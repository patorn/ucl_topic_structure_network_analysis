  "body": "In the time it takes you to read this sentence, nearly 10,000 lbs of fish will be stolen from the world\u2019s oceans. Illegal fishing, which accounts for up to 26m tons of seafood annually, robs legitimate fishers and governments of revenue, undermines the accuracy of fisheries\u2019 stock assessments and threatens the stability of coastal communities that rely on the legal trade.   Related: Off the hook: can a new study in the Pacific reel in unsustainable fishing?    Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing occurs in all the world\u2019s oceans and takes many forms, from operating without a license and falsifying documents to using banned gear, exceeding quotas and fishing in marine protected areas. These activities are especially prevalent in areas such as West Africa, Southeast Asia, South America and Antarctica, where local authorities lack the resources to sufficiently patrol marine territories. Illegal activities account for up to one in five wild-caught fish taken from oceans \u2013 worth up to $23.5bn in stolen seafood each year. But what if illegally caught fish couldn\u2019t be moved to market and sold, thereby eliminating any financial motive to continue the practice? On 16 May 2016, six countries \u2013 Dominica, Guinea-Bissau, Sudan, Thailand, Tonga and Vanuatu \u2013 ratified the Port State Measures Agreement (PSMA), a United Nations treaty designed to stop illegal fishing by strengthening inspection protocols for foreign-flagged fishing vessels coming into their ports. Governments that have ratified the PSMA must enact legislation specifying how they will enforce the agreement, including procedures on what to do with an illegal cargo, the crew and the vessel. With the recent additions, 30 governments have now ratified the PSMA, five more than are needed to bring the treaty into effect. Now, suspected illegal fishers calling on ports in 29 countries, plus those inside the European Union, face a higher risk of being turned away or having their catch and vessels seized. This is a major step forward. Almost all fish caught in the ocean must come through a port on their way to market. Trying to find and confront illegal operators on the water is dangerous, expensive work. By comparison, at-port policing, when done correctly, is efficient, cost effective and safe. Under the PSMA, captains of foreign-flagged vessels must provide advance notice when approaching a port. If officials have any reason to suspect illegal activity \u2013 due to, for example, a vessel\u2019s history, licensing discrepancies or intelligence from authorities of a neighboring country \u2013 they can order an inspection of the boat\u2019s documentation and catch. The results of that check will determine whether the ship is refused entry, held for further inspection, seized or cleared to offload its cargo. The pact also empowers port officials to deny services, such as refueling, to operators found to have broken the law.   Related: A sustainable fishing experiment in the Pacific \u2013 in pictures    If a vessel under suspicion is turned away, officials must notify nearby ports, in their own and neighboring countries, that it may be carrying illegal fish. This way, it is more likely that, even if a suspected crew is allowed to leave with its catch, it will be forced to spend large amounts of time (and money) searching for another port to unload fish and obtain the refueling, food provisioning and other services that are necessary to continue fishing. The PSMA also helps consumers ensure that they are buying legally caught seafood. The agreement gives processors and retailers another way to track their supplies and buy fish that comes through a port covered by the treaty. While the PSMA presents a great strategy to stop illegal fishing, it\u2019s not the only way. Countries with rich fishing grounds are banding together to identify common challenges and share enforcement and other resources. One example is the Central America Fisheries and Aquaculture Organization, whose members include Beliz, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Honduras. In southeast Africa, an eight-country coalition called FISH-i Africa \u2013 which includes Kenya, Mauritius, Seychelles, Somalia and Tanzania \u2013 also coordinates its members\u2019 enforcement efforts. It has prevented a boat operator, Premier, owned by Dongwon Industries in South Korea, from profiting off its illicit catch and chased others out of the western Indian Ocean. The PSMA will become an even more powerful tool if it gains support from additional nations. Countries that have signed on but are yet to ratify include Russia, Indonesia, Canada, Brazil, Peru, Kenya, Ghana, Sierra Leone and Turkey. We must work on expanding the treaty\u2019s reach, ensure that it is effectively enforced and make the cost of illegal fishing so prohibitive that it\u2019s no longer worth the effort.",
