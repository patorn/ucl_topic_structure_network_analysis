  "body": "My father left my mother when I was five and cheated on her with a 19-year-old Finnish girl he\u2019d met online. I don\u2019t know how long they\u2019d been sleeping with each other before my mother found out, but clearly my father valued their relationship over his family\u2019s.  My memory of all this is blurry, but his return in a few months is clear as anything. I was the first to see his car come up the drive. The first, and last, to shout with joy, \u201cHe\u2019s back!\u201d   Related: Facing my fear: I was terrified of nursing homes, but I had to put my mom in one | Shannon Malone    My mother stepped onto the porch as if entering a battlefield. My father got out of the car, followed by his golden-haired girlfriend. She stood silently, petulantly smoking several cigarettes as my parents screamed at each other. The problem was my father and his waif had run out of money. And so, his mind as brilliantly thoughtless as ever, he decided to return home, mistress in tow. Maybe some small part of her was glad to see him back, a failure even in adultery. She told me later that since they co-owned the house, she couldn\u2019t force him to leave. I\u2019m not sure she\u2019s right about that, but whatever the reason, they camped in our backyard for six months.  My grandmother moved in to support my mother, who got thinner by the hour.  I knew something was off about all this \u2013 that this wasn\u2019t how most of my friends\u2019 parents acted \u2013 but I didn\u2019t care. My father was home. He\u2019d never paid me much attention before, and he still didn\u2019t now, but it was better than the stark nothing I\u2019d experienced in his absence. Every time he looked at me, I felt more solid, more important, until he\u2019d look away and, once again, I\u2019d dissolve. When he disappeared again, presumably after gathering his jobless welfare payment into a small pile of cash, a piece of me dissolved forever.  I became, from that moment, a covetous and clingy child, afraid that things, and people, would be taken from me as quickly as they\u2019d appeared should I be so foolish as to turn my head. Something as simple a friend at school sitting with other people would send me to tears or tantrums. When I was 10 years old, my father partially reappeared again, calling sporadically, though I was the only one in the house who\u2019d speak to him.  Things went on like that for two years until, early one morning, police showed up at our door. They woke us all at 4am with their knocking \u2013 you\u2019d think they could\u2019ve waited until daylight \u2013 then quietly informed my mother that my father had taken his own life three days prior. He\u2019d been living in Finland with his new wife, but they\u2019d separated. Now I was faced with his final departure.    My father and his waif had run out of money. And so he decided to return home, mistress in tow    That cliche of daddy issues that people love to joke about fits me like a glove, to say the least. I turned from a clingy child, afraid to let loved ones out of my grasp, to a sullen, distant teen unable to trust anyone. Even my mother once called me an acidic bitch. According to several doctors, I was suffering from a combination of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. Girl, Interrupted. I finally pulled it together in my last two years at an alternative education program. My relationship with my family got better, I made friends with a group of girls who I\u2019m still close with, got into a good university and became, as my mother likes to put it, somewhat well-adjusted. I ended up taking a gap year at the end of my first year of university, deciding a degree in international relations wasn\u2019t for me but North Africa was. I\u2019d been back home in Melbourne less than a year when I met Hudson at a music festival. He was standing in front of a Ferris wheel on top of a natural amphitheater looking lost. We spent the whole weekend together. On the first night we were shy, and the only time he touched me was to hold my hand as he led me in and out of the crowd. But by the time the second night arrived I felt as if I\u2019d known him for years as we danced and moved between our friends like we\u2019d always been together. Still, I didn\u2019t want a relationship. He didn\u2019t either. He\u2019d broken up with his girlfriend of six years only nine months prior. We were both very young and were both still very self-involved (still are). But we spent far too much time together for a non-couple. He\u2019d told me early on he was planning to go to Europe indefinitely later in the year. I decided this was perfect: our time was fleeting and, because I had prior knowledge of the fact, it wouldn\u2019t hurt when he left. Yet the more time we spent together, the more I felt the need to break it off. He was charming and sweet, constantly cracking jokes that only we understood and giving me small compliments on more than just my appearance. Our preferences synched, and he made me realize that I wanted to be a writer, and convinced me that I could do it.  One evening he drove me home after a comfortable day of doing nothing together in his backyard. The sun had fallen low on the horizon, and a perfect breeze filtered in from the only window that still rolled down in his old station wagon. He was talking about booking flights for his upcoming trip when a very familiar fear clenched my stomach. He was leaving. And I couldn\u2019t pretend not to care, because I was falling in love with him.  It wasn\u2019t until he\u2019d gone that I started to cry. A dam burst inside me and it was all I could do not to disappear \u2013 to run away from an intense situation, just like my father always did. I didn\u2019t want to be like that though, undermining love like he did. So with Hudson\u2019s encouragement, I stuck around by leaving with him for Europe, at least for a time. And while we were there, I gathered the courage to fight against every instinct I had and told him how I felt. My chest was tight and I had to choke the words out, but he was worth the risk. I told him I loved him in a hostel in Malaga, even knowing he wasn\u2019t ready to say it back. On New Years Eve he did, though, outside of a tiny bar in Berlin. Delight and amusement bubbled up inside my chest, filling my throat until I burst out laughing. I pointed out that Wonderwall by Oasis, was playing in the background. He still hasn\u2019t lived it down.  Two years later, I sometimes have moments where I\u2019m still afraid he\u2019ll leave me, and I think of leaving first. But I choose to trust instead \u2013 it is a choice. Tennyson had a point; I\u2019d rather love and lose then never love at all.    Open contributions: When have you faced your fear?",
