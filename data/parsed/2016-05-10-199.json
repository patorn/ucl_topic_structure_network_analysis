A Danish team looked at the results of seven trials of the products \u2013 often sold as milk-based drinks, biscuits, sachets, or capsules \u2013 and found no evidence they changed the composition of faecal bacteria in healthy adults. Online blogs and magazines have helped spur a trend for lacto-fermentation of foodstuffs by touting a range of purported health benefits, such as improved digestion and resistance to infections.  Oluf Pedersen, who led the research at the University of Copenhagen, said: \u201cWhile there is some evidence from previous reviews that probiotic interventions may benefit those with disease-associated imbalances of the gut microbiota, there is little evidence of an effect in healthy individuals.\u201d In-depth clinical trials would be needed to explore whether probiotics can help people avoid getting sick, he added.  Probiotics are live microbial food ingredients \u2013 sometimes labelled \u201cfriendly bacteria\u201d \u2013 that are said to provide the consumer with numerous health benefits by improving the intestinal microbial balance. They are often made by introducing live bacterial cultures to everyday foodstuffs, which metabolise sugars as they multiply and leave them with a sour, fresh flavour. Aside from branded products specifically marketed as probiotic supplements, such foods include plain yoghurt, sauerkraut, miso and kefir.     Japanese miso soup.

Previous research has suggested that in some cases, such as where diarrhoea has arisen from antibiotic use, probiotics can have a therapeutic effect.  But when Pedersen and his team reviewed seven randomised controlled studies that investigated whether a daily probiotic supplement had any effect on the microbial composition of healthy adults\u2019 faeces, only one showed significant changes.

The Copenhagen team noted that the real impact of the probiotics may have been masked by small sample sizes and the use of different strains of bacteria and variations in participants\u2019 diets, among other factors. Pedersen said: \u201cTo explore the potential of probiotics to contribute to disease prevention in healthy people there is a major need for much larger, carefully designed and carefully conducted clinical trials.  \u201cThese should include ideal composition and dosage of known and newly developed probiotics combined with specified dietary advice, optimal trial duration and relevant monitoring of host health status.\u201d Their findings are published in the online journal Genome Medicine.",
