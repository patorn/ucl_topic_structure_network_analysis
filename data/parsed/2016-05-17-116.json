At least that was the choice of one couple on Sunday night, who turned up to WetYourSelf!, Fabric\u2019s weekly house and techno night, at 10pm and stayed dancing and drinking cups of tea until 5am the following morning.    Related: Skream, DJ Premier and Maya Jane Coles to headline MoMA PS1 Warm Up    The couple \u2013 whose names no one apparently managed to catch \u2013 caused a stir among the night\u2019s regular clientele, according to the promoter and resident DJ Jacob Hansen, 35, who is known as DJ Jacob Husley and has run the event at the Farringdon nightclub for the past 10 years. \u201cThey got a lot of attention from people in the club, who all really embraced them,\u201d said Husley, who is originally from Denmark. \u201cThere was lots of smiles, the girls were dancing with the guy as well \u2013 the gentleman I should probably say.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s an important story because that\u2019s what clubbing should be about. It should be about music and the coming together between all phases of life, religion or sexuality.\u201d  Husley said he first noticed the couple just after the doors opened, as they ambled down the long flights of stairs to the basement venue. \u201cI stopped and said, \u2018are you OK?\u2019 And they just smile at me and nod and continue down. I\u2019m thinking maybe they\u2019re relatives of the owners or someone else so I run up and ask security on the door and they said \u2018no, they had tickets so of course we let them in\u2019.\u201d Husley gave each of them a drink ticket \u2013 which they swapped for tequila \u2013 then ran off to find a Polish speaker. In the meantime, the couple joined the other revellers. \u201cThey go on the dancefloor and are kind of doing this kind of ballroom-type dancing, but very slow because she can only really stand up when she\u2019s holding on to him. She would also sit down and he\u2019d go off by himself.\u201d As the club got busier, Husley said he arranged for them to have a cup of tea \u2013 at a table in the VIP area, which he opened specifically for their benefit.  \u201cWe don\u2019t actually open the VIP balcony on Sundays, but the lighting guy is up there so I just took them round the back and gave them a table right at the end where you can see down to the dancefloor,\u201d Husley said. \u201cI gave them another round of tea and they were standing up there dancing. Then I left and I came back 20 minutes later and they were gone \u2013 they had just gone back downstairs again.\u201d Speaking to the couple with the help of an interpreter, Husley found out they had come to London to visit their daughter and had decided to experience the city\u2019s nightlife during their stay. \u201cI asked them who came up with this idea and the guy was pointing at her, going like \u2018she did it!\u2019\u201d Husley said. \u201cThey were laughing; they had loads of banter between them, they were really lovely. They read a review of Fabric in a Polish newspaper and they just decided \u2018when we go to London we are going to go there on the Sunday night\u2019. And they bought the tickets [online] in Poland.\u201d Now Husley is trying to find out the names of the couple. He believes he has tracked down the email address they used to buy the tickets, and he has the address they returned to when he called them a cab. But he is also mindful that they may not want to be outed any more than they already have been. \u201cWe want to keep their privacy until we find out whether they want to be public about it, because it\u2019s also their right to just come and enjoy the club and be anonymous if they want,\u201d he said. \u201cThat picture is out but we will just have to wait and see if they want to be in the press or not.\u201d",
