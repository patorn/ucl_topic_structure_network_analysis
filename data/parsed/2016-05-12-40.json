  "body": "\u2022 The journalist and author Sally Brampton, who died this week, went to Ashford school, not Ashdown as we had it in a feature (\u2018She was never a follower\u2019, 12 May, page 10, G2). The article also said Brampton\u2019s daughter was 23 and an academic; she is now 24 and working in publishing. Finally, Nilgin Yusuf joined Elle in 1988, not 1998 as we had it. \u2022 Because of an editing error, a feature about the comedian Diane Morgan (Move over, Simon Schama, 11 May, page\u00a018, G2) referred to \u201ccasting agents\u201d,\u00a0a conflation of the roles of agent and casting director. As our style guide states: \u201ccasting director \u2026 sometimes mistakenly referred to as a \u2018casting agent\u2019\u201d. \u2022 Another editing error meant that the words in a pullquote on the letters page (12 May, page 34) were misattributed. As\u00a0was clear in the body text, it was Paul\u00a0Godier\u2019s letter that said \u201cIf Tony Hall\u2019s article is the best he can do to defend the BBC against the Tory onslaught, the beloved institution is doomed\u201d, not Hugh Sheppard\u2019s, which preceded Godier\u2019s.",
