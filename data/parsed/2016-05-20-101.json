Comments 171 entries for what was clearly a pretty tough PD (aren\u2019t they all?), with a strong showing from the overseas contingent. If it\u2019s any consolation, devising the clues takes at least twice as long as those for other types. I don\u2019t know, for example, what I\u2019d have done with TEOSINTE if I\u2019d not found BUTEO (any ideas?). Pleasingly for me, no fewer than 23 clues were chosen as favourites by one or more, the winner being \u2018Her gold hoard gave her such a thrill I often saw her chuck l/ots\u2019 (INGATHERING) some way ahead of \u2018For any, gra/tis, an end- product\u2019 (INTRADERMAL). Weakest clue, I concede, was the one for NACELLE, which, though sound enough, might have benefited for a bit more polishing. That\u2019s the way it is with PDs. This particular special doesn\u2019t appeal to everyone, but it has many fans and will remain in the repertoire, though probably only once every two years or so. (RJH tells me that there have been 51 PDs, by Ximenes and myself, demonstrating some sort of enduring appeal.) In this one 15 entries had SANDAL for SENDAL. It was perhaps a bit sneaky of me to opt for the latter, and I almost included a note warning solvers of the possible wrong answer but decided against this as SANDAL really made no sense in the undevilled version. One regular commented that he finds the instruction about where the target word in a PD clue should appear in the undevilled version a little hard to understand, and offered alternative wording. It isn\u2019t easy to express this \u2018rule\u2019 both succinctly and clearly. The wording I use is based on that of Ximenes with a bit of subsequent tweaking. If he\u2019ll forgive my saying so, I wasn\u2019t entirely convinced that the suggested improvement was much clearer, but I\u2019m grateful for his taking the trouble to try and I\u2019ll keep his suggestion in mind when PD comes up again. In point of fact only one entry this time broke the \u2018rule\u2019 by ending AVESTA at a natural word break in the clue. (It isn\u2019t a rule at all, of course, merely a preference, but a sensible one, as I think most would agree.)One tip I\u2019ve found helpful when writing PD clues is to make sure that the finished article is a complete sentence (i.e. containing a main verb), not a phrase. And, of course, as I\u2019ve said many times, the sense of the undevilled version should not be sacrificed in the interests of the devilled version. Finally, I was reminded by a regular with an astonishing memory that I myself clued AVESTA in an earlier PD competition puzzle, No. 1,888, which must have been nearly eight years ago. I didn\u2019t look to see how I\u2019d dealt with it until after I\u2019d finished judging this month\u2019s entries. Here it is: \u2018Young rebels often hid parents they want to escape\u2019.
