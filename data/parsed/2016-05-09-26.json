  "body": "Slaven Bilic played the game reluctantly. West Ham United will bid an emotional farewell to their cherished old ground when they host Manchester United under the lights on Tuesday night but Bilic, still smarting from the shambolic 4-1 defeat by Swansea City on Saturday, was going through the motions when he was asked to recall his favourite Upton Park memories.   Related: Olympic Stadium deal benefits taxpayer, claims West Ham\u2019s David Gold    On a day when David Gold, Sir Trevor Brooking, Tony Carr and Mark Noble lined up to reminisce about 112 years of East End history coming to an end, it was telling Bilic wanted to keep his business face on. \u201cWe have a game tomorrow and I am very much concentrated on that,\u201d he said, giving the impression he will enjoy the post-match celebrations \u2013 which will apparently feature \u201cspectacular lighting, music and a big-screen video to match the scale and emotion of the evening\u201d \u2013 only if West Ham have avenged the FA Cup defeat by United last month in the preceding 90 minutes. West Ham\u2019s manager echoed Noble by speaking fondly about the roar in those last few seconds before kick-off, when the music stops and the crowd belt out the first of many renditions of I\u2019m Forever Blowing Bubbles, and he has not forgotten his first game at Upton Park, a 2-0 win over Kevin Keegan\u2019s swashbuckling Newcastle United in 1996. \u201cThey had that gap at the top ahead of Manchester United,\u201d he said. \u201cI will always remember it. So it is a special stadium.\u201d           Farewell Boleyn: the end of an era for West Ham United    But the challenge for Bilic\u2019s team is to play the match rather than the occasion. West Ham froze when they lost 2-1 against United in their FA Cup quarter-final replay and their defeat by Swansea all but ended their hopes of qualifying for the Champions League. More realistically they are fighting for a Europa League spot, with Southampton jumping above them into sixth place after their win against Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday and Liverpool a point behind West Ham in eighth place. \u201cIf I am really honest, I thought the atmosphere was a little bit strange, but only because we have this game,\u201d Noble, the captain, said. \u201cSwansea, from the start of the season, was always billed as the last ever at the Boleyn and then things change. All of a sudden we are playing Manchester United and, no disrespect to Swansea City, that becomes a bit of a glamour fixture. With us being really close in the league together it adds that extra incentive. The fans are really looking forward to tomorrow night, instead of Saturday. Swansea played better than us.\u201d West Ham are six points below fourth-placed Manchester City with two games left and they will go two points ahead of Southampton if they win their game in hand against United. Opponents have been targeting Michail Antonio since injuries forced him to move to right-back two months ago and Bilic has persisted with playing one of his most effective attackers in a makeshift role despite Sam Byram and James Tomkins returning to fitness. Swansea capitalised on that glaring weakness. West Ham have conceded 10 goals in their past five matches at Upton Park and United will go fourth if they triumph in east London again.   Related: Louis van Gaal says he will not take a risk with Anthony Martial at West Ham    Bilic attributed the defeat against United to overconfidence. \u201cWe knew straight after the defeat why it had happened,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can lose against United and still have a great game just because it is United, but we learned. Simply we approached that game in a way that was very hard to stop \u2013 in a too optimistic way. At that time the whole set-up before that game \u2013 and I\u2019m saying it again, it was very hard to stop it \u2013 was \u2018we are going to beat you\u2019 and we started to attack them on very big space individually. \u201cAnd if Man U are good at anything it is stretching you and keeping the ball, and then you have to be compact against them, otherwise they are going to have a lot of space and they have a lot of pace up front and quality,\u201d he added. \u201cThat gives them more than enough opportunities to hurt you and they did exactly that.\u201d Perhaps it will suit West Ham to be underdogs in a fixture that has often provided entertainment. The mind goes back to Alex Ferguson accusing an already-relegated West Ham of an obscene effort when they denied him a first league title in England in 1992, Ludo Miklosko winning his personal duel with Andy Cole on behalf of Blackburn Rovers in 1995 and David Beckham scoring a stunning lob when United won 5-3 in 2002. With a wave of nostalgia about to hit them, West Ham will be desperate to see the place off in style by raising their game for one last time.",
