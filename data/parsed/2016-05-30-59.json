Folding bicycle maker Brompton will be hoping to avoid the same accusation from its legions of suited and booted commuter devotees when it too \u201cgoes electric\u201d. From next year, the business plans to start producing fold-up electric bicycles aimed at people who find pedalling too much like hard work.   Related: Brompton Bicycles \u2013 the unfolding saga of a two-wheeled success story    The new bikes employ pedelec technology, which stores energy from pedalling and releases it when the rider reaches a hill. The Brompton system has been developed in partnership with Formula One team Williams and is a slimmed down version of the Kers (kinetic energy recovery system) technology that racing cars use to gain extra speed. \u201cThe guy on his \u00a32,500 carbon-frame road bike will wonder why you\u2019re cruising past him in a suit,\u201d said Will Butler-Adams, the chief executive of Brompton. The move into electric bicycles is part of an ambitious global expansion plan orchestrated from a gleaming new factory in the west London suburb of Greenford. At 84,000 sq ft, the floorspace of the site is bigger than the pitch at Wembley Stadium and four times the size of Brompton\u2019s previous home. The move cost the company about \u00a32m, a sum equal to its pre-tax profit in 2015, achieved on turnover of \u00a327.5m. While the factory itself is shiny, new and packed with new technology, the work that goes on here hinges on some old-fashioned craftsmanship.     Brazing in the Brompton factory.

He is responsible for passing on the decades-old craft, which is similar to welding, to new trainees. All 250 staff, from the engineers to the receptionists, have to try their hand at brazing when they start work at the business. . For new recruits the stakes are high \u2013 all have their initials stamped on individual bike components for the sake of quality control. But the money isn\u2019t bad either. A new brazer can expect a starting salary north of \u00a330,000, partly because it isn\u2019t easy to find people suited to such a job. \u201cNot many people know about brazing, which was a problem for Brompton,\u201d said El Saidi, who demonstrates the steady hand, patience and eye for detail required for a top brazer. \u201cTechnology has taken over engineering and welding jobs so there\u2019s not much training. In the 1970s when I started, there were full classes of people learning to weld. It was big money. But if I lost my job here, there\u2019s not a job elsewhere. The world has changed a lot.\u201d If El Saidi\u2019s story of industrial decline sounds like a familiar tale of Britain\u2019s diminishing place in global manufacturing, Brompton is at least bucking the trend. About 80% of its bikes are exported to 44 markets. Two of the largest markets are Germany and South Korea, often held up as shining examples of export-led economies. The working practices at Brompton feel like a cosy reminder of days long past, with the production line staffed by people rather than robots.  Do any of them own a Brompton, given that the machines start at a cool \u00a3785? \u201cNah, I\u2019ve got a Ferrari,\u201d joked one of Brompton\u2019s bike makers, as he screwed in a crucial component. Every member of the production line staff is responsible for a different part of the bike and between them they can assemble one in about three and a half minutes. Their target for the year is 47,500 and the company is soon to add a second production line in the belief it can roll out 100,000 bikes a year by 2022. To do so, it will need to use all of the tools at its disposal. Although the bicycles help people to save on public transport, they could not be described as cheap, and at 9.5kg are technically portable but not for a long period of time.     The business aims to produce 47,500 bikes a year, but is upping its target to 100,000 by 2022. Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi for the Guardian    \u201cYou have to have ambition,\u201d said Butler-Adams. \u201cThere are more than a billion people in China. Not all of them are going to ride a Brompton but there\u2019s an opportunity there. \u201cMost people in the world have never seen one [a Brompton] but globally there is net migration to cities and they\u2019ve got the same challenges with space and lack of exercise.\u201d While China represents an opportunity, it will not be easy to break into the market. Working-class Chinese cannot afford one of the costly machines, while many among the burgeoning middle classes see cycling to work as beneath them. But since founder Andrew Ritchie first developed a folding bike in 1975 \u2013 naming it after the Brompton Oratory church across the road from his flat \u2013 the company has defied its critics. It has also developed a cult following, as evidenced by fan groups such as the London Brompton Club page on Facebook, which has 2,800 members. There are even competitions for who can fold one up the quickest - the record is 5.6 seconds. \u201cThere are Brompton owners who are tall, small, old, young. We don\u2019t give a stuff,\u201d said Butler-Adams. \u201cThe flipping thing works. If it works in London, it can work all over the world.\u201d",
