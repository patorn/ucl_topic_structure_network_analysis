Among them was Robert Smithson, who created Spiral Jetty, a massive sculpture in Utah\u2019s Great Salt Lake, fashioned out of crystals and rock.         Watch the trailer for Troublemakers    The ambition and daring of these artists is something to ponder, and unlike the more well-known players of today\u2019s contemporary art market, what they were making wasn\u2019t money. Not much, anyway. As well as material scale, they were aiming at a vast reach of time, something that would physically last hundreds of years, something so elemental that it might transcend its physical shape and become just a concept. Well, you might argue that there is a kind of hubris in all this, and its very giganticism condemned it to marginal status and a kind of cultural smallness. But what excitement there is in these folies de grandeur.",
