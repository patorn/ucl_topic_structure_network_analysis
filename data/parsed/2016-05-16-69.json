Through a cacophonous sea of blue and white on either side, the bus carrying Leicester City\u2019s triumphant Premier League champions slowly snaked its way through the streets of the city in a victory parade like no other in British footballing history.   Related: The season of the fearless Foxes, Leicester City \u2013 in pictures    Glorious early evening sunshine shone down on the bus as it set off from the city\u2019s Jubilee Square shortly after 6pm carrying the manager, Claudio Ranieri, and his team of misfits, journeymen and cast-offs. At times it seemed that every one of the city\u2019s 330,000 inhabitants \u2013 as well as thousands from the towns and communities around it \u2013 had turned out to celebrate the achievements of a club that had not only won the first top-flight title in its 132-year history but finished a full 10 points clear of the chasing pack.

The team bus was followed by two others, one of them carrying a large contingent waving the national flag of the club\u2019s Thai owner, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha. The team\u2019s international following was strongly in evidence along the route, too, with Japanese fans holding banners with messages for the forward Shinji Okazaki. Eventually the convoy arrived in Victoria Gardens, where perhaps every second reveller was wearing a Leicester shirt and many had stories to tell, such as the three Italian geology students making a pilgrimage to London in honour of Ranieri. \u201cHe has done something so incredible, so fantastic, that people in Italy just can\u2019t believe it. It\u2019s like he is a different person to the one who used to manage teams there,\u201d said Nicola Benedetti, 21, clutching his national flag and, like his two friends form Perugia, decked out in Leicester City shirts and scarves.

Along with her partner, Darren Massey, and two-and-a-half-year-old son, Alfred, they had journeyed into the city from Coalville, a town close to the border with Nottinghamshire. \u201cThere\u2019s been a particularly strong following for the team in our town, partly because we\u2019ve almost got Derby and Nottingham on our doorsteps. They\u2019ve had their time and now some of their fans are even coming across,\u201d said Darren.     An aerial view of the crowd during the celebrations.

People have been talking about the diversity of this city, but it\u2019s really true that this has brought us even closer together,\u201d said Ish.

The season has been incredible, with people discovering that their neighbours were just as passionate about the team as they were.\u201d Standing nearby, students Saima Bodiat and Hajera Mubarak were in agreement about how the season had brought one of Britain\u2019s most ethnically diverse communities even closer together. \u201cPeople have felt part of this right throughout the season,\u201d said Bodiat, 19, a student from Regent College who had come out with four other friends all wearing blue headscarves.",
