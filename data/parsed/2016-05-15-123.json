  "body": "Freedom, as the far left used to say, is the right to choose your jail. School, job, family, marriage: no cage is distraction enough for Gabrielle (Marion Cotillard), who \u2013 with a dreamer\u2019s conviction \u2013 will do anything to escape the box being built for her.   Related: American Honey review: Andrea Arnold mislays map on sweet, indelible roadtrip    From the Land of the Moon is a choc-cake rich drama that oozes along on the strength of a committed performance from Cotillard and the odd sprinkle of visual flair. It presents a kind of no-frills silliness, almost tricking you into believing its balderdash. It\u2019s based on Italian author Milena Agus\u2019s 2006 novella, which has been relocated by director Nicole Garcia to 1940s Provence, the French coastal town of La Ciotat, the Swiss alps and Lyon, sometime later in what looks to be the mid-60s. The story is told in flashback from this point. Gabrielle and her husband, Jos\u00e9 (Alex Brendem\u00fchl) are taking their son to a regional music competition, where \u2013 in respect to mama\u2019s gloomy sensibilities - he\u2019ll mournfully trot out some Tchaikovsky. The mood in the car is peculiar. Mum\u2019s distant, dad and son clearly more connected. They roll into Lyon in a funk. Then Gabrielle spots an address that stirs a violent memory. And from there, we\u2019re off. Sort of. For a fairly simple plot the story rolls out awfully slow. It emerges that Gabrielle, the daughter of a successful lavender farmer, was always the wild child. Stultified by country life, she has channeled her frustrations into a crush on her teacher, partly fuelled by his on-point literary recommendations (Wuthering Heights is, according to teach, \u201cAbout a girl who never leaves the countryside\u201d). The flirtation ends, disastrously, at a family meal to celebrate the harvest. Luckily, there is someone there to pick up the pieces: Jos\u00e9. A Spaniard who fought against Franco and now works for the family, he\u2019s picked as a solid candidate for a marriage of convenience. The family hand over responsibility for Gabrielle, she gets to leave the lavender and he can marry money. \u201cWhy choose to be unhappy?\u201d, Gabrielle asks Jos\u00e9 as they wrangle with the idea. Jos\u00e9, played delicately by Brendem\u00fchl, gives the impression he has seen several lifetimes of unhappiness already. A little more will hurt, but manageably. The couple move to the coast, where dependable Jos\u00e9 begins to build a house. Gabrielle is still afflicted, now with paralysing cramps that may or may not be real. She\u2019s sent, on doctor\u2019s orders, to a spa in the Swiss mountains. There \u2013 finally \u2013 she meets someone who might help her escape herself: a floppy-haired hottie called Andr\u00e9 Sauvage (Louis Garrel). A veteran of the war in Indochina, he\u2019s picked up a kidney infection that manifests itself in bouts of exhausted sighing. His treatment is gob-fulls of opium and the odd manly grunt to help through the pain. All this Byron-esque suffering is, unsurprisingly, right up Gabrielle\u2019s street. A lot has been made of female sexuality coming to the fore at this year\u2019s Cannes. From the Land of the Moon continues the trend to a degree. It\u2019s implied that much of Gabrielle\u2019s pain is rooted in sexual frustration. There\u2019s a lot made of what Gabrielle calls \u201cthe principal thing\u201d. This, in Agus\u2019s novella, is love. But Garcia suggests sexual fulfilment is strong in the mix here too. In an early scene Gabrielle stands, dress hiked up and lets a river wash over her. It\u2019s the pursuit of orgasm as escape. Getting off to get out. Elsewhere the expression of inner turmoil is a lot less interesting. There is loads of Gabrielle running away desperately - into the woods, the sea, a ditch. Cotillard\u2019s ability to tear up in an instant is used to the point of exploitation. Gabrielle is, on many occasions, simply too nasty to care about. \u201cEvery time you visit it rains,\u201d she tells Jos\u00e9. \u201cPeople are right: you\u2019re mean,\u201d he says later. He sticks around, still. The film takes on Gabrielle\u2019s listlessness, slumps into an opiated fug. The malady is mysterious and not easily treatable. It just exhausts you. It transforms from a story about release to just another jail. At times it felt like there was no escape.",
