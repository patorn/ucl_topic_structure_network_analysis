  "body": "On a Bafta night that promises no shortage of rivalry between Ben Whishaw and Idris Elba, and Claire Foy and Suranne Jones, a bigger battle is being played out over the future of the BBC and Channel 4. The annual TV awards ceremony on Sunday at Royal Festival Hall in London comes at the end of a week of intrigue and attacks over the government\u2019s plans for the BBC, from cuts to its \u00a35bn income to where it should schedule Strictly Come Dancing. The occasionally fierce exchanges are likely to be reflected in some of the winners\u2019 speeches on Sunday night, days before the government publishes its white paper on the corporation\u2019s future. High-profile nominees have already spoken out in defence of the BBC. Oscar-winning actor Mark Rylance said no other company in the world could have made BBC2\u2019s Wolf Hall, which leads the Bafta pack with four nominations. Its director, Peter Kosminsky, labelled the government\u2019s plans for the BBC as \u201cterrifying\u201d. Sir David Attenborough, whose BBC1 series The Hunt is nominated, warned the government against playing \u201cfast and loose\u201d with the BBC. Another of the BBC\u2019s biggest names, Gary Lineker, in the running with Match of the Day\u2019s live FA Cup final coverage, called the culture secretary, John Whittingdale, a \u201cchump\u201d after he joked that the BBC\u2019s demise was a \u201ctempting prospect\u201d. Whittingdale is not thought to be attending the awards. The former Blackadder and Not The Nine O\u2019Clock News producer John Lloyd, whose BBC2 panel show QI has been nominated, as has its presenter, Stephen Fry, said: \u201cIf there was an election between the BBC and any government you care to name, the BBC would win hands down. This is the sort of thing we should be having a referendum about.  \u201cI really hope the government isn\u2019t going to do something which makes the BBC impossible to operate effectively. Not having a strong and creative BBC would be a terrible thing \u2013 like the Royal Navy or the National Trust, it\u2019s a core part of who we are,\u201d he told the Guardian. Lloyd, currently filming the new series of QI with Sandi Toksvig following Fry\u2019s departure after 13 years, added: \u201cEveryone must agree that an independent BBC is a good thing. No one can get everything right all of the time but broadly it is trusted. It is there to be awkward and to ask questions of those in power.\u201d The government has come under fire over its plans for the BBC and its proposals to privatise Channel 4, which the culture secretary said would be better off in private hands. The two issues dominated another TV awards ceremony, the Broadcasting Press Guild awards in March. Along with four nominations for Wolf Hall, including a leading actor nod for Rylance, there are three nominations each for Peter Kay\u2019s BBC1 comedy Car Share and Channel 4 drama This is England \u201890.   Related: Bafta TV awards 2016: full list of nominations    Rylance will compete with Luther\u2019s Idris Elba and London Spy\u2019s Ben Whishaw for best male actor, while Wolf Hall\u2019s Claire Foy will go head to head with Suranne Jones, star of BBC1\u2019s Doctor Foster, for leading actress.     Sir David Attenborough, whose BBC1 series The Hunt is nominated for a Bafta, last week warned the government against playing \u2018fast and loose\u2019 with BBC funding. Photograph: Colossus Productions/AP    All four BBC programmes were name-checked by director general Tony Hall \u2013 writing in the Guardian, he urged the government to protect the scale and scope of the BBC and not let the interests of commercial rivals \u201cdetermine\u201d the contents of the white paper.  \u201cThe BBC should be tasked to deliver, not everything to everybody, but something great to everybody,\u201d he wrote, adding, \u201cOf course Sunday\u2019s Baftas matter to the BBC, but I want to make sure that we are winning Baftas in five years\u2019 time.\u201d After the racial discrimination row that overshadowed this year\u2019s Oscars, non-white talent is recognised in most of Bafta\u2019s performing categories, from Elba and Cucumber\u2019s Cyril Nri to newer performers such as Michaela Coel, of Channel 4\u2019s Chewing Gum, and BBC2\u2019s Javone Prince. Ruth Madeley, star of BBC3 drama Don\u2019t Take My Baby, is understood to be the first wheelchair user to be nominated for a Bafta TV award in what was also her first leading role. \u201cI was very lucky to have got the role \u2013 it was a very sad story that needed to be told \u2013 and this just feels incredibly surreal,\u201d said Madeley.  \u201cThe TV and film industry has come so far since I was a child, it has come on leaps and bounds not just in terms of disability but other types of diversity.\u201d Madeley has said that when she was growing up there were no disabled actors on TV, but now she may be a role model for future generations. \u201cI was inspired by wonderful friends and family but if I can play a tiny part in someone else\u2019s life in some respect, then I will quite happily take that,\u201d she added. Actor and comedian Lenny Henry, who has led a campaign for more diversity on TV, will receive the Bafta special award, with a fellowship for Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, the writers of Hancock\u2019s Half Hour and creators of Steptoe and Son. The ceremony, presented by Graham Norton, will be broadcast on BBC1. Bafta chair Anne Morrison said: \u201cI must say I am really glad it is the most diverse list of nominations we can remember but one must never be complacent, there is a lot of work still to be done.\u201d On the looming new challenges facing both the BBC and Channel 4, she said: \u201cWe are the envy of the world in many ways and there is something about the particular broadcasting ecology in Britain that seems to be serving us well. \u201cClearly there are always changes and this is a very fast changing industry, but we need to make sure that whatever changes we make underpin the quality and excellence that we will reward on Sunday night.\u201d",
