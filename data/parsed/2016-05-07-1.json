Parliament is supposed to be a workplace like anywhere else, but when you see them on the news, they\u2019re all just screaming at each other.\u201d Mead lives in the La Trobe electorate, 50km from Melbourne. Liberal MP Jason Wood held the seat in the last federal parliament and Labor needs a swing of four percentage points to take it at the election on 2 July \u2013 the same swing it needs across the country to win a majority. In other words, if Labor can\u2019t take places like La Trobe, it can\u2019t win.

If you can win La Trobe, you could possibly win government.\u201d Although there is plenty of disillusionment about politics, Mead\u2019s attitude is fairly typical of the electorate, which suggests it is not translating into votes for Labor either. A 64-year-old man from Belgrave, who did not want to be named, said: \u201cI\u2019m voting blank this year.\u201d However, he also said he was weary of Labor\u2019s reforms to negative gearing. \u201cI\u2019ve worked my guts out my whole life, and I\u2019m worn out,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I have a second home, I deserve that. Meanwhile parliamentary pensions are too high, yet when people like myself approach retirement age, we are not looked after or treated well.\u201d The seat spans 562 sq km. In the north of the electorate are parts of the scenic Dandenong ranges, including the pristine bush suburbs of Olinda, Kallista and Upper Ferntree Gully, which like Melbourne, are Greens-voting and left-leaning.  But the bulk of the electorate\u2019s 145,000 residents and 90,000 voters live in mortgage belt suburbs in the south such as Berwick, Beaconsfield and Officer, which line the Monash freeway and Princes highway, major arterial roads connecting to the city. All around housing estates with names like Sanctuary and Berwick Waters are cropping up and young families are moving in. While those who live in the Greens-held electorate of Melbourne rally in the streets over issues such as asylum seekers, Indigenous land rights and climate change, the concerns of Victorians here are more bread-and-butter.  Economou describes voters in La Trobe as \u201cclassic, rational voters\u201d.  \u201cThey\u2019re less interested in partisan politics; they don\u2019t see themselves as uber-rich, nor do they see themselves as blue collar,\u201d he says.    If it were up to me, I\u2019d be sending a message to the major parties that we don\u2019t get enough from them  Kuranda Seyit     \u201cThey\u2019re not as interested in asylum seekers, gay marriage, the environment or any of that stuff. They\u2019re new-home buyers hyper-sensitive to interest rates. They have kids going to school. They want the government to do their job and provide healthcare and education, and they don\u2019t want to pay too much for it. They put a high value on order and stability and if a major political party is in disarray, they won\u2019t hesitate to go to the other major party.\u201d Labor is seen as attractive by voters interested in health care and education \u2013 many of the schools in the electorate are public. \u201cOn the other hand, Liberals are seen as better economic managers, which is important to these voters who are worried that even a slight interest rate rise may throw out their family\u2019s budget,\u201d Economou says. \u201cBut the Liberals are not seen as being as good on public education or healthcare.\u201d Wood, a former counter-terrorism police officer who has lived in the electorate all his life, first won the seat in 2004. He lost to Labor\u2019s Laura Smyth by just 1,600 votes six years later, but managed to wrest the seat back in 2013. This to-and-fro reveals the unpredictability of an electorate with little tolerance for party in-fighting or political spin. With so large an electorate, Wood must tackle a diverse range of issues. Weed management, bushfire control and sustainable tourism development is vital to the Dandenongs and surrounds, he says. But with more young families buying into the area, La Trobe also has a higher number of secondary-school aged youth than the state average, and has struggled with high youth suicide rates. Last year Wood opened headspace in Narre Warren as part of the Coalition\u2019s commitment to open 100 of the youth support service sites across the country. There are also pockets in and around Narre Warren where young people are at risk of radicalisation, prompting Wood to call for increased powers for magistrates to bar at-risk youth from associating with certain people or viewing social media. But these issues aside, Wood says a major concern in La Trobe is roads. Every morning, the Monash towards the city is crammed with cars and brought to a near standstill.  \u201cI\u2019ve secured $500m in federal funding for upgrading the Monash,\u201d he says. \u201cIf I did a survey of my electorate, more people are concerned about the Monash than the Melbourne Metro [public transport project]. You can get more people on trains, but the state hasn\u2019t put funding into car parks at the train stations, and so they\u2019re all at capacity.\u201d      Kallista is a picturesque, left-leaning suburb within the marginal electorate of La Trobe in Victoria. Photograph: Melissa Davey for the Guardian    Tackling congestion on major arterial roads would be an ongoing priority. Wood\u2019s Labor opponent is Simon Curtis, a Beaconhills College teacher who beat the well-known director of La Trobe University\u2019s centre for citizenship, development and human rights, Damien Kingsbury, to gain preselection. His success likely speaks to the priorities of residents of La Trobe, who are more concerned about their children receiving quality education and services than human rights issues. \u201cClearly people have said that healthcare and education are at the top of their priority lists, and I\u2019ve door-knocked thousands of people who have said that,\u201d Curtis says. \u201cCost of living is certainly also a concern, especially for older generations. The Coalition\u2019s weakness is their attitude towards the most vulnerable in society. We\u2019re seeing that in cruel cuts to Medicare, we\u2019re seeing that in their lack of attention to public education.\u201d Among the voters Guardian Australia spoke to, opportunities for youth, more efficient roads into the city, and cost of living were all raised. But most were unclear about who they would vote for. With the election date set and campaigning about to ramp up, this may change. However, the candidates may have a struggle getting people to engage.  Fiona Bilton, a youth work graduate from Kallista in her early 20s, has been living in the area for a decade. She describes her suburb as a \u201chippie base\u201d. Opportunities for young people to work and improved public transport services were important to her. Young people were moving away as soon as they finished high school and often did not return once they had finished their tertiary education. She knew what she believed in, but was unsure of who she would vote for. \u201cProbably it would be either Family First or the Greens,\u201d she said, adding that she would be swayed by a party who could put forward a strong plan for youth support services, including public health, and public transport. Among La Trobe\u2019s residents is the secretary of the Islamic Council of Victoria, Kuranda Seyit. He would not be surprised if the electorate sent a strong message to both major parties by voting Greens or for a minor party. \u201cIf it were up to me, I\u2019d be sending a message to the major parties that we don\u2019t get enough from them,\u201d he said.",
