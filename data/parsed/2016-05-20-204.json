  "body": "I met my new partner last year and moved in with him about six weeks ago. I love and admire him deeply. He is dominant by nature, which at the beginning I liked very much, at least sexually. However, since moving in, his controlling ways have extended to forbidding me to wear certain clothes if they are too short or revealing, insisting I wear tights with dresses and so on. This makes me feel uneasy. I don\u2019t want to be made into a dowdy, mousy partner who eventually gets replaced with someone more exciting. I have a tendency to become very insecure in relationships, and this is not the first time I have been dominated in this way. Is the relationship fundamentally flawed or is this something we can work on? \u2022 When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help, and may well view your comments here.
