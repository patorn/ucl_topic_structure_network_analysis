  "body": "Kim Kardashian in the flesh is precisely like Kim Kardashian on the page. Half-pint-sized, completely symmetrical and, to quote Jess Cartner-Morley, with a face like \u201claser-cut diamond\u201d. Her friend, makeup artist Charlotte Tilbury, describes her as a modern day icon, the new Sophia Loren and credited her Armenian genes. Kim, however, put most of it down to makeup. Here are 12 nuggets of wisdom from Saturday\u2019s event.   Related: Why is Kim Kardashian famous? You asked Google \u2013 here\u2019s the answer | Eleanor Morgan     Michael Jackson once told Kim that she looked like Madonna. Said out of context, this observation is both problematic and inaccurate, but it did set the tone for the rest of the afternoon. She hasn\u2019t had a nosejob. But, she explains, you can replicate the nosejob effect with some sharp contouring. Except that contouring is over. It\u2019s all about \u201cnon-touring\u201d says Kardashian, sort of \u201ccontouring without the bronzer\u201d. Natural base and highlighted cheeks. That sort of thing. She doesn\u2019t believe in \u201cover-sharing\u201d. After all she\u2019s \u201copened up her life\u201d to public scrutiny, a life she often compares to The Truman Show. While this understated the obvious, it did introduce a series of excellent anecdotes. The best? How she once snapchatted a pregnancy test in the bathroom of an airplane and then spent the rest of the flight wondering if she\u2019d gone \u201ctoo far\u201d.  \u201cI\u2019m not a free-the-nipple feminist\u201d but I feel comfortable doing what I want to do. Amazing.  How to take a perfect selfie. If you\u2019re with someone it \u201cdepends whose arm is longer. Flash is everything. Flash always from above because of your double chin.\u201d She has a very big space between her eyebrows and her sockets. Ideal for applying makeup, wearing false lashes, and so on and so on. Again, who cares? But also, everyone. When Caitlyn Jenner transitioned, Kim was pivotal in helping her dress like a woman. \u201cI said: \u2018If you\u2019re gonna do this, you can\u2019t look crazy.\u2019\u201d  What does she have in her makeup bag? \u201cAn eyelash curler, a tiny lipstick in nude in a shade called Kim KW, a Joe Blasco mascara, a Kabuki brush, some sort of eyelash powder, a smashbox bronzer.\u201d Again, fascinating.  Their father wanted his daughters to look age-appropriate. So he did what any father of a teenager would do and sent them to Joe Blasco beauty school when Kim was 14.   She used to be nervous about getting naked. In fact, her mum had to \u201cpersuade\u201d her to pose for Playboy. \u201cHow things have changed,\u201d she deadpanned.   Her dream? To look like Kim circa 2011.",
