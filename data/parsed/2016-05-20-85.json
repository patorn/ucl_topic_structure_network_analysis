  "body": "It was the year that Cannes prepared itself, spectacularly, for a terrorist attack by staging a full-dress armed incursion the week before. As it turned out, this was the only recognition of the security situation in France: there were no films about it.   Related: I, Daniel Blake review: Ken Loach's welfare state polemic is blunt, dignified and brutally moving    Elsewhere, the politics of Cannes manifested themselves in the auteurs\u2019 individual statements. Ken Loach, in his I, Daniel Blake, gave a blistering attack on food-bank Britain and political austerity. Andrea Arnold\u2019s American Honey featured a disagreeable chancer selling dodgy magazine subscriptions door-to-door: he wears black trousers and braces which make him \u201clook like Donald Trump\u201d. It could be that salesmen will always bring anxiety-capitalism with them. Asghar Farhadi\u2019s The Salesman is about a couple whose souring relationship is linked to Arthur Miller\u2019s Death of a Salesman.     Andrea Arnold\u2019s American Honey Photograph: PR Image    Meanwhile, the cast of Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho\u2019s Brazilian movie, Aquarius followed up that film\u2019s political satire by showing up on the red carpet carrying placards denouncing Brazil\u2019s new administration as the beneficiaries of a \u201cpolitical coup\u201d. It was also the year that the big directors took on genre pictures. Olivier Assayas made a scary suspense movie in the form of Personal Shopper \u2013 and a great performance from Kristen Stewart helped sell it to the crowd. That seasoned provocateur Nicolas Winding Refn gave us a freaky horror with his The Neon Demon: again, it depended on a very strong performance from a Hollywood star, Elle Fanning. Romania has had another huge year on the Croisette. Two big-hitters from that country, Cristian Mungiu and Cristi Puiu, gave us films which anatomised the state of that country\u2019s ruling class and also hinted at signs of a poisonous Ostalgie: a feeling that things have not advanced since the era of Ceau\u0219escu, and might be worse. Oddly, the year\u2019s German movie, Maren Ade\u2019s Toni Erdmann, was mostly set in Romania, and featured a performance from its seasoned character and bad-guy specialist, Vlad Ivanov.   Related: Personal Shopper review: Kristen Stewart's psychic spooker is a must-have    2016 has also been the year of comedy on the Croisette, a genre traditionally neglected. Toni Erdmann showed that Germany can do broad comedy which travels outside its borders and Bruno Dumont\u2019s Slack Bay delivered big, goofy laughs. Here are my predictions for this year\u2019s prizes: Palme d\u2019Or Graduation (dir: Cristian Mungiu) Grand Prix Aquarius (dir: Kleber Mendon\u00e7a Filho) Jury Prize Personal Shopper (dir: Olivier Assayas) Best director Nicolas Winding Refn for The Neon Demon Best screenplayJim Jarmusch for Paterson Best actor Peter Simonischek for Toni Erdmann Best actress Ruth Negga for Loving     Loving actor Ruth Negga at a Cannes photocall.
