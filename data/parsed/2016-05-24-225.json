  "body": "The controversial ruler of Chechnya, Kremlin-backed Ramzan Kadyrov, has engaged John Oliver in an unlikely online spat after the British comedian mocked the hardman leader for posting an online appeal about a lost cat. Oliver mocked Kadyrov in a five-minute segment on HBO\u2019s Last Week Tonight after the Chechen leader appealed to the world to help find his cat, a so-called toyger, a domestic cat bred to resemble a tiger cub.  Last week, Kadyrov posted a message on Instagram to ask for help in locating the animal. \u201cWe have begun to seriously worry,\u201d he wrote, asking for anyone with information on the cat\u2019s whereabouts to get in touch. During the sketch on Sunday, Oliver said Kadyrov, who posts regular videos of his work-outs in the gym on Instagram, is \u201cbasically like a can of Monster energy drink come to life\u201d. He also teased the Chechen for his propensity to wear T-shirts bearing the image of president Vladimir Putin. Oliver later posted a photograph on Twitter of himself holding a cat, asking Kadyrov if it was his.    .@RKadyrov Is this your cat? pic.twitter.com/2UacV3km7J\u2014 John Oliver (@iamjohnoliver) May 23, 2016    The stunt provoked a growl of protest from the Chechen. Late on Monday evening, he responded with a photoshopped picture of Oliver wearing a Putin T-shirt, and with the caption \u201cI\u2019m tired of jokes, I want to care for cats in Chechnya. By the way, Putin is our leader!\u201d       Kadyrov has been accused of a string of human rights abuses during his rule over Chechnya. Men close to him are the prime suspects in the murder of opposition politician Boris Nemtsov in Moscow last year.  He has also become known for his idiosyncratic Instagram feed, which frequently features photographs and video of exotic animals, fast cars, and apparent death threats to opposition leaders. Kadyrov\u2019s Instagram response to Oliver was accompanied by a long text in semi-comprehensible English: \u201cThe anchorman comedian \u2013 John Oliver asks millions of viewers to look for a cat. I knew long ago that in the USA unevenly breathe to my younger friends. One day horses aren\u2019t allowed to jump, the other - a cat is a real star of a show,\u201d he wrote.        He said it was no surprise that he liked to wear Putin T-shirts, and that \u201cmillions of people rejoice t-shirts with the image of the national leader\u201d. This, said Kadyrov, was because Putin is a \u201cwise, courageous, resolute Head, who managed to withstand unfriendly campaign, which is conducted by the USA and its assistants\u201d.  Despite the apparent seriousness of the initial post looking for the cat, Kadyrov suggested the whole affair was more of a storm in a teacup, and that the cat had merely left to reproduce. \u201cBy cat rumors he has in our district a familiar she-cat with which he\u2019s going to start a family. I\u2019m sure that after spring affairs, the cat will return to native walls. Perhaps, he\u2019ll bring his sweet love with him,\u201d Kadyrov wrote.

In February 2015 the Ecuadorian president, Rafael Correa, called Oliver an \u201coxymoron\u201d because he was an \u201cEnglish comedian\u201d, after Oliver accused of him being thin-skinned.  In October, Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump said he had turned down an invite to be on the show, a claim disputed by Last Week Tonight:    .@thehill  John Oliver had his people call to ask me to be on his very boring and low rated show. I said \"NO THANKS\" Waste of time & energy!\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 31, 2015      A couple of points...1. Yes, we have a boring show.2. At no point did we invite Donald Trump to appear on it.https://t.co/qjpg9FLb0V\u2014 Last Week Tonight (@LastWeekTonight) November 1, 2015",
