  "body": "South African musicians have joyfully welcomed an announcement that their music will dominate the country\u2019s airwaves after years of \u201ccultural imperialism\u201d. The national broadcaster, SABC, decided this week that 90% of the music played on its radio stations would be by local artists, a move that one of South Africa\u2019s hip-hop stars compared to Nelson Mandela\u2019s release from prison. \u201cI never even thought that they\u2019d make this change,\u201d said Slikour, a musician from Johannesburg. \u201cIn the music industry, it\u2019s like Mandela coming out of jail, to keep it real.\u201d Under the new quotas, all 18 of SABC\u2019s radio stations are to play local music from Thursday. The broadcaster took the decision after consultation with members of the music industry, and is expected to fill its schedules with jazz, reggae and other popular South African genres such as kwaito, inspired by 1990s house music and bubblegum disco of the 1980s.

That\u2019s why we\u2019re saying local is lekker.\u201d \u201cLekker\u201d, a ubiquitous South African slang word meaning \u201cgood\u201d, was the word on dozens of musicians\u2019 lips on Thursday. Jazz musician Don Laka, who campaigned hard for South African music to be played, said the decision to introduce quotas would \u201cmark the death of cultural imperialism\u201d. Laka had previously said millions of rand in royalties were leaving the country and resulting in local musicians struggling financially. \u201cEvery time you hear an American song on our radio and watch SABC TV, know that money is leaving South Africa,\u201d he wrote.

Photograph: Don Laka/Facebook    On Thursday, Laka said he was delighted and surprised by SABC\u2019s announcement. \u201cThis is a landmark decision,\u201d he said. \u201cThey nearly gave me a heart attack yesterday when the news broke. We were in a meeting and in that meeting I had prepared myself to come and fight. I think they thought they\u2019d show this one that his time of fighting is over now. The COO just announced it and what shocked me even more was that he just said: \u2018Tomorrow.\u2019 Tears started running down my cheeks. I\u2019ve never experienced such a move \u2013 that culturally, we\u2019ll be liberated in 12 hours.\u201d Not all South Africans were happy at the prospect of listening to local music all day , however. \u201cIt should be up to consumers, not bureaucrats, to determine what is played on the radio. The SABC 90% quota is irrational populism,\u201d said Sihle Ngobese, a sociologist. \u201cThere\u2019s no virtue in being a local musician. They too must earn fans and listenership.\u201d",
