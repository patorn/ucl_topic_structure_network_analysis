  "body": "The Guardian\u2019s awards were launched to showcase the improvements and innovation under way across UK public services after seven years of a Labour government that had invested billions in new hospitals, schools and Sure Start centres, and boosted the workforce, increasing the number of doctors and nurses and police officers. With hospital waiting times falling and local authority services fast improving, the first year\u2019s winner in 2004, from more than 300 entries, was Blackburn with Darwen council for its trailblazing role in children\u2019s services. The council was one of the first advocates of early intervention and collaborative working. Its early years excellence service brought together drop-in health and child development clinics, childcare, an under-fives library and job advice services under one roof.   Related: How to enter the Guardian Public Service Awards 2016    Over the years the Guardian\u2019s awards have picked winners that have reflected changing social needs and services to match. In 2008, in the wake of the financial crash, Scotcash, a scheme backed by Glasgow city council to tackle loan sharks, was named overall winner. In 2010, the University Hospital of South Manchester NHS foundation trust took the top accolade for its efforts to become Britain\u2019s greenest hospital, introducing a raft of measures to help patients, staff and the local community reduce their carbon footprint. The following year, Tukes, a unique service-user employment scheme that enables patients to take an active part in maintaining and running their acute mental health unit, from cleaning, catering and laundry to gardening and reception work, scooped the highest prize. Described as being five years ahead of its time, the winner was not only a new breed of social enterprise working in health and social care, but a pioneer of the concept of user-led public services. By 2013, as the coalition\u2019s swingeing cuts were making their mark on public services, it was fitting that Hampshire county council\u2019s young interpreter programme was singled out. The scheme had made a vital impact on a pressing social issue, yet cost almost nothing.     The Hampshire Young Interpreters Project Team who won in 2013.

Unlike the problems that caused the government to can its \u00a310bn NHS IT programme and e-borders system, the overall winner of the 2005 awards was an example of an IT project done well. The then Department of Constitutional Affairs\u2019 \u00a320m Xhibit system provides real-time information to criminal justice agencies on the status of court cases and has replaced the paper-based method of recording court information. More than a decade later, the system is now used in all 74 crown courts and 18 satellite courts and the Ministry of Justice wants to use it to further improve access to data and information. The Family Drug and Alcohol Court, set up by the Tavistock and Portman NHS foundation trust and children\u2019s charity Coram, which was the children and young people category winner in 2011, has proved so successful in improving care proceedings for families with substance abuse issues, that it has been introduced in other towns and cities across England. Now, some 12 years after its initial launch, we are opening entries to the Guardian Public Service Awards 2016. The public services landscape has changed irrevocably: since 2010 there have been massive spending cuts, welfare benefits have been slashed and council funding has fallen by more than 40%, putting enormous pressure on already stretched local services. If that were not enough, an \u201cefficiency review\u201d announced in this year\u2019s budget, aims to identify \u00a33.5bn more savings by 2018. Against this backdrop, it is arguably more crucial than ever to pioneer new approaches. \u201cAusterity is proving to be a longer and darker tunnel than we imagined, but thoughts are turning to what public services will look like when we eventually emerge blinking into the sunlight,\u201d says David Brindle, the Guardian\u2019s public services editor and chair of the judges. \u201cThese awards will showcase the kind of innovative working that will be leading the way.\u201d Of course, previous winners have not been immune from cutbacks. Sutton\u2019s library service, which won the innovation and progress, technology category in 2005, for tranforming its service through IT, will this year have to close some services to save the south London borough \u00a31m. In Blackburn with Darwen, despite budget cuts, the council still operates eight designated children\u2019s centres (down from 13), although fewer services are now delivered from them as partner organisations have also had to make cuts. Instead, outreach teams have been developed, to prioritise \u201csmarter, not harder working\u201d. As Linda Clegg, Blackburn with Darwen council\u2019s director of children\u2019s services, says: \u201cThe award recognised that the early innovative thinking about collaboration and partnership working was right. This way of working is truly embedded and continues to support and drive strong local service delivery for children and families despite the challenging financial times.\u201d How to enter The Guardian Public Service Awards 2016 are open for applications from today and seek to recognise best practice in public services across the UK.
