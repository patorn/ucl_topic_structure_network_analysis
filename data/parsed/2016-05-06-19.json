  "body": "The wave curls, whip-fast and flawless; it goes on, and on, and on. Inside it, surfing in the barrel of the wave \u2013 the feeling, the high, that surfers yearn for \u2013 is Nat Young, an American pro-surfer, ranked ninth in the world. Above him, a drone films his run \u2013 10 seconds, 20 seconds, 30 seconds. It was the longest barrel of his life. Young had never surfed a wave like this before. Yet this was 110 miles from the ocean, in California farm country  in a specially constructed, exquisitely engineered freshwater pool. And it was perfect. \u201cIt\u2019s an awesome feeling,\u201d Young told the Guardian. The pool was built by 11-time World Surf League champion Kelly Slater, who for 10 years had been focused on an idea that many thought was impossible \u2013 building a machine which could reproduce the ideal wave, and create it on command.          Kelly Slater invited fellow pro surfers Nat Young, Carissa Moore and Kanoa Igarashi to try out his new artificial wave near Fresno, California.    Few people thought it was possible. But in December, after two years of construction in near perfect secrecy, Slater released an extraordinary video of his machine in action. The excitement the video caused in the surfing community is hard to overstate. \u201cThat thing basically broke the internet,\u201d said Craig Brokensha, surf forecaster for surfing news site Swellnet. In that video, the wave curls over silently, dark and mysterious in the early morning light. The water from which it rises is glass-flat; the wave\u2019s curling edge is smooth, sharp, almost sculptural. \u201cIt is,\u201d Brokensha said, \u201calmost too perfect.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the most bizarre-looking thing you\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Tom Lowe, a British professional surfer. \u201cA robotic wave which goes forever.\u201d Lowe watched the first video, when it came out in December, 20 times over.  \u201cIt was kind of like, just a normal day on a surf trip,\u201d said Young of his day riding the machine that Slater calls his \u201cfreak of technology\u201d. \u201cWe woke up pretty early, 6 or 6.30, had some food, some coffee, got the wave pool up and running, and we went and we surfed. \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe it when Kelly gave me a call and invited me to come up there,\u201d he said. \u201cI felt honored that I was one of the people he invited; it\u2019s amazing to be one of the first people to surf it.\u201d Young was joined by WSL women\u2019s champion Carissa Moore, Californian pro Kanoa Igarashi and Robert \u201cWingnut\u201d Weaver, a veteran American surfer who starred in the 1994 surf movie Endless Summer II.            Young said the narrowness of the pool \u2013 700 yards long, but only 40 or so yards wide \u2013 struck him when he saw it in person. \u201cMy first impression, when I saw the first wave come through, was disbelief,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a flat pond, and then, all of a sudden, you\u2019re watching a perfect wave.\u201d Slater\u2019s machine is powered entirely with solar energy, and the wave itself is created with a specially shaped foil or plough, which is pulled along mechanically beneath the surface, shaping the wave and pushing it forward. Nick Houndsfield is founder and CEO of The Wave, a British-based company currently constructing their own artificial surf pool in Bristol. He said that wave machines have been around for 40 years, but that it is only in the last 15 years or so that the technology has been good enough to make waves suitable for surfing.    If you can build this at an Olympic city, you\u2019ve got a surfing event.  Matt Barr, All Conditions Media     The Wave\u2019s Bristol project will use pneumatics \u2013 pulsating the water for constant waves, rather than the displacement foil Slater used. The difference, Houndsfield said, is that pneumatics create a variety of waves near constantly, while Kelly\u2019s foil displacement system creates just the one \u2013 albeit eerily perfect \u2013 breaker. \u201cWhat [Slater has] produced right now is mind-bending,\u201d Houndsfield said. \u201cIt is brilliant \u2013 but it is brilliant for professional surfers. I\u2019m not going to be sticking my kid in it any time soon.\u201d The technology is extraordinary; but while Young said that it was a paradigm shift in terms of bringing surfing to areas distant from the sea, Houndsfield disagreed. \u201cI can count on two hands the number of people I know that could surf a high, perfect, barreling wave, day in, day out,\u201d he said. This might change however. Surfing has exploded in popularity over the past 20 years, with an estimated 500,000 regular surfers in the UK alone. \u201cIt\u2019s completely crossed over into mainstream culture,\u201d said Matt Barr, the director of All Conditions Media, an action sports agency. The perfect predictability of Slater\u2019s wave means that the final piece of that puzzle \u2013 the fact that competitive surfing has relied, to a greater or lesser degree, on the luck of the wave \u2013 can now be overcome. \u201cThe problem with surfing is it\u2019s so unpredictable,\u201d Barr said. \u201cIf you can build this at an Olympic city, you\u2019ve got a surfing event.\u201d Young, who rode Slater\u2019s wave this week in a VIP session along with several other pro surfers and executives in the World Surfing League, also agreed. \u201cIt has a set running time, instead of waiting for the swell and conditions,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, that\u2019s huge. And being able to recreate the same wave over and over gives people an even playing field \u2013 because it\u2019s sometimes a bit of luck catching waves [in the ocean].\u201d            For some surfers, the very idea of the artificial, man-made wave is problematic. \u201cI think a big part of surfing is reading waves and being in the ocean,\u201d said Andrew Cotton, a professional big-wave surfer who famously took on the monster waves at Portugal\u2019s Praia do Norte, 80 miles north of Lisbon.  \u201cThe one in California looks absolutely amazing \u2013 it\u2019s like the dream wave. Any surfer would be excited to surf it,\u201d said Cotton. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing to watch Kelly Slater ride that wave, because he rides it as best as anyone could ever ride a wave. But it\u2019s amazing watching Kelly Slater ride, full-stop. I don\u2019t think anything makes up for learning to surf, or having the skill of reading the ocean. That\u2019s surfing.\u201d",
