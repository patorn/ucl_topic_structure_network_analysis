Unfortunately Alberto Moreno has always been more Harold Lloyd than Larry Lloyd and living up to past glories proved beyond him on Wednesday night, as did keeping up with Sevilla attackers, concentrating for more than one second or heading the ball to any of nine team-mates readily identifiable by the most famous red outfits never to grace the cast of Baywatch. Aye, it was a night to forget for young Moreno. But forgetting it is another thing he\u2019ll not be able to do, especially with the criticism of millions of Liverpool fans ringing in his ears like dilly bleeding dong. Even ex-Liverpool players couldn\u2019t hold back, with Steve McManaman branding the Spaniard\u2019s performance \u201catrocious\u201d and a blast from Jamie Carragher\u2019s Twitter gun demanding that J\u00fcrgen Klopp \u201csign an [effing] left-back!\u201d It all amounted to quite an ordeal for a player who should never have been put in the position of having to defend himself, or anything else.   Related: Liverpool's Europa League party fizzles out as Sevilla reign again | Barney Ronay    Moreno was not the only one to blame for Liverpool\u2019s comprehensive defeat, of course. Philippe Coutinho and Roberto Firmino were like a couple of geckos introduced to Easter Island by Polynesian settlers a long time ago, insofar as they had no influence whatsoever on events in Basel/Basle/Baaarl/Barzuhl. And Klopp himself didn\u2019t seem to exert much control in the second half as Sevilla reminded everyone what a nifty team they can be. Ah yes, the Premier League fans predicting a comfortable Liverpool victory had forgotten about that last bit, hadn\u2019t they? After the match Klopp had the unhappy duty of having to look at a bunch of journalists but, to his credit, he resisted any temptation to throw Moreno to the slobbering pack. Instead he lamented the way his whole team unravelled after Sevilla\u2019s equaliser to the point that they were practically indistinguishable from the shower that Brendan Rodgers used to send out earlier this season. OK, those are our words, not exactly his. What he said was: \u201cAt this moment we lost faith in our style of play, we changed from passing quick and simple to complicated and lost our formation.\u201d  At least Klopp managed to finish his press conference, if not his season, on a high note: \u201cWe are disappointed and frustrated 100% but tomorrow or later in the week we will see it a little bit more clearly and we will use this experience, that is what we have to do,\u201d he bugled. \u201cIt is clear we are not in a European tournament next year so we don\u2019t have football on Wednesday or Thursday, so we will have time to train and we will, for sure, come back stronger.\u201d And with a new left-back, for pity\u2019s sake. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cMy ambition is to bring Villa to the top six in less than five years and I hope it can be [one of] the top three in the world \u2013 even the best well known in the world \u2013 in less than 10 years\u201d \u2013 not sure how good or bad it is for new Aston Villa owner Tony Xia to be setting his sights so high. Hear more from him in this exclusive chin-wag.     Tell \u2018em T. Photograph: Damir Sagolj/Reuters    CRASHER KIDS \u201cI would like to apologise to the England football team, the FA, Club Wembley, and anyone else affected by my actions on Wednesday afternoon at St George\u2019s Park. My intentions were not to embarrass anyone or cause concern. Upon entering the pitch I identified myself to England players so they knew I wasn\u2019t a threat, and as soon as I was asked to leave I did so\u201d \u2013 Pirate DJ and son of a Club Wembley member, Harry Peak, reveals himself to be the perpetrator of what was probably the most underwhelming and least exciting gatecrashing of the most underwhelming and least exciting thing to gatecrash in history.     Be underwhelmed. Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters    FIVER LETTERS \u201cI\u2019ve spent this morning cataloguing every Google News utterance this season of the phrase \u2018a tough place to go\u2019. These are the results. Stoke\u2019s reputation is incredibly unfounded. I have in no way wasted my life\u201d \u2013 Steven Chicken.  \u201cLet\u2019s hope Liverpool didn\u2019t paint the bus prematurely this time\u201d \u2013 Gareth Rogers. \u201cI enjoy sitting down to actually read The Fiver every day. But I couldn\u2019t get past the giant Liverpool-branded mammary glands hanging above J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s head in the main image of yesterday\u2019s edition. They\u2019re quite the distraction. I know this is hardly hitting the standards of the witty, educated and erudite commentary you usually get every day, but I had to mention it. In fact I feel positively childish now\u201d \u2013 Kate Vogelsang. \u201cRe: the photo of Klopp. I\u2019ve never seen the Liverpool crest as a n1pple before. Now I cannot see it as anything else\u201d \u2013 Kristian Brock. \u201cRe: your snarky remarks yesterday about [Plain Old] John Terry (yesterday\u2019s Bits and Bobs). Of course, any working-class lad on a YTS scheme is an easy target for the lazy scribblers at your paper, but for someone who has actually made something of his life, he has provided plenty of copy for you. Now, leave him alone\u201d \u2013 Mark Law. \u201cAll this dog-handling chat (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters) reminds me of a flamin\u2019 Aussie Rules Football game I went to in Sydney in 1996. Sydney Swans were pounding the Wagga Wagga Wasps or some such when the break came. The half-time entertainment generously comprised an attempt to break a record of some sort for line dancing. Exciting. As if that wasn\u2019t enough of a treat, they also had some dusty bush-type and his dogs herding sheep around the perimeter of the oval. It was all going quite smoothly until one of the dogs got slightly overcome by the occasion and bit one of the sheep on its back leg. The suddenly-spooked sheep scattered in all directions, skittling dozens of tasselled line-dancers to the ground while the dogs descended into full rampage, encouraged as they were by a suddenly boisterous and baying crowd. Tears and cheeks have rarely met under more wondrous circumstances\u201d \u2013 Glenn Leete. \u201cBack in the days of The Dell, a police dog team prepared to demonstrate their catch-a-man skills. The man, to be caught with well padded arm, leapt out from the sidelines prepared to hare across the pitch. Before he could get into full stride however, an alert PC, not in the act, flattened the runner\u201d \u2013 Jeff Dunn. \u2022 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
