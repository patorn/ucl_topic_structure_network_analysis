  "body": "The internet is not what it used to be, cries the chorus. Once a playground of geeks and innovators, it is now ruled by the corporate giants, Facebook, Google and Apple. But those nostalgic for its heyday are gathering at Tate Modern\u2019s Turbine Hall this weekend for the first UK Internet Yami-ichi.   Related: Kittens, Kanye and kiss-and-tells: the artist who swapped canvas for clickbait    Translated as \u201cblack market\u2019 in Japanese, the Yami-ichi has a simple aim: bringing internet culture offline. Think Edward Snowden snow-globes, spambot love letters (in envelopes not emails), and chocolate chip browser cookies you can actually eat. Founded in Tokyo in 2012, the Yami-ichi has since set up shop in Berlin, New York and Amsterdam but this is London\u2019s first chance to \u201cbrowse IRL\u201d. Looking for a new artwork for your living room? Give the Tate shop a miss and head instead to Yinan Song\u2019s booth, which is selling prints of images taken from people using public Wifi. Song will obscure images for privacy purposes and sell them for between \u00a31 and \u00a33 a pop. Alternatively, you can get your digital fortune told by London artist Libby Heaney, who offers personalised Tarot readings based on age, gender and relationship status,read out in the form of pre-programmed phrases from the likes of Match.com. \u201cInternet companies already hold so much data about us, they can essentially predict our future,\u201d says Heaney. Japanese artist Kensuke Sembo, who founded the Internet Yami-ichi, agrees. \u201cOnce upon a time, the internet was supposed to be a place for liberty, now there are privacy issues, flame wars and social media stress. We thought we should turn off, log out and drop in on the real world to enjoy our internet liberties.\u201d     Cookie policy ... a fresh batch being made. Photograph: Internet Yami-Ichi    At another booth, Nye Thompson is mining Backdoored, an archive of unsecured webcam images that end up in public search engines. \u201cMany are from private domestic spaces and the people who live there have no idea they are broadcasting their lives to the world,\u201d said Thompson, who is selling postcards, stickers and underpants of the images for \u00a310. Most of the 20 stall-holders are applying a comical touch to the internet\u2019s darker issues, says Nimrod Vardi, curator of the London event. \u201cTheir projects give a new way to look and understand digital \u201cobjects\u201d. It is important to remain experimental; that\u2019s what the Yami-Ichi is all about.\u201d Other pieces up for grabs includes \u201cglitch embroidery\u201d by Japanese fashion designer Nukeme, who hacks digital patterns on sewing machines to make custom hoodies. Erik Zepka has made a series of T-shirts that incorporate Twitter and Apple-inspired logos into his own pseudo-corporate brand. Meanwhile sound artist Tadeo Sendon is selling Browsing Noise, a book of field recordings from his travels around the internet. It ties into the Yami-ichi\u2019s main premise: to create a space to show experimental works that, while digitally influenced, don\u2019t necessarily fit online. \u201cThe idea for the Yami-Ichi began when my own iPhone app was rejected by Apple because it was too simple,\u201d said Sembo, who began to wonder how he might sidestep digital marketplaces like the App Store. \u201cWe thought that not only data, but also internet-inspired ideas, can be exchanged in real space.\u201d Just like any market, there will be haggling. But it\u2019s meant to go beyond bargains. \u201cI hope people leave with an insight of new forms of art, new worlds to explore, commercial and non-commercial,\u201d says Vardi. \u201cLondon needs more of those.\u201d",
