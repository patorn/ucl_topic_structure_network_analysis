  "body": "Given the negative attention charities have received in the last year, it\u2019s debatable how much we understand about what charities actually do, especially when they are competing against companies in the private sector for large-scale public service contracts. With the government\u2019s continued austerity cuts pushing more charities towards delivering these contracts, and away from grant funding, how many of the services we rely on are now run by the charitable sector? Here are 10 essential services that are: Ambulance services While air ambulance services have always been run by charities or not-for-profit organisations, it may come as a surprise that when you call 999, it might be a charity, such as St John\u2019s Ambulance, that is sent out to take you to hospital rather than an NHS ambulance. In fact, in 2014-15, England\u2019s 10 ambulance services spent \u00a357.6m on private or voluntary services due to increasing demand and pressure to meet targets.

It provides a range of housing solutions including social housing, care homes, retirement homes and supported housing. There is high demand for their rented properties, with more than 1,000 people currently waiting for a home. It doesn\u2019t always work out, though \u2013 the Glasspool Trust in Walthamstow has faced criticism for selling off its housing stock to a private company, which has resulted in eviction notices for the residents. Legal or advocacy advice According to Charity Bank\u2019s research, 18.3m people have received support or advice from a citizen\u2019s or legal advice charity. The best known is Citizens Advice, which experienced a huge rise in demand following the cuts to legal aid in 2012, which have resulted in a surge of people attempting to defend themselves in court. Last year the charity helped 2.5 million people resolve 6.2m problems including legal, money and a huge variety of other issues by providing free, independent and confidential advice. There are also smaller charities such as Personal Support Unit, whose volunteers offer emotional support and practical guidance to litigants facing proceedings without legal representation. Health and social care In Wales the British Red Cross\u2019 home from hospital discharge scheme helps patients leave hospital when their medical and nursing needs have been met. For a period of up to six weeks immediately after discharge, the charity provides them with emotional and practical support \u2013 to ease the transition from hospital to home. Meanwhile, Age UK has developed an innovative integrated care model to reduce the number of older people living with multiple long-term conditions having to repeatedly go into hospital in the first place with a combination of medical and non-medical support that integrates health, social care and voluntary sector services.

The three-year project, funded by the government, Rotherham council and independent backers, includes preventative education programmes, specialist training for professionals as well as help for the victims to rebuild their lives.  Probation services  Much was made of the charities and social enterprises bidding to deliver probation service contracts in 2014. The contracts, worth \u00a3450m, handed over 70% of the work the public probation service did to other providers as part of Chris Grayling\u2019s Transforming Rehabilitation programme. While most of the contracts were won by consortiums rather than one single organisation, 16 charities such as Nacro, the rehabilitation charity, are now helping to run the probation service. Meanwhile, there are numerous examples of charities working in the probation sector \u2013 for example, the innovative charity Circles UK works with criminal justice agencies to reduce sex offending. Community transport Community transport plays a crucial role in tackling loneliness, ECT, a leading community transport charity, found in a recent study conducted with Deloitte. As well as playing an essential service for the elderly and disabled, transport services also help communities who by way of geography \u2013 and public service cuts \u2013 are left isolated. For example, Essex county council announced it was cutting bus routes on the island of Canvey. A local charity, Wyvern Community Transport, stepped in and now runs a bus service called DAR73, which is free to anyone with a bus pass or \u00a33 for a single or return trip for everyone else.

One such charity is Self Help in Manchester which consistently wins contracts from local authorities from the whole Greater Manchester area to provide both e-therapy (also known as iCBT) and more traditional talking therapies. It is now one of the main providers of talking therapy programmes in the north-west of England and is unique in that it is service user-lead.  Search and rescue The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) provides a 24-hour lifeboat search and rescue service around the UK and Ireland, as well as a seasonal lifeguard service. There is no public service alternative, yet the authorities rely on the charity when people go missing at sea or on coastal paths. Recently during the floods in Cumbria, it was boats and volunteers from the RNLI that worked through the night to rescue people trapped in their homes by floodwater. Meanwhile Mountain Rescue provides a similar service \u2013 rescuing people from mountains or searching for missing people \u2013 and is also a charity. Sexual health services  The sexual health charity FPA has delivered specialist sexual and reproductive health information for more than 20 years on behalf of Public Health England and the Department of Health. It has just been awarded a three-year PHE contract to lead a new sexual and reproductive health programme, which will use apps and interactive tools to reach more people. There are also a plethora of smaller voluntary organisations delivering specialist services such as London Friend, a LGBT health and wellbeing charity. They provide a whole host of sexual (and mental) health services in London as well as special training in LGBT issues for health and social care professionals.
