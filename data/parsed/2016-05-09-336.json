Citing a lack of clarity in Britain\u2019s post-referendum plans, many Europeans who have lived in Britain for years are nervously anticipating the 23 June vote, fearing the result could upend their lives.  \u201cEventually we will leave,\u201d said Marie Lemaire, who is French and lives and works in London. \u201cHow soon will depend on the result of the referendum. The debate about Brexit had made us realise that we were not at home here.\u201d    I feel rejected, like a bad transplant  Julie Lamoureux      Respondents also reported an increase in anti-migrant feeling, and criticised the remain campaign for not being vocal enough in promoting the cultural and democratic upsides of European membership alongside the economic argument.  While some EU citizens already living and working in Britain may secure indefinite leave to remain, the lack of a clear picture of what a post-Brexit Britain would look like is causing concern for Europeans resident across the UK.    One of the Brexit camp\u2019s most potent arguments is that leaving the EU would enable Britain to secure a firmer grip on immigration. For European immigrants, particularly those who have been here only a short whilte, this raises all kinds of worries about a future dominated by visas, work permits and bureaucracy.  Among those applying for permanent residency is Patrizia Piccardo, a teacher in Northamptonshire. Originally from Italy, she has \u201cfinally started the process\u201d towards citizenship after 24 years in the UK. \u201cPeople\u2019s attitudes towards me have changed,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes me paranoid and scared.\u201d Born in France, Julie Lamoureux works in IT in Belfast. \u201cI feel rejected, like a bad transplant,\u201d she said. Lamoureux is worried that EU citizens will gradually be \u201cencouraged\u201d to leave should the UK vote to leave, and is applying for British citizenship. \u201cMy friends like Nigel Farage. My friends like me. Do my friends know that they want to see in power someone who wants me out, away, back where I came from?\u201d  The question of what exactly will happen after a leave vote is occupying the mind of thousands of Europeans in the UK: students wondering if it\u2019s worth applying for a master\u2019s degree; property and business owners considering their long-term plans; people with British partners and children.  \u201cNobody seems to actually know what the consequences would be,\u201d said Marie Van Der Velde, in London. Originally from Belgium, she is married to a British citizen. \u201cWill all EU citizens be required to leave? Will we be assessed on level of income, on desirability of God-knows-what?  \u201cWhat if we are married to a UK citizen? Will they now need a certain income level to keep us in, like for non-EU spouses? Do we need to apply for citizenship and give up our European passport in the process? My children think they are English.\u201d  Lou Del Bello, a freelance journalist from Italy, said: \u201cI would rather settle somewhere else than undergo the humiliating process of applying for a visa.\u201d Others are less worried about their immediate future in the UK, expecting a bureaucratic process of visas and fees, but otherwise an expectation that they would be able to remain.  However, Gizem Ozkaynak, a postgraduate student in York, echoed many in questioning whether a post-EU Britain would be a country worth staying in. \u201cI could apply to gain British citizenship but the question is, do I really want to be in the UK when the UK does not want to be part of the EU?\u201d     Etienne Dunant. Photograph: Etienne Dunant    Frenchman Etienne Dunant, 37, an administrator in Sheffield, said: \u201cI do not honestly think that I am not going to be deported or anything of the sort should the UK leave the EU. But with my life and son here, I cannot risk to have my right to remain in this country become problematic. This is why I have now hastened my application. \u201cI also said, not quite tongue in cheek, if Scotland has another independence referendum and then applies to the EU, I would move over the border. \u201cThe thing is, the empire days are gone. I say this as a person who really loves the UK and its specificities, but sees a country that is lying to itself in a way.\u201d  Some names have been changed",
