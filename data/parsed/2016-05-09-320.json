Appearing at a doorstop with Bill Shorten at Cairns West public school on Monday, Dodson said \u201cwe know a treaty is a big discussion out in the community\u201d.  \u201cWe know constitutional recognition is a big discussion out in the community. They\u2019re not mutually exclusive matters,\u201d he said. Dodson, one of Australia\u2019s most prominent Indigenous leaders, became a Labor senator after he was picked to fill a vacancy created by the resignation of Western Australia senator Joe Bullock. Explaining the path ahead for constitutional recognition, he said \u201cthere is a process with the referendum council that is pursuing further consultations with the [Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander] community about what they want to see in the constitution or what are their basic preferences\u201d. Dodson noted that Victoria had begun negotiations with Indigenous Australians for a settlement agreement, which would be the first treaty with Indigenous Australians in Australia and follow similar arrangements with first peoples in Canada, the US and New Zealand. \u201cI think the question of settlement agreement that we\u2019ve seen in the state of Victoria, the state government engaging with the Indigenous people there, around the nation a treaty and we will be looking at that very closely and seeing how it might be something people might want to aspire to in other jurisdictions,\u201d he said.

Dodson co-chaired the expert panel on the constitutional recognition of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. He was replaced by Guardian Australia\u2019s Indigenous affairs editor Stan Grant after he took up the Senate seat. Grant said he was honoured to succeed Dodson. \u201cI\u2019m very mindful of the shoes I\u2019m stepping into \u2026 Pat is known as the father of reconciliation, and has a longer history in this than any of us, in moving the recognition process forward,\u201d he said.",
