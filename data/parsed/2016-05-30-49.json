I often get abusive, misogynistic messages on my Facebook page from complete strangers and these are frequently accompanied by penis pictures. When I complain, the response I get is that these messages do not contravene their \u201ccommunity standards\u201d. Yet a tasteful photo of me breastfeeding my baby was removed, because Facebook doesn\u2019t allow female nipples (male nipples are fine).Elizabeth BaylissStafford \u2022 The Treasury committee (MPs\u2019 report condemns \u2018misleading\u2019 EU referendum campaigns, theguardian.com, 27 May) seems to have come to the same conclusion as RD Laing who summed up the use of statistics as follows: \u201cStatistics should be used as a drunken man uses lamp posts \u2013 for support rather than illumination.\u201d We can only guess what he would have concluded about the state of the various politicians who have been abusing statistics in the last few weeks.Andrew GarradBristol \u2022 Stephen Plowden (Letters, 30 May) argues that if unchecked immigration continues we will \u201chave to build the infrastructure to accommodate several million more people\u201d. It would be nice if our governments built the infrastructre to accommodate the people we already have. Their failure to do so is nothing to do with immigration.Jeremy CushingTaddyforde, Exeter \u2022 Given that Charles Dickens created characters called Fanny Cleaver and Dick Swiveller, does that mean that Our Mutual Friend and The Old Curiosity Shop need to be rewritten (Letters, 30 May)?Tom LockeFife \u2022 As a pig farmer we used to call the runt of a litter Tat because there was no tit for Tat.David BuckinghamLeamington Spa, Warwickshire \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
