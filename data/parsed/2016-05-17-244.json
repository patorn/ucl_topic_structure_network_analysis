  "body": "I Love Dick is an account of lived events that occurred between 3 December 1994 and 19 September 1995. Everything that happens in it happened first in life, but that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s a memoir. I didn\u2019t set out to write a book, but when I realised that the hundreds of single-spaced pages addressed to Dick ___ during those months might actually be research material, I conceived the novel as a conte, a narrative, a cautionary tale or fable.    Related: I Love Dick: the book about relationships everyone should read    The novel opens at the onset of an irrational obsession that will become its story, when \u201cChris Kraus, a 39-year-old experimental film-maker and Sylv\u00e8re Lotringer, a 56-year-old college professor from New York, have dinner with Dick ___, a friendly acquaintance of Sylv\u00e8re\u2019s, at a sushi bar in Pasadena.\u201d After a drunken and flirtatious evening, the pair, who are conjoined more by intellectual companionship than by traditional bonds of marriage, parse every detail of the brief encounter. Chris thinks Dick was flirting with her. The dean of a cultural studies program at a California art school, Dick, an expat Brit, has the demeanour of the \u201cmean horse-faced junkies\u201d she dated in her 20s. Sylv\u00e8re contends she\u2019s really flirting with rejection. An orgy of interpretation reanimates their marriage and Dick becomes their silent partner. To amuse themselves, they write letters to him that they don\u2019t intend to send. In the ensuing weeks, they pack up their temporary sabbatical home in Crestline, California, Sylv\u00e8re leaves for Europe for the holidays, and Chris drives across the US alone with their belongings. Throughout this time, they continue writing letters. During the next six weeks, they compose 180 pages that they hesitantly present to Dick over breakfast at an Antelope Valley diner. Dick says: \u201cI\u2019m gobstruck.\u201d By the end of the book, Chris will sleep with Dick once or twice and he\u2019ll reject her. She\u2019ll leave Sylv\u00e8re to spend the winter in the southern Adirondacks writing letters to Dick __ that now take the form of essays. Having spent the first two decades of her adult life as a minimally participant observer in the art world, she finds she has a lot to talk about. Using the ever-silent Dick as her addressee and \u2018perfect reader,\u2019 she finally has someone besides Sylv\u00e8re who\u2019ll listen. She writes to Dick about entropic rural poverty, the Guatemalan civil wars, dead friends, her childhood in New Zealand and the unspoken rules that regulate success and failure in the art world. She writes to Dick about her girlhood heroes, outsider and female artists who were either marginalised or silenced. I wrote the book in 1997. Sylv\u00e8re and I were then, and remain, co-editors at the independent press Semiotexte. When we decided to publish I Love Dick in our Native Agents fiction series, we received a Cease and Desist letter from Dick __\u2019s lawyer. I found this very strange. Beyond his first name, Dick __ was not identified within the narrative. I\u2019d changed the titles of his books, his physical appearance and personal history, and did not refer to any facts about his life that weren\u2019t already published. I called Dick up and asked if he\u2019d like to write an introduction. Nothing in the book was aimed against him: it could be presented as a joke that we\u2019d cooked up together. He declined. When an ex-student of Sylv\u00e8re\u2019s wrote a New York magazine piece about the publication, Dick ___ identified himself to comment. He described the book \u2013 or, as I called it then, the \u201cproject\u201d \u2013 as a \u201cbeneath contempt \u2026 a despicable enterprise\u201d, and drew an analogy between himself and Princess Diana.  When I Love Dick appeared in November 1997, it was received mostly with derision: \u201cA book not so much written as secreted,\u201d as the reviewer for Artforum noted. Others defended it. I failed to see what people found so controversial. As the late Kathy Acker remarked about a 1975 performance with the elderly cabaret artist Lil Picard that entailed audience members spitting liquids into her vagina: \u201cReally, there are worse atrocities.\u201d When Hedi El Kholti decided to re-release the book with Semiotexte in 2006, it enjoyed a much more welcoming reception. The world had changed. Women, by then, had utterly rejected the unspoken rule of feminine discretion. In a milieu of female blogs and third-wave feminism, I Love Dick was seen as prescient. Almost invariably, reviewers praise the book for its embrace of \u201cfeminine abjection\u201d, although I see it more as comedy. The years that I spent living and then writing I Love Dick were exhilarating. They laid the groundwork for all my future writing. Extract December 3, 1994 Chris Kraus, a 39-year-old experimental filmmaker and Sylv\u00e8re Lotringer, a 56-year- old college professor from New York, have dinner with Dick ___, a friendly acquaintance of Sylv\u00e8re\u2019s, at a sushi bar in Pasadena. Dick is an English cultural critic who\u2019s recently relocated from Melbourne to Los Angeles. Chris and Sylv\u00e8re have spent Sylv\u00e8re\u2019s sabbatical at a cabin in Crestline, a small town in the San Bernardino Mountains some 90 minutes from Los Angeles. Since Sylv\u00e8re begins teaching again in January, they will soon be returning to New York. Over dinner the two men discuss recent trends in postmodern critical theory and Chris, who is no intellectual, notices Dick making continual eye contact with her. Dick\u2019s attention makes her feel powerful, and when the check comes she takes out her Diners Club card. \u201cPlease,\u201d she says. \u201cLet me pay.\u201d The radio predicts snow on the San Bernardino highway. Dick generously invites them both to spend the night at his home in the Antelope Valley desert, some 30 miles away. Chris wants to separate herself from her coupleness, so she sells Sylv\u00e8re on the thrill of riding in Dick\u2019s magnificent vintage Thunderbird convertible. Sylv\u00e8re, who doesn\u2019t know a T-bird from a hummingbird and doesn\u2019t care, agrees, bemused. Done. Dick gives her copious, concerned directions. \u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d she interrupts, flashing hair and smiles, \u201cI\u2019ll tail you\u201d. And she does. Slightly buzzed and keeping the accelerator of her pickup truck steady, she\u2019s reminded of a performance she did called Car Chase at the St Mark\u2019s Poetry Project in New York when she was 23. She and her friend Liza Martin had tailed the steelily good-looking driver of a Porsche all the way through Connecticut on Highway 95. Finally he\u2019d pulled over to a rest stop, but when Liza and Chris got out he drove off. The performance ended with Liza accidentally-but-really stabbing Chris\u2019s hand onstage with a kitchen knife. Blood flowed, and everyone found Liza dazzlingly sexy and dangerous and beautiful. Liza, belly popping out of a fuzzy midriff top, fishnet legs tearing up against her green vinyl miniskirt as she rocked back to show her crotch, looked like the cheapest kind of whore. A star is born. No one at the show that night had found Chris\u2019s pale anemic looks and piercing gaze remotely endearing. Could anyone? It was a question that\u2019d temporarily been shelved. But now it was a whole new world. The request line on 92.3 The Beat was thumping, Post-Riot Los Angeles, a city strung on fiber-optic nerves. Dick\u2019s Thunderbird was always somewhere in her line of sight, the two vehicles strung invisibly together across the concrete riverbed of highway, like John Donne\u2019s eyeballs. And this time Chris was alone. More about I Love Dick I Love Dick is a joyful riposte to all those stories in which clever women fall victim to the pressures of convention \u2013 from The Yellow Wallpaper to The Bell Jar and beyond \u2013 and also to the countless books by men in which women are crushed by romantic encounters: from Madame Bovary to Anna Karenina to Laclos\u2019s epistolatory Les Liaisons Dangereuses and Andr\u00e9 Breton\u2019s autofiction, Nadja. Equally earnest and flip, ILD balances its narrator\u2019s yearning with the surprising empowerment the performance of her abjection brings. By giving the tragic heroine an absurd edge, Kraus is able to tackle some serious stuff. \u2013 Joanna WalshRead the full review.
