  "body": "Related: Five things we learned from the new Ghostbusters trailer    For a film to break records before its release is usually a good sign. But such records tend to be for advance ticket sales or most trailer views \u2013 they do not tend to register unusually high levels of online dissatisfaction. When the first look at footage from Paul Feig\u2019s female-fronted Ghostbusters reboot debuted in March, the reaction encompassed outrage not only that the beloved comedy was being remade, but that the lead characters\u2019 genders would be altered.  Since then, the hating has not abated, and the first trailer (a second one appeared to address the controversy around the film\u2019s perceived misogyny and racism) has now racked up more than half a million \u201cthumbs down\u201d votes on YouTube. This is not only more than any other trailer: it means the two-and-a-half minute ad earns a place on the streaming channel\u2019s list of the 100 least-liked pieces of content.             As the website Screencrush notes, the trailer\u2019s unusual ratio of views to dislikes suggests a concerted campaign to vote down the video.    Related: Who ya gonna call? Why Ghostbusters is leading the charge for female buddy movies    Feig initially called much of the negative reaction to the casting of four women in the leads \u201cvile misogynist shit\u201d, but speaking to the Guardian last week, the director played down the backlash.  \u201cThe haters on our trailer were very proud of the fact they had racked up 400,000 [currently 600,000] dislikes on YouTube versus 200,000 likes. But [given the number of views] that\u2019s not a majority by anybody standards. Some of it is that people don\u2019t want an old property touched \u2013 I\u2019m sympathetic to that. But the ones who are hating it because it\u2019s about women? That\u2019s just a non-starter.\u201d Feig pointed a finger at the media which amplify this negativity, and for funnelling \u201ca small minority of voices into a sort of bullhorn\u201d. \u201cIt makes me sad that [the negativity surround Ghostbusters] informs every article now,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s always some comment about how people are down on it. Well, somebody is down on everything. It\u2019s very easy once you\u2019re predisposed to be pissed about something, to watch it and find fault.\u201d",
