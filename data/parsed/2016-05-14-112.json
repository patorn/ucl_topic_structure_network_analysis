  "body": "Donald Trump was every bit the buyer ready to walk off the lot if he couldn\u2019t be shown a bargain.  \u201cDoes it have to be unified?\u201d he said last Sunday, musing aloud about the need for the Republican party to come together behind his candidacy for president. \u201cI\u2019m very different than everybody else, perhaps, that\u2019s ever run for office. I actually don\u2019t think so.\u201d Was the author of the Art of the Deal bluffing? It does not matter now, because in the last week Trump has gotten what he professed not necessarily to want: substantial party backing for his presidential candidacy.   Trump tracker   A series of meetings between Trump and congressional leaders in Washington on Thursday turned out to be a victory lap for the candidate. His success with House speaker Paul Ryan, previously billed as his most powerful adversary, was typical. Ryan went from being \u201cjust not ready\u201d to back Trump one week to \u201ctotally committed to working together\u201d the next. Or, in Trump\u2019s words on Twitter on Thursday afternoon: \u201cGreat day in DC with @SpeakerRyan and Republican leadership. Things working out really well!\u201d The Republican coalescence around Trump is indeed working out really well, for the candidate at least. By the Guardian\u2019s latest count, 45 of 54 Republican senators either support Trump wholeheartedly or have pledged to support the nominee. Only three senators have said they will not back Trump. Senator Susan Collins, a moderate from Maine, is one of six senators in a third category: wait-and-see. In a statement to the Guardian on Friday, she said she expects to support the Republican nominee, \u201cbut I do want to see what Donald Trump does from here on out\u201d, including whether he will dispense with \u201cgratuitous personal insults\u201d and \u201cclearly outline for us what his vision of America is beyond a slogan\u201d.  Collins said she would not make a decision until the national convention in July. In the House of Representatives, the break towards Trump has not been quite so clean. Some members clung to \u201c#NeverTrump\u201d sympathies even after his run on the Hill. Republican governors presiding over states where Trump\u2019s name is mud with moderates, such as Charlie Baker of Massachusetts, or with important constituencies, such as Susana Martinez of New Mexico, likewise have withheld their support. A significant opposition remains among the party\u2019s pass\u00e9 ruling class and current donor class. Both former presidents Bush have said they will sit out the 2016 campaign, as has former presidential candidate Jeb Bush. The 2012 nominee, Mitt Romney, said on Wednesday that Trump\u2019s refusal to release his tax returns was \u201cdisqualifying\u201d. Important mega-donors including Paul Singer and the brothers Koch have not visibly moved to back Trump. But many Republican senators who once expressed misgivings about Trump have set those feelings aside, as a rallying cry goes up to join forces in an attempt to defeat the likely Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.  In February, majority whip John Cornyn of Texas warned that Trump could be \u201can albatross around the down-ballot races\u201d. On Thursday, Cornyn tweeted a picture of himself standing next to Trump, who was poking a thumbs up.  \u201cGood, constructive meeting with senate leadership,\u201d wrote Cornyn. The rally around Trump goes beyond elected officials and into the party apparatus, from other major donors to red state celebrities, such as Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson.  It has also reached the National Republican Congressional Committee. Its chairman, Oregon representative Greg Walden, declared of Trump last December: \u201cThis is not what we\u2019re about as a party, and this is not what we\u2019re about as a country, and we cannot yield to this.\u201d On Thursday, Walden announced that he would be supporting Trump after all.  \u201cWhile I may disagree with the rhetoric Mr Trump uses and some policy positions, he is the better option than Hillary Clinton in the White House,\u201d Walden said in a statement. In February, Trump delivered a Sopranos-esque warning to the Ricketts family, billionaire Republican donors who had given millions to defeat Trump\u2019s candidacy. \u201cThey better be careful, they have a lot to hide!\u201d Trump tweeted.  Not a trace of that tension was visible last week, when family scion Pete Ricketts, the governor of Nebraska, appeared onstage with the candidate and conferred his endorsement. For many observers who only weeks ago saw a civil war ahead for the Republican party, the swing behind Trump has come quickly.  On Thursday, conservative analyst Ross Douthat wrote: \u201cA party whose leading factions often seemed incapable of budging from 1980s-era dogma suddenly caved completely.\u201d On Friday, former top Barack Obama strategist David Axelrod tweeted: \u201cThe Day After: seems as if @GOP establishment is measuring @realDonaldTrump as a moldable vessel. And he\u2019s eying them as pliable marks.\u201d \u2018It\u2019s just going to take a little bit longer\u2019 Timothy Hagle, a University of Iowa political science professor, told the Guardian that in the broader view, however, the party can be seen to have fallen behind the candidate at an \u201caverage\u201d pace. He pointed to the last Republican nominating competition, when widespread displeasure with Romney was palpable through the spring. \u201cThere was a concern that Romney was insufficiently conservative on a lot of issues,\u201d he said, \u201cthere was still a certain distrust that people even had from four years before, where he stood on abortion, the whole Romneycare thing.  \u201cSome of those arguments and concerns go much deeper this time, so I think on the part of some people, it\u2019s just going to take a little bit longer for them to come around.\u201d Notably taking his time is Senator Ted Cruz, Trump\u2019s main rival for the nomination until he withdrew last week.  \u201cThere\u2019s time for recriminations and, you know, everyone who was responsible for the rise of Donald Trump, they will bear that responsibility going forward,\u201d Cruz told a Texas talkshow host on Thursday. \u201cBut there were more than a few players that played a disproportionate role in that rise.\u201d Some elected officials sound as if they will never come around. Senators Ben Sasse and Dean Heller have said they oppose Trump, nominee or no. Holdouts in the House have been even more vocal, with Illinois representative Bob Dold among them. \u201cI said last year after Donald Trump disparaged the service of our nation\u2019s POWs \u2013 including my uncle \u2013 and then used countless offensive remarks against women, Latinos and Muslims, that I will not support his candidacy for president,\u201d Dold told the Guardian in a statement. But pliability on the Trump question has been the rule, not the exception. In February, after Trump attacked former president George W Bush, pointing out that the 9/11 attacks happened on his watch and suggesting that Bush wanted a war with Iraq and lied to make one, New York representative Peter King said Trump was \u201cnot fit to be president \u2013 morally or intellectually\u201d. On Thursday, King endorsed Trump.  \u201cI stand by all those things I said,\u201d King told Newsday. \u201cI said all along I would support the nominee of the party. I do endorse him and I\u2019ll vote for him, but I don\u2019t intend to be campaigning for him.\u201d Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican who has been one of Trump\u2019s sharpest critics this election cycle \u2013 \u201cDonald is like being shot in the head,\u201d he said in March \u2013 stopped short on Thursday of saying that he was supporting the nominee. But the senator found his first nice words to say about Trump, saying the two held a \u201ccordial, pleasant phone conversation\u201d on Wednesday. \u201cI congratulated him on winning the Republican nomination for president,\u201d Graham said, in a statement. \u201cI know Mr Trump is reaching out to many people, throughout the party and the country, to solicit their advice and opinions.  \u201cI believe this is a wise move on his part.\u201d",
