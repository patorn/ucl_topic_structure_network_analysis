The former mayor of London\u2019s limerick, published by the Spectator as a rebuff to Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan\u2019s efforts to prosecute a German comedian\u2019s offensive poem, also calls the president a \u201cwankerer\u201d. Johnson, a former editor of the magazine, won the Spectator\u2019s \u201cPresident Erdo\u011fan offensive poetry competition\u201d, despite judge Douglas Murray saying the contest had received thousands of entries. The prize money has been donated by a reader.    Related: Turkey asks Germany to prosecute comedian over Erdo\u011fan poem    The limerick was written off-the-cuff by the Conservative MP during an interview with the Swiss weekly magazine Die Weltwoche.  Johnson \u2013 whose great-grandfather was Turkish \u2013 called it \u201ca scandal\u201d that a German court had granted an injunction to prevent comedian Jan B\u00f6hmermann repeating his offensive skit about the Turkish president. \u201cIf somebody wants to make a joke about the love that flowers between the Turkish president and a goat, he should be able to do so, in any European country, including Turkey,\u201d Johnson told interviewer Nicholas Farrell, who then challenged him to enter the Spectator\u2019s poetry prize. Johnson then offered the limerick: \u201cThere was a young fellow from Ankara, Who was a terrific wankerer.  \u201cTill he sowed his wild oats, With the help of a goat, But he didn\u2019t even stop to thankera.\u201d The former mayor is reported to be surprised that his efforts were officially entered into the competition.  In awarding Johnson the prize, Murray appeared to contradict his own rule that \u201cwankerer\u201d was not a word, despite rhyming with the Turkish capital, but defended his choice in a blogpost, saying the prize was \u201centirely anti-meritocratic\u201d.     Can I remind entrants that you cannot just make up words. 'Wankerer' does indeed rhyme with Turkey's capital. But it is not a word.\u2014 Douglas Murray (@DouglasKMurray) April 19, 2016    \u201cCertainly there were better poems,\u201d he wrote on the Spectator website. \u201cFor sure there were filthier ones \u2026 For myself, I think it a wonderful thing that a British political leader has shown that Britain will not bow before the putative caliph in Ankara.  \u201cErdo\u011fan may imprison his opponents in Turkey. Chancellor Merkel may imprison Erdo\u011fan\u2019s critics in Germany. But in Britain we still live and breathe free. We need no foreign potentate to tell us what we may think or say. And we need no judge, especially no German judge, to instruct us over what we may find funny.\u201d Murray said he would encourage Johnson to donate the \u00a31,000 prize money to a relevant charity.  On Tuesday, a Hamburg court issued a preliminary injunction banning republication of sections of a satirical poem by B\u00f6hmermann, saying they amounted to libel of Erdo\u011fan. The poem, which was first recited on German TV, used coarse language to describe the president. Erdo\u011fan filed two complaints, one with German prosecutors and an application for an injunction to stop the republication of the poem.  Merkel has previously also granted permission for prosecutors to investigate. Under Germany\u2019s criminal code, insults against foreign leaders are not banned but the government can decide whether to authorise prosecutors to proceed.  An MP from Merkel\u2019s conservative party read the poem out in parliament last week, amid widespread criticism of the chancellor\u2019s decision to allow the prosecution to go ahead.  Prosecutors in the western German city of Mainz who are dealing with the B\u00f6hmermann case said it was unclear on Tuesday when a decision would be made to pursue prosecution. At the time Merkel said she would allow prosecutors to investigate, Johnson said she had \u201cnumbly decided to kowtow to the demands of Erdo\u011fan, a man who is engaged in a chilling suppression of Turkish freedom of expression\u201d.",
