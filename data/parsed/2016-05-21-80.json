At Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s Vicente Calder\u00f3n stadium they were getting ready for the Copa del Rey final between the recently crowned league champions and the even more recently crowned Europa League champions; at Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s Cerro del Espino training ground, they were getting ready for the Champions League final against Real. Saturday morning aerobics with Oscar \u201cEl Profe\u201d Ortega, Diego Simeone\u2019s relentless fitness coach, followed by a full rehearsal on pitch one. In red: Oblak; Juanfran, God\u00edn, Gim\u00e9nez, Filipe Lu\u00eds; Sa\u00fal, Augusto, Gabi, Koke; Torres, Griezmann. Against them, nine Atl\u00e9tico first-teamers plus two kids from the youth team, in white bibs and a 4-3-3 formation, with Yannick Carrasco as Cristiano Ronaldo, Luciano Vietto playing Karim Benzema and Angel Correa in Gareth Bale\u2019s role. Final score? 0-0. Not even a dodgy penalty, blown by Simeone in his role as referee, could produce a winner: Antoine Griezmann shot wide. Another clean sheet, then, at the end of a season in which Atl\u00e9tico have kept 34 of them. \u201cThat will be important in Milan because then you only need to score one,\u201d the goalkeeper Jan Oblak said. \u201cWe\u2019re very happy with the record, but the final is another game.\u201d \u201cThe game of our lives,\u201d Fernando Torres calls it, and Torres is a World Cup winner whose strike in the Euro 2008 final clinched Spain\u2019s first triumph in 44 years. \u201cYou never know how many finals you\u2019ll get; you have to play each as if it was your last,\u201d Koke added. It may yet be their last, but it is not their first, of course. Two years on, Madrid\u2019s biggest clubs \u2013 the only two left in Spain\u2019s first division after relegation for Getafe and Rayo Vallecano \u2013 meet again in the European Cup final in Milan next Saturday. In Lisbon, Atl\u00e9tico were seconds from victory only for Sergio Ramos\u2019s header to change everything with the scoreboard showing 1-0 and 92.48. Diego God\u00edn had scored Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s opener that night, agonisingly close to being eternal, but asked if this was about revenge, he insisted: \u201cNo. We don\u2019t see this as revenge; we see it as a new opportunity.\u201d \u201cWhat happened, happened,\u201d Koke said. It is inevitable that Lisbon is on their minds, but there appears to be a collective effort to look beyond that now. Publicly, at least. No revenge, no fatalism. Privately, it is a different matter: this has been their obsession since then. But, asked how the scar of Lisbon was, whether it had healed, Simeone replied simply: \u201cVery good.\u201d Koke added: \u201cTwo years have passed; some things have changed, some stay the same. It\u2019s different now.\u201d There have been changes, and not just the stage upon which this will be set, Simeone describing San Siro as \u201cpure football\u201d. Some have even suggested that Atl\u00e9tico are favourites, too, but you will not catch them saying that. \u201cIt\u2019s just one game and the fact that we beat Bayern and Barcelona doesn\u2019t mean that we are going to win this,\u201d Griezmann said. \u201cFifty-fifty,\u201d Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s players repeated, one after the other. Simeone, too. Simeone is still there, of course, the man who transformed this club for ever, but Madrid\u2019s manager has changed: from Carlo Ancelotti to Rafa Ben\u00edtez to Zinedine Zidane. Players have changed too. Three of Real Madrid\u2019s starters have gone: F\u00e1bio Coentr\u00e3o, \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda and Sami Khedira, who replaced the then-suspended and now departed Xabi Alonso. The turnover at Atl\u00e9tico has been even more significant: Thibaut Courtois, Jo\u00e3o Miranda, Ra\u00fal Garc\u00eda, Diego Costa and David Villa, all starters that night, have gone. Filipe Lu\u00eds left too, although he is back again. Out on pitch one, he bombed up and down the left through the white box marking the pressure points on the turf. The replacements have been good ones. Oblak, who watched that final on television, has been outstanding and Simeone described Griezmann as one of the best three players in the world. \u201cThat\u2019s nice, isn\u2019t it?\u201d the Frenchman grinned.   Related: Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s Antoine Griezmann sends Barcelona crashing out    The buildup has been different too: longer and quieter. So far, at least. \u201cLast time we came from a having won the league at the Camp Nou,\u201d Simeone said. There was a league title, a bus parade, celebrations, and injured players back then; this time they have a fortnight to\u00a0prepare. \u201cWe\u2019ve had more time. It\u2019s not an excuse but we had played a \u2018final\u2019 against Barcelona and physically and mentally that\u2019s tiring,\u201d Koke said. God\u00edn agreed. \u201cWe\u2019re better physically,\u201d he said. They both are. That night, Pepe missed out through injury while Benzema and Ronaldo were struggling. For Atl\u00e9tico, there was no Arda Turan and Costa was withdrawn early, broken again, while others were running on empty; the Camp Nou had cost them. There has been a slight shift in styles, too, God\u00edn talking about Atl\u00e9tico as a team seeking \u201cnew variations\u201d, while Simeone spoke about a side that is constantly \u201creinventing itself\u201d, about \u201crenewal\u201d. \u201cDefend well\u201d might have been the first thing that Koke highlighted as vital at San Siro but the idea that this is all they do is facile and flawed. The idea that Real always attack is, too \u2013 and it was striking that Simeone and his players expect their opponents to wait for them. \u201cI anticipate them playing like they did against Manchester City,\u201d Simeone said. \u201cCasemiro gives them defensive strength and in the Champions League they have played on the break in almost every game. They have used that to get space; tactically, I think they\u2019ve been very good.\u201d The midfielder Augusto Fern\u00e1ndez described Madrid as \u201cvery strong, direct\u201d, noting: \u201cThe more space they have the better it is for them.\u201d Atl\u00e9tico will try to deny them that. \u201cThat\u2019s the way they\u2019ve played in this Champions League,\u201d God\u00edn said. \u201cAnd we must not allow space for the Madrid forwards. In close games like this, a game that I expect to be tactical, hard, set plays could be the difference between winning or losing. But then lots of things can happen that you don\u2019t expect. Football isn\u2019t always logical.\u201d If it wasn\u2019t, perhaps they would not be here, but the revolution rolls on. And here Atl\u00e9tico are again, for the second time in three seasons, only the third time ever. So far, little over a minute has cost them two European titles, late equalisers ending their challenges after 120 minutes in Brussels 1974 and 92 minutes in Lisbon 2014. In Milan, they must avoid that same fate. Repeating that does not bear thinking about, so they are trying not to. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking about the moment we\u2019re in now; we all dream of playing in another final,\u201d God\u00edn said. \u201cWe\u2019re excited and we\u2019re going into this final with the confidence and humility we always have, knowing that this is a lovely chance to write a great page in Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s history.\u201d",
