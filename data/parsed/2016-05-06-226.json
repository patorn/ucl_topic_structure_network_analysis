  "body": "I am 26 and I came out as gay at the end of last year. I am from a religious background and I feel stuck between two realms and I can\u2019t find the appropriate balance. Seeking a lasting loving relationship for a 26-year-old virgin is not as easy as I thought. With so much preference for everyone to be physical in gay culture, I feel disappointed and even more alone in a foreign country. Dating websites only add to my sorrow and despair. From the religion side, it seems everyone hates me for who I love. I feel I can\u2019t even go back nor move forward, since it seems I am not worth loving, even though I am a talented, loving, caring individual. If someone could see beyond the appearance, they would be see my inner beauty, but no one bothers. \u2022 When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help, and may well view your comments here.
