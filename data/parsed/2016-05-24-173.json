Related: Halloween shocked back into life and Money Monster reviewed - the Dailies film podcast    The film-maker and composer will executive produce the 10th sequel to 1978\u2019s Halloween, which introduced mask-wearing bogeyman Michael Myers and the young Jamie Lee Curtis as original scream queen Laurie Strode. \u201cThirty-eight years after the original Halloween, I\u2019m going to help to try to make the 10th sequel the scariest of them all,\u201d said Carpenter, 68.  The new, as-yet-untitled film is being co-produced by Malek Akkad, son of the late Syrian American film-maker Moustapha Akkad, who oversaw the success of the first movie and several of its sequels. Jason Blum of Blumhouse Productions is on board as a second co-producer. Producers will now work with production company Miramax to find a director for the 11th Halloween movie, previous instalments having taken more than $400m worldwide. It will be the first new film in the series since 2009\u2019s critically scorned Rob Zombie-directed effort Halloween II, a sequel to the director\u2019s 2007 remake of the original Halloween.",
