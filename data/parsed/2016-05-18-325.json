  "body": "A blond woman in a high-rise apartment removes a\u00a0bright yellow canary from a cage, opens the window and sets it free. In the voiceover \u2013 and subtitles \u2013 the woman is on the phone telling her mother she\u2019s going away on a lovely sailing trip. But really, she\u2019s going to jail. Welcome to Locked Up, Channel 4\u2019s new Spanish prison drama. If the thing with the canary and the cage was too subtle for you, it transpires that the uniforms at Cruz del Sur correctional facility are also bright yellow. Yellow, it seems, is the new orange. It would be fair to say that Locked Up (in Spain it\u2019s called Vis a Vis) owes a debt to Orange Is the New Black, although women-in-prison melodrama counts as a whole genre, with its own narrative tropes. Where OITNB is darkly comic, this is largely straightfaced, and unafraid to embrace the gratuitous toplessness that has long been a mainstay cliche of women-in-prison films. Unless there\u2019s a good reason a conversation can\u2019t take place in the showers, it does. Macarena (Maggie Civantos) is evidently unprepared for the rigours of prison; she has packed an elastic exercise band, and royal jelly. She insists she is there by mistake. Within 48 hours of her arriving, her bunkmate is found murdered \u2013 steamed alive, in fact. She still doesn\u2019t know the good guys from the bad guys among the guards. I\u2019m not sure there are any good guys. There are flashbacks to Macarena\u2019s pampered former life \u2013 it\u2019s pretty obvious her boss/boyfriend has contributed to her incarceration \u2013 which fall a little flat. Once you\u2019ve set a story in a prison, everything that happens outside begins to seem incidental. I think that might be true of actual prison as well. Locked Up looks great, with most scenes drained of every colour except that acid yellow \u2013 the uniforms almost glow. And it is both gripping and gritty, although by far the most menacing thing about it is that it\u2019s in Spanish. The swearing sounds much worse than the words that appear in the subtitles. The sense of alienation is only heightened by Locked Up\u2019s foreignness: the violence; the casual wear the guards walk around in; the idea that your cellmate might keep a pet scorpion. I have no idea which bits are realistic and which bits are preposterous, so I just believe it all. When the TV series Zoo Quest began with a trip to Sierra Leone, David Attenborough and his cameraman, Charles Lagus, filmed everything they encountered on a 16mm clockwork camera \u2013 14 seconds of filming for each wind; two minutes, 40 seconds for each 100ft roll of film. To overcome the BBC\u2019s objection to using 16mm instead of the standard 35mm format, Attenborough agreed to\u00a0shoot on colour film, which would give more clarity even when the footage was printed and broadcast in black and white. Those original negatives were recently found in the archives of the BBC natural history unit. David Attenborough\u2019s Zoo Quest\u00a0in Colour (BBC4) is the extraordinary result.     David Attenborough\u2019s Zoo Quest in Colour. Photograph: BBC/PA    The sheer quality of the footage is hard to believe: birds with bright plumage, richly patterned snakes, Balinese musicians in seated rows. The present-day Attenborough and Lagus are on hand to give the scenes some context, and to recall hardships and privations with great affection. Colour brings to the past a kind of shocking immediacy. One is reminded that this venerable wildlife series wasn\u2019t just a mission to film wild animals; they were also kidnapping them on behalf of London zoo. There is some amusing footage of a twentysomething Attenborough chasing an anteater, and then turning tail once the anteater decides to front it out (they lassoed it in the end \u2013 off to the zoo). Today, Attenborough is rightly embarrassed by this wholesale animal shopping, but not only did the programme take me back to a time when you could bring a bear home from Borneo and keep it in your flat, it\u00a0also made me long for it a little. Peggy Mitchell took her leave from EastEnders (BBC1) last night, and from this mortal coil, swallowing the pills she had kept by, one by one. Sometimes, I think dying is the only sure way to leave EastEnders: last night\u2019s episode was brimming with former escapees: Sharon, Kath, Phil \u2013 even Grant dropped by, angry as ever. Actually death isn\u2019t always enough. Pat Butcher died in 2012, and here she was, smoking on Peggy\u2019s stairs. \u201cI\u00a0might\u2019ve known it was you,\u201d said Peggy. \u201cEarrings rattling like Marley\u2019s bleeding chains.\u201d Peggy faced a\u00a0dilemma: die or face having Grant and\u00a0Phil as carers. \u201cIt\u2019s our turn to look after you now,\u201d said Grant, making it sound like a threat. The ghost of Christmas Pat didn\u2019t have much in the way of advice. \u201cWhat are you askin\u2019 me for?\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not even here, am I?\u201d I am sad to see Peggy go, even though she left a long time ago, and only came back to seal the deal.",
