  "body": "Nigel Farage has had a furious row in a live debate with Peter Mandelson, after he claimed that New Labour had encouraged immigration to \u201crub our noses in diversity\u201d. In a discussion about the EU referendum held by the Daily Mirror, Farage said New Labour wanted higher immigration as a deliberate policy to change the makeup of Britain. \u201cYou wanted to rub our noses in diversity didn\u2019t you, Lord Mandelson,\u201d he said. In angry riposte, Mandelson said the Ukip leader should not have said that when \u201csitting next to a black person\u201d, and demanded he apologise to Dreda Say Mitchell \u2013 a panellist on the same side as Farage, in favour of leaving the EU. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t we have people of different ethnic backgrounds, different colours?\u201d the Labour peer shouted at the Ukip leader. Mitchell, an author and broadcaster, agreed with Mandelson that Farage should not have made the remarks, asking how he could possibly say that sitting next to her. \u201cYou\u2019ve shown your true colours and you owe her an apology,\u201d Mandelson added.   Related: EU referendum: Boris Johnson accuses PM of 'collusion' with top business chiefs    Farage hit back, claiming: \u201cI quoted you from 1998\u201d, apparently in reference to a remark by former Labour adviser Andrew Neather, saying in 2009 that higher immigration was designed to \u201crub the right\u2019s nose in diversity\u201d.  But Mandelson replied: \u201cI never said any such thing \u2013 as you well know. So don\u2019t make it up as you go along.\u201d  Farage then retorted: \u201cThe point is Labour tried this as a deliberate policy and it\u2019s hurt working people.\u201d Mitchell also objected to another fellow panellist\u2019s language when Andrea Leadsom, a Conservative energy minister, said public services had been \u201coverwhelmed\u201d by immigration. The minister had said: \u201cHere we are overwhelmed with uncontrollable migration from the European Union. The point is we don\u2019t have the people we want to have. We have a skills shortage.\u201d She said migrants are \u201cpushing down the pay for workers at the lower end\u201d because we have to take EU workers over those from India or China. \u201cThis is us being Little Europeans. It\u2019s not us being globalist at all. This out-of-control immigration has to stop\u201d. However, Mitchell said that was too reminiscent of the way migrants used to be talked about in the past. Leadsom later clarified that she did not mean to cause any offence, saying: \u201cThere\u2019s not a racist bone in my body.\u201d John McDonnell, the Labour shadow chancellor, speaking for the remain side, gave an impassioned speech standing up for migrants. \u201cDo not blame migrants for the cuts you are making in education and health. Because many of those migrants are staffing those public services,\u201d he said. He quoted HMRC figures that showed migrants paid in \u00a33bn but took just \u00a30.5bn in tax credits and child benefit. \u201cOur economy has always been dependent on migrant labour but we export labour as well,\u201d he says.  \u201cI remember in the 1980s when work was short here and people went abroad to find work.\u201d",
