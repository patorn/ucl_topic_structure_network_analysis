Something new, something different, possibly even something that takes a bit of effort to track down. Well, this week, that something is Indian wine.     Soul Tree Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve 2013. Serve with lamb rogan josh.    If you didn\u2019t know they made wine in India, you\u2019re forgiven \u2013 given the climate, it\u2019s by no means obvious. But there are cooler regions, and in some they have three harvests a year. According to Peter Csizmadia-Honigh\u2019s fascinating new book, The Wines Of India: A Concise Guide (which it isn\u2019t, given that it runs to 452 pages), the best areas to look out for are Nashik, Pune and Karnataka. At the tasting that accompanied the book launch, and to my surprise, I was most impressed by the reds, which were typically full-bodied bordeaux and cabernet shiraz blends. My favourite was the very cool-looking Myra Vineyards\u2019 Misfit 2013, a really gorgeous blend of cabernet and shiraz from Karnataka state; it\u2019s available in tiny quantities from next month from Premia Wines. More widely available are Soul Tree\u2019s full, ripe, oak-aged Shiraz-Cabernet Sauvignon Reserve 2013 (\u00a310.95 Kensington Wine Warehouse in Bath, \u00a310.99 from Soul Tree Wine; 14% abv) and the rich, velvety Grover Zampa La R\u00e9serve 2013 (14% abv), a similar blend that you could easily imagine coming from Chile or Argentina (the consultant is the world renowned Michel Rolland). Rodney Fletcher Vintners has the 2012 vintage for \u00a311.40, while Amazon has it at \u00a334.87 for three bottles. It would be fun to serve all three wines blind to a guest who fancies themself as a bit of a wine buff. When it comes to whites, India\u2019s winemakers seem curiously fixated on sauvignon blanc, rather than on the more aromatic varieties you might expect. On the whole, I wasn\u2019t wild about those I tried at Csizmadia-Honigh\u2019s tasting. Sula\u2019s Sauvignon Blanc, also available in Marks & Spencer under the Jewel Of Nasik label (\u00a37; 13% abv), was the best of the bunch, but I much prefer Sula\u2019s nicely rounded Dindoori Reserve Viognier 2015 (14% abv) \u2013 that would go very well with a korma. Corking Wines of York has it at \u00a310 a bottle (or \u00a359.94 for six). If this all seems too much effort for a Friday night takeaway, take a lead from the styles the Indians are making and source a wine from elsewhere: cabernet shiraz from Australia and carm\u00e9n\u00e8re from Chile, say, both tick that big, ripe, red box. matchingfoodandwine.com",
