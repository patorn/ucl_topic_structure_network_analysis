  "body": "Even Nathan Hughes sometimes wonders which direction his life would have taken had he not found rugby, almost by accident, at the age of 16. He reckons he would still be hanging out in Lautoka in Fiji, maybe playing some hockey or just watching the world go by. \u201cI\u2019d probably still be back there kicking it around back in the neighbourhood,\u201d he says, looking momentarily wistful. \u201cI do look back and think: \u2018What would I be doing if I wasn\u2019t playing rugby?\u2019\u201d Hughes is 24 now but the story of his past eight years would have been rejected by Boy\u2019s Own magazine as overly fanciful. On Saturday he runs out for Wasps against Exeter Chiefs in the Premiership semi-finals knowing that, win or lose, Twickenham is beckoning. At the end of next month he qualifies for England on residency grounds; the Pacific island conveyor belt that has already supplied the Vunipola brothers and Manu Tuilagi is set to deliver once more. It is not impossible that the quartet, plus the Worcester-bound Ben Te\u2019o and Bath\u2019s Semesa Rokoduguni, will all wear the red rose against Fiji this autumn, a scenario almost as improbable a decade ago as Exeter reaching a Premiership final. When Hughes, a marauding back-row force of nature, is fully fit and firing no international coach could possibly ignore him. Which makes the story of his introduction to rugby at St Thomas High School in Lautoka \u2013 surrounded by cane fields and known as Sugar City \u2013 all the more serendipitous. Hughes\u2019s parents were hockey players \u2013 his father, William, is a diesel mechanic who played national hockey \u2013 and their gangly son had never played a 15-a-side game before 2008. \u201cWe were short of a lock against a touring school team from Auckland and the coach asked me if I wanted to play,\u201d says Hughes, the memory still fresh. \u201cI said: \u2018Yeah, but I don\u2019t know the rules.\u2019 He said: \u2018Don\u2019t worry, just catch the ball and run it straight. And if you see someone with the ball tackle him.\u2019 That\u2019s basically what I did. Then, after we\u2019d won the game, they offered me a scholarship to go to New Zealand.\u201d The Kiwi school concerned was Kelston Boys\u2019 High \u2013 Sir Graham Henry was once its headmaster \u2013 and Hughes swiftly ditched his hockey. \u201cI got banned from playing in school in New Zealand because I tended to do rugby tackles in hockey as well.\u201d Instead, he graduated to Auckland\u2019s junior sides and, in 2013, was awaiting an offer of a Super Rugby contract from the Blues. It never came, prompting him to give Europe a shot. \u201cI thought I\u2019d give it two years and then come back,\u201d he says, chuckling. \u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about Wasps. I didn\u2019t even know who Lawrence Dallaglio was.\u201d     Hughes on the charge for Wasps against Exeter earlier this month. The two sides meet again in the Premiership semi-finals on Saturday. Photograph: David Rogers/Getty Images    Soon enough the little-known new arrival also encountered the fierce debate surrounding World Rugby\u2019s paltry three-year eligibility period. The board\u2019s newly elected vice-chairman Agustin Pichot believes it should be five years or more, making Hughes potentially among the last hemisphere hoppers under the old criteria. He knows the questions will keep coming, not least when he returns home to visit family in Lautoka and the Waikato next month. His explanation is gloriously honest. \u201cEveryone\u2019s going to put their two cents in and ask: \u2018Why are you doing this?\u2019 But it\u2019s what I do for a living. It\u2019s what I do to put food on the table for the family. If the opportunity comes to play for England I\u2019ll take it. I\u2019d be a bit gutted if it goes to five years, but I don\u2019t make the rules.\u201d He says he has had nothing but support from those he aspires to play alongside. \u201cThey keep asking me: \u2018When are you going to come and join us?\u2019 They\u2019re not saying: \u2018Go and play for your own country.\u2019 It makes you feel like you\u2019d be welcomed.\u201d   Related: Exeter can drive Wasps to distraction again in Premiership semi-final | Dean Ryan    The personable Hughes, who loves strumming a guitar and playing golf, makes another interesting point, suggesting it might even be selfish for him to commit to Fiji now. \u201cIt will give opportunities for others back in Fiji to play for their country and maybe get an overseas contract themselves.\u201d The issue of eligibility is seldom black and white and the 125kg, 6ft 5in tall Hughes is increasingly a globe-trotting citizen of the world, married to a Dutch wife, Ella, and the proud father of a young son, Johannes. He already has Eddie Jones\u2019s full attention and while he remains ineligible for next month\u2019s Australia tour, the prospect of him joining forces with Vunipola is scary. Hughes acknowledges the big Saracen is his toughest opponent. \u201cI tackled him in the European semi-final and, after I\u2019d got back up, I said to one of the guys: \u2018Wow he\u2019s a heavy boy, he\u2019s a hard man to take down.\u2019\u201d He will also have to batter past Exeter\u2019s Dave Ewers and his club captain, James Haskell, for a Test starting role, with opponents now seeking to minimise the ball-carrying havoc he wreaks. \u201cTeams are starting to read the way we attack. When I\u2019m on the ball I tend to have three to four people on me trying to tackle me.\u201d It has merely intensified his desire to improve and give his parents even more to be proud of. \u201cYou can tell they\u2019re very proud but they don\u2019t want to say it too much because that gives you a big head. My mum and dad haven\u2019t seen me play here yet. That\u2019s one of my goals: I want to bring them over to see what I do.\u201d Saturday will require he and Wasps perform rather better than they did in Devon three weeks ago. \u201cWe didn\u2019t turn up,\u201d says Hughes. \u201cThere was a bit of fatigue and a lot of tired legs. \u201cWe\u2019ll go down to Sandy Park ready this time. You work very hard all year to get to this stage and you don\u2019t want to fall short ... you want to keep going.\u201d All the way to a senior England cap? \u201cWhen that day comes and they want to pick me it\u2019ll be very exciting. I\u2019ve got to take the chance with both hands.\u201d Life is about to get sweeter still for the boy from Sugar City.",
