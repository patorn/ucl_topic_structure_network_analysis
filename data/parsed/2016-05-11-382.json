  "body": "Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign has been told it cannot remove a prominent white nationalist from the official list of delegates to the Republican national convention. In an afternoon of chaotic back-and-forth, the campaign first flatly denied the inclusion on its list of William Daniel Johnson, a Los Angeles-based corporate lawyer who once called for a constitutional amendment which would revoke citizenship from all non-white Americans. The campaign then blamed a \u201cdatabase error\u201d. Johnson cast doubt on the campaign\u2019s initial claim directly. \u201cI will confirm that I am a delegate, but I won\u2019t speak more than that because they don\u2019t want me to,\u201d he said, referring to the Trump campaign.  Later, he told the Guardian that Trump\u2019s California director, Tim Clark, had emailed him saying his acceptance as a delegate had been a mistake. In response, Johnson offered his resignation to the campaign. He told the Guardian sadly: \u201cThey made a mistake. They removed me, and that\u2019s fine.\u201d However, Sam Mahood, press officer for the California secretary of state, said that the campaign had attempted to send a revised delegate list on Tuesday, the day that news broke about Johnson\u2019s inclusion, but that because it was after the deadline the first list they sent must stand, and Johnson was a certified delegate for the campaign.

The media outlet Mother Jones initially reported Johnson\u2019s inclusion on the official list of Trump\u2019s California delegates to July\u2019s convention, alongside others including the Republican house majority leader, Kevin McCarthy, and the billionaire founder of PayPal, Peter Thiel.  When contacted by the Guardian about the report, Trump\u2019s campaign spokeswoman, Hope Hicks, offered an unequivocal denial but did not initially explain why Johnson was on the list of California delegates.  \u201cThis report is totally false,\u201d Hicks said. \u201cHe has not, nor will he be, selected as a delegate.\u201d She and state director Clark later emailed reporters with an explanation. \u201cYesterday the Trump campaign submitted its list of California delegates to be certified by the Secretary of State of California. A database error led to the inclusion of a potential delegate that had been rejected and removed from the campaign\u2019s list in February 2016.\u201d In a further email to reporters, Clark said: \u201cUpon careful review of computer records, the inclusion of a potential delegate that had previously been rejected and removed from the campaign\u2019s list in February 2016, was discovered. This was immediately corrected and a final list, which does not include this individual, was submitted for certification.\u201d According to the Mother Jones report, Johnson said that in his application to be a delegate for Trump he disclosed details about his background and activism, but did not specifically use the term \u201cwhite nationalist\u201d. \u201cI just hope to show how I can be mainstream and have these views,\u201d Johnson told the publication. \u201cI can be a white nationalist and be a strong supporter of Donald Trump and be a good example to everybody.\u201d Any suggestion Trump was willing to be connected to a white nationalist could damage his campaign, which has been plagued with complaints of racism. In February, the billionaire candidate was criticized for initially failing to disavow David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader who had urged sympathizers to vote for Trump. In 1985, Johnson proposed an amendment to the constitution that would repeal the 14th amendment (citizenship for all those born in the US) and the 15th (which granted African American men the right to vote) and force the deportation of all non-white citizens. According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, Johnson\u2019s amendment sought the deportation of all those with any \u201cascertainable trace of Negro blood\u201d and all those more than one-eighth \u201cMongolian, Asian, Asia Minor, Middle Eastern, Semitic, Near Eastern, American Indian, Malay or other non-European or non-white blood\u201d. He believed it imperative that his amendment be enacted in order to avoid a \u201crace war\u201d. Johnson, who works as a corporate lawyer in southern California, is also chairman of the American Freedom party, whose platform states that \u201cWhite Americans should select a party that advocates for issues and concerns affecting European Americans\u201d, and goes on to describe itself as \u201ca Nationalist party that shares the customs and heritage of the European American people\u201d.",
