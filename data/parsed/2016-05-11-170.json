  "body": "With his launch of the BBC white paper looming on Thursday, one might think John Whittingdale might have weighty broadcasting matters on his mind. But the culture secretary \u2013 who is currently also pondering options for Channel 4\u2019s future \u2013 still found time in his busy schedule to give a keynote speech at the Business of Sport conference in London on Wednesday morning.  So just what could have persuaded the minister to make room in his diary to speak at the \u00a31,295 + VAT per ticket event?     The Rt Hon John Whittingdale OBE MP explaining why the #TelegraphBOS is important for the evolving sporting industry pic.twitter.com/mBptbSYFG3\u2014 TelegraphB2BEvents (@TelB2BEvents) May 11, 2016      Culture Secretary @JWhittingdale is about to deliver a speech on the power of sport and its contribution to the economy #TelegraphBOS\u2014 DCMS (@DCMS) May 11, 2016    Perhaps it had something to do with the organisers? The conference is run by the Telegraph, one of the papers that has led the charge in publishing leaked government plans for the BBC white paper.  In a strange twist, the event comes almost exactly a year after the Tory-supporting newspaper heralded the appointment of the seemingly amiable Whittingdale by calling it a \u201cdeclaration of war\u201d against the BBC.  Whittingdale would have denied such views \u2013 but the Telegraph\u2019s front page on Wednesday will be handy in boosting his credentials as a BBC basher with Tory rightwingers. In any case, the minister seems more than eager to play ball.     The Daily Telegraph\u2019s front-page story on John Whittingdale\u2019s BBC white paper",
