  "body": "\u2022 A strange future is sketched by a Secrets of My Success piece in the London Evening Standard by Johnny Hornby \u2013 founder of The & Partnership, a marketing group 49% owned by Martin Sorrell\u2019s WPP \u2013 who after bluntly setting out his domestic priorities (\u201cI have five children and five horses, and the horses are slightly more important than the children\u201d) addresses the crucial issue of his status as one of the leading contenders to succeed the spry but senior Sorrell: \u201cthat\u2019s a race that won\u2019t happen,\u201d the former Labour party election adman firmly insists, \u201cand if it does, it probably won\u2019t be for another 15 years\u201d. So he envisages Sorrell stepping down, if at all, in 2031 when he\u2019s 86, a year older than Rupert Murdoch is now; by which time, Monkey very roughly estimates (extrapolating from recent increases), the miniature marketing colossus\u2019s total annual pay package should be around \u00a3285m. \u2022 How many lesbians have been killed on screen in primetime shows this year? Monkey can tell you it\u2019s 12. Not many, you might think, but with only 35 lesbian characters on peaktime shows in the UK and US last year that\u2019s quite a high number. Monkey knows this because former Channel 4 commissioner Jacqui Lawrence reveals the statistic in her pitch to crowdfund \u00a350,000 on Indiegogo to get a screen adaptation of her novel Different For Girls into production. A number of actors have confirmed or expressed interest in being in it including Rachel Shelley from Grantchester and The L Word, Blue Peter and Doctor Who star Janet Ellis, Death in Paradise\u2019s Nimmy March and Emmerdale\u2019s Charlie Hardwick. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to be glib about this but in reality the constant \u2018disposal\u2019 of lesbian characters has an acute impact on younger viewers who are struggling with their sexuality. Television is literally getting away with murder,\u201d says Lawrence. \u201cDifferent for Girls is here to save the fate of fictional lesbians. You can rest assured that no lesbian will be killed or harmed during its making.\u201d Not unless one of them dies due to different kinds of L Words, she says, namely, \u201ctoo much love, lust and laughter\u201d. \u2022 Today\u2019s newspaper editors tend to do their utmost to keep their private lives private, so it was a turn up for the books last week when City AM supremo Christian May  informed his Twitter followers  that \u201cif you see a shiny ring on @ElizaFilby\u2019s hand on @SkyNews later, it\u2019s because she\u2019s agreed to marry me\u201d. Politics looks to be a key thing the couple have in common - indeed Maggie Thatcher could be seen as their spiritual matchmaker \u2013 as Dr Filby is an academic and the author of God and Mrs Thatcher, while the PR man-turned-editor is associated with Thatcher-ish anti-state, pro-business views. \u2022 How did a maths don come to wake up last week to find a vast picture of herself (\u201cthe queen of the anoraks\u201d) on the front page of the Daily Telegraph, a space normally reserved for female royals and celebrities? Dr Hannah Fry, who also does some broadcasting (but mostly on radio), ostensibly owed her splash status to her involvement in BBC4\u2019s Trainspotting: Live; but this was an unsatisfactory explanation because (a) she will only provide expert back-up to frontman Peter Snow, (b) the show is not imminent but scheduled for some unspecified point in the future, and (c) the Telegraph seemed sheepish itself about its flimsy pretext for the pin-up pic, with its caption referring readers on to a \u201cfull story\u201d that turned out to be some barely rejigged bumf tellingly lacking a byline (its online version fessed up by featuring a photo of trains, not Fry, and reflecting Snow\u2019s primacy). So we\u2019re left with a mystery worthy of The Curious Cases of Fry and Rutherford, the Radio 4 science series she co-presents; Monkey\u2019s hunch is that a Telegraph decree requires picture editors to put Poldark\u2019s Eleanor Tomlinson (a fellow-redhead whom Fry resembles) on the front whenever she pops up on a red carpet \u2013 and, amidst the current turmoil at the paper, someone either desperately decided a lookalike would do, or mixed them up and only discovered the mistake too late.",
