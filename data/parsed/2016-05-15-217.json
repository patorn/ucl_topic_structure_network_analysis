Victoria, a 36-year-old actor, made her \u201ciron throne\u201d from recycled materials two years ago, and has 28 signatures on it from Game of Thrones cast members, including Kit Harington. \u201cIt says I\u2019m obsessed with Game of Thrones, and that I have determination. I made it through trial and error \u2013 and boredom.\u201d And what it really says I don\u2019t watch Game of Thrones, but even a non-believer like me can see that this homemade throne \u2013 Victoria\u2019s version of the actual Iron Throne \u2013 is an amazing achievement. A mad thing to have looming from the corner of your sitting room, but amazing, nonetheless. Anything crafted with care and love, invention and attention is to be admired, and I admire it. I\u2019m not sure how well it works as a sofa, though. It\u2019s a bit upright. Not enough cushions. Nowhere convenient for snacks. I showed it to a couple of people who thought it would work as a commode, meaning you could plonk yourself in front of re-runs of GoT and never have to move. One of the swords would make an ideal toilet roll holder. Game of Thrones is filmed in Belfast and when our real Queen visited the set, she refused to sit on the Iron Throne. The rules of monarchy mean royalty can\u2019t take their seat upon a throne \u2013 even a pretend one \u2013 unless it\u2019s theirs. Which is the whole point of the programme. The throne is what everyone is fighting over: a physical representation of the power at stake. What this throne says about Victoria is that she takes her fantasy seriously. Dungeons & Dragons enthusiasts were once thought of as odd-bods who disappeared into magical tales because they couldn\u2019t cope with real life. But with the success of Game of Thrones, they are part of the mainstream alongside Twilight vampire-lovers and Harry Potter spell-casters. Victoria isn\u2019t an outsider any more. Her throne doesn\u2019t invite ridicule, but applause. If you would like Miranda to cast an eye over your favourite possession, email a photograph to magazine@observer.co.uk",
