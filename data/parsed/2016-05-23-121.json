  "body": "To go out of town or not to go out of town? This question has a much easier answer than Hamlet\u2019s existential conundrum. The Danish riviera starts at North Sealand, just 18 miles (30km) \u2013 or 35 minutes by train on a particularly pretty coastal route \u2013 from Copenhagen city centre. So you could, if time was tight, go there for a day.   Related: Music, nightlife and hip districts: the best of cool Copenhagen    Far better, though, to turn it into a weekend break all of its own, for this is a pristine coastline suited to swimming, cycling, a laid-back fly-drive holiday, a history-themed tour, or an art pilgrimage \u2013 or all of those things, carefully and calmly curated in the Danish manner of course. There are superlative sea views along the Oresund coast and at the massive Isefjord and Roskilde fjord. At the head of the latter is the Kronborg castle \u2013 Elsinore in Shakespeare\u2019s Hamlet \u2013 which has stood here in one shape or form since 1420, serving as a tollgate for Baltic Sea traffic, and which was listed as a Unesco world heritage site in 2000. This year, the castle hosts special events to commemorate 400 years since Shakespeare\u2019s death, and the 200 year anniversary of the annual Shakespeare festival.

The Danish Maritime Museum, housed in an acclaimed underground exhibition space designed by the renowned architects Bjarke Ingels Group, tells the story of exploration, conquest, trade and mastering the maelstroms of the wild northern seas through interactive displays and large video pieces.  The Louisiana Museum of Modern Art \u2013 ten kilometres south \u2013 is already a firm fixture for Copenhagen art aficionados. The museum building itself is a showpiece of discreet Danish modernism and houses cutting-edge contemporary art and key works by some of the 20th century\u2019s greatest painters and sculptors. As well as a permanent collection of more than 3,000 works, the Louisiana has up to 12 temporary shows every year. The calendar for summer-to-autumn 2016 includes works on paper by the young Picasso and a mid-career retrospective of Daniel Richter. But once you\u2019ve seen the art shows, explored the museums and taken in the views, North Sealand is a wonderland of pellucid lakes, deep woodland, beautiful coastline and wide-open, green landscapes. Travelling as a couple? The distinctively Danish \u201cLove on a Bike\u201d scheme invites you to follow a three- or four-day route stopping at dreamy seaside hotels and B&Bs, recharging at indie cafes and dining on the day\u2019s catch, pedalling through tiny coastal villages and drifting around Gilleleje Harbour in a cutter, all with zero fuss. Your luggage will be shipped and your beds booked along the way so you can enjoy us-time. Three romantic routes have already been designed, themed around culture, rooms with views and, of course, elsker \u2013 the Danish word for love.
