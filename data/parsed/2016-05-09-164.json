  "body": "Labor has promised to produce a mini-budget within three months of being sworn in, saying the government\u2019s budget forecasts are so unrealistic they will need updating to avoid a AAA credit downgrade. Shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, says Labor would also want to update the budget early in its term to put its \u201cstamp\u201d on the economic agenda quickly, and it does not want to wait until May next year to produce its first budget. It means Labor will publish a mid-year economic and fiscal outlook within three months of being sworn in \u2013 if it wins the election \u2013 with the forward estimates projections updated to reflect Labor\u2019s policies, including its savings measures and its \u201cinvestments in schools\u201d.

It comes a day after the election campaign officially began, which Malcolm Turnbull and Bill Shorten both spending the day in Queensland. It has been a rocky start for both major parties.  Liberal MP Dennis Jensen \u2013 who lost Liberal Party pre-selection before the election \u2013 announced on Monday he would re-contest his seat of Tangney as an independent. Labor\u2019s candidate, in the seat of Melbourne, publicly disagreed with Labor\u2019s asylum seeker policy. Bowen says Labor wants the Parliamentary Budget Office to take control of all economic forecasts in future budgets, because that will finally ensure they are produced \u201cat arm\u2019s length\u201d from the government. He criticises treasurer, Scott Morrison, for relying on overly-optimistic assumptions to show the budget returning to surplus in the future. He will also claim the Coalition\u2019s plan to deliver large tax cuts for big business is reckless, saying the government was so embarrassed by the $50bn cost of its tax plan that it tried to keep the centrepiece of its budget \u201cin the witness protection program\u201d. \u201cThe government lectures us that investments in schools and hospitals should be paid for. We agree. But the Government can\u2019t claim that it can\u2019t afford a $37bn investment in schools over the next decade but an unfunded $50bn corporate tax cut is just fine,\u201d he says. Bowen says Moody\u2019s rating agency gave the Turnbull government \u201ctwo clear warnings\u201d last week when it reviewed the Commonwealth budget \u2013 to adopt measures like the ones Labor is proposing, or risk losing the AAA rating.   Related: Campaign catchup: election 2016 is off with a bang, a bus and a box of melon    He says Australia\u2019s AAA rating is now under real pressure, and the treasurer, in \u201cdoggedly insisting\u201d that Australia doesn\u2019t have a revenue problem, is endangering Australia\u2019s AAA rating. \u201cIn an economy where confidence is low and the Reserve Bank has repeatedly expressed concerns about the lack of investment, losing one or all the AAA ratings would be a real body blow to confidence,\u201d he warns. He says Morrison\u2019s budget appears to lay out a pathway to surplus, but almost the entire return to surplus is built on assumptions and projections about the economy, \u201cnot on decisions to alter the direction\u201d. \u201cAll of these forecasts underline the reason why I announced here at the National Press Club eighteen months ago that the Parliamentary Budget Office, independent of government, will produce the underlying economic parameters in the budget,\u201d he says. \u201cThis will ensure that economic forecasts are undertaken at arm\u2019s length from Government giving the public more confidence in the Budget process.\u201d Moody\u2019s warned last week the government\u2019s budget projections for nominal gross domestic product growth \u2013 the key to shrinking the deficit \u2013 were too optimistic. \u201cWe estimate that constraints on the ability of the government to reduce spending amid moderate nominal GDP growth will lead to somewhat wider deficits for longer than currently budgeted,\u201d Moody\u2019s said.",
