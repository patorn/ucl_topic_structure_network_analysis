Related: Manchester United fake bomb 'fiasco': call for full investigation    When Sunday\u2019s match was postponed until Tuesday night Moses, a lifelong fan, was in tears before what was to be a first experience of seeing United play live. Having made the 3,170 mile trip from his homeland he faced the bitter disappointment of the return journey without seeing them in action. A suspect device, which was later discovered to be a mock explosive, caused the evacuation of the stadium before the 3pm kick-off. While the match is to be played at 8pm on Tuesday, Moses can now attend it and United\u2019s FA Cup final against Crystal Palace at Wembley. \u201cI was so disappointed and I cried right away and people come around me and hug me,\u201d said Moses, according to the BBC. \u201cI come far away from Sierra Leone. I come to watch this match and it doesn\u2019t happen. This is my first time in real life to watch Manchester live and it doesn\u2019t happen.\u201d       Ian Stirling, vice-chairman of the Manchester United Supporters Trust, was at the forefront of raising the monies in a personal capacity for Moses to be able to change his flight and acquire a ticket for the Cup final. Stirling said: \u201cWhen we heard the game was abandoned we had to tell Moses and the poor lad was distraught - being so close to the ground and not being able to go in, not knowing when he might get this chance again. \u201cHe\u2019s still distraught at not getting in to Old Trafford. That was his dream. But we\u2019re trying to do the right thing for a friend.\u201d Along with a picture of Moses, Stirling tweeted: \u201cUpdate on Moses whose first game at OT today. We\u2019re paying for a change of flight date and he\u2019s going to Wembley!\u201d Moses has also been offered free accommodation for the week in Salford Quays at the private home of United fans.",
