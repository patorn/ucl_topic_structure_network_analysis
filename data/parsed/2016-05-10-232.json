The player completed a medical on Monday in Munich and the club\u2019s CEO, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, said: \u201cWe have been keeping an eye on Renato Sanches for a long time now and we are very happy to have signed him despite a lot of competition for him.

I have always been proud, and still am, to wear the Dortmund shirt and to be a part of this extraordinary team. \u201cBefore I return to my home city we have one big goal to achieve: to win the German Cup and to have a big party with the BVB fans. I thank all the people from the bottom of my heart for the wonderful time in black-and-yellow.\u201d Bayern have already won the Bundesliga this season but lost their Champions League semi-final against Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. The coach, Pep Guardiola, will leave the club in the summer and be replaced by Carlo Ancelotti.",
