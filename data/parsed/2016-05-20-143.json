The Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw called the drama a \u201cdream,\u201d but the majority of critics at Cannes were decidedly less kind.    Related: It\u2019s Only the End of the World review: Xavier Dolan's nightmarish homecoming is a dream    Variety\u2019s Peter Debruge said it was \u201cunbearable\u201d. The Hollywood Reporter\u2019s Jon Frosch called it \u201cdeeply unsatisfying\u201d. TheWrap\u2019s Ben Croll went further, declaring it to be Dolan\u2019s \u201cfirst total misfire\u201d.            Director Xavier Dolan: \u2018Cannes is sinking into a culture of hatred\u2019    \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t for you guys, the entire Anglophone world would have detested the film,\u201d Dolan joked. Asked if he was surprised by the largely negative reaction to his drama, an adaptation of a famed stage play of the same name starring some of France\u2019s most revered actors, Dolan said that it\u2019s typical for all films at Cannes to \u201cdivide\u201d.  \u201cIt\u2019s always been the case,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course we expected to divide. We didn\u2019t think we would inflame the Croisette and people would be, \u2018I adore it\u2019 or \u2018I fucking hate it!\u2019 It\u2019s not what we had in mind. [My producers and I] always thought that it was the most complete film of all the six that I\u2019ve made.\u201d     Marion Cotillard in It\u2019s Only the End of the World Photograph: PR Company Handout    His comments echo the ones he made at Thursday\u2019s press conference for the film, where he called It\u2019s Only the End of the World his best film.  \u201cI have to admit, it\u2019s not only ego,\u201d Dolan said. \u201cYou\u2019re always ready for people not liking your work. But I feel that there\u2019s a rather baffling misunderstanding.\u201d Dolan took aim at the tendency for critics to tweet their opinion immediately after viewing a picture, saying it breeds \u201c a sort of instantaneous harm and culture of hatred, which the festival seems to be sinking into.\u201d    Related: Julieta review: Pedro Almod\u00f3var ties himself down with fractured melodrama    \u201cIt\u2019s like a ship that\u2019s sinks; it starts in clear water and then it goes down and down, and it keeps getting darker. You feel like when you come into a Cannes: it\u2019s a dark cloud of a storm waiting and rumbling. You wonder how you\u2019re going to get through that.\u201d \u201cIf the guy who gives Creed five stars and Fast and the Furious four stars and-a-half is saying that Marion Cotillard is a bore in my movie, then it really is the end of the world,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd you wonder what the fuck he\u2019s doing here.\u201d",
