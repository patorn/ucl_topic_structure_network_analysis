  "body": "We\u2019ve been primed by so many films and TV series to expect something darker beneath images of 1970s California sunshine and optimism: to believe the smiles are rictus grins, concealing an underbelly of excess, amorality and tragedy. Sometimes, though, it was just fun. \u201cThe money was flying,\u201d says Franne (formerly Frannie) Golde, one of the stars of the new compilation The Ladies of Too Slow to Disco. \u201cLimousines from the airport \u2013 not just for the artist but for the songwriters, for anyone that you might want in the studio with you to feel relaxed and comfortable \u2013 beautiful hotel rooms for everyone, lots of time to do your thing in the studio. It was a great time.\u201d      The story of The Ladies of Too Slow to Disco, in fact, is disconcertingly delightful. The compilation of songs in the interzone between AOR, winsome singer-songwriter strums and lavish disco/soul, fairly gleams with joy. It\u2019s enough to make some of the positive-living screeds in the lyrics ring oddly true. The album, in keeping with previous volumes in the Too Slow to Disco series, is full of obscurities but also has no fear of obviousness: there are enduring MOR radio classics such as Rickie Lee Jones\u2019s Chuck E\u2019s in Love and Maria Muldaur\u2019s Midnight at the Oasis, as well as groovers by Carole King and Carly Simon. That led to some deeply tedious wrangling with major labels for its compiler, Berliner Marcus Liesenfeld \u2013 AKA DJ Supermarkt \u2013 but as soon as he began to make contact with the singers themselves, it became worthwhile for him. \u201cThey\u2019re just the coolest people I have ever met, anywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re really young in their spirit. Maybe it\u2019s that hippie generation. They must have grown up in a good way. Either those people died, or they turned around the wheel and became what they are now.\u201d            Franne Golde was his touchstone. \u201cOnce I got her number,\u201d says Liedenfeld, \u201cshe straight away gave me numbers for six of the other singers I was looking for. They all still live in LA, and she knew them all.\u201d Golde might not have made it big with her late-70s solo material, such as the loping funk-pop of Isn\u2019t It Somethin\u2019 on The Ladies of Too Slow to Disco, but she clearly sussed out the record industry, and would go on to write mega-hits for everyone from the Commodores to the Pussycat Dolls. For all this success, there\u2019s not a trace of industry smarm about her, though. She emanates the bullshit-free sass of her upbringing in Chicago \u2013 where she cut her musical teeth in the Chess studios \u2013 and is full of delight that people should still want to dance to her youthful works. Her view of history isn\u2019t rose-tinted. On her solo records, for example, she says she felt pushed into a particular sound \u2013 she had Albhy Galuten and Karl Richardson parachuted in to produce, fresh from their mega success working with the Bee Gees on Stayin\u2019 Alive. \u201cChauvinism in the industry was there,\u201d she says, \u201cand sure it was worse than now\u201d \u2013 though nothing like the image of the era portrayed in HBO\u2019s series Vinyl, which she calls \u201ckind of a cartoon view\u201d. She never felt women were treated as second-class musicians, and as she reels out her formative influences, she sketches out a kind of alternative canon for the world of The Ladies of Too Slow to Disco: \u201cI grew up on Laura Nyro, I had every single album. Joni Mitchell, too, though not so much. I taught myself to play piano by listening to [Carole King\u2019s] Tapestry. But the thing that changed everything was a moment I literally had to stop my car because I was a mess, I couldn\u2019t believe what I was hearing. That song was Chuck E\u2019s in Love.\u201d     Franne Golde. Photograph: record company handout    Muldaur, too, says \u201cI was accepted as a musician first, a woman second,\u201d citing meeting a young Bonnie Raitt in 1972 as \u201cgiving me the confidence that I could be a bandleader too, be in control and command\u201d. Rootsier than Golde, though just as funny and gutsy in conversation, she inhabited a parallel world to rock star decadence when she was working as a session musician in LA. \u201cOh, I knew all that was going on,\u201d she says. \u201cI went to the parties! But I cared more about working, I was playing with Ry Cooder, David Lindley, Jim Keltner, Jim Gordon, Ray Brown, Benny Carter, Dr John, and met with respect and appreciation from them all. I would say it was a wonderful working environment, in fact.\u201d This melting pot of jazz, folk, R&B and country musicians of the first rank in the most expensive studios on earth is what defines the musical gloss of The Ladies of Too Slow to Disco \u2013 and also its lasting quality. Evie Sands\u2019s You Can Do It, which opens the album, is possibly the perfect expression of the luxurious atmosphere: a groove from soul/funk rhythm section gods James Gadson and Reggie McBride buoys up a message of such positivity that it would be saccharine were the end result not so perfect. Sands \u2013 who has had a more roundabout career than the others, from 60s teen starlet to latterday cult figure \u2013 is a lot more circumspect than Golde and Muldaur about the grind of the industry and the \u201cgood old boys\u2019 network\u201d that held back women\u2019s creativity. But even she, with genuine wistfulness, recalls the making of the track, with her regular songwriting partner Ben Weisman, as \u201cjust a blissful time with so many phenomenal, phenomenal musicians around us\u201d.     Carole King. Photograph: Jim McCrary/Redferns    It could be tempting to see the revival of these tunes as kitsch hipsterism. And Muldaur half-jokes: \u201cSure, it tickles me that people are dancing to my song, but it tickles me more when the pay cheque comes.\u201d Golde, too, lets out a giggle: \u201cSo there are beautiful people swaying to my song in Berlin and Ibiza? Wow, I think that\u2019s where I\u2019d like to be!\u201d But all are clearly touched by the fact that the songs work for clubbers. As Sands puts it: \u201cWe weren\u2019t thinking about dance clubs or anything like that when we made the song, but we\u2019d sure dance around the studio when we did it. If people feel like doing that now, that\u2019s a beautiful thing.\u201d Liedenfeld is stern in his insistance that he picks songs not for cultural chic but because they work on the dancefloor. \u201cWhen I started compiling this west-coast 70s stuff, I\u2019d get emails from people I used to DJ with when I was more an electro DJ, asking if I was mad. But I\u2019m a DJ of 20 years\u2019 experience. I\u2019m not a jukebox DJ. To make things relevant for me, it has to happen now, it has to be new and not just a museum of tracks. I was tired of the big clubs and house music, but this music, I play in a little place in Berlin, quite dirty, nothing fashionable, and have 120 people [aged] from 18 to 60 dancing on tables. If a song can still do that 40 years on, that\u2019s not fashion: that\u2019s really, really good music.\u201d The Ladies of Too Slow to Disco is out now on How Do You Are?",
