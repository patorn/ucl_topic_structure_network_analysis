  "body": "The British javelin thrower Goldie Sayers, who looks set to claim a belated bronze medal from the 2008 Olympics after hundreds of urine samples from Beijing were retested, has called for Russia to be banned from the forthcoming Rio Games because \u201cthe only way they will learn is if they are properly punished\u201d. Sayers feels so strongly about the situation that she has even considered pulling out of the Olympics in protest if Russia\u2019s track and field stars are allowed to compete. \u201cI\u2019d almost go as far as to say I wouldn\u2019t want to compete in Rio if Russia are competing,\u201d Sayers told the Guardian. \u201cBut boycotting it wouldn\u2019t do anything, because no one would care. And then I would be missing out on another Olympic moment. So I will aim to qualify again. However, I certainly think their athletes should be banned from Rio. \u201cYes, there might be a few Russians that haven\u2019t cheated but the number of positive tests makes it pretty obvious that it is state-sponsored and endemic. The only way they will learn is if they are punished and banned.\u201d   Related: Russian athletes \u2018likely to have tested positive at 2008 Olympics\u2019    Sayers is awaiting official confirmation of reports in the Russian media that the javelin silver medallist Mariya Abakumova is among 14 of the country\u2019s athletes to have tested positive in Beijing. If the news is confirmed by Abakumova\u2019s B-sample, it would upgrade Sayers from fourth to bronze. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly been a strange 24 hours,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve swung from being really happy and excited to being really angry, and everything in between. It\u2019s always been my dream to be an Olympic medallist but you don\u2019t think you\u2019ll hear about it while driving on the M11. It\u2019s slightly different from the Bird\u2019s Nest stadium.\u201d However, Sayers believes that the International Olympic Committee needs to do far more to reassure clean athletes, and has urged them to retest every sample from the Beijing Games to catch more cheats. \u201cIn some ways I feel quite lucky,\u201d she said. \u201cThe IOC has so far only retested samples of those athletes hoping to go to Rio, so if Abakumova had retired after having twins, the news of this potential medal would never have come out. But what about those in events where medallists have already retired?\u201d Sayers also believes the IOC should retest all out-of-competition samples, too \u2013 despite the costs. \u201cThe IOC make a fortune from the Olympics, of which none of that goes to the athletes, so it is the least they can do. If that means more positive tests, so be it. You have got to be a pretty stupid athlete to be caught at a championships, although I guess they were using stuff they could get away with.\u201d   Related: Why the IAAF must ensure Russia remains banned for Rio Olympics    And while Sayers says she has suffered a \u201chuge six-figure financial loss\u201d because of doping, she points out that the consequences run far wider than a loss of sponsorship, prize money and funding. \u201cMy overriding feeling post-Beijing was that I was very proud \u2013 not many athletes have broken a British record in an Olympic final \u2013 but I thought I needed to train more to make the podium,\u201d she said. \u201cI went into the winter of 2008 with a sense of deflation, and pushed even harder, and that was a recipe for disaster. It\u2019s no coincidence that I then wound up with a stress fracture in my spine. But lots of other lives have been changed because of Russian cheating. People were sacked because they failed to make medal targets. The butterfly effect was huge.\u201d The former UK Athletics\u2019 performance director Dave Collins, who lost his job after falling two short of the medal target of six in 2008, told the Guardian that it was a bittersweet moment to learn that his athletes may have won six medals \u2013 through Sayers and the men\u2019s 4x400m relay team \u2013 after all. \u201cWe were making progress,\u201d he said. \u201cWe put a lot more people into finals in Beijing, with plenty of season\u2019s bests and personal bests. That could have been carried to London and beyond, and it was frustrating to not have the chance to do it. It was a bugger at the time, and it is a bugger now.\u201d Collins, who many in the sport believe was harshly treated by UK Athletics, also confirmed that he had his suspicions that many countries and athletes were cheating in Beijing. \u201cIt would be naive to say otherwise,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the elephant in the room.\u201d",
