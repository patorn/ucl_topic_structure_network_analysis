  "body": "The editor of the Sun has insisted that the Queen \u201cstrongly\u201d believes the UK should leave the EU, despite a ruling by the press watchdog that his paper\u2019s \u201cQueen backs Brexit\u201d headline was inaccurate.  Tony Gallagher maintained that the paper had not made a mistake despite a ruling by the Independent Press Standards Organisation that the headline was \u201csignificantly misleading\u201d.   Brexit companion   \u201cDo I accept we made a mistake?\u201d Gallagher told Radio 4\u2019s Today programme on Wednesday. \u201cIn all conscience I don\u2019t.\u201d Asked if he had made a journalistic error in approving the headline, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t accept that we made an error at all. We made a judgment that the headline was right and that it was backed up by the story.  \u201cWe knew more than we put in the public domain. The sources were so impeccable that we had no choice but to run the story in the way that we did.\u201d He added: \u201cI don\u2019t think were I doing this again tomorrow I would act in any way differently whatsoever. Given what I know about the detail of the sourcing and given what I know about the detail of the conversation, frankly, we would be better packing up and going home as journalists if we didn\u2019t actually put these things in the public domain.\u201d  Gallagher insisted the paper was right to run the story, saying: \u201cWe were in no doubt that the Queen\u2019s views were strongly of the opinion she would want to leave the European Union.\u201d   Related: Rupert Murdoch will decide Sun stance on Brexit, says its ex-political editor    Buckingham Palace complained to Ipso about the story, which was published on 8 March. It detailed an occasion when the Queen allegedly vented her anger with Brussels at the strongly pro-EU Nick Clegg during a lunch at Windsor Castle when he was deputy prime minister. The Ipso verdict \u2013 that the newspaper\u2019s headline had breached clause 1 (accuracy) of the editors\u2019 code of practice \u2013 was printed in an article on page two of Wednesday\u2019s edition of the newspaper. The front-page article, which was headlined \u201cQueen backs Brexit\u201d, was described by the paper as an \u201cexclusive bombshell\u201d.  Written by the Sun\u2019s political editor, Tom Newton Dunn, it quoted \u201ca senior political source\u201d and \u201ca highly reliable source\u201d as saying that people who heard the conversation \u201cwere left in no doubt at all about the Queen\u2019s views on European integration\u201d. It said two unnamed sources had claimed that the Queen made critical comments about the EU at two private functions \u2013 first with Nick Clegg at a lunch for privy counsellors at Windsor Castle in 2011, and at a reception for MPs at Buckingham Palace. At the time, the former Liberal Democrat leader Clegg dismissed the report as \u201cnonsense\u201d, while the Palace said: \u201cThe Queen remains politically neutral, as she has for 63 years. \u201cWe will not comment on spurious, anonymously sourced claims. The referendum is a matter for the British people to decide.\u201d The justice secretary and pro-Brexit campaigner, Michael Gove, refused to rule out being the source of the leak. The Sun said it stood by its story and planned to defend against the complaint \u201cvigorously\u201d. Ipso said that while the article itself did not breach the code, the headline did as it was \u201ca factual assertion that the Queen had expressed a position in the referendum debate, and there was nothing in the headline, or the manner in which it was presented on the newspaper\u2019s front page, to suggest that this was conjecture, hyperbole, or was not to be read literally\u201d. Gallagher told Today on Wednesday: \u201cThe headline is only misleading if you exclude the words \u2018bombshell claim over Europe votes\u2019, which are in capital letters on the front page. I emphasise the word \u2018claim\u2019 \u2026 so they reached the ruling by disregarding those words.\u201d The Sun\u2019s article reporting the ruling \u2013 ordered by Ipso as a remedy for the inaccuracy \u2013 said: \u201cIpso acknowledged the importance of headlines in tabloid newspapers. \u201cHowever, it did not follow from the comments the article reported that the Queen wanted the UK to leave the EU as a result of the referendum: that suggestion was conjecture and the committee noted that none of those quoted in the story were reported as making such a claim. \u201cThe headline was not supported by the text. It was significantly misleading \u2013 given that it suggested a fundamental breach of the Queen\u2019s constitutional obligations.\u201d  The complaint was the first by a reigning monarch to the official press watchdog in the UK.  The decision is also the first time Ipso has ruled on the newly-revised clause 1 of the editors\u2019 code of practice, which makes specific reference to \u201cheadlines not supported by the text\u201d as an example of inaccurate, misleading or distorted information.  Commenting on the adjudication, Ipso chief executive Matt Tee said: \u201cClause 1 of the editors\u2019 code was amended in January 2016 with specific reference to \u2018headlines not supported by the text\u2019.  \u201cThe editors\u2019 code committee clearly wanted Ipso to pay close attention to the use of headlines, something we have done in the period since the new code was issued.  \u201cThe Sun\u2019s headline was significantly misleading and represented a failure to take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted information.\u201d  He added: \u201cIpso will continue to carry out our work without fear or favour and will continue to support those who feel wronged by the press, whoever they are.\u201d  Evan Harris, joint executive director of press reform campaigners Hacked Off, said Ipso\u2019s action was \u201cgrossly inadequate\u201d.  He said: \u201cThis ruling shows everything wrong with Ipso - it was a clear and obvious code breach but the remedy is grossly inadequate.  \u201cMillions of people read the false front page banner headline and they deserve to see the truth. But only a small proportion of them will read the adjudication to learn how they were misled, because the front page reference and the page 2 headline are both small and neither correct the record.  \u201cThe burying of the adjudication on page 2, the absence of an actual correction and the absence of an apology all demonstrate that Ipso, like the PCC before them, strives to protect the newspapers that control them at the expense of the public interest.  \u201cThe code requires \u2018due prominence\u2019 corrections and while the public think this should be \u2018equivalent prominence\u2019, Ipso thinks it means \u2018buried inside prominence\u2019.\u201d  Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the ruling.",
