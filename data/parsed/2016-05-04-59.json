The reckless, belligerent, mendacious inexperience of the man is awesome. It is never good to see virtue in a bully or a thug. With no record of public service, Trump can be judged only on his private behaviour, and that is by all\u00a0accounts\u00a0deplorable. Even as Trump moved into an unassailable lead over his rival, Ted Cruz, he could not resist a torrent of abuse. Cruz, he said, was a serial liar and\u00a0had five extramarital affairs. His father was associated with Lee Harvey Oswald, John F Kennedy\u2019s assassin. For good measure, Cruz retorted that Trump was \u201camoral, a pathological liar, narcissist and buffoon\u201d. His father pleaded to \u201cevery member of the body of Christ to vote according to the word of God\u201d and avoid America\u2019s destruction at the hands of Trump.    The so-called new politics of Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson and Alex Salmond has proved as effective as Trump\u2019s    Outsiders at such moments wonder what the hell is happening to America. But the answer is simple and salutary. When democracy slithers towards oligarchy, as has federal America, the mob retaliates. Congress has become an aloof, gerrymandered, constitutional dinosaur. It renders the most powerful nation on Earth ungovernable, even by so palpably sincere and competent a leader as Barack Obama. No problem, says democracy, and turns to the nearest available antidote. It votes for the outsider, the anti-Washingtonian, the shaker-up of things. If the establishment gangs up to stop him, democracy backs him all the more. It backs him even if he is Trump. Let that be a lesson, says democracy, to all oligarchs and stuffed shirts and nice talkers. Step out of line and we will give you someone so awful, so disruptive, he\u00a0will be a nightmare. Trump\u2019s candidacy now enters new territory. While his appeal so far has been to the back woods, he is no real backwoodsman. Indeed the Republican establishment was more appalled by the ultra-rightwing Cruz, a candidate they knew and loathed. As Michael Tomasky points out in the current New York Review of Books, they would \u201crather spend four years calling Trump \u2018Mr President\u2019 than have to genuflect to Cruz\u201d. Better the devil they didn\u2019t know.           Donald Trump: \u2018We are going to win bigly. Believe me\u2019 \u2013 video    In contrast January\u2019s issue of the conservative National Review was directed \u201cAgainst Trump\u201d. Rightwing commentators lined up to abuse him for being a big-government lefty. They cited his support for a fiscal stimulus during the credit crunch, for backing the bailouts of the banks and carmakers. He demanded \u201cthe government take over companies\u201d to save them and their employees from recession. The National Review did not like that. Indeed Trump, at least in the past, was a relatively progressive New Yorker.\u00a0He was pro-abortion, pro-gun control, pro-healthcare and deeply critical of George Bush\u2019s Iraq war. On most of these he has since flipped and flopped outrageously \u2013 in the case of abortion, ludicrously so. His opportunism has been total. But if Trump can flip one way, he can assuredly flop back. He seems at times almost to be enacting a parody of a modern politician. Trump\u2019s one killer issue has been immigration, on which he has gone straight for the conservative soul. In common with half Europe\u2019s current politicians, he plays on the insecurity that settled communities feel towards newcomers. Republicans seem ready to take Trump\u2019s vacillation on social issues as a price to pay for his elephantine antagonism towards migrants. Others may mouth bromides about immigration control. Trump espouses brutally specific remedies. Get them out, he says, and keep them out. Hanging, drawing and quartering seems too good for them. He presumably relies on few immigrants bothering to vote. It is working. After long trailing behind Hillary Clinton in the opinion polls, Trump finally edged ahead of her in a Rasmussen Reports survey on Monday. Support had shifted from 41-36 in Clinton\u2019s favour in March to 41-39 in Trump\u2019s favour now. The much-trumpeted assumption that the Trump brand has too many \u201cnegatives\u201d to be electable, especially among women, no long looks the case. With the nomination under his belt, Trump\u2019s defeat by Clinton is no foregone conclusion. He could yet be the Leicester City of American politics.           Indiana voters on why they backed Donald Trump    Trump must now make peace with his own party and its donors if he is to recruit the vote-getters on which victory in swing states depends. He is rich, but he is not rich enough to do without them. He must also make peace with an\u00a0electorate that he has so far disregarded \u2013 the tasteful, dignified, risk-averse Republican America, an America that so far sees him as truly awful. The game is on to detoxify Trump. If it works, who knows what may happen? If it does not work, Trump need concern the world no more. Europeans may watch these events with dismay. America\u2019s capacity to scare the wits out of the rest of the world is undimmed. But as the historian Arthur Schlesinger remarked of the McCarthy era, America regularly takes democracy to the edge of the cliff, wobbles there awhile and then draws back.   Related: America's Trump nightmare has arrived | Lucia Graves    How America votes is America\u2019s business. David Cameron was silly last December to dismiss Trump as \u201cdivisive, stupid and wrong\u201d \u2013 not because it was inaccurate but because foreign leaders should keep their noses out of each other\u2019s domestic politics. Trump\u2019s aides are demanding \u201can apology or some sort of retraction\u201d, which is the more humiliating for\u00a0Cameron. The prime minister seems devoid of sound advice these days. The best response to Trump is to look\u00a0into our own backyards. Europe displays the same detachment of political elites from public opinion, the same deaf ears and clogged arteries. In Britain, the so-called \u201cnew politics\u201d of Nigel Farage, Boris Johnson and Alex Salmond has proved as effective as Trump\u2019s, and for the same reason. With politics less a matter of personal interest than of psychology and tribal attitude, the slick hypocrisy of the Blair-Cameron years is vulnerable to the new, media-friendly authenticity. Across Europe, Trump-like characters are emerging from the ooze of a decaying political union. Some are deeply unattractive. Some are dangerous. But it is no good just deploring them. If Trump proves anything, it is that you can\u2019t deplore all the people all the time. There is no substitute for listening, arguing, persuading \u2013 because sooner or later they\u00a0get round to voting.",
