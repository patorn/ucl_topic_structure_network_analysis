  "body": "\u201cDid they find him guilty?\u201d asked a woman walking through what has been described as an open-air drug market by the subway stop across the street from the CVS that burned after Freddie Gray\u2019s funeral in Baltimore last year. It was 2.30pm, several hours after Judge Barry Williams rendered a not guilty verdict on all of the charges against police officer Edward Nero for his role in the arrest and death of Gray.

Even on a normal day, news travels quickly here but the extra police presence and the return of the TV news camera crews all seeming to wait for a riot accelerated the pace. Still, only a small handful of mostly white activists stood with yellow signs demanding justice beside the elevator to the subway on the afternoon that a judge handed down the first verdict in the charges over the death of Freddie Gray.  Most everyone else was simply going about their days because no one really expected anything different. That was not the case on the day Marilyn Mosby announced that she was bringing charges against six officers over Gray\u2019s death and this same intersection erupted with joy as much of the city danced in the street. But that was a long time ago. When the verdict was announced, Mosby did not even show up at the courthouse to hear the judge. And the same activists who celebrated her last year now heckle her at events and protest outside of her house because of her prosecution of protesters and a perceived lack of transparency and accountability.

Photograph: Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images    On Monday, many of those same activists expressed something closer to a resigned sense of defeat or frustration. \u201cToday\u2019s verdict is upsetting but not at all surprising to anyone who has been paying attention to police brutality cases all over the country, or to anyone who has been paying attention to Marilyn Mosby\u2019s office,\u201d the activist group Baltimore Bloc wrote in a statement, arguing that to \u201cseek justice for Freddie Gray\u201d would mean \u201cupsetting the status quo\u201d where Mosby\u2019s office prosecutes \u201cpeople like Freddie Gray every day. We do not expect justice for Freddie or for Baltimore to come from a prosecutor\u2019s office or a courtroom\u201d. Shaun Young, a photographer who was arrested here at the Penn North subway stop on the anniversary of Gray\u2019s arrest and knows the indignities of the legal system, thinks \u201cit wouldn\u2019t have been in the best interest of the government to have Nero found guilty.\u201d \u201cA government employee was tried against the same government that paid for the trial, using another government employee to prosecute and was found not guilty by another government employee all in defense of policies put in place by that same government,\u201d he said, incredulous. That resignation that comes from the sense that the system is rigged is in some respects the flip side of the rage that erupted in these streets last year. Many in Baltimore were full of fury because they had been treated in the same way as Gray on too many occasions and they felt the same thing could happen to them. But like Gray, so many in Baltimore have come not to expect anything more from the legal system. \u201cThe fact that prosecutors usually work with the police, they don\u2019t see them as criminals or as worthy of putting together the best possible case and strategies that they would deal with the regular normal everyday citizens who are often presumptively viewed as criminals,\u201d said Morgan State University professor Lawrence Brown. On the day of Gray\u2019s arrest last April, police say he ran when he saw Lt Brian Rice. Gray\u2019s friend Brandon Ross testified at Nero\u2019s trial last week that Gray started running before he saw Rice, not because of him. We\u2019ll never know whether or not Gray was running from the police, but people who have been in his shoes believe that he would have had plenty of reason to. Gray had been arrested numerous times and on six occasions he was either acquitted or the prosecutors decided not to pursue the charges after officers brought them. Nevertheless, Gray served time in jail on these charges and his family paid thousands of dollars to bail bondsmen to get him out of jail. Ross was led from the courtroom in handcuffs after his testimony. \u201cI knew I was going to be harassed and messed with by police officers,\u201d he said when asked by the defense why he gave a false name when he called 911 on the day of Gray\u2019s arrest. Ross spent 40 days in jail shortly after Gray\u2019s death for not having a registration on a dirtbike. His lawyer calls the pending assault charges \u201cbullshit\u201d. After Gray\u2019s death, Ross, who had also faced other criminal charges, tried to do something positive and began working with a street artist named Nether on the large mural that now covers a wall across the street from where he was arrested by officers Miller and Nero. \u201cHe was telling me that he\u2019s using this as something to change his life,\u201d JC Faulk, a community organizer and activist, said of Ross\u2019s involvement in the mural project. The mural was completed around the same time Ross was arrested by the Baltimore police department for allegations of a violation of probation on the dirtbike charge. \u201cIt was Father\u2019s Day,\u201d said Ross, who has two children, \u201cand they gave me no bail for a violation of probation from a traffic violation?\u201d he told the Baltimore Sun, claiming that the charge \u2013 and the 40 days he spent in jail for it \u2013 were police harassment stemming from Gray\u2019s arrest.  Ross\u2019s charges were later dropped. But the fact that Ross was led from the courtroom in chains while officer Nero went home each night is one reason that many in Baltimore never expect police officers to be convicted.  \u201cIt\u2019s a racist-ass system,\u201d said Carde Cornish, another young photographer who lives near Penn North (and helped with a Guardian video production). \u201cThere\u2019s nothing we can do to escape this situation. It\u2019s a systemic issue. That\u2019s what people are ignoring. No matter what we do on our behalf, they can\u2019t justify what they do. And [the accused police officers] get paid vacations. What the fuck?\u201d",
