  "body": "My husband and I have been having relationship problems, but I thought we were doing OK until I found out he has been lying. He went away for a long weekend with friends and they visited lapdancing clubs. I knew as soon as I picked them all up at the airport \u2013 they looked so guilty. But when I asked him later he lied, first about visiting a lapdancing club, then about having a lap dance, then about how much he spent on lapdances, and about physical contact during the lapdance. One of his other friends told his wife all the details, and so the rest made a pact to keep it secret from their wives. He expects me to just get over it but I am so hurt by his behaviour that I can\u2019t. It\u2019s not the first time: previously, I discovered he had been paying for porn \u2013 again, when I confronted him he denied it until I showed him the credit card statement. I don\u2019t feel we really recovered from this but stayed together anyway. There have been several other times when he has stayed out all night with no explanation, sent porn emails around his office and inappropriate texts to women at work, and got into fights \u2013 he\u2019s been charged with assault more than once. All this he blames on drinking too much and not feeling like he has grown up. I don\u2019t know how we can regain trust, or get over this yet again. \u2022 When leaving a message on this page, please be sensitive to the fact that you are responding to a real person in the grip of a real-life dilemma, who wrote to Private Lives asking for help, and may well view your comments here.
