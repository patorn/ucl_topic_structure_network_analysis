  "body": "As cities develop and change, so their streetscapes often become a mix of different architectural styles and eras. But some buildings, either daring new additions or leftovers from a previous time, stick out like a sore thumb (perhaps a beautiful sore thumb, but still). One of my favourite examples of this, though admittedly on the silver screen, comes at the end of Batteries Not Included (a brilliant film which although technically about flying alien robots made of scrap metal is essentially about resisting corporate-led urban development and the destruction of built heritage) when we see a small, historic, stand-alone Manhattan apartment block surrounded by a sea of monolithic slick skyscrapers. I was always reminded of this vision when driving past the Albert Tavern in Westminster, London, which is a Grade II-listed Victorian four-storey brick building surrounded by glassy modern high-rise offices (pictured above).
