  "body": "Barack Obama delivered a stinging rebuke to a culture of isolationism and falsehood, and an adamant defense of facts and science, in his commencement address to the Rutgers University graduating class of 2016 on Sunday.  In a wide-ranging address, Obama singled out the issue of income inequality and proposed closing tax loopholes on hedge fund managers, highlighted the importance of voting and accountability, and commented on the problems of money in politics and climate change. \u201cA wall won\u2019t stop that,\u201d he said, alluding to the proposal by Republicans\u2019 presumptive nominee, Donald Trump, to build a wall at the US-Mexico border.

The president took particular umbrage with a culture of willful ignorance, ridiculing leaders and commentators who reject science and facts. \u201cAnd yet, we\u2019ve become confused about this,\u201d he said.

That\u2019s not keeping it real or telling it like it is. That\u2019s not challenging political correctness. That\u2019s just not knowing what you\u2019re talking about.\u201d Obama also commented on the nature of progress itself, an implicit rebuke to those who have expressed disappointment with his campaign promises and lofty ambitions. \u201cAmerica\u2019s progress has never been smooth,\u201d he told the crowd of 40,000. The United States, he said, \u201cremains a very young nation. Progress is bumpy.  \u201cIt always has been. Dreamers\u2019 and strivers\u2019 and activists\u2019 progress are this nation\u2019s hallmarks. The arc of history is long, but it bends toward justice. Stand up for what you believe in.\u201d  The president urged graduates to pursue change in the world despite a cascade of challenges, and to take on those challenges together, as part of the political process. \u201cIt is your turn now to shape our nation\u2019s destiny as well as your own,\u201d he urged.  Obama took special care to refute the some of rhetoric of the 2016 presidential campaign, on the right and left. \u201cOur nation\u2019s founders were born of the enlightenment,\u201d he said, adding that change was never sudden, not even through \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d \u2013 an allusion to the rhetoric of Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders. \u201cFolks on this campus got upset that Condoleezza Rice was supposed to speak at a commencement,\u201d he said, referring to student protests against the former secretary of state for George W Bush. \u201cNow, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a secret that I disagree with many of the policies of Dr Rice and the previous administration,\u201d he continued. \u201cBut the notion that this community or the the country would be better served by not hearing from a former secretary of state, or shutting out what she had to say \u2013 I believe that\u2019s misguided. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s how democracy works best.\u201d He also argued that the notion of a wall on America\u2019s borders ran counter to the nation\u2019s founding principles: \u201cThe world is interconnected and becoming more so every day. Building walls won\u2019t change that.\u201d     Obama laughs as he sits with Bill Moyers during the ceremony. Photograph: Evan Vucci/AP    It was an idea, he said, that \u201cdoesn\u2019t just run counter to our history as the world\u2019s melting pot \u2013 it contradicts the evidence that our growth, our innovation and our dynamism has always been spurred by our ability to attract strivers from every corner of the globe. \u201cThat\u2019s how we became America. Why would we want to stop it now?\u201d he continued. \u201cCan\u2019t do it.\u201d  The US, if not the world at large, he suggested, is at \u201can inflection point\u201d when \u201cbig changes are happening\u201d.     Related: Obama tells Howard University students to change US through action    \u201cThe pace of change is accelerating, offering great opportunity and great peril,\u201d he warned. \u201cMake the right choices, away from fear and paralysis and toward co-operation and hope.\u201d In closing, he offered what he called \u201ca few suggestions of how you can change the world\u201d. First among them was another reproach of Trump and his campaign slogan to \u201cmake America great again\u201d. Obama told the students they should resist those who insist the past was better: \u201cOften, the good old days weren\u2019t that good.\u201d  They should also hold leaders accountable, he said, and recognise that when experts are dismissed as elitist, \u201cwe have a problem\u201d. But above all, he urged students to vote, saying \u201capathy has consequences\u201d. \u201cHave faith in democracy. It\u2019s not always pretty, I know. I\u2019ve been living it. But it\u2019s how we make progress.\u201d",
