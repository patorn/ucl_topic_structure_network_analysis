But should it share some of the anniversary attention? At the Somme, Britain suffered 20,000 dead on the first day alone, beginning a grinding attrition that staggered to an inconclusive end on 18 November 1916. Little wonder that it always overshadows a briefer passage of arms to break the first world war\u2019s military deadlock just a month earlier. Over in a few hours with 10,000 dead on both sides, it proved far more significant to the eventual allied victory.  The naval Battle of Jutland, fought in the shallow waters of the North Sea 80 miles off Denmark on 31 May 1916, seems to be gathering a little more attention this year than usual. The BBC is showing Dan Snow\u2019s Battle of Jutland: The Navy\u2019s Bloodiest Day on Sunday. Scores are still being settled between supporters of the main British admirals, cautious Sir John Jellicoe, commander of Britain\u2019s Grand Fleet, and his swashbuckling cruiser chief, Sir David Beatty. Shrouded in mist and confusion during the battle, Jutland was instantly controversial and remains so. Who were the real winners and who the heroes or villains? Was it \u201cthe battle that won the war\u201d, as Jellicoe partisan and ex-defence minister, Admiral Lord West, reasserted on Radio 4. or a missed opportunity to repeat Nelson\u2019s comprehensive destruction of the French and Spanish fleets at Trafalgar in 1805 and end the war more quickly?

Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images    As a much diminished Britain prepares to debate the painful findings of Sir John Chilcot\u2019s report on the 2003 Iraq war, the \u201cJutland Controversy\u201d \u2013 as it quickly became known \u2013 serves to remind us of the fearsome cost of military miscalculation and how a victorious commander can be as readily pilloried for caution as a reckless one by a glory-hungry press. The basic facts  are that in 1898 the new German empire of Kaiser Wilhelm II decided to challenge Britain\u2019s centuries-old, worldwide naval dominance by building its first fleet. A naval arms race followed, focused on super battleships known as dreadnoughts. Britain won numerically, but new technologies, notably mines and submarines, complicated the equation. When war broke out in 1914, the Royal Navy set about blockading Germany while German U-boats sank allied shipping on a prodigious scale.           Tony Blair comments on long-awaited Chilcot inquiry    Both aimed to starve the other into submission while the rival fleets \u2013 one at Scapa Flow in the Orkneys, the other at Wilhelmshaven on the Jade bay of the North Sea \u2013 waited in stalemate as profound as in muddy Flanders. Heavily outnumbered, the imperial High Seas Fleet, commanded by Reinhard Scheer sought to even things up with raids on east coast towns such as Scarborough, hoping to lure Beatty\u2019s rapid response cruisers into a bitesized trap. Under pressure to help the German army, bleeding from another futile \u201cbreakthrough\u201d initiative around the French fort of Verdun, Scheer took his fleet to sea on 31 May 1916. But, not for the first or last time, British codebreakers were ahead of him. Jellicoe had already put to sea 28 dreadnoughts (against Scheer\u2019s 16) and other warships, bent on a counter-trap. In preliminary skirmishes between the lighter battlecruiser squadrons of admirals Franz Hipper and Beatty, Germany\u2019s relative novices sank more British ships, 14 to 11 lost, and claimed a great victory as soon as they got safely back to port. But as soon as he unexpectedly caught sight of Jellicoe\u2019s awe-inspiring Grand Fleet \u2013 opening fire and brilliantly positioned at high speed to destroy him in the rays of a setting sun \u2013 Scheer fled. He immediately turned his highly trained fleet 180 degrees and escaped his pursuers via a second bold change of course under cover of darkness. In London, Arthur Balfour (of Balfour Declaration fame), First Lord of the Admiralty after the Dardenelles-disgraced Winston Churchill, later remarked: \u201cIt is not customary for victors to run away.\u201d  But, as its reaction to the Dublin Easter Rising had just shown the world, Whitehall\u2019s stuffed shirts were hopeless at PR. For several days the Germans were allowed to proclaim a triumph in what they called the Battle of Skagerrak, while London said nothing.     British ships in the Battle of Jutland. Photograph: Express/Getty Images    After all, Beatty\u2019s cruisers had been beaten by a smaller force, the 113,000 tonnage lost was, like the death rate, double Germany\u2019s loss, even when the Germans were forced to tell the whole truth about their own losses and damage. Short of information and outraged at its failure, the press turned on the navy. Battered ships returning to port were booed. The Admiralty had to call for Churchill\u2019s deft pen to restore some perspective.  But Germany\u2019s tactical victory masked a strategic defeat of great consequence. As a New York newspaper explained to its readers, most of them keen to stay out of a European bloodbath, \u201cthe German fleet has assaulted its jailer, but it is still in jail\u201d. The blockade\u2019s slow strangulation continued.  In consequence, Scheer swung his prestige behind those generals loudly demanding a resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare. It had already been twice attempted, then curtailed for fear of provoking war with the nascent power of the US. Now the desperate calculation became that, if Britain could be crippled, the war might be won on the western front \u2013 as it was soon to be against Russia \u2013 before the Americans could organise an army and intervene decisively. As with Hitler in 1940-41, Britain was waiting for an American intervention and German mistakes. Berlin duly took a conscious gamble and it failed. In April 1917, its mediation efforts spurned and its ships being sunk, an angry America entered the war and made the predicted difference. Four days after the 11 November 1918 armistice, when German admirals came to negotiate the surrender of their fleet to Beatty in the Firth of Forth, their sailors were in open mutiny, having refused a last-minute plan to attack the Grand Fleet. Instead they endured humiliation. One starving senior officer in the surrender party was caught stealing a piece of cheese from HMS Queen Elizabeth\u2019s table. Six months later, a week before the new German republic signed the humiliating Treaty of Versailles, their crews scuttled and sank most of the 74 rotting ships of the High Seas Fleet interned in Scapa Flow. Only then could Scheer talk of honour restored.  But what of Jellicoe\u2019s honour? Churchill would later write that he had been \u201cthe only man on either side who could lose the war in an afternoon\u201d by way of a major defeat in the North Sea. A modest man, much-loved by his officers and men, Jellicoe was also a cautious perfectionist of centralising instinct. So Sir John turned his great battle fleet to the east \u2013 to port, not starboard \u2013 at the crucial moment at Jutland when Scheer did his U-turn. Going west would have offered greater opportunities to destroy the enemy, but also greater risk from submarines (torpedoes were Scheer\u2019s speciality) and from mines. Jellicoe was not a man to take a risk he didn\u2019t need to take. A draw that upheld Britain\u2019s dominant status quo was good enough.

But Beatty, a hunting-and-shooting socialite with a rich and glamorous American wife, let it be known almost immediately that he disagreed. He had done his job, delivering Scheer\u2019s fleet into Jellicoe\u2019s hands, in the \u201ccrossed T\u201d formation of which every admiral dreamed. Jellicoe had flunked it.  The truth, as usual, was messier. Modern British battleship design had sacrificed armour plating for speed and those great 15-inch guns that now greet visitors to the Imperial War Museum had failings. Its shells were poorly designed and did less damage than they should. Communication between the Admiralty and the fleet, as well as between ships, was not that much advanced on Nelson\u2019s own, primitive by 1939 standards, let alone today\u2019s.  Systemic failures were matched by tactical ones. Whitehall blundering failed to alert Jellicoe to Scheer\u2019s exact movements. More extraordinary still, Beatty failed to tell his chief where exactly the enemy was heading and at what speed \u2013 vital to interception in poor visibility \u2013 a silence that lasted from 4.45pm to 6.06pm. Later he would fiddle the record and suppress the official history of the battle to exculpate himself, as Nick Jellicoe, the admiral\u2019s grandson, explained on Channel 4 this month. Beatty won the immediate PR war and got control of the levers of power. First succeeding Jellicoe as commander of the Grand Fleet (Jellicoe went ashore to be first sea lord), he then became first sea lord after the armistice while Jellicoe was dispatched to distant New Zealand as governor general. Never mind that Beatty\u2019s cruisers had been beaten by Hipper\u2019s inferior force. \u201cSomething wrong with our bloody ships today,\u201d he remarked as another one blew up with 1,000 lost lives. Poor gunnery practice and carelessness with safety regulations (to increase the rate of fire) was part of the story. Beatty\u2019s style was \u201cmore inspirational than preparation\u201d, Admiral West said on Radio 4. But Beatty was as glamorous and self-promoting as Jellicoe was not. He was made an earl and granted \u00a3100,000 by parliament, Jellicoe initially only a viscount (and \u00a350,000). Papers such as the Daily Mail and a string of early books promoted Beatty\u2019s version of events and denigrated Jellicoe. It was years before they were challenged, less by Jellicoe than by his outraged captains.  In his own history of the war, The World Crisis, Churchill equivocated, torn between his awareness of Jellicoe\u2019s cautious wisdom and his own preference for the gloryseekers. In our own times, scholarly works such as Andrew Gordon\u2019s The Rules of the Game (1996) have put the arguments fairly in the wider context of their times.  But the story is a familiar one, which will be as evident in the pages of the Chilcot report as the postmortem on Jutland. Political imperatives compromise military strategy, which veers between reckless and cautious. Poorly designed or outdated equipment is found wanting in the heat of battle. The armchair press and war-weary public longs for stirring victories and seek scapegoats when they do not happen. Politicians, officials and commanders shamelessly pass the buck and cover up their mistakes.  Beatty made it up with Jellicoe to the extent of acting as a pallbearer at his funeral, despite evident poor health. It prompted a bystander to pass him a glass of brandy as the procession passed along Fleet Street, where he had won so many battles. Beatty died four months later. In 1948, busts of them both were unveiled in Trafalgar Square on the anniversary of Nelson\u2019s greatest victory. In death, as in all ambitious British admirals\u2019 lives, Nelson still overshadows them.",
