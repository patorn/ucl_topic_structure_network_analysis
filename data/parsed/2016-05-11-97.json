  "body": "Less than a fortnight before the French Open, Roger Federer admits he is \u201cfar from 100%\u201d fit and the fear that his run of 65 consecutive grand slam appearances could be about to end is now more than idle speculation. Two of his perennial rivals, Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic, joined the 34-year-old Swiss in the third round of the Italian Open with satisfactory wins on Wednesday but kept their professional distance when asked if they shared wider concerns about his immediate future. \u201cI was expecting to lose in straight sets,\u201d Federer said after a typically measured early-round performance to turn back the precocious challenge of the German teenager Alexander Zverev, 6-3, 7-5.   Related: Roger Federer defeats Alexander Zverev in Rome Masters    In 18 years on the Tour, Federer has rarely been troubled by physical problems but he has already pulled out of two tournaments since the Australian Open to protect a back problem and a knee that required the first surgery of his career. Murray opened his campaign with a routine 6-3, 6-3 win over the Kazak qualifier Mikhail Kukushkin, although he struggled with the low bounce and swirling wind on the tournament\u2019s second court. It was a sound, unspectacular performance, one to steady the nerves rather than raise the spirits. Asked what he thought of Federer\u2019s doubts about finishing let alone winning the tournament, Murray said: \u201cMaybe he doesn\u2019t feel his best right now but he knows himself and his body better than any of us, so I take his word for it.\u201d Federer said: \u201cI only decided after the warm-up that I was going to play. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m going to feel tomorrow [against Dominic Thiem]. I hope I can play. But I\u2019m literally going practice to practice. Every 15 minutes, I speak to Ivan [Ljubicic] or Severin [Luthi] and say: \u2018What else can we do?\u2019 \u201cIt\u2019s baby steps right now. To even to think of tomorrow is already a big ask. It was a calculated risk to play at all, so I\u2019m super pleased that I was able to play, let alone to win. \u201cLooking ahead for next few weeks, regardless if I\u2019m going to play tomorrow or not, this was something I feel like I needed to do to get a sense of where I\u2019m at. It would have been easy not to play and then just be unsure how I was going to feel in Paris. At some point you have to go out there and see how it feels, and I\u2019m happy I was able to play a full match without any setbacks. \u201cI\u2019m far from being 100% right now, so I still have some work to do. There is a lot to be done in the next 12 days so that I have a base, a level, which is really important to have. I\u2019m not going to be coming from no man\u2019s land. I\u2019m going to be coming from a level which is totally acceptable. I have done as much as I possibly could in the last four months. \u201cI have been unfortunate with Miami and now Madrid [both of which he missed]. That setback was unnecessary but it happened. It was unfortunate. Looking forward, I\u2019m not even thinking one second about the Olympic Games [in August], because there is going to be a lot of tennis played before that, hopefully.\u201d Djokovic, not entirely convincing in subduing St\u00e9phane Robert 7-5, 7-5, said of the Federer conundrum: \u201cHe\u2019s still in the tournament.\u201d And his back problem? Djokovic paused, and said: \u201cThe spine is a core, a foundation of every human\u2019s body, and especially athletes. But also it\u2019s vulnerable, especially if you are playing many matches, training, and, having to be adapting to different conditions. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have big teams of people, physiotherapists that are experts in their field. We spend a lot of time on the tables, trust me, before training, before the match, after the match, a lot of time, a lot of time stretching, doing different kinds of exercises for strengthening, prevention. \u201cIf you really want to play at the top\u00a0and if you want to be a candidate for a top spot\u00a0in the world, you need to be healthy. In order to be healthy, you need to really\u00a0be devoted for several hours a day to your body.\u201d They are a tough, unsentimental lot, these tennis players.",
