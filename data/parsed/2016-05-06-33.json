  "body": "BBC director general Tony Hall has hit back at reports that the government plans to scale back the BBC, adding that the interests of commercial rivals should not dictate plans for its future.  Writing in the Guardian, Hall said audiences \u201cabove all want our creativity enhanced not diminished\u201d.    Related: Britain\u2019s people, not its politicians, own the BBC. And they don\u2019t want it reduced | Tony Hall    \u201cThey will not want to see plans to reduce the scale and scope of the BBC so it can do less for them at home and less for Britain abroad,\u201d he added.    Related: Gary Lineker: John Whittingdale is a chump over BBC demise joke    \u201cThey want a distinctive BBC \u2013 creatively ambitious, takes creative risks and finds and works with the next generation of talent and not a BBC constrained by over-regulation and box ticking.\u201d Citing nominations for Mark Rylance in Wolf Hall, Idris Elba in Luther and Suranne Jones in Doctor Foster at Sunday\u2019s Bafta awards, Hall said he wanted to \u201cmake sure that we are winning Baftas in five years\u2019 time\u201d. He pointed out that the BBC accounts for more than half of all this year\u2019s nominations, but less than a fifth of the UK\u2019s TV revenues. Recent reports have indicated that culture secretary John Whittingdale is planning to limit the BBC, including restricting its ability to make popular shows and schedule them in prime time, subjecting it to more regular charter reviews, and giving some of its licence fee income to other broadcasters for programming such as arts and children\u2019s shows.  It is likely to publish a white paper, which will set out plans for the new royal charter for the BBC starting in 2017, as early as next week. Hall said that audiences wanted the BBC to remain \u201cnot everything to everybody, but something great to everybody,\u201d and urged the government not to renege on last year\u2019s licence fee settlement, which he said included a guarantee that no \u201ctop-slicing\u201d of the BBC budget would take place. Describing the public debate over the BBC\u2019s future as \u201ccompletely legitimate\u201d and negotiations with ministers as \u201cconstructive and good-natured\u201d, he said he believed the government also \u201cwant a BBC where its best days lie ahead\u201d.  He added: \u201cWhat has been heartwarming about this debate is that there has been a greater consensus behind the need for the BBC than I can ever remember. But important as industry interests have been in the debate, they shouldn\u2019t determine what\u2019s in the white paper\u201d.",
