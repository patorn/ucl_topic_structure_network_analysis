  "body": "NO, REALLY: LEICESTER CITY ARE PREMIER LEAGUE CHAMPIONS Today\u2019s Fiver will obviously be on Leicester City winning the Premier League. Of course, if we\u2019d thought it obvious to have a fiver on Leicester City winning the Premier League last August, we\u2019d be \u00a325,000 richer and you\u2019d be sitting there looking at an empty screen, wondering why your daily dose of football news hadn\u2019t yet turned up considering the momentousness of this particular moment in English sporting history. It has been well documented that Claudio Ranieri\u2019s ragbag assortment of cast-offs, journeymen and bargain basement buys were 5,000-1 to win the title before a ball had been kicked this season. To put this in some sort of perspective, at the moment, the 5,000-1 shots du jour with William Hill include the discovery of the Loch Ness monster, Elvis Presley to return from the dead and the discovery of intelligent extra terrestrial life. And there\u2019s no shame in admitting it, dear reader; last August you\u2019d have considered any of those three scenarios coming to pass considerably less preposterous than the likelihood of Leicester City winning the Premier League.   Related: Leicester City\u2019s triumph: the inside story of an extraordinary season | Stuart James    Indeed, Leicester\u2019s success has been so implausible that those \u2013 and there are many of \u201cthose\u201d \u2013 who expected them to Devon Loch it on the title run-in are probably still not entirely convinced that they have won the Premier League. Who are in fact certain there\u2019s been some sort of terrible mistake and even after the trophy has been handed over to Wes Morgan at the King Power Stadium on Saturday night and his team-mates are passing it around on the inevitable open-top bus tour through the thronged streets of the city they\u2019ve made so proud, some sombre looking blazers will intervene, repossess the cup and give it a police escort to some other club. A club with supporters who consider winning the thing a kind of birthright rather than some outlandish fairytale. A self confessed \u201cvery, very old man\u201d who will never again have to pay for a drink or meal in Leicester, Ranieri was no more or less than his usual cheerful self on his way into \u201ctraining\u201d (The Fiver\u2019s wagering there weren\u2019t too many shuttle runs done on Tuesday morning), as he stopped to oblige waiting reporters by doing an \u2018Arry out his car window. \u201cI said every time I am very happy for the fans, for the chairman and for all the Leicester community,\u201d he beamed. \u201cI don\u2019t know the secret. The players, the heart, the soul and how they play. My message to the fans is now to keep going, we want to improve a lot.\u201d He\u2019s not the only one who doesn\u2019t know the secret. While some \u201cexperts\u201d were baffled by his appointment last year, it was openly ridiculed by others and now they are all tasked with the complex job of trying to make sense of it all. Good luck to them, because beyond a rather simplistic perfect storm of hard work, shrewd but simple tactics, good luck with knack and the surprisingly erratic form of other teams it makes no sense. Leicester City are the Premier League champions and The Fiver hopes all concerned cherish and enjoy their moment. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Barry Glendenning from 7.45pm BST for hot MBM coverage of Bayern Munich 1-1 Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in Big Cup semi-finals (agg: 1-2). QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cIt is not nice to see for kids here or kids watching on TV. I apologise if it looked bad on TV. It is a London derby. It is to be expected. We wanted to win and they wanted to stop us having any more say in the title race \u2026 I couldn\u2019t tell you what happened, it was just handbags being thrown. I saw the Chelsea manager fell on the floor. I hope he is all right\u201d \u2013 Tottenham\u2019s Danny Rose, one of a record nine Spurs players to be booked in their hilarious 2-2 draw at Chelsea, sort-of-apologises for the fun and games at Stamford Bridge. None required, Danny, none required.     Chelsea\u2019s Diego Costa engages in a full and frank exchange with Tottenham\u2019s Michel Vorm.

Now I\u2019m sat outside HR dressed as Batman. Thanks a bunch, Fiver (the old ones, etc and so forth)\u201d \u2013 Derek McGee. \u201cHaving read your tea-timely email on Friday, I was struck by the similarity of your words describing Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, \u2018the erstwhile professor who these days looks like a shuffling old schoolmaster who everyone watches sadly and says should\u2019ve retired a few years ago\u2019, with the story enacted in the 1939 film Goodbye Mr Chips. For your young reader, the latter tells the story of a schoolteacher, Mr Chipping, and his 43-year career at Brookfield Grammar School, a second-rate boys\u2019 public school. During his career, Chips is elevated to Senior Master and forced to deal with the loss of pupils and proteges to greater things (The Great War) and, in one particularly prescient case, with a colleague who ends up fighting on the opposite side. The film is of course prophetic in another sense in that the teacher\u2019s nickname is the same as that of the current Arsenal chairman. As further evidence of the similarity, I attach a photo showing Wengs flanked by Ivan and Sir Chips during recent negotiations for a lifetime extension to his contract, which might, just as convincingly, have been extracted directly from the film\u201d \u2013 Ian Tasker. \u201cI saw Louis van Gaal grabbing the hair of a journalist and talking about acceptable behaviour in \u2018$ex masochism\u2019 this weekend. Fair play to the Dutchman, he\u2019s really worked at introducing new torture methods into football this season \u2013 the fans, the English language, and now even hacks are screaming in pain and begging for mercy. Hats off to King Louis, but you can leave your studs and stockings on, perhaps\u201d \u2013 Justin Kavanagh.  \u2022 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And if you\u2019ve nothing better to do you can also tweet The Fiver. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Ian Tasker.

BITS AND BOBS Fairytale dept: Bournemouth were fined \u00a37.6m by the Football League for breaching FFP rules in their promotion-winning season. Kosovo have become the 55th member of Uefa after being accepted at the governing body\u2019s annual conference by 28 votes to 24. \u201cIt would create tumult in the region and open a Pandora\u2019s box throughout Europe,\u201d declared Serbian FA president Tomislav Karadzic before the decision. Leicester are there, Tottenham, barring a meltdown of Tottenham-sized proportions, are there, and there could be three more English teams in next season\u2019s Big Cup. All hail the co-efficient! That does require Manchester City beating Real Madrid and winning Big Cup though \u2013 a task made harder with the news that He is fit for the second leg of their semi-final. Bayern have also been boosted before facing Atl\u00e9tico after Franck Rib\u00e9ry was passed fit following back-knack. May as well use Trump for something. Sheffield Wednesday will kick off the Championship play-offs on Friday 13 (oooooohhh!) May against either Middlesbrough or Brighton. And in news that probably won\u2019t come as a surprise, the Alex McLeish experiment at Zamalek has ended in failure and his abrupt exit after 65 days days at the helm. STILL WANT MORE? The definitive inside story on Leicester City\u2019s extraordinary season. Spoiler alert: contains encyclopaedic levels of knowledge from Stuart James.     Like Hot Fuzz then! The sneaks. Photograph: Plumb Images/Leicester City FC via Getty Images    Ranieri\u2019s success at Leicester proves that nice guys do not always come second, reckons Owen Gibson.  \u201cDo not adjust your reality: this really is happening \u2026\u201d begins Barney Ronay, on the miracle that was not supposed to happen. Happen it did however, and here\u2019s each of Leicester\u2019s 36 matches dissected to prove it. Still don\u2019t believe it, watch this. Leicester were 5,000-1 and all that, but Greg Wood busts some myths about those poor bookies. You\u2019d be forgiven for missing it, what with the amount of Leicester coverage clogging up the internet like stolen bantz account tweets, but Burnley rubber-stamped their promotion on Monday. Paul Wilson on the Premier League return of Sean Dyche and co. Let\u2019s not forget that Leicester have been crowned champions because  last summer Nigel Pearson\u2019s so \u2026  Tottenham let a two-goal lead slip in the Battle of the Bridge. Simon Burnton bore witness to a side losing the plot. Newspaper front pages from around the world, featuring fairytales, miracles and King Claudios aplenty.
