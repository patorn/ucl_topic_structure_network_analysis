Led by 33-year-old Colum Eastwood, the Social Democratic and Labour party (SDLP) is defending one of its last redoubts in this week\u2019s elections to the Stormont assembly.    Related: 5 May: your guide to this week's local and mayoral elections    The constituency of Foyle \u2013 bisected by the river of the same name, with the Donegal hills visible across the border in the west \u2013 is home to the former SDLP leader and Nobel peace prize winner John Hume. It is also the party\u2019s electoral stronghold, with the SDLP defending three of Foyle\u2019s six seats.  But the SDLP under Eastwood \u2013 the youngest party leader in the UK or Ireland \u2013 faces a major threat in the guise of another internationally famous Derry man, Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s Martin McGuinness.  The former IRA chief of staff turned deputyfirst minister of Northern Ireland has moved back to Foyle after representing Mid Ulster both as an MP and assembly member. McGuinness\u2019s return to his native city threatens to undermine Eastwood\u2019s efforts to revive a party that has been eclipsed by Sinn F\u00e9in during the peace process years.

Under the complex and unique rules of power sharing, the last devolved government operated on a near-mandatory basis where almost every party took seats in the regional cabinet. This meant at one stage in the last parliamentary term there were only two assembly members on the opposition benches.  McGuinness shares power with his unionist counterpart Arlene Foster, the first minister and leader of the largest political force in the assembly, the Democratic Unionists. The DUP is expected to remain the largest party after 5 May with Sinn F\u00e9in still the strongest nationalist force.

On an unseasonably chilly Friday evening in Derry\u2019s Pennyburn area, the issue of opposition was put to Eastwood as he rapped on doors and dealt with more mundane constituency queries ranging from cycle lanes to derelict houses.  Eastwood said: \u201cNationalists have been in opposition in the north of Ireland for decades and people expect us to offer a programme for government. It\u2019s far too early to be talking about opposition but after the elections we will sit down with the other parties and see what kind of programme for government is on offer. If it\u2019s not the one we could support then we will think about opposition but it\u2019s too early to say that yet.\u201d For Eastwood, a good result in Foyle would mean him and his two running mates, Gerard Diver and Mark H Durkan, returning to the assembly.  Behind Derry\u2019s historic Guildhall, where the Bloody Sunday tribunal was held, is a massive billboard advertising the leading lights of Sinn F\u00e9in including McGuinness and the party president, Gerry Adams. It is a reminder for Eastwood and his party that they have an uphill struggle to repel the Sinn F\u00e9in onslaught, let alone lead a region-wide recovery.  McGuinness was the star of Sinn F\u00e9in\u2019s manifesto launch in Derry last week, where he promised the party would create 50,000 new jobs and spend more than \u00a31bn extra on the local health service. Signalling a willingness to cooperate further with the DUP, McGuinness said the two parties had similar commitments on jobs and health.

Photograph: David Young/PA    He told a packed audience, including the party\u2019s 39 candidates: \u201cYou can see the similarities between what the DUP and ourselves are saying. \u201cI think that should be, if you like, a clear indicator to people out there that at least we and the DUP are getting our act together and also being part of an administration which is prepared to confront sectarianism, racism and homophobia.\u201d Both the SDLP and Sinn F\u00e9in face two challenges from the left. The veteran socialist Eamonn McCann is standing for the Marxist People Before Profit party, and a popular local GP in the Creggan estate, one of the top three most deprived wards in the UK, is being backed by an amalgam of dissident republican groups in the city.  Dr Anne McCloskey describes herself as \u201can independent republican\u201d but stresses that she opposes political violence. Despite many of those canvassing for her from the republican socialist left, McCloskey is resolutely against abortion reform and is \u201cpro-life\u201d. Despiteholding views on abortion that conflict with a lot of her campaign team, she believes she can capitalise on a general cynicism in Derry about the regional parliament in Belfast. \u201cIf elected I am going to be a bloody nuisance in that parliament,\u201d the 57-year-old said.  \u201cThe feeling here in Derry is that most of the resources controlled by the Northern Ireland executive stay in the east. We still don\u2019t have a fully fledged university in this city and our sole campus is being cut to bits.\u201d  McCann points to the same failings, with Derry home to some of the poorest electoral wards in the UK.   Related: Northern Ireland gay community mobilises against DUP candidates    \u201cThere has been no peace dividend for Derry and most people feel that up here. This time around I think the message is hitting home that maybe we can do it, that we can challenge the big party machines in Derry and take a seat. Once that happens it sends out a signal to wider society that the sectarian stranglehold can be broken everywhere,\u201d McCann said.  All of the Derry candidates, including the two rival unionists fighting over the city\u2019s one pro-union seat, face a common enemy this time: apathy. Voter turnout used to be the highest in the UK but in the last few elections has fallen sharply. \u201cTurnout is everything in this election,\u201d said Eastwood. \u201cMy message to voters is that if you want a change, if you are disillusioned by an executive dominated by Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP, then don\u2019t stay at home \u2013 come out and vote for an alternative.\u201d",
