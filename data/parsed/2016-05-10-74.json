  "body": "The criminalisation of payment for sex would dissuade sex workers from reporting violence against them, Brooke Magnanti, the former London call girl better known by her alias Belle de Jour, has told a group of MPs.  Appearing before a home affairs select committee hearing on prostitution and the sex industry, Magnanti, 40, a research scientist, blogger and author, said: \u201cIf you criminalise buying sex, the prostitute knows she becomes the evidence. Police will be instantly suspicious, they ask to see your papers, examine your premises. She might be coerced by police into giving evidence against other people.\u201d The committee is looking into the way prostitution is dealt with in legislation, and in particular whether the balance in the burden of criminality should shift to those who pay for sex. While prostitution is legal in the UK, related activities such as soliciting for sex in a public place or owning or managing a brothel are outlawed.   Related: Brooke Magnanti: 'I couldn\u2019t go on writing Belle de Jour books'    Magnanti said MPs needed to focus on the root causes driving people into sex work, \u201cthings like migration policy and the social safety net\u201d. \u201cYou have people who are marginally in the black going into red because of the bedroom tax, and the failure of the social system to catch them,\u201d she said. Magnati worked as a call girl between 2003 and 2004 in order to supplement her income while completing her doctoral studies, and is estimated to have earned more than \u00a3100,000 in that period.  \u201cI am a non-EU migrant, when I submitted my PHD there was zero funding and I had no recourse to public funds, I could either not have the science career I\u2019d been working for a decade to get to or I could do sex work,\u201d she said. \u201cI saw it as a stopgap, in the way that a lot of students would choose to work behind a bar.  \u201cI come from a reasonably privileged and safe background. Don\u2019t those who don\u2019t deserve to feel as safe as me doing the work? Don\u2019t they deserve to be able to go to the authorities?\u201d Magnanti appeared alongside Paris Lees, a journalist and equality campaigner who has also previously been a sex worker. Both were critical of the witnesses the select committee had called to question as part of the inquiry. \u201cOf the four sex workers you\u2019ve spoken [to] face to face, three of us aren\u2019t doing it any more,\u201d Magnanti told the committee\u2019s chair, Keith Vaz.

People from the Sex Worker Open University, people from the English Collective of Prostitutes, current sex workers. They weren\u2019t asked because me and Paris come with great media platforms, we bring attention, so you can tick a box and say we spoke to some ex-sex workers. I retired in 2004, I can tell you everything about what was happening in 2003 and 2004, the laws aren\u2019t going to affect me. You need to speak with the biggest stakeholders.\u201d  Both witnesses emphasised that violence against women and trafficking were already illegal. They warned against trusting reduced crime statistics from countries such as Sweden and Northern Ireland, where it is unlawful to buy sex.  \u201cPart of the problem with statistics being currently produced by Sweden is they don\u2019t have statistics [from] before the law came into place,\u201d Magnanti said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t polling any sex workers to get a before and after. I deal on a daily basis with population statistics and there are a lot of them bandied about. Countries like Sweden and Northern Ireland have no basis for comparison.

I agree that even one is too many, which is why you need input from sex worker-led organisations.\u201d  In Sweden, she added, reduced rates of prostitution did not concern all sex work, \u201cjust visible, on-the-street sex work, the cliche of women leaning into cars. Other evidence shows indoor sex work has gone up. Trafficking has also gone up. If women don\u2019t feel safe with the police, they go to criminals.\u201d  Magnanti said decriminalisation was not a \u201cfree for all\u201d but merely a first step. \u201cIn New Zealand [where there is a licensing system in place], sex work was so highly stigmatised, and there is still violence, but it\u2019s improving,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople feel individual instances of violence against sex workers [are] going down. You have to put the law in context of the society it\u2019s enacted in.\u201d  Lees said: \u201cLet\u2019s say you\u2019ve got a client who\u2019s going to see an escort, they think the person seems a little on edge, doesn\u2019t seem happy and they suspect they\u2019ve been trafficked. What client is going to go to the police and raise concerns if they know they\u2019re going to be outed as a criminal?\u201d",
