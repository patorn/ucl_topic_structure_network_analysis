  "body": "Ian Gill, owner of the Shailer Park Mitre 10 franchise, was a Liberal campaign extra from central casting. Which is exactly why the Liberal National party member for the marginal Brisbane seat of Forde, Bert van Manen, chose him for Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s visit on Tuesday.           Election campaign day two: Turnbull talks jobs and growth in Forde    With an annual turnover of $3.2m, Gill will be getting a tax cut that he wouldn\u2019t have got before Turnbull\u2019s \u201cjobs and growth economic plan for a new economy\u201d was unveiled in last week\u2019s budget. And, unsurprisingly, Gill\u2019s pretty happy about it. \u201cLooking forward to the enterprise tax cuts in the budget?\u201d Turnbull asked, rhetorically, bounding into the store. \u201cYes, they should be quite good for us,\u201d Gill replied. \u201cCan I just say we are so committed to supporting businesses like yours,\u201d Turnbull told Gill. \u201cYou are the engine room of the economy.   Related: Campaign catchup: deal or no deal with the Greens?    \u201cWe always say that but it is absolutely true. This is where the additional investment comes from, this is where the jobs and growth are being found ... We recognise that the fastest growth in jobs comes from the ability to respond in firms like yours. It is so much greater than the big firms, the big firms respond too, but you\u2019re in a position to move so fast,\u201d Turnbull said, as Gill nodded and the cameras whirred and the fluffy boom mics hovered overhead. Gill was also extremely worried about the competition he is about to face from three big hardware stores about to move into the area. \u201cWe feel the competition laws are tipped too heavily in favour of the big guys,\u201d he told Turnbull. \u201cWell, Ian, that is a really good point and one of the changes we are making is to section 46 of the competition laws,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cWe are introducing an effects test, to give businesses like yours more protection from the big guys.\u201d So far, so wonderfully on message. Unless you switch on your critical faculties. The chief executive of the Council of Small Business, Peter Strong, who fought for years for the changes to competition law, confirms they would almost certainly not help Gill\u2019s looming competition from the \u201cbig guys\u201d at all. \u201cIf one or two big hardware stores move into an area where a small hardware store is operating, there\u2019s really nothing you can do about that. It\u2019s just competition,\u201d he said. So if the \u201cbig guys\u201d are about to move in, and it does have the effect Gill is fearing, he might not be growing or employing even with the tax cut. And even putting the looming competition to one side, when Gill gets a tax cut will it definitely boost \u201cjobs and growth\u201d? Gill tells Guardian Australia he\u2019ll use the extra money either to put on another staff member (he now employs eight full-time and two part-time) or buy extra stock and \u201cmake more money\u201d.

He said jobs and growth would be an \u201cinevitable consequence\u201d and returned to the Treasury paper he cited on Monday that he says showed that every $1 of tax cuts delivered a $4 boost to the economy, conceding that this dividend would be delivered over \u201cthe longer term\u201d. But, according to the chief executive of the Grattan Institute, John Daley, most of the economic impact of the tax cuts will be felt when they extend to big business, and the impact on employment from tax cuts for small businesses , like Gill\u2019s, is \u201csmall even on the government\u2019s own estimates\u201d. \u201cAccording to the most recent working paper released by Treasury the economic effect of the tax cuts is about 0.6% of GDP... and only about half of that will have eventuated in 18 years time, the rest will come in 28 years time.\u201d But none of this was possible to even talk about in the contrived situation of an election campaign, despite the $48bn jobs package being Turnbull\u2019s major offering and the major point of policy difference with Labor. And that phenomenon is not confined to the Coalition. Journalists \u2013 apart from the few questions allowed by each leader at their daily doorstop \u2013 are really becoming for the most part just added extras in an elaborate pantomime, unless there is a \u201cgaffe\u201d. And of course the absolute need to avoid such \u201cgaffes\u201d gives the campaign organisers on both sides even more incentive to make sure no actual debate, no real discussion, intrudes on the whole contrived circus. Which raises the question as to whether the Truman Show nature of election campaigns has finally outlived its useful purpose? Over the years voters have gradually been privy to more of the process by which prime ministerial contenders interact with \u201cordinary people\u201d who just happen to hold opinions, and be encountered in situations, that fit the politicians\u2019 desired message. Like the viewers in the movie The Truman Show, voters always knew it wasn\u2019t entirely real \u2013 the prime minister didn\u2019t drop into any old factory, the opposition leader didn\u2019t turn up unannounced to that school. And an occasional wide shot of the backwards-walking media scrum was a glimpse of the artificial nature of the process.   Related: Punishing workload v independence: are small businesses really the answer?    But now, via a constant stream of video and pictures and commentary via every type of social and traditional media, they can almost watch the process from the inside. Often the only thing reporters on the road can offer that reporters watching live feeds in their offices cannot is the view from \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d. But that view regularly looks pretty ridiculous.  Which raises the question, after 55 days, will the \u201ccampaign trail\u201d serve a useful purpose for the politicians, or for journalism, or for voters?",
