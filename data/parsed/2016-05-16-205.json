  "body": "The strong plot, the exotic setting, the quotable, piquant dialogue, the cherished performances from a magnificent cast and the emotional Max Steiner score \u2013 not forgetting Dooley Wilson as Sam playing As Time Goes By \u2013 have ensured that Casablanca (1942) remains the most popular film from Hollywood\u2019s golden age. Madeleine LeBeau (sometimes credited as Lebeau), who has died aged 92, the last surviving member of the cast, was among those whom cinephiles have sanctified for her special connection with Casablanca. LeBeau played Yvonne, one of the many French refugees seeking solace in the Caf\u00e9 Americain, run by Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), a cynical isolationist. You must remember this \u2026 at the bar sits the attractive Yvonne, who has obviously been drowning her sorrows because Rick has jilted her. \u201cWhere were you last night?\u201d she asks him as he passes by. \u201cThat\u2019s so long ago, I don\u2019t remember,\u201d Rick replies. \u201cWill I see you tonight?\u201d she ventures. \u201cI never make plans that far ahead,\u201d he tells her coldly. A few scenes later, when the resistance leader Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid) asks the band to play La Marseillaise, in order to drown out the group of German soldiers singing the patriotic song Die Wacht am Rhein, Yvonne, in close-up, having been seen previously arm-in-arm with a Nazi officer, joins passionately and tearfully in the rendition of the French national anthem, ending with \u201cVive La France!\u201d As time goes by, LeBeau\u2019s portrayal seems better and better. What helped give her performance such passion and conviction was that LeBeau was a refugee from Nazi-occupied France. She and her Jewish husband, the actor Marcel Dalio, had fled to Lisbon in June 1940, eventually arriving in the US. Due to Dalio\u2019s connections in Hollywood with fellow French exiles such as Jean Renoir and Charles Boyer, they were both given Warner Bros contracts. LeBeau, who was born in the southern suburbs of Paris, started acting in her teens, making her film debut as a schoolgirl in GW Pabst\u2019s Young Girls in Trouble (Jeunes Filles en D\u00e9tresse), in 1939, the same year she married Dalio. In her first Hollywood film, Hold Back the Dawn (1941), starring Boyer, she had a bit part. As the glamorous Polish-born stage star Anna Held, she had a significant scene with Errol Flynn in Gentleman Jim (1942), the lively biopic of the boxer Jim Corbett. After Casablanca, she had her most substantial Hollywood role in Paris After Dark (1943) as a cafe owner who is secretly helping the resistance in Nazi-occupied Paris. Besides brilliantly handling dramatic scenes, one with a slimy collaborator played by Dalio (they were then on the verge of a divorce), LeBeau, who had a fine singing voice, delivered a soulful ballad, My Paree. On her return to France after the war, LeBeau had several roles in period pieces such as The Royalists (Les Chouans, 1947) with a swashbuckling Jean Marais, and The Secret of Monte-Cristo (1948). In the British film Cage of Gold (1950), with Jean Simmons, LeBeau had a meaty role as a Paris nightclub singer, the jealous mistress of the caddish Bill (David Farrar), whom she shoots at the end. The New York Times critic described her as being \u201cundecided whether to imitate Edith Piaf or storm the Bastille\u201d. She was in the all-star cast of Sacha Guitry\u2019s Napoleon (1955), and in La Parisienne (1957), a bedroom farce, she played Brigitte Bardot\u2019s romantic rival, trading sauciness with BB. In Fellini\u2019s celebrated metamovie 8\u00bd (1963), LeBeau played a temperamental French film star, exquisite in white fur. Then she retired and settled in Rome. In 1988 LeBeau married Tullio Pinelli, one of the screenwriters on 8 \u00bd. He died in 2009. She is survived by her stepson, Carlo Alberto Pinelli. \u2022 Marie Madeleine Berthe LeBeau, actor, born 10 June 1923; died 1 May 2016",
