  "body": "Zanny Minton Beddoes\u2019 office may have a worn and old-fashioned feel, indeed it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if it turned out it hasn\u2019t had a makeover since the Economist\u2019s arrival in 1964, but she couldn\u2019t be more focused on the shiny digital future. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be the grandpa at the disco,\u201d says Minton Beddoes, the first female editor in the business magazine\u2019s 173-year history. \u201cThe bedrock of this place is the weekly Economist but in the 21st century that is no longer enough.\u201d Building the Economist brand on social media, bearing in mind that nearly all content is behind a paywall, has been a major preoccupation since Beddoes took the reins last February. When she arrived there was just a single social media staffer, now there are nine; seven in the UK and one each in North America and Asia. \u201cIt became clear to us that we needed to have a real social media push,\u201d she says, citing more than 36 million social media \u201cfollowers\u201d, from Twitter and Facebook likes, to LinkedIn and Google+ circle members. \u201cMuch of that has happened in the last year. It\u2019s a gift horse really,\u201d she enthuses. \u201cIt is a way of telling people what you are doing, drawing in new subscribers. We have to be ourselves in social media. What does it mean to be the Economist on social media? I think a lot of what is characteristic of the Economist, its brevity and analysis, works very well actually. A very small number of articles, including the cover leader, are in front of the paywall [but] we tweet a huge number of articles.\u201d There has also been a bolstering of multimedia staff and output which includes Economist Radio, under Anne McElvoy, Economist TV and newly-minted Economist Film, which will produce 22 short documentary films this year, with titles including Drone Rangers and Drugs: War or Store?. \u201cWe are trying things editorially,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re not turning into a video company but I\u2019m a real believer that we need to try new stuff and measure how it works.\u201d The conversation seems incongruous given Minton Beddoes\u2019 spartan, dated office which includes an ancient screen, impossible to identify as either a computer or TV, on a window ledge gathering dust. Perhaps it was her predecessor John Micklethwait\u2019s, now at Bloomberg News, who also left behind a framed note from the 33 miners trapped for 69 days underground in Chile. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those buildings where the sartorial quality decreases the higher up you go,\u201d she quips, referring to the mix of corporations that occupy the floors below. \u201cIt\u2019s hedge fund, hedge fund, hedge fund, Fiat Chrysler [then] wonderfully scruffy journalists.\u201d She can look forward to an upgrade as the Economist is hunting for a new home after selling its London editorial office in St James\u2019s for around \u00a3130m in February (the commercial operation is in Canary Wharf). \u201cWe\u2019ll stay in central London. We won\u2019t go anywhere that editorial doesn\u2019t want to go,\u201d she says, adding that the building\u2019s 200 staff are \u201ccompletely squashed\u201d. \u201cWe need a new kind of space. This building is fantastic but it is not the perfect building for being a 21st-century media organisation.\u201d The decision to move formed part of the deal in which Pearson offloaded its 50% stake in the Economist Group to existing shareholders for \u00a3469m in cash last August. That change of ownership meant Exor, the investment company led by John Elkann, heir to the Fiat business a few floors below Minton Beddoes\u2019 office, become the biggest shareholder with a 43.4% stake. The deal included a 20% voting cap for any individual shareholder to safeguard the independence of the company. The biggest change in ownership in 58 years came months after she became editor, and only a year after her return to the UK, first as business affairs editor, after two decades in the US. \u201cFor me it was quite a time,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has turned out extraordinarily well. For a long time [Pearson selling] had been a big question \u2026 but it wasn\u2019t anything that I anticipated. It was not expected, at least by me.\u201d She adds that the Elkann family empire, which has interests including Juventus football club and the publishers of Corriere della Sera, a leading Italian daily newspaper, and Turin daily La Stampa, is a benign and committed shareholder. \u201c[They] are engaged but totally respectful of editorial independence,\u201d she says of Exor. \u201cThey are very committed to media and the future of premium media. There are not that many global media brands of quality. We are smaller than many but we are a pretty powerful global media brand.\u201d The 48-year old, who early in her career worked as an IMF economist alongside Jeffrey Sachs before joining the magazine in 1994, has also taken an \u201cevolution not revolution\u201d approach to updating the Economist\u2019s editorial. This has included introducing more \u201cbig ideas\u201d reporting, such as its exploration of assisted suicide and the right to die. About half the covers in the last year have been \u201cnon-news\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018viewspaper\u2019 idea,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m deeply liberal. I\u2019m passionate about pushing that agenda. Social liberalism ... as well as economic and financial liberalism.\u201d The most popular edition in years was the Economist\u2019s anti-Brexit edition, which she says was a newsstand sell-out. \u201cWe came out very early and clearly with where we stood on Brexit. By a long shot it was our best-performing cover. It wasn\u2019t a sell-out because of our position. It was a sell-out because people really want a detailed, fact-based analysis. And that is what it was.\u201d Despite this success, as at other publishers print sales at the Economist have fallen across the globe, although the circulation still stands at 1.25m copies a week. Digital edition sales have broken through the 300,000 mark, up by 50% or more year-on-year in most markets, including the UK but not North and South America. Minton Beddoes says the print decline is in part to do with a \u201cdrive to quality\u201d - getting rid of bulk copies and converting readers to paid subscribers. \u201cThe overall circulation is slightly down but the profitability of our circulation is rising and print is still holding up remarkably well,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m completely agnostic [about whether] people read print or digital, I really want them to have a premium subscription giving them access to both.\u201d The Economist is still willing to embrace the potential of print, as is shown by it launching 1843, a bi-monthly magazine (which replaced Intelligent Life) aimed at the \u201cglobally curious\u201d which aims to speak to them \u201cwhen they have their feet up, on a weekend break, on holiday\u201d. Minton Beddoes says the Economist is not feeling the same extreme pressure as advertising-reliant newspaper publishers. \u201cI\u2019m very simple about this. You make money out of things people pay for,\u201d she says. \u201cSubscriptions is the bulk of our business, ads are nice to have on top of that. We are in the midst of a massively changing disrupted industry and that is incredibly exciting but it is also challenging. There are going to be winners in that and losers. It is foolish for anyone to be complacent. I am confident and hopeful and paranoid at the same time.\u201d So, nearly 18 months in, how does she feel about breaking the glass ceiling of being the first female editor of the Economist? \u201cLots of people ask me about how I feel about being the first woman editor,\u201d she says. \u201cThe answer is that I\u2019m thrilled to be doing this job and my main priority is to do it as well as I can. I can\u2019t wait for the day when it is no longer newsworthy that a woman is appointed editor of a newspaper.\u201d Curriculum vitae Age 48 Education Moreton Hall school, St Hilda\u2019s College, Oxford (PPE) Harvard University (Kennedy scholar) Career 1990 adviser to minister of finance in Poland 1992 economist, International Monetary Fund 1994 emerging-markets correspondent, the Economist 1996 US economics correspondent 2007 economics editor 2014 business affairs editor 2015 editor-in-chief",
