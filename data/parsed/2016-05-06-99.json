If I were a fugitive, a reclusive playwright, a mum or dad juggling kids and life, or a politician dripping with corruption, I\u2019d squirrel myself down a country lane off another country lane behind a hedgerow in the Marches and hope the cosmos would forget about me. It probably would, too. Nobody really comes here. This swath south of the Shropshire Hills between Ludlow and the Welsh border is a magical patch straight off the pages of Tolkien, with wooded hills, woodland elves (maybe), rustic taverns and pretty towns and villages filled with old, half-timbered houses painted black-and-white, like a crooked Mondrian. Once, it was a borderland fought over by Welsh folk heroes and English knights. Now, it\u2019s both off and under the radar, on the way to nowhere in particular. Sounds like bliss to me. The case against Not much to do, off and on the clock. It\u2019s a rural economy, so jobs are not 10 a penny; many young people leave for the bright lights of Hereford and the world beyond. Well connected? Trains: don\u2019t hold your breath. Knighton has a few a day to Shrewsbury (51 minutes) and Llandrindod (38); otherwise, drive to Leominster for trains to Hereford (15 minutes). Driving: a car would be handy \u2013 40 minutes to Hereford, Ludlow and Brecon from Kington, an hour to the M50 and thence the M5. Schools Primaries: Shobdon, Wigmore, St Mary\u2019s CofE (Bucknell) and Presteigne are all \u201cgood\u201d, say Ofsted and Estyn; Pembridge CofE and Kingsland CofE \u201coutstanding\u201d. Secondaries: Weobley High is \u201cgood\u201d, Wigmore High \u201coutstanding\u201d. Hang out at\u2026 It\u2019s all about the pub here, and what fine pubs they have, from the celebrated Stagg in Titley to The Harp in Old Radnor. Where to buy Knighton, Kington and Presteigne are the main towns, each subtly different: Knighton has a Victorian air; Presteigne\u2019s whitewashed houses with black trim make it more 18th-century; while Kington\u2019s beautiful streets have buildings from every period. I\u2019ll plump for quieter Pembridge, though, wall-to-wall with crooked, timber-framed houses. Large detacheds and town houses, \u00a3375,000-\u00a32m. Detacheds, \u00a3200,000-\u00a3375,000. Semis, \u00a3140,000-\u00a3300,000. Terraces and cottages, \u00a3110,000-\u00a3275,000. Rentals: very few \u2013 a three-bed house might be \u00a3700pcm.
