  "body": "This weekend Britain is set to receive warmth and sunlight, a wholly unexpected set of affairs for early May.  Humans in offices up and down the country are spending their Friday afternoons rubbing their hands with glee, getting minimal amounts of work done, and vaguely plotting to buy barbeque equipment and maybe a few sausages. Obviously, many of these plans will end in mild disappointment. You\u2019ll get stung by wasps. Sausages will be burned. You\u2019ll forget to pack sunscreen. You\u2019ll spend hours stuck in a traffic jam. Someone will drop ice cream down the front of your new shirt. If any of these minor disasters befall you, the GuardianWitness team would like to hear from you. Share your photos from your underwhelming weekend in the sun, and we\u2019ll put together a selection of the most average in a gallery on Monday. You can share your stories by clicking on the blue \u2018Contribute\u2019 button on this article.
