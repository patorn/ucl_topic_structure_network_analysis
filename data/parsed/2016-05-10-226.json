  "body": "The region where the Pearl River flows into the South China Sea has seen some of the most rapid urban expansion in human history over the past few decades \u2013 transforming what was mostly agricultural land in 1979 into what is the manufacturing heartland of a global economic superpower today. In 2008, China announced plans to mesh Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Dongguan, Zhaoqing, Foshan, Huizhou, Jiangmen, Zhongshan and Zhuhai into a single megacity. A series of massive infrastructure projects are under way to merge transport, energy, water and telecoms networks across the nine cities. Development has been relentless, and the World Bank recently named the Pearl River Delta as the biggest urban area in the world in terms of population and geographical size. A 30-mile-long bridge and tunnel is under construction to join the Pearl River Delta metropolis of Zhuhai to the special administrative regions of Macau and Hong Kong.

Click or tap on the image (or drag the blue button) to see the second (taken in 2000), which shows that vast swathes of farmland have turned from green to grey, and huge new areas of land reclaimed from the sea. Hong Kong  1980 population: 4.6 million; 2015 population: 7.3 million The autonomous territory, which was handed back to China by Britain in 1997 after 99 years, has more skyscrapers than any other region in the world. The high-density city has reclaimed many square miles of land from the sea, as can be seen from the shifted shoreline in the newer photograph.

The park still contains miniature replicas of China\u2019s greatest tourist sites \u2013 from the Great Wall to the Forbidden Palace, both of which are visible here \u2013 but the residential area in the background has been transformed. Guangzhou 1980 population: 1.9 million; 2015 population: 12.5 million The port of Guangzhou is the third largest city in China, and the biggest in the Pearl River Delta.

Macau 1980 population: 243,000; 2015 population: 584,000 Since the Portuguese legalised gambling in Macau in the 1850s, the city has developed into the \u201cMonte Carlo of the Orient\u201d. It is the only place in China where casinos are legal, and millions of visitors flood in every year from the mainland and Hong Kong, which has helped Macau overtake Las Vegas as the world\u2019s biggest generator of gambling revenue.
