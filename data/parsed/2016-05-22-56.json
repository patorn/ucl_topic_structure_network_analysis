Nothing has been heard since of it getting a green light as a series, but no doubt that\u2019s due to all that long-run landfill leaving scant scope for blazing emerging talent. \u2022 Also fascinating was Lygo\u2019s signal that he wanted documentaries about crime (\u201ceveryday hideousness\u201d) but wasn\u2019t content with the network\u2019s current offerings in the genre. \u201cWhat is the modern way of doing that for ITV?\u201d he wondered. \u201cIs it through Trevor McDonald or Piers Morgan?\u201d \u2013 a question that would seem to presuppose the answer \u201cno!\u201d and spell curtains for the pampered pair\u2019s crook-hunting trips to America. Next week, hopefully, he\u2019ll similarly ask aloud: \u201cwhat\u2019s the modern way for us to do a chatshow \u2013 is it through Jonathan Ross?\u201d \u2022 The way online titans assert their supremacy over waning old media can take subtle forms, as evinced by Amazon\u2019s party last week to mark the new availability of its Amazon Prime Music streaming service on Sonos. Guests throwing shapes at Sonos Studios in east London were informed that the floor there had come from the BBC Maida Vale studios across town \u2013 yes, they were literally trampling at Amazon\u2019s invitation on part of the BBC, sacred territory where the Beatles played for the Beeb, hundreds of classical concerts were recorded, and John Peel gave bands such as Nirvana, Pulp and the Smiths early breaks in his Peel Sessions. \u2022 Who knew that Jim Naughtie was ratings gold? As Press Gazette points out, the latest Rajar figures show that the Today programme had an average reach of 6.8 million listeners in post-Naughtie Q1 2016 compared with 7.1 million in Q1 2015 when he was still on board \u2013 a hefty year-on-year drop of 300,000 listeners. Possible takes on the Scot\u2019s pulling power would be that listeners tuned in in the hope of catching his occasional gaffes and trademark multi-clause questions, or that the long-running Jim \u2019n\u2019 John combo offered a comfortable familiarity that\u2019s now gone with ever-shifting pairings, often involving recently arrived presenters; another might be that with Naughtie departed all the breakfast hosts except John Humphrys are English. \u2022 \u201cSuccess has many parents, but failure is an orphan\u201d is the TV industry\u2019s truest saying, and the latest Radio Times\u2019 letters column entertainingly sees the continuation of a paternity dispute going back to the Swinging Sixties. \u201cWithout wishing to rain on my friend Sir David Attenborough\u2019s parade in [BBC1\u2019s] Attenborough At 90,\u201d chunters former BBC1 controller Paul Fox, who is also 90, \u201cMonty Python\u2019s Flying Circus did not begin on BBC2 [of which Attenborough was controller]. It began \u2026 on BBC1. In 1969. I commissioned it.\u201d In a response in italics, the magazine concedes it debuted on BBC1, but says Attenborough was by then director of programmes and so \u201cinvolved in the show\u2019s conception\u201d. Let\u2019s hope both nonagenarians will still be around in three years\u2019 time when the 50th anniversary will give them a chance to properly sort out who the father was. \u2022 Although the appointment as economics editor (an \u201cexplainer\u201d job often filled by non-journalists) of the academic Noreena Hertz has come under fire in the rightwing press, having read her book of tips on decision-making Monkey can see nothing but advantages for her new ITV colleagues. They too can now benefit from advice on how to prepare for making big calls and deals previously available to Hertz\u2019s husband Danny Cohen, which at the time of Eyes Wide Open\u2019s publication Monkey noted include: sport noise-reducing headphones; use a meditation app to gauge your feelings; always wear the same clothes and eat the same meals; ensure you\u2019re neither sex- nor sleep-starved; and only take decisions on a full stomach and bladder. The last tip does mean of course that serial decision-makers will have to drink water constantly, while avoiding running to the loo until a decision has been made or the pain of holding themselves in check (without betraying their peak bladder condition to meeting-mates) becomes too much to bear.  \u2022 In devoting a four-page investigation to the ordeal of four students at Cirencester agricultural college - they were accused of rape but cleared at trial when the Crown\u2019s case collapsed - the Mail on Sunday chiefly had the detective who headed the botched investigation in its sights. But its giant sub-headline seemed to spread the blame more widely (\u201cAccused of gang rape at a top royal college. Publicly shamed. Then exonerated only after shocking police abuses \u2026 \u201d), implicitly condemning those who \u201cpublicly shamed\u201d the innocent students before and during the trial \u2013 as illustrated by a \u201crag-out\u201d from one newspaper (with photos of them arriving at court above a headline saying \u201cfour students \u2026 \u2018raped woman at ball\u2019\u201d) to show \u201chow the case was reported\u201d. But which paper was being publicly shamed, albeit unnamed, for this public shaming? Few MoS readers will have failed to spot the typeface of its sister title, and an archive check confirms that the ragged-out report appeared on 30 March this year in the Daily Mail.",
