  "body": "In this era of post-truth politics, an unhesitating liar can be king. The more brazen his dishonesty, the less he minds being caught with his pants on fire, the more he can prosper. And those pedants still hung up on facts and evidence and all that boring stuff are left for dust, their boots barely laced while the lie has spread halfway around the world.   Related: Sheldon Adelson endorses Donald Trump for president \u2013 campaign live    The proof is on show most visibly in the US, where Republican nominee-to-be Donald Trump enjoys a relationship to the truth that is chilly, occasional and distant. The Washington Post\u2019s fact-checker blog has awarded its maximum dishonesty rating \u2013 four Pinocchios \u2013 to nearly 70% of the Trump statements it has vetted. And it\u2019s vetted a lot. That doesn\u2019t mean the other 30% turned out to be true. They just earned three Pinocchios rather than the full four, which means the Post found a shrivelled kernel of veracity wrapped inside the thick layers of fraud, distortion and deception. Among the biggest of whoppers, Trump has claimed that Barack Obama was not born in the US; that Obama spent $4m in legal fees to hide the true facts of his birth; that Hillary Clinton was the true originator of these \u201cbirther\u201d claims; that he, Trump, opposed the Iraq war before it happened (of which there is no evidence); that \u201cthousands\u201d of Muslims in New Jersey celebrated the 9/11 attacks; that he started his business empire with a \u201csmall loan\u201d from his father, when in fact he inherited $40m; that the father of his former rival, Ted Cruz, was a pal of Kennedy assassin Lee Harvey Oswald; and on and on. To adapt Mary McCarthy\u2019s critique of the novelist Lillian Hellman, every word Trump says is a lie, including \u201cand\u201d and \u201cthe\u201d. Trump is in a league of his own, of course, even apparently pretending to be his own spokesman, \u201cJohn Miller\u201d, in calls to reporters. But though he is a master of post-truth politics, he is not its sole practitioner. This week, Boris Johnson reminded us that he has more in common with Trump than just a lovingly styled, idiosyncratic head of blond hair. The former London mayor ventured to Cornwall to climb aboard the Brexit battlebus, a vehicle which, improbably enough, was itself guilty of a lie.     Boris Johnson with the Vote Leave battlebus. Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images    Emblazoned on the side was the slogan: \u201cWe send the EU \u00a3350 million a week.\u201d Except it\u2019s not true. That figure fails to take account of Britain\u2019s rebate \u2013 negotiated, incidentally, by the Brexiteers\u2019 heroine, Margaret Thatcher \u2013 worth the best part of \u00a3100m each week. To say nothing of the money the EU sends back to the UK, mainly to help British farmers, which reduces the net weekly cost of EU membership to an estimated \u00a3160m or less. But let\u2019s not punish Johnson for the mute words of a charabanc. Rather let\u2019s pay attention to the words that came out of his mouth, such as his critique of David Cameron\u2019s speech on Monday, which had focused on the national security implications of a Brexit. Johnson hit back: \u201cI think all this talk of world war three and bubonic plague is demented, frankly.\u201d And who could disagree? Who but a cretin would suggest that the black death would be the result of a British break from the EU? And yet a scan of the text of Cameron\u2019s speech yields no results for either \u201cbubonic\u201d or \u201cworld war three\u201d. Who was it, then, that introduced \u201call this talk\u201d of such perils? Why, it was the former mayor himself.    Fact checking is laborious, especially compared with the brio that can be generated by a sweeping (but false) assertion    On BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, Johnson reminded listeners how slippery his grasp on the truth has long been. Asked whether it was true that he had drafted two versions of his Daily Telegraph column \u2013 one for leave, the other for remain \u2013 on the night of his big decision, suggesting his stance on this most fateful issue was driven by immediate career calculus rather than long-held principle, he failed to supply an answer. Worth remembering that Johnson has been sacked twice, and on both occasions it was for dishonesty: once by the Times for making up a quote, and again by the former Tory leader Michael Howard, for lying to his face about an extramarital affair. More relevantly, when it comes to Europe, Johnson\u2019s career was all but built on wilful distortion. All those comedy stories of meddling EU bureaucrats \u2013 directives demanding square strawberries and smaller condoms \u2013 were inserted into the public domain by the Telegraph\u2019s Brussels correspondent in the 1990s, one Boris Johnson. As a former colleague, Sarah Helm, has recalled: \u201cJohnson\u2019s half-truths created a new reality \u2026 correspondents witnessed Johnson shaping the narrative that morphed into our present-day populist Euroscepticism.\u201d     A Trump supporter at a campaign rally in Maryland in April. Photograph: Jim Bourg/Reuters    The Today interview provided a useful insight into why Johnson has been able to get away with it for so long. As with Trump, humour plays a crucial part. The combination of jokes and bluster is hard to oppose, not without making an interrogator look like a spoilsport and a killjoy. Too often, radio and TV interviewers want to appear in on the joke, to share in the chuckle, lest they seem dull and po-faced. It\u2019s no coincidence that the toughest encounter Johnson has faced, at the hands of the BBC\u2019s Eddie Mair, came when an unsmiling Mair played it straight. It\u2019s also the case that fact checking is laborious, tedious and time-consuming, especially compared with the brio that can be generated by a sweeping (but false) assertion. Just look again at the earlier paragraph, picking apart that \u00a3350m figure. You can almost hear the nation\u2019s inner teenager chant in unison: bor-ing. Broadcast exchanges are especially resistant to such fact-checking, warning interviewees they don\u2019t \u201cwant to get stuck in the weeds\u201d or \u201clost in the detail\u201d.   Related: Donald Trump makes Rupert Murdoch dance to his tune    Perhaps that was always so. More significant is the shift in media culture. Technology now allows politicians to communicate directly with their followers, with no need to transmit their claims through the fact-checking filter of a news organisation. Witness Trump and his Twitter account. Meanwhile, the rise of social media and, in the US, cable TV channels and radio stations defined by political hue, means voters can easily get the entirety of their information from sources tailored to reflect their own views back to them. That, in turn, makes them ever more unwilling to accept contradictory facts. The editor of the Washington Post \u2013 and hero of the film Spotlight \u2013 Marty Baron, addressed this in a speech last week, noting how easy it has become to wave aside discomforting facts as the work of the hated \u201cmainstream\u201d media, pushing its secret agenda. \u201cWhat has taken hold is an alternate reality, a virtual reality, where lies are accepted as truth and where conspiracy theories take root in the fertile soil of falsehoods.\u201d It\u2019s clear why this matters. As Baron puts it plaintively: \u201cHow can we have a functioning democracy when we cannot agree on the most basic facts?\u201d In the US, that\u2019s become a pressing question. In Britain, we have not yet fallen as far. That\u2019s partly because we still have one forum which cannot so easily be dismissed as peddling a partisan agenda, though its critics, right and left, never cease trying. I\u2019m speaking of the BBC. For all its flaws, it has retained the status once enjoyed by the US networks, broadly trusted to play umpire between competing claims on the truth \u2013 or at least to try. As the battle that preceded this week\u2019s white paper demonstrated, the BBC can never take that status for granted. It has powerful enemies. But one look across the Atlantic shows what happens when there is nothing like it. When everyone can be shouted down as a liar, you\u2019re left in a world without truth \u2013 and that\u2019s a cold place indeed.",
