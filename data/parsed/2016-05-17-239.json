  "body": "There is some consolation for John Gosden, whose So Mi Dar has been ruled out of the Oaks through lameness, in the thought that his chance of Derby success may have been improved. The trainer feels his filly\u2019s absence from Epsom next month makes it more likely that the star Irish filly Minding will be targeted at the Oaks rather than tilting at the colts race, in which Gosden will field Wings Of Desire, currently the 5-1 second-favourite.   Related: John Gosden forced to rule So Mi Dar out of the Oaks due to lameness    Minding\u2019s trainer, Aidan O\u2019Brien, now has \u201ca lot of cards to play\u201d in the Derby, Gosden said at a press conference here on Monday evening to promote the Investec-sponsored Classics. \u201cSo many runners, why would you need to run Minding when she can run in an Oaks?\u201d Indeed, Gosden expects his Irish rival to be mob-handed in the Derby and recalled the 2007 race, in which he ran the eventual fourth, Lucarno, while O\u2019Brien had no fewer than eight runners. The Newmarket man is also more respectful than many have been about the quality of O\u2019Brien\u2019s likely runners. \u201cI think you\u2019ve got very nice horses. US Army Ranger and the horse who was second to him [Port Douglas], they\u2019re bloody good horses. I think Deauville\u2019s a good horse.\u201d Gosden was especially taken by the success in France on Sunday of O\u2019Brien\u2019s The Gurkha. \u201cHe was impressive. I\u2019ve got to be honest, I think he beat Group Three horses. A horse of my wife\u2019s [Crazy Horse] was beaten a length for second and he\u2019s a bit rusty. But he totally showed he\u2019s a Group One horse, so he\u2019s exciting if they run him there. \u201cWho knows, he could go to the St James\u2019s Palace [at Royal Ascot in mid-June]. He could be that kind of speed. It\u2019s not my business, all I know is I expect Aidan to turn up with about six colts at least and I expect Minding to remain in the Oaks. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll do that.\u201d To some extent, Gosden is happy to have a Derby candidate at all, having believed as recently as the middle of last month that he would be unrepresented in the race he won last year. Wings Of Desire held a Derby entry initially but the trainer pulled him out on 7 March, when it would have cost \u00a31,000 to stay in, believing instead the horse would go for the much less prestigious King Edward VII Stakes at the Royal meeting. \u201cI think it\u2019s still a very good idea,\u201d he joked. \u201cAlas, I\u2019ve been made a fool of. And he only did his first half-speed on 15 March.\u201d Connections must now pay \u00a375,000 to re-enter into the Derby. For a colt to make such rapid progress, from first gallop to Derby contention, is unusual, Gosden readily conceded, though he sent out Tamure to be second at Epsom in 1995 after a similar preparation. Of Wings Of Desire, he said: \u201cHe\u2019s got a gorgeous frame, good mind on him. And he\u2019s done a lot of solid, steady stuff through the winter, but he\u2019d never done any fast work until the third week of March. He\u2019s learning quick.\u201d Referring to the colt\u2019s success in York\u2019s Dante Stakes last week, Gosden added: \u201cI notice Frankie [Dettori] didn\u2019t hit the front too soon because he\u2019s still a baby but he\u2019s a proper Derby horse, there\u2019s no doubt about it. You\u2019d just love to have got another run into him, that\u2019s all. He\u2019s a big, strapping, strong colt now and last year he wasn\u2019t.\u201d While the trainer still feels that last year\u2019s Derby winner, Golden Horn, might have won despite a mile and a half being a shade further than his optimum distance, Wings Of Desire is likely to prove a more thorough stayer. \u201cIt\u2019ll be his best trip and I won\u2019t bother bringing him back to a mile and a quarter again. Because if things go well, you\u2019d probably put him away for a King George, something like that, he\u2019s a proper mile and a half horse, like his brother [Eagle Top].\u201d But the very experienced Gosden has seen too much to be taking anything for granted. In Tamure\u2019s year, he also ran the eventual third, Presenting, and still feels that horse would have won if his jockey had not taken the view that he knew better than to follow instructions. \u201cMr Cash Asmussen wouldn\u2019t listen to me. I told Cash, go to the front, make the running, go for it, he stays, he\u2019s a galloper. \u201cHe just popped him in to give him a little air, then he couldn\u2019t get out again until too late. Typical Asmussen, he always knew the name of The Unknown Soldier. \u201cThere\u2019s a banana skin round every corner. Look at So Mi Dar!\u201d",
