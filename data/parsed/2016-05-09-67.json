  "body": "Paul Ryan is willing to step down from his role as co-chairman of the Republican National Convention in July if Donald Trump asks him to do so, he told reporters on Monday. The comment, made in an interview with the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, was the latest sign that many Republican leaders are willing to walk away from their party\u2019s presumptive nominee and distance themselves from the controversy and chaos of his campaign. Many believe Trump will lose badly in a general election, and that he could take senators and representatives down with him.  Ryan declined to endorse Trump last week, telling CNN: \u201cI\u2019m just not ready to do that at this point. I\u2019m not there right now.\u201d  Trump at first responded with statement: \u201cI am not ready to support Speaker Ryan\u2019s agenda.\u201d  He later expressed disappointment, telling NBC on Sunday: \u201cHe called me, I think, to congratulate me about New York, \u2019cause I won by massive numbers.\u201d  Ryan\u2019s staff has since made clear that the two hadn\u2019t spoken since March, more than a month before New York\u2019s 19 April primary. However, Trump also made clear he does not place great value on the speaker\u2019s support. \u201cNo. It\u2019s just the way it is,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI don\u2019t think it hurts me at all. And I\u2019d like to have his support, but if he doesn\u2019t want to support me that\u2019s fine.\u201d As speaker of the House, Ryan would be expected to preside over the Republican party\u2019s convention as chairman this summer. Though his office has called the role mostly \u201cceremonial\u201d, he would be expected, as the party\u2019s leader in Congress, to bless the nominee and rally Republicans around the candidate. Ryan\u2019s skepticism about the presumptive nominee has sparked a backlash. The vice-presidential nominee in 2008, Sarah Palin, has endorsed his primary challenger and several members of his leadership team have expressed disappointment in his stance. Her running mate and a senior leader in the Senate, John McCain, has offered only tepid support for Trump, saying that although he would stand by his promise to support any Republican nominee, he wanted the businessman to apologize for offensive remarks about prisoners of war. Ryan is one of many top Republicans who have either rejected Trump or said they cannot yet endorse him as the party\u2019s nominee. Two of Trump\u2019s former opponents, Jeb Bush and Lindsey Graham, have said they will not vote for Trump in November, as have a host of congressmen, governors and top party intellectuals: the coalition includes the moderate governor of Massachusetts, Charlie Baker, and a conservative senator of Nebraska, Ben Sasse.  But Trump has opened a divide within the party between those adamantly opposed to the former reality TV star and those who have accepted him, a group sometimes derisively called \u201cVichy Republicans\u201d. Many longtime Trump opponents are grudgingly coming on board. On Monday, former Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal wrote in an editorial in the Wall Street Journal: \u201cI think electing Donald Trump would be the second-worst thing we could do this November, better only than electing Hillary Clinton to serve as the third term for the Obama administration\u2019s radical policies.\u201d While running for president, Jindal called Trump \u201can egomanical madman\u201d. Utah congressman Chris Stewart, who previously compared Trump to Mussolini, said he would support the party\u2019s nominee this weekend.  Trump has not gone out of his way to extend an olive branch to Republicans skeptical of his candidacy. He dismissed those who questioned his conservative bona fides in a Sunday interview. \u201cI\u2019m a conservative, but don\u2019t forget, this is called the Republican party,\u201d he told ABC. \u201cIt\u2019s not called the Conservative party. You know, there are Conservative parties. This is called the Republican party.\u201d  He echoed this on ABC, saying of the Republican party: \u201cI think it would be better if it were unified. And I think there would be something good about it. But I don\u2019t think it actually has to be.\u201d Trump is scheduled to meet Ryan and other members of the congressional leadership on Thursday in Washington DC.",
