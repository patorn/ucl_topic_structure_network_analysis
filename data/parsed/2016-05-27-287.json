  "body": "Simon Cowell has announced a new venture: he is going to write a children\u2019s book. He says that he needs to because all children\u2019s books are boring \u2013 at least the ones that he\u2019s reading to his two-year-old, Eric. When he appears on The X Factor he gets help from David Walliams, Alesha Dixon and Amanda Holden, at least one of whom writes successful children\u2019s books. So I\u2019m guessing he might be looking for some help with the writing, too.   Related: Simon Cowell gets star advice on plan to write children's book    What tips can I offer on writing for two-year-olds like Simon\u2019s Eric? My tip to students thinking about writing picture books is to comb the field \u2013 see what\u2019s already out there. The common ingredients are repetition, a bit of jeopardy, possibly loss or confusion, followed by a sense of rescue, unity or comfort. There should also be success: the protagonist (or more than one) has succeeded, though this could have come about through something or other that is not real. And finally, remember that animals can talk. Basically, it\u2019s The X Factor. Right there, Simon, is your plot, which \u2013 as I say to my students \u2013 is often the best place to start. You need to translate your own personal experience into your chosen format. Maybe the animals in the wood are arguing about who can make the best noises \u2013 the mouse squeaks, the crow caws, the weasel squeals \u2013 they can\u2019t decide who is the winner. Unbeknownst to them, while they were arguing, Simon the Fox was listening. Up he pops and says, \u201cWhy don\u2019t I be the judge, and whoever is the best will come to my palace for a meal?\u201d \u201cYes!\u201d say the animals, and one by one they stand in front of Simon and make their noises. Simon chooses one of them and takes them off to his ... well, actually, he doesn\u2019t have a palace, he has a den. And the meal? Oh yes, it\u2019s Simon\u2019s meal. He eats the winner. Look, I haven\u2019t got it right yet. I\u2019m not sure about the ending, or how to get in that stuff to do with rescue, unity and comfort. But anyway, Simon, how\u2019s that for starters?
