  "body": "\u201cOnly use the dirty water to shower,\u201d said Florence Mandible. \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget that ever since inflation hit 48% and the US dollar became next to worthless on the global currency markets, things are pretty tight around here.\u201d Her 12-year-old son, Willing, toyed with a .44 Colt that he had stolen from some Lat. Ever since the Mexicans took over the country and he was forced to speak Spanish at school, he had taken a keen interest in paramilitary survivalism, just like her brother Jarred who nobody ever mentioned. \u201cPut that gun down and go and queue for some foodstuffs that will probably have gone off by the time you get home,\u201d Florence said. She kind of missed the old days when the worst that seemed to happen was that a few bankers tried to fiddle the Libor rate. In Washington, Avery Mandible was anxious that all of her patients were cancelling their therapy sessions because tax rates had gone up to 88%, interest rates had hit a new high of minus 23% and the only people left in work were those making money off the influx of Chinese tourists. She decided to call her sister on her FleX watch. \u201cHi Florence,\u201d she said. \u201cI kinda just miss the stonage days of 2025 when the internet collapsed and no online financial transactions could be authorised. At least in those days a $50,000 bill still had some value.\u201d \u201cMe too, Avery,\u201d Florence replied. \u201cIt sure is tough when US government borrowing has reached 290% of GDP.\u201d \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t worry too much,\u201d said Avery. \u201cMy husband Lowell, the respected Georgetown economist, has modelled projections saying that even 385% is perfectly sustainable. Besides, we still have the backup of Grandpa Douglas\u2019s millions. He\u2019s now 95 and can\u2019t live for ever.\u201d   Related: The Mandibles: A Family, 2029-2047 by\u00a0Lionel Shriver \u2013 a vibrant vision of America in decline    Both women\u2019s FleX\u2019s pinged. It was an alert from the US Treasury saying that everyone\u2019s gold reserves were being nationalised and that even people\u2019s teeth would be requisitioned by the army. \u201cThat means I am now also officially broke and can no longer care for my second wife, Luella, who is suffering from dementia,\u201d said Grandpa Douglas. \u201cSo I will now have to go and live with my son Carter.\u201d \u201cWhy can\u2019t you go and live with my sister, Enola?\u201d Carter said. \u201cAt least she has some money in the alternative currency of bancors.\u201d \u201cIn case you had forgotten,\u201d Grandpa Douglas responded, anxious to use a word different to replied, \u201cbancors are a proscribed currency, and Enola lives in France.\u201d \u201cWell, you can\u2019t live with me because now that the official annualised rate of inflation is now 215% I too am broke. We\u2019ll all have to go and live with Lowell and Avery.\u201d     Novelist Lionel Shriver. Photograph: Eamonn McCabe for the Guardian    \u201cI\u2019m afraid you can\u2019t,\u201d Lowell said grimly. \u201cI\u2019ve just been fired from my job, as unemployment has risen to 3,400%. We\u2019re going to have to take our kids, Savannah, Goog and Bing, out of private schools and go and live with Florence in New York, where they will learn nothing with Lat kids.\u201d \u201cGuess what,\u201d said Enola. \u201cI\u2019m fed up with nobody buying my novels in France so I am coming to live with Florence too.\u201d Grandpa Douglas, demented Luella, Carter, Lowell, Avery, Savannah, Goog, Bing, Enola, Willing and Florence all sat miserably in Florence\u2019s tenement flat, searching for scraps of cloth with which to wipe their bottoms, while lamenting the fact that they were the victims of a strict novelistic determinism that only allowed them to talk at length about the economic apocalypse. \u201cI\u2019ve got no money,\u201d said Savannah. \u201cI\u2019m going to be a hooker.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m going to steal stuff,\u201d said Willing. \u201cDoes no one one have any redeeming qualities?\u201d asked Bing. \u201cNo,\u201d said Lionel. Just then a group of people took over the flat and forced Grandpa Douglas, demented Luella etc to go and live in a tent in the park. Grandpa Douglas shot demented Luella and then himself. Lucky Grandpa and demented Luella. 2047: \u201cI\u2019m not enjoying living in a world where the US is a third-world state, where tax rates are 98% and every transaction is controlled by a treasury implant in my head,\u201d said Willing, who had just killed someone who had killed several dozen other people. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve still got a bit of cash stashed away,\u201d said Enola. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we drive to the breakaway United States of Nevada and see if we can find Jarred?\u201d \u201cTo be honest, it\u2019s not all it\u2019s cracked up to be here either,\u201d shrugged Jarred. Somehow, no one found that surprising. Digested read, digested: The Unreadables.
