  "body": "Erik Satie (1866-1925) occupies a unique place in the musical pantheon, eschewing all artifice and show, stripping his compositions back to the bare essentials and creating a world of calm and order (he called it \u201cmusic without sauerkraut\u201d). His Trois Gymnop\u00e9dies (1888) and Six Gnossiennes (1889-97) are popular examples of his style, played here with unremarkable simplicity (for there is no other way to play them) by the Russian-born pianist Olga Scheps. More interesting are the Trois Sarabandes (1887), particularly the example in F minor, made almost entirely of a luminous, graceful chord progression. Scheps conjures this otherworld with admirable poise but, given the material, the temperature of this recording rarely rises above blood level.",
