  "body": "Katie Nolan refuses to be a victim. All the TV host needs to do is scroll through her Twitter feed, read YouTube comments, or turn on some sports radio show to hear people say how annoying, slutty and talentless she is. Once, when she hosted her first radio show, a caller phoned the station, shouted \u201cFuck you, cunt!\u201d live on air, and hung up. Nolan could be discouraged. Pissed off. Or worse, quiet. Instead, it just makes her double down harder, getting ready for her show Fox Sports 1\u2019s Garbage Time with Katie Nolan to return for a third season on 4 May. Being insulted by listeners and viewers is an experience Nolan shares with a lot of female sports journalists as was demonstrated last week in a viral video in which men were tasked with reading hateful messages sent to two female hosts in order to demonstrate just how brutal people can be when armed with their keyboards. Nolan, however, can\u2019t let it stop her. She has a platform, and she\u2019s not afraid to stand squarely on top of it.  Her show, which airs at midnight eastern on Wednesdays, has been nominated for two sports Emmys. It is entirely driven by Nolan\u2019s irreverent personality and her fearlessness to say what others can\u2019t, or won\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019ve always talked, not followed the rules, and been the one to poke the bear,\u201d said Nolan, 29. \u201cIt\u2019s less a skill than a lack of skill.\u201d     Katie Nolan: \u2018I never thought I could be in sports and give my opinion.\u2019 Photograph: William Hauser/Fox    Nolan, who grew up in the Boston suburb of Framingham, is not only funny \u2013 she\u2019s humble to a fault. She still can\u2019t get over having her own network TV show. It\u2019s not tough to buy, considering a couple of years ago she was filming YouTube videos in her apartment using a green screen as a backdrop. She\u2019s now given speeches to six different college journalism classes and still can\u2019t believe they want her. \u201cI never thought I could be in sports and give my opinion,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen they say, \u2018Thanks for people like you,\u2019 I think, \u2018What do you mean ME?\u2019 That\u2019s why I go to work. That\u2019s where some of my courage comes in. Someone has to say something, so women who want to do this after me won\u2019t have to fight this battle. Let me put my footprints in the snow.\u201d Garbage Time is at heart a sports comedy show, but when Dallas Cowboys defensive end Greg Hardy, who served a four-game suspension for domestic assault, gave his first interview to reporters after his suspension, Nolan couldn\u2019t look around and expect somebody else to speak up about what transpired. She knew it had to be her. She called Hardy a \u201cgarbage human\u201d and also called out reporters for their softball questions to him. That was also the night she decided to stop reading her Twitter replies \u2013 she now has more than 213,000 followers. But the vitriol doesn\u2019t stop her from continuing to voice her opinions, liberally sprinkled with profanity.

Lots of people have outdated, sexist views. The more women who come up and take stances the sports world hasn\u2019t seen, the more we can change the narrative. Men are watching and hearing this opinion from a woman who works in sports. It\u2019s a big responsibility.\u201d ESPN\u2019s Rachel Nichols, who was Nolan\u2019s first podcast guest, agrees. \u201cShe\u2019s got a great voice, and she uses it,\u201d she said. In her recent piece on Kathryn Smith, the first woman to be hired as a full-time coach in the NFL as special teams quality control coach for the Buffalo Bills, Nolan first pointed out how boring the blatant sexism it raised is. She then explained matter-of-factly why everyone should calm down and stop screaming about Smith\u2019s hiring being the result of affirmative action or a publicity stunt for the team. And also why she actually wants to answer those kinds of questions: because no one ever does.    Men are watching and hearing this opinion from a woman who works in sports. It\u2019s a big responsibility  Katie Nolan     Some men become stubborn, Nolan believes, when the immediate reaction to their opinions is that they\u2019re sexist. And that\u2019s what she is trying to change.  \u201cI know their ears will turn off,\u201d Nolan said. \u201cI say, \u2018Hey, you\u2019re wrong. I\u2019m not going to label you as sexist, but I\u2019m going to walk you through why this isn\u2019t OK. I don\u2019t hold your opinions against you. But I\u2019m smiling through my teeth because I think you\u2019re an idiot.\u2019\u201d            \u201cKatie Nolan is everything I want Fox Sports 1\u2019s programming to be. Period, end of statement,\u201d said Jamie Horowitz, president of Fox Sports National Network. \u201cThe thing with Katie is she\u2019s incisive and insightful and she challenges the way viewers think. Katie Nolan is not an interesting woman. She\u2019s just interesting. That\u2019s the magic of it.\u201d As to what her future holds, Horowitz wants to keep her around. \u201cWhen you look at a movie poster of FS1 a few years from now,\u201d he says, \u201cyou\u2019re going to see Katie Nolan\u2019s face on it.\u201d Nolan has ideas of how she wants her show to evolve. More women on her crew would be a start, as currently there is one, because as progressive as her male staff is, they can\u2019t truly relate to a reality they\u2019ve never lived. Maybe she\u2019ll have a live studio audience instead of just the banter with her off-screen producers. Her quick wit, and her casual and sometimes quirky interview style, humanize the athletes and celebrities, as if they are, as her brother describes, \u201csitting next to her on a barstool at 12.30 on a Friday night\u201d. What won\u2019t change is her giving a single thought to what she looks like on camera. She\u2019s not into the heavily made-up, blow-dried culture of broadcast TV. If it were up to her, Nolan would just stay in her uniform of sneakers, jeans, T-shirt and her glasses. But she has wardrobe, hair and makeup people who have other ideas, and Nolan\u2019s appearance hits right in the middle of too much and not enough. \u201cI\u2019m aware of how I look being a storyline,\u201d Nolan said. It\u2019d be tough not to, considering how her viewers like to comment on her appearance. But a better storyline for Nolan, the one she wants to be known for, is one in which she means what she says, and says what she means. Because she knows if she changes her line every 30 seconds, or says stuff for the sole purpose of getting a reaction, her mostly male viewing audience would be all over her \u2013 and she\u2019d lose the respect she\u2019s working so hard to build.  And no amount of fame, she says, is worth that to her.",
