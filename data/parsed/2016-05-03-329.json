  "body": "Refik Tekin, an award-winning photographer and video journalist, had been covering the curfew in the predominantly Kurdish city of Cizre, south-east Turkey, for more than a month when a report by a pro-government news agency turned him into a terrorist. Tekin accompanied a group carrying white flags that wanted to retrieve bodies and injured people from a nearby street when security forces suddenly opened fire, wounding nine and killing two, including a member of the city council. Tekin was shot in the leg but kept filming. A police officer later dragged the injured journalist along the ground to an ambulance. \u201cThe policeman shouted at me, telling me not to look at him. He said: \u2018You are all terrorists, you will see the strengths of the Turks!\u2019 This struck me as an especially strange thing to say. Am I not a citizen of this country?\u201d said Tekin.            Turkish security forces open fire on Kurds \u2013 video    The state-run Anadolu agency described the incident as a clash between security forces and terrorists:  \u201cClashes between security forces and terrorists erupted in the Cizre district of \u015eirnak province. Three terrorists were neutralised and nine others wounded. There was an attempt to [help the wounded terrorists escape] with funeral cars and ambulances belonging to the Cizre municipality. An alleged cameraman working for a TV channel was reported to be among the injured.\u201d  Tekin was accused of being a member of a terrorist organisation. The charges have since been dropped, but the pressure remains. \u201cIt gets harder and harder for journalists to keep an eye on what is happening in the [Kurdish region],\u201d said Tekin, who is still using crutches and unable to work. \u201cThe government controls the narrative, barring a large part of the country from knowing what is going on.\u201d   Related: Turkish journalists accuse Erdo\u011fan of media witch-hunt    Turkey\u2019s president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, insists that the press in Turkey is among the most free in the world, but very few would agree. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) recently said in a letter to Turkey\u2019s prime minister, Ahmet Davuto\u011flu, that press freedom was \u201cunder siege\u201d, pointing to \u201cincreasing numbers of journalists in jail, violence against journalists on the rise, and critical news outlets officially harassed or obstructed\u201d. Turkey now ranks 151st among 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index published by Reporters Without Borders.   Press freedom graphic   Coverage of the conflict in Turkey\u2019s Kurdish south-east is an ever-growing challenge for journalists. Many pro-Kurdish news sites and Twitter accounts were closed following the breakdown last summer of a two-year ceasefire between the Turkish government and the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party, or PKK. Several Turkish journalists have been fired by their newspapers for reporting on the region. Reporters for pro-Kurdish outlets are routinely detained and face threats of violence and harassment by security forces. According to the CPJ, at least seven Kurdish journalists were arrested in Turkey between 1 December and mid-February. Two reporters working for the pro-Kurdish Dicle news agency were detained in April, and one agency intern, Ziya Ataman, was formally arrested on terrorism charges. G\u00fcler Can, head of news at the Diyarbak\u0131r office of the woman\u2019s news agency Jinha, said reporters were being labelled \u201cterrorists\u201d for doing their jobs. \u201cThey use news items we work on as \u2018proof\u2019 in court, and this has got worse since the breakdown of the peace process,\u201d she said. In December the Jinha journalist Beritan Can\u00f6zer was detained while reporting on a demonstration in Diyarbakir, because police decided she looked \u201ctoo excited\u201d. Pro-government outlets tend to have better access to state security operations, but reporters say they cannot always write what they want. Some journalists working for mainstream news outlets say their reports are often heavily censored by editors, and that some news organisations prefer to bring in journalists from Ankara or Istanbul instead of using their local reporters, arguing that those on the ground are \u201ctoo emotional\u201d. Human rights groups are worried about the increasing lack of independent coverage in the south-east. \u201cIf this is what can be done under the eyes of the public, we are afraid to think what is done when there is no press coverage at all,\u201d said Zeki Parlak, of the Diyarbak\u0131r-based Turkey Human Rights Foundation. \u201cThere needs to be unbiased reporting, and the media need to be able to monitor and question human rights violations.\u201d   Turkey map   Sitting in his Diyarbak\u0131r flat a month after being shot in Cizre, Tekin received a phone call from a colleague informing him that his employer, IMC TV, might be shut down over allegations of \u201cspreading terrorist propaganda\u201d. A couple of hours later, Turkey\u2019s satellite provider T\u00fcrksat took the channel off the air. \u201cWe have come to a point where all the media that do not express exactly the government\u2019s views are seen as enemies,\u201d Tekin said. \u201cThere is now an extreme polarisation among journalists as well. Turkey has become the kingdom of the reporting of lies.\u201d Trust in the media has plummeted, and mainstream media coverage regularly becomes the object of mockery. In February, news sites published a video released by the military purporting to depict the surrender of three Kurdish militants in Sur. At the end of the video, one militant is heard saying: \u201cFriends, we have done nothing but hurt the local people. Come and surrender, too. You cannot run from the government, nobody is harmed [by the police].\u201d \u201cWe all laughed when we watched that,\u201d said one Diyarbak\u0131r teacher. \u201cIt looked like a bad school play. Even my grandmother thought this was hilarious. Who are they trying to fool with such bad acting?\u201d Media experts underline that the human rights abuses and the stories behind images such as this alleged surrender remain in the dark if they are simply written off as propaganda. Reports from the south-east often fail to answer the most pressing questions, leaving those depicted to fill the roles of either heroes or villains. Pro-Kurdish sites too are criticised for often reaching for the most dramatic language. \u201cThe use of words like \u2018massacre\u2019, even \u2018genocide\u2019, comes very easily \u2026 Is it not terrible enough to say \u2018x person, a civilian, was killed in front of his or her house\u2019?\u201d said one human rights activist from Diyarbak\u0131r. \u201cWe need journalism more than ever before,\u201d said an academic researching the media, who wished not to be named for fear that speaking about coverage of the Kurdish issue might spell trouble. \u201cThere is hardly any proper journalism now. We almost never hear human stories, stories about civilians and people in the area. Both sides try to spin the story to their advantage.\u201d The academic pointed to the coverage of clashes between members of the outlawed PKK and security forces in Da\u011fl\u0131ca in March. Mainstream media reported that the militants ran, leaving behind \u201clarge numbers of their own weapons and ammunition\u201d, and that no army members were harmed. Pro-PKK outlets said 26 soldiers were killed.  \u201cThe dichotomy of us v them is reproduced every day on both sides,\u201d the academic said. \u201cIt\u2019s very black and white, there are no more grey zones, no nuances. Nobody feels the need to ask follow-up questions.\u201d",
