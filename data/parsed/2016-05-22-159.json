  "body": "From \u201cJack\u201d to \u201cKick\u201d, the Kennedy self-confidence expressed in demotic monosyllables does not cease to dazzle. Fifty-three years after JFK\u2019s assassination, and 68 years after his beloved sister\u2019s death in an air crash, biographers continue to fly into the lost world of Kennedy brilliance, as moths to a flame. In the inevitable burn-up that follows, language itself acquires ever more lurid tones. So Kick is not the biography of Joe Kennedy\u2019s second daughter Kathleen. Rather, it is \u201cthe true story of Kick Kennedy, JFK\u2019s forgotten sister and the heir to Chatsworth\u201d. But if Kick is a \u201ctrue story\u201d, we should also recognise what it\u2019s not. It is, for instance, scarcely a dispassionate biography. Paula Byrne, the author of Mad World: Evelyn Waugh and the Secrets of Brideshead (2009), the book that gave her the idea for Kick, is too heavily invested in her subject for the usual considerations of objectivity. Thus: \u201cKick was approaching her 16th birthday, and she wanted some fun.\u201d No surprise, also, to find it falling for the temptations of sentiment: \u201cKick felt as if she was in another world as she gazed at the rows of snow-capped pines and the enormous fairytale hotel nestling under the Swiss Alps, which loomed over the tiny village of Gstaad.\u201d   Related: Mad World by Paula Byrne | Book review    Addressing Kick\u2019s place in a family dominated by boys, Byrne reports that \u201ca hierarchy was established within the family with Joe Jr, Jack and Kick firmly at the top\u201d. But the relationship of Joe\u00a0Jr (who would also die in an air crash), and JFK (who would become a \u201cwar hero\u201d), to their one-of-the-lads sister rarely departs from a pop psychological narrative. It also fails completely to elucidate the impact on the young Kennedy family of its darkest secret. Older than Kick, but brain-damaged from birth, was another daughter, Rosemary, who would eventually be subjected to a botched\u00a0lobotomy. Still in the family division, Kick hardly offers much that\u2019s new about the cold but tormented marriage of Joe and Rose Kennedy. When Joe Sr starts his affair with Gloria Swanson, we learn that Kick \u201cwas intrigued to meet the daughter of the world\u2019s most famous movie star. She liked little Gloria, but she longed even more to meet the beautiful star herself.\u201d Shortly after this\u00a0breathless revelation, Byrne describes the Kennedys as \u201cthe ideal Catholic family\u201d. The deficiencies of Kick multiply within its unfolding narrative. It is not really a fraternal portrait of JFK as a young hero, though he\u2019s hovering in the wings throughout. When Kick moves to London during her father\u2019s disastrous tour of duty as US ambassador, this is not even a study of expat American life in the blitz. Kick\u2019s biographer, apparently oblivious to the flourishing genre of blitz studies, is content to describe the high jinks in the Gargoyle club and the Cafe\u00a0de\u00a0Paris. Despite several index entries for Evelyn Waugh, who was apparently \u201cbewitched\u201d by Miss K, Byrne has almost nothing to say about Waugh\u2019s partiality for an American girl with outstanding \u201csexual charisma\u201d, a species Waugh generally, and notoriously, loathed. Finally, Kick is not\u00a0really an Anglo-American romance, more a snapshot of wartime heartbreak. So what kind of book is it?    Behind the luxurious long weekends is the poignant story of an impressionable American, starved of parental affection    Paula Byrne certainly has a beady eye on the marketplace. All too frequently a \u201ctrue story\u201d apparently written and researched in the UK, tips its cap to an American audience, with unintentionally hilarious results. When\u00a0Kick visits Cambridge, Byrne\u2019s readers, who will shortly get a lesson in the art of the apple-pie bed, discover that the\u00a0\u201cTrinity Ball [is] the highlight of the\u00a0academic year\u201d, which might come as news to many Cambridge graduates. When Kick and JFK first land in wartime Britain, \u201cthey intuitively understood the understated British humour\u201d. Elsewhere, Byrne\u2019s transatlantic readers will doubtless yearn to join \u201ca smart set of aristocratic young people\u201d and \u201cembrace the wholesome American girl with the dazzling smile\u201d. Actually, Kick was tormented by her lack of wholesomeness, and we hear so\u00a0much about her \u201cdazzling smile\u201d that\u00a0one is tempted to elevate this biography into that rarest and most exclusive genre of life-writing: the\u00a0hagiography. Kick, then, is a missed opportunity. Behind the luxurious long weekends and the high-society junketing is the poignant story of an impressionable, gung-ho American (a discernible type), starved of parental affection, tyrannised by her mother, trapped in a cruel web of Roman Catholic guilt, trying to make sense of her young adult\u00a0life in a baffling and impenetrable\u00a0society high on the adrenaline of total war. Having defied her parents (especially her mother), and married Billy Hartington, the \u201cheir to Chatsworth\u201d, this unfortunate Bostonian was first widowed, then snagged by a philandering Irishman (\u201cking dandy and scum\u201d, according to Waugh), dying with him in a senseless plane crash (shades of John Kennedy\u00a0Jr). End\u00a0of\u00a0story. Less a book than an uncontrolled magazine article, Kick reads like an unedited film treatment. But it contains, for Hollywood, one fatal flaw. Kathleen \u201cKick\u201d Kennedy was a tragic figure, a victim of her upbringing and circumstances, who died in the quest for love. In the movie, we should shed a tear. In the book, we could hardly care less. That famous Kennedy magic is all the more golden for being so tantalisingly elusive. Kick is published by William Collins (\u00a320).
