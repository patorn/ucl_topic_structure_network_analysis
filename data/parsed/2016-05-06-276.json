  "body": "Andrea Bocelli has revealed he asked Claudio Ranieri if he could perform at Leicester\u2019s coronation as Premier League champions on Saturday because their story is \u201ca lesson in life\u201d. The Italian opera singer will provide the soundtrack at the King Power Stadium when the captain, Wes Morgan, is presented with the trophy by the supporter Steve Worthy after the match against Everton. Bocelli, a lifelong Internazionale fan who lost his sight following an accident during a football game when he was 12, said he had been inspired by their story.   Related: Leicester City confident of keeping Riyad Mahrez as speculation mounts    \u201cTo be honest, I was the one who called. It kicked off over a month ago,\u201d he told La Gazzetta dello Sport. \u201cI got Ranieri\u2019s number off [Javier] Zanetti, so I called him and said: \u2018Look Ranieri, it\u2019s Bocelli, I would love to do this thing.\u2019 He was very happy; he is a man with an innate elegance. Next, everything was arranged through my manager and the club. \u201cMy passion for football has no limits and comes from when I was a child in college. I followed everything then. Then, this Leicester season has really caught my eye. I think it has garnered attention from everyone as they are an extraordinary example of clean football, a small team becoming great thanks to the strength of the group spirit. \u201cThey are a lesson in life: where there is a will there is a way. And then, there\u2019s an Italian driving the whole thing. There\u2019s the story of [Jamie] Vardy, from a factory worker to a champion, who realises his dream. How do you tell me not to get caught [up in all of this]?\u201d Bocelli has previously performed at the 2009 Champions League final in Rome, when Barcelona defeated Manchester United 2-0, with the 57-year-old also set to appear with Alicia Keys before this year\u2019s edition between Real Madrid and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid at the end of this month. However, he admitted he is yet to decide which song will serenade Leicester\u2019s players and supporters on Saturday, although Bocelli drew comparisons with the club\u2019s manager and legendary Italian singer Domenico Modugno. \u201cWe have not decided anything, we\u2019ll see. What is certain is that the fans of Leicester will sing painted blue and that Ranieri is Mister Volare,\u201d he said.",
