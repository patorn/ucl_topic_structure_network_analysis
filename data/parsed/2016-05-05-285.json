Her brother Rassim, who helped her escape the perils of Damascus for the uncertainties of a future in Vogtei, central Germany, is worried. \u201cShe watches cartoons, but if there\u2019s a scene where children are having meals with their parents she bursts into tears and switches off the TV,\u201d he says. She eats little. \u201cShe keeps asking me to take her back to her parents in Lebanon.\u201d     Rassim and Kawkeb. Photograph: Mona Mahmood    Things are little better for 11-year-old Ali AlShafa\u2019i, who is trying to settle in Gothenburg after an epic 2,000-mile journey across Europe from Syria. His uncle and chaperone bought him a bird \u2013 a cockatiel, to be precise. But when they were out one day, the neighbour\u2019s cat ate it. Ali was inconsolable. \u201cI was so upset I can hardly restrain myself whenever I see the cat,\u201d he says, \u201cbut I couldn\u2019t touch it because I like cats too.\u201d More than 370,000 child refugees arrived in Europe last year, almost 90,000 of them unaccompanied, the vast majority from Afghanistan, Syria, Eritrea and Iraq. But after treacherous sea journeys, monumental hikes and the dangers of the road, the hardest bit may yet be ahead: settling in. Insomnia, homesickness, separation anxiety and culture shock unsettle all but the most robust souls, according to interviews conducted with child refugees by the Guardian in recent weeks. And though they may have left the bombs and militias behind, there are new threats. Many are intimidated by local hostilities, while others wrestle with cultural challenges: new school subjects, strange cuisine and even stranger linguistic quirks. The wait for asylum is oppressive, the shortage of clothing humiliating. A large number complain of insomnia, but psychiatric help \u2013 and even physical healthcare \u2013 are hard to find for those yet to be approved for asylum. The children\u2019s restlessness is instructive for Britain as it debates whether to take in 3,000 unaccompanied minors. Their experiences suggest Britain will need not just a small army of case workers, foster families and psychiatrists, but also fast-track bureaucracy to deal swiftly with asylum claims.     Athari Bassim in the Netherlands.         \u201cMy heart starts to race whenever I close my eyes and try to sleep,\u201d says Athari Bassim, a 15-year-old Iraqi sent by her parents to the Netherlands last year. \u201cThe repeated nightmares are driving me crazy. The moment I go to bed I start to dream of militia men with ugly faces chasing me with their guns. They always get me wherever I hide.\u201d     Athari\u2019s drawing.    Athari\u2019s account of odyssey has a familiar ring to it. Her parents dispatched her after an elder brother was kidnapped and tortured by militias; there were long days at sea, nights spent walking the entire length of countries. She slept in forests, on roadsides, avoiding looters and drinkers, while keeping an eye out for items left behind by earlier refugee waves that pointed the way north-west.   Related: First laughs since Syria: the clowns getting refugee children smiling    Of course, refugees have not been universally welcomed across Europe, and in Germany, which has hosted more than any other country, an initial Willkommenskultur (welcoming culture) has been contaminated by hostility and even violence in some parts. Rassim Hassan says he faces regular outbursts on the streets of Vogtei, and wonders how to protect his sister from the worst of it. \u201cThere are always German guys in the streets speaking badly about Syrian refugees,\u201d he says. \u201cKawkeb is a little kid.\u201d           Huzaifa, a 15-year-old Syrian refugee in Germany.    Huzaifa Waiz, a 15-year-old boy from Aleppo, feels the culture shock keenly in the north-eastern German city of Mecklenburg, where fear of neo-Nazis makes him reluctant to travel around alone. \u201cWe leave for school at 7am in a group of 17 refugees and take the same bus,\u201d he says. \u201cIt gives us a sense of protection. I once left the school early and took the bus on my own, but the Nazi guys abused me verbally and I moved to stand by the driver until I got home.\u201d     Huzaifa\u2019s drawing.    Huzaifa fled Syria with his brother eight months ago, sent by parents alarmed at the rising incidence of kidnappings and child soldiers in the ruins of Aleppo.  He misses his mother and her cooking. But his biggest problem is getting papers. \u201cMy parents thought it would be fairly easy to get residency in Germany,\u201d he says. \u201cThe didn\u2019t know that the large number of refugees who made it to Germany has had a serious impact on the asylum system here.\u201d Athari says the situation is little better in the Netherlands. \u201cI thought all our problems would be sorted out once we got to Netherlands, but the asylum process has been very slow.\u201d          Fahmi Ali, 16, a Syrian refugee in the Netherlands.    Without asylum, healthcare can be hard to access. Different countries have different rules. Fahmi Ali, 16, says the doctor at his camp in the Netherlands simply prescribes paracetamol \u201ceven if you are dying\u201d. \u201cSome refugees needed surgery and were told they had to wait until they got a residency permit,\u201d he claims. Fahmi escaped from a suburb of Damascus last July after surviving a shell that landed right next to him - but didn\u2019t explode. He travelled with his 23-year-old sister, Jihan, to link up with an older brother in the Netherlands. He lost 13kg (2st), and every second thought is about his parents stuck back at home in the Syrian capital. \u201cI sleep barely five hours a night asking myself all the time why I agreed to leave my parents alone in Damascus and when I will be able to get them here.\u201d Hadi Dibbes, 16, suffered ulcers and rashes during a tortuous journey from Syria to Germany last year. \u201cI asked the German officer at the kids\u2019 centre to let me see a doctor, but he never answers me because I still do not have a residency permit. \u201cI\u2019m losing patience as the time gets longer. Nothing has been done in six months on my asylum case. I was told I have to wait two years to get residency and then get my family reunion. But I need to see my parents and brothers.\u201d And so the waiting game goes on. Huzaifa fills the dead time at a fitness club. Fahmi has joined a football club. Hadi plays pool and smokes. Athari loves to skate and to watch movies on YouTube. Ali takes care of his two canaries (replacements for the luckless cockatiel), or walks in the forest with his uncle.          Aseel Ahmed, who now lives in Germany with her aunt.    Aseel Ahmed, a 10-year-old refugee from the Yarmouk refugee camp for Palestinians in Damascus, spends her spare time with her aunt watching movies in Erlangen, Germany, where she arrived at the end of last year. She left Syria believing her family had died in a bomb blast, only to find out later that they had survived.  She misses them. \u201cI watch cartoons, do my homework, then hug my teddy bear and go to sleep so I can be united with my family in Damascus in my dreams,\u201d she says. Aseel has a German \u201cguarantor\u201d, a sort of guardian angel who sometimes takes her to the swimming pool. It\u2019s a system used in the Netherlands and Sweden too. Athari has a Dutch \u201csponsor\u201d who helped her to enrol in school. \u201cShe has many other kids to look after, so I found it hard to explain to her that I feel down and flashbacks of the past are damaging my life,\u201d she says.     Drawing by Aseel.    In Sweden, Ali too has a sponsor, known as a \u201cgood woman\u201d. She comes to visit him every two or three weeks. \u201cShe brings me chocolate, games and gave me 1,100 kronor [\u00a394] to buy secondhand clothing.\u201d Clothes shortages are just one of the many inconveniences that young refugees must endure.  \u201cSince I arrived in the Netherlands last December, I did not get any money to buy a single item of clothing,\u201d says Fahmi, still making do with a threadbare jacket and boots given to him by the Red Cross in Hungary. It\u2019s the same for Athari. The Dutch system is far less generous than those in Germany or Sweden. \u201cI can\u2019t buy any piece of clothes as I\u2019ve not had a penny since I\u2019ve been here. I use my old clothes. I accept that.\u201d All the children are positive about their new schooling, seeing it as an anchor of normality in turbulent lives, even if for some school is just a modified room in a sports centre. \u201cI memorise six or seven Swedish words every day,\u201d says Ali in Gothenburg. \u201cI\u2019m really interested in carpentry: we have a workshop for making boxes and knives.\u201d \u201cWe study maths but without having a teacher to explain to us,\u201d says Athari. \u201cThe teacher would give us notebooks with maths exercises, we solve them and the next day we get them corrected. We do not mix with any Dutch students. The school actually is a room in a basketball stadium.\u201d Aseel says: \u201cI\u2019m learning German language, maths, reading, writing, singing and tennis. I always draw our house in Syria on the board in the class.\u201d But some are shocked at classroom dynamics. \u201cIt is chaotic. Students swear badly in front of the teacher, chat, sing, use WhatsApp, laugh while the teacher talks,\u201d says Huzaifa. \u201cI do not mean the teacher should beat students, but in Aleppo they would tap lightly a few times on the hand of someone being naughty.\u201d Culture is often bewildering. High prices, evening curfews, odd food and new languages are all aspects some young arrivals have struggled to get to grips with. \u201cMost of the time my uncle gets us fast food like hamburger, fries and pizza,\u201d says Ali. \u201cI call my parents every day and ask my mother what she cooked for my other brothers. I miss the family meals we used to have together.\u201d     Fahmi Samir\u2019s drawing.    Fahmi says he can\u2019t relate to a city centre that is dead by early evening. \u201cThere is no life in the city after 6pm,\u201d he says of Gorinchem, in the Netherlands. \u201cIt\u2019s very depressing for me. In Syria, streets are busy late at night. People check how you are doing. If you go to the shopkeeper here to ask for something, he hardly speaks to you.\u201d Rassim Hassan is worried about the influences on nine-year-old Kawkeb. \u201cIf she was still in Syria she would be learning how to pray and behave in a decent way. I don\u2019t want her to watch what is going on on the streets. The German boys and girls drink and kiss each other. I myself feel shy when I see this.\u201d   Related: Quarter of child refugees arriving in EU travelled without parents    Huzaifa was startled to see German kids sharing his youth hostel taking drugs, and he has also been startled by the food. \u201cWe can\u2019t guarantee if it is halal or not,\u201d he says. For most, it\u2019s missing their parents that is the hardest thing. Ali says he can\u2019t wait much longer. Athari says the worry is exaggerating her depression. Similar thoughts keep Huzaifa awake at night. \u201cI go to bed at 9pm but I don\u2019t close my eyes until 2. I keep thinking: what am I doing here? How are my parents and little sisters? We were a close family and enjoyed being at home. I miss them so much. Is it worth all the risk?\u201d",
