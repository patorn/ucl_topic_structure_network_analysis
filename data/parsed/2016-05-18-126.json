Carwyn Jones will remain first minister but his anointment threatened to be overshadowed by a sexism row after Ukip\u2019s leader at the assembly, the former Tory MP Neil Hamilton, branded two senior female assembly members \u201cpolitical concubines\u201d and called Plaid a \u201ccheap date\u201d. Welsh Labour failed to win a majority at the assembly elections and Plaid, the second biggest party, put forward its leader, Leanne Wood, as a candidate for first minister against Jones. Thanks to mischievous support for Wood from the Tories and Ukip \u2013 Plaid\u2019s sworn enemies \u2013 the pair tied and the people of Wales faced having to return to the polls if the impasse remained.  Following days of talks between Labour and Plaid, the parties reached agreement and, subject to the Queen\u2019s approval, Jones will lead a minority government.  Hamilton branded it the \u201ccoronation of King Carwyn\u201d and claimed the deal made Plaid a \u201cvery cheap date\u201d.     Neil Hamilton campaigning for Ukip with his wife Christine. Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images    He was accused of sexism after calling Wood and the Liberal Democrat Kirsty Williams \u2013 who backed Jones last week \u2013 \u201cpolitical concubines in Carwyn\u2019s harem\u201d.  Williams tweeted: \u201cThe blatant sexist language was bad enough but Neil Hamilton actually talked about dodgy deals with a straight face.\u201d    The blatant sexist language was bad enough but Neil Hamilton actually talked about dodgy deals with a straight face.\u2014 Kirsty Williams (@Kirsty_Williams) May 18, 2016    While an MP, Hamilton faced allegations that he took cash for asking parliamentary questions, which he has always denied.  The Welsh Conservative leader, Andrew RT Davies, said it was \u201cgroundhog day\u201d and Plaid, which has worked in coalition with Labour in the past, had fallen in line with Labour. Wood, however, made it clear her party was not part of a coalition. She pulled no punches when she accused Labour, which has been in government in Wales since 1999, of arrogantly believing it was entitled to power.  The Plaid leader said her party was \u201callowing\u201d Jones\u2019s election as first minster but was not supporting him and would oppose and challenge Labour when it disagreed. \u201cWe intend to be an opposition. We are prepared to use our mettle if and when that is needed,\u201d she said. Jones made it clear within the debating chamber and outside it that Labour would operate in a new way in this fifth assembly. On Twitter he said: \u201cWe have no doubt about the responsibilities on us, and the responsibility upon me in particular, to work with others.\u201d     We have no doubt about the responsibilities on us, and the responsibility upon me in particular, to work with others\u2014 Carwyn Jones (@fmwales) May 18, 2016    In the Senedd, Jones said that for the fifth time in a row the Welsh people had asked Labour to form the next government.  But he added: \u201cFor the fifth time in a row they have said: \u2018Proceed, but with caution and humility.\u2019 Because we have no majority. Of that we are acutely aware \u2026 No one party has a monopoly on good ideas, and I want this assembly to be more open and more confident than the last.\u201d  He said the priorities for the first 100 days would include a \u201crelentless focus on securing a successful and sustainable future\u201d for the steel industry and campaigning \u201cvociferously\u201d for the UK to remain in the EU.  A key plank of the agreement with Plaid \u2013 called A Compact to Move Wales Forward \u2013 is the establishment of three liaison committees on finance, legislation and the constitution. Jones said these would comprise a Labour minister and a Plaid Cymru representative and would be staffed by the civil service. Offering an olive branch to the other parties, Jones said the government would not bring forward any new legislation in the first 100 days, giving political groups in the assembly time to establish \u201ca new way of doing law-making in Wales\u201d. He said that when the time was right the government would introduce a new public health bill and, on a cross-party basis, a law to remove the defence of \u201creasonable chastisement\u201d \u2013 smacking.  Jones concluded: \u201cWales does not want for ambition. Wales does not want for brilliance. And if the last few days are anything to go by, Wales does not want for excitement either. It is our job, collectively, to make real that ambition. To turn that brilliance into sustainable success and growing prosperity for all. And where we have excitement, let\u2019s make sure it comes with results. \u201cWe have given the media, the Welsh historians and the commentariat plenty of what they want \u2013 theatre and intrigue. It is time now to give the Welsh people what they want and expect: good governance, delivery and respect.\u201d",
