  "body": "CITY ROUSE THEMSELVES, 24 HOURS TOO LATE In scenes reminiscent of the time Arthur Pewty told the marriage guidance councillor to stop messing around with his wife, Manchester City marched purposefully into the Bernab\u00e9u on Wednesday night, were told to go away, and complied with a cheery right-o. They left the place exactly as they found it. No point making a fuss. Not least because there\u2019s always next year. \u201cWe go again!\u201d is the brave battle cry of City keeper Joe Hart, reading aloud from the Big Book of Stirring Soccer Oratory, published in April 2014 and authored by one $ Mbe. Joe should probably put the book down. The problem is, of course, that in order to \u201cgo again\u201d, and perhaps consider snapping out of their dozed reverie and running around a bit next time, City need to qualify for Big Cup by finishing in the top four of the Premier League. That\u2019s not a given, with Manchester United breathing down their necks and Arsenal scheduled for a visit to the Etihad this weekend. \u201cRoll on Sunday,\u201d chirruped Hart. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it!\u201d Which is, all things considered, a brave face ahead of a stern test: defeat would put City\u2019s top-four finish very much in the balance, and the Gunners, as is their wont, have started to win games again now there\u2019s absolutely nothing whatsoever left to play for. Also desperately hoping to compete in next season\u2019s Big Cup are Liverpool, who can do so by winning devalued qualification mechanism Big Vase. That looks something of a pipe dream, as they\u2019re trailing Villarreal after the first leg of the semi, have no away goal to fall back on, and all of their good chances these days seem to fall to Joe Allen, who really needs to start putting his laces through it. Villarreal have already qualified for Big Cup via La Liga, winning at Valencia last weekend with a weakened team while Liverpool\u2019s second-string shower were making a mid-table show of themselves in Swansea. It all suggests the Yellow Submarine have too much quality in depth for Liverpool, who need another against-the-odds Dortmund-sized miracle if they\u2019re to make the final. We would encourage them to \u201cgo again!\u201d too, but, well, y\u2019know. LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Barry Glendenning from 8.05pm BST for hot MBM coverage of Liverpool 1-1 Villarreal in Big Vase semi-finals (agg: 1-2). QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cHe will sing here. He called me, one month and half ago, two months ago. He was so happy [about] what we were doing in Leicester. He said: \u2018I would like to come and sing something.\u2019 I said: \u2018Great, why not?\u2019 I gave all the information to the club and they made all the arrangements. It is great for all the community\u201d \u2013 Leicester boss Claudio Ranieri confirms that shouting\u2019s Andrea Bocelli will serenade fans before Saturday\u2019s game with Everton.     Claudio Ranieri and the Leicester press pack get on it, earlier.

This from the man who, after the last World Cup and European Championships, indulged in over-the-top rants about England\u2019s inability to keep the ball and adapt to the competition following their elimination from each. Who knew that one of the things he had picked up while with Marseille was the French admiration for Woody Allen, and to such an extent that he has started to channel Alvy Singer\u201d \u2013 David Wall. \u201cWhat\u2019s all this nonsense about violent conduct, red cards and suspensions? Surely Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 was assisting Diego Costa who had something in his eye; Dele Alli was performing the Heimlich manoeuvre on Claudio Yacob; Jamie Vardy lost a contact lens in front of goal; and didn\u2019t anyone else see the bee on the Atl\u00e9tico Madrid staff member\u2019s shoulder that Diego Simeone tried to swat?\u201d \u2013 Ruth Kleinhenz. \u201cI read the first line of Adam Pinder\u2019s letter (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters) with child-like excitement in anticipation of the similarities between Pep Guardiola and Ronny Deila. I was expecting a ream of passing or possession stats for each of their teams, coupled with some jaw-dropping trivia like they have the same birthday or the same blood type. No. Both of them managed a team to an easy league victory and were not successful in Europe. With this in mind I would like to point out the similarities between myself and Mr Roy: we both have heads and both of us will be in France this summer for the Euros\u201d \u2013 Gavin O\u2019Sullivan. \u2022 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And if you\u2019ve nothing better to do you can also tweet The Fiver. Today\u2019s winner of our prizeless letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 David Wall.

RECOMMENDED VIEWING A very lovely film from Tom Jenkins on the end of West Ham United at the Boleyn Ground.            BITS AND BOBS West Ham have offered \u00a331.5m that they should be using to fund their new home to Marseille for striker Michy Batshuayi. It took all of three days for Riyad Mahrez\u2019s Mr 15% to pipe up and use Leicester\u2019s title win for planned contract negotiations. \u201cIf the opportunity comes to play for a big team then we would have to think about it. I\u2019d say it\u2019s 50/50 at the moment whether he stays or goes,\u201d trousered Kamel Bengougam. Spurs are close to an agreement with FA suits to play home games at Wembley in 2017-18, as well as next season\u2019s Big Cup games there. \u201cWe\u2019re quite close to a deal,\u201d teased Greg Dyke. \u201c$ex masochism\u201d involving Robert Huth and Marouane Fellaini has helped earn the pair three-match bans. Mats Hummels has got the funk on after Borussia Dortmund claimed he\u2019d handed in a transfer request and planned to join Bayern Munich. \u201cNothing has been decided yet,\u201d he fumed. \u201cThis dirty statement created a different impression.\u201d Newcastle United have booked Gabriel Obertan and Sylvain Marveaux for stays at L\u2019Hotel du 1. Hyperhidrosis sufferers Crystal Palace are worried about Wilfried Zaha\u2019s fitness for the FA Cup final. \u201cThe problem\u2019s high up in his attachment to his hamstring, so it\u2019s not his hamstring but it\u2019s high up on the tendon there,\u201d pouted Alan Pardew. And Northampton Town glory fan Shaquille O\u2019Neal has posted a video congratulating the Cobblers on their League Two title. STILL WANT MORE? Had your fill of Fox-themed fairytales?
