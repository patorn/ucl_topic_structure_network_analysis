  "body": "And just like that, it\u2019s over. Jarryd Hayne\u2019s crazy-brave tilt at the National Football League is done like so many dinners. He\u2019s brushed the San Francisco 49ers for a lash at playing rugby sevens for Fiji at the Rio Olympics. As one does. And here we are, not quite fulfilled and more than a little surprised. What is he doing?   Related: Jarryd Hayne retires from NFL to pursue Olympic rugby sevens dream with Fiji     We\u2019ll get to what he\u2019s left behind. For now we know this: Hayne is joining the World Series-leading Fiji sevens team 82 days before the Olympic opening ceremony. There is one round of the series to go, in London, for him to press claims. Fiji has the best sevens players in the world. There are 12 spots. Hayne has never played the game before.  On top of that, there\u2019s the advice of former Asada chief Richard Ings, who tweeted to Hayne: \u201cSlight problem mate. World Rugby require you to be in their registered testing pool six months to be eligible to play.\u201d Adding: \u201cIf Jarryd Hayne had been playing in Wada compliant sport he would have grounds to reduce the six months. But NFL is PED badlands. No chance.\u201d   So there you go. It seems a fair impediment. And that\u2019s before we talk about whether he\u2019s equipped to play a sport he\u2019s never played at the highest level for the best team in the world. For all the things that stopped Quade Cooper from being an Olympic sevens player for Australia \u2013 choices in defence, cleaning out rucks, body height, not giving away penalties, knowing when to shelve the hero plays, generally how to play sevens \u2013 will plague Hayne. And at least Cooper came from a rugby union base. Hayne\u2019s never played sevens and wants to make the Olympics team of the best sevens nation on earth? Is there not a whiff of arrogance about that? Is Hayne\u2019s belief he can do anything not a mite offensive to the incumbents?   Good luck to him, of course. It\u2019s great that someone wants to have a go. Great that people chase big dreams. And how we\u2019ve barrelled along on his journey. But does it not smack a little of last-minute glory hunting? Fiji are favourites for Olympic gold. Hayne is a sensational runner of the football but there\u2019s more to it than that. Fitness, for one thing. He\u2019s a power man in the NFL. In sevens they run flat out for 10 minutes. Hayne wouldn\u2019t have played 10 actual live action minutes in the NFL all up.  Sure, he\u2019d occasionally tear it up on the rugby field. The man can run. But the sharp-eyed squads of Kiwis, Australians, English, South Africans, these people know how to draw penalties, to target defenders who are off the mark. It\u2019s a very different game to anything he\u2019s played before. And yes he went relatively well in American football. But he made a few blues too.   Still, I wanted to see another season of him bopping about for San Francisco 49ers. And I\u2019m not alone. Australia was so into him people complained how into him we were, how giddy we were with his trip into that famous golden helmet and very tight gold pants with red trim. Like cats falling off things, anything Hayne-related was \u2013 and continues to be \u2013 top shelf clickbait. The numbers didn\u2019t lie. Hayne is hotter than the \u201988 Hot Chilli Peppers.  Starting out, we watched him in trials, in practice games. What coach Jim Tomsula called \u201cpaintball, not war\u201d. But my, how he dazzled. Stepping, running, shooting out that cattle-prod of a fend. Come on, curmudgeons. You weren\u2019t excited by that? By the possibilities of it? He killed \u2018em, this bloke who\u2019d never played the game, whose match experience was watching Deion Sanders on You Tube.  And then he made the final 53 (the things we learned) and in his first game garnered as much attention in Australia as a change of prime minister.   Yet, ultimately, for all the nice words of Tomsula about how excited he was by Hayne\u2019s \u201cpotential\u201d, it seems he wasn\u2019t completely aboard the Hayne Plane. And probably fair enough. Understandably he cared more about winning games of football \u2013 and hence keeping his job \u2013 than the Hayne project. And there were just too many fumbles. Three of them. That\u2019s a lot.  I watched the third one from high in the mega-plex glass magnificence of Santa Clara\u2019s Levi\u2019s Stadium, and the catch and run that sealed his fate was probably a microcosm of his \u201ccareer\u201d. He caught the punt, set off on a harum-scarum dash up the middle, beat a couple blokes, put on a step, a fend, and just when the journalist\u2019s buttocks lifted off the chair and it seemed he might break free bound for glory, he was whacked from a behind by a man he didn\u2019t know was there. And down the ball went, bobbling about under a cruel sea of desperate, scrabbling helmet-heads. And Hayne swore with much gusto, for he knew the error of his ways.   Related: Doubt cast over Jarryd Hayne's Olympic rugby sevens bid by former Asada boss     He was, perhaps, arguably, unlucky. The defender got a good shot on the ball and knocked it free. But a more seasoned NFL running back \u2013 or even someone who\u2019s played in high school \u2013 would tell you that the ball is The Precious, and that there is danger everywhere. And when you\u2019re running with it, you secure that thing, first and foremost.  But Hayne, confronted mostly by a parallel wall of defenders, found that there were threats everywhere, all around him. It was 360 degrees of trouble. And Tomsula dropped him like a hot scone.  He made it back after injury nobbled just about everyone else in his position, including guys who\u2019d been parachuted in. When Tomsula was fired, new coach Chip Kelly made more of the right noises. But they were ultimately platitudes with Tomsula. There\u2019s no room for a project in the pro leagues. There\u2019s no sentiment. It\u2019s money. And results. And while we don\u2019t know what Kelly was thinking, it\u2019s hard to think Hayne didn\u2019t quit the NFL on advice that he wasn\u2019t in the new man\u2019s plans.   Because Hayne wouldn\u2019t brush the NFL to try to qualify for Fiji\u2019s Olympic sevens squad on the basis of one (one!) tournament, would he? Or would he? For away he goes again, our Jarryd, into the next chapter of this maybe-crazy-brave, maybe-pragmatic, maybe-completely-odd-ball-and-weird athletic adventure, attempting to make his place among 12 of the best rugby sevens players in the world. But less than three months out from Rio, he\u2019s pushing a very big barrow up a very big hill.  If Wada\u2019s rules hold firm and there\u2019s no special dispensation for Hayne to join Fiji, riches in French and even Japanese rugby await. Hayne is the sort of player a wealthy owner of a French club could take a punt on, for press as much as anything. Or even Australian rugby might like him, as they liked the almost-Eels man, Israel Folau.   Hayne\u2019s manager Wayne Beavis said his star client would never go back to the NRL. Now he\u2019s not so sure. Hayne has said that if he ever came back he\u2019d \u201cgo to Parra\u201d. Sydney Roosters boss Nick Politis could yet ruffle the pages of his cheque book. Meanwhile, Hayne tweeted to Western Sydney Wanderers a query if they\u2019d like a six-foot-two striker.  Beavis told Fox Sports on Monday morning that Hayne\u2019s preferred sport could be marbles. Hopefully neither man has lost them.",
