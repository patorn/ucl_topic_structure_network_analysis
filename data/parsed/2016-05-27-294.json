  "body": "To the final frontier of identity politics, and a\u00a0preposterously late debut in this column for acting\u2019s Tom\u00a0Conti. Indeed, Lost in Showbiz has left it so late that Contism \u2013 absolute Contism \u2013 has become an established doctrine. Though Mr Conti found fame as an actor, starring in such favourites as Shirley Valentine and Reuben, Reuben, he is now widely acknowledged for his work in the field of making objections to things in the London village of Hampstead, where he owns a\u00a0\u00a317.5m\u00a0house. Mostly, they are planning objections \u2013 his last outing was against the development of a Sainsbury\u2019s, in a\u00a0performance that critics are already calling his finest since the time he didn\u2019t want his next-door neighbour Thierry Henry to build a fishtank. But his latest and arguably greatest intervention is an objection to a particular strain of hate speech. By way of background, Conti is part of a group of other local actors who are reflexively opposed to such things as war and leafblowers. Your Emma Thompsons, your Janet Suzmans. Last week, their seemingly tireless objections to the advent of mid-range supermarkets \u2013 as well as plans for the cycle superhighway \u2013 saw them branded \u201clivid luvvies\u201d by one councillor in a letter to the local paper. Invited to address this designation, Conti made what I think will become one of the most pivotal speeches in the history of the early-21st-century civil-rights movement. The word luvvie, he told the Daily Mail, is \u201cas abusive as \u2018Yid\u2019 or \u2018n******\u2019.\u201d Go on, Tom. Actually don\u2019t go on \u2013 I need a minute. All right, go on now. \u201cIt\u2019s a horrible expression,\u201d Tom continued. \u201cIt\u2019s pejorative, denigrative and demeaning.\u201d God, yes. It deffo stains us all. In fact, how about if \u2013 instead of building the supermarket \u2013 they built a museum to the time when rich actors were kept as slaves? I know these places can be a really harrowing visit, but it\u2019s just so important we tell the stories and educate future generations about the barbarity. \u201cI know a number of actors,\u201d ran the continuation of Tom\u2019s argument, \u201cand certainly the actors with whom I have mixed over my entire life have been very bright people.\u201d No doubt. Borderline genius is widely credited as coming as standard in their line of work. Certainly, Tom himself is possessed of an exceptionally fine mind \u2013 his ability to see the similarities between the N-word and the L-word evidences an intellectual agility rarely seen outside the confines of first-rate legal academia. Of course, I\u00a0know you\u2019ll always get some one-eyed internet halfwit asking how it can be hate speech when some actors use the L-word as a term of endearment among themselves. But those are what they always are: whiny and transparent attempts to distract from confronting the real abuse, usually advanced by people too unimaginative to realise they are bigots. The good news is that while Tom is undoubtedly the Rosa Parks of this thing \u2013 if not its MLK \u2013 he is not alone. Enter Peter Egan, most recently seen in Downton Abbey, who knows exactly what Conti is talking about. \u201cIf actors are voicing an opinion, in many cases a true opinion,\u201d Egan explained, \u201cthe way to dismiss that is to downgrade them with a diminishing term for a name. It was exactly the same in Vietnam. The American troops ... \u201d Hang on. Hang on. Again, I\u2019m going to have to put Peter on hold there for a\u00a0minute, because that got heavy and it got heavy FAST. I know the very last line that should have popped into my head is the Dude\u2019s cordial inquiry of Walter Sobchak in The Big Lebowski. To wit: \u201cWalter! What the fuck does this have to do with Vietnam?\u201d Even so, the line is there. Peter! What the fuck does this have to do with Vietnam? Was Egan in \u2019Nam? No, he was in Cold Comfort Farm, a 1968 BBC adaptation that also starred Alastair Sim and Brian Blessed. Probably fairly lively in the pub after wrapping for the day, but still marginally less gruelling than the Tet offensive. Anyway, let\u2019s permit Peter to finish: \u201cIt was exactly the same in Vietnam. The American troops used to call the Viet Cong \u2018Charlie\u2019. It\u2019s a cheap way of scoring points. And I do find it offensive, personally.\u201d Damn straight. Just like his forebear in rights activism, Egan ain\u2019t got no quarrel with them Viet Cong. No Viet Cong never called him luvvie. Even so, I\u2019ve never felt gladder that Penelope Wilton didn\u2019t end up leaving Richard Briers for him in Ever Decreasing Circles. As for Conti, he didn\u2019t watch his buddies die face down in the muck just so some draft-dodging local councillor could fail to thank him for his service. The tragedy, of course, is what happens to veterans like Tom when they come home \u2013 home to Hampstead from theatreland or a movie set \u2013 and find some townsfolk either unwilling to understand what they\u2019ve been through, or moved to use hate speech against them. Frankly, the fact that Tom has still to find a buyer for his house, despite recently knocking \u00a32.5m off the price, makes it overwhelmingly clear where this all leaves him. Namely: down in the shadows of the penitentiary, out by the gas fires of the refinery. He\u2019s 10 years burning down the road \u2013 nowhere to run, nowhere\u00a0to go ...",
