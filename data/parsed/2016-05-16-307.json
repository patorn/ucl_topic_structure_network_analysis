  "body": "Mindfulness can have a significant impact for patients with mental and physical health problems, as well as those accessing social care services. Not only that, but there is growing evidence to suggest it can help professionals working in health and social care. Jon Kabat-Zinn, professor of medicine emeritus and creator of the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care, and Society at the University of Massachusetts medical school, wrote that mindfulness is about attention, awareness and caring.  He added: \u201cIt is a way of being in wise and purposeful relationship with one\u2019s experience, both inwardly and outwardly, with oneself and with others.\u201d A study published last year in the Lancet slated mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) as an especially effective treatment for those with depression. Developed from mindfulness, MBCT encourages individuals to pay more attention to the present moment, and is combined with cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), specifically to try to help people who have recurring depression. Mindful practice can also have a significant impact on key leadership qualities, including clarity, curiosity, courage, creativity and working with conflict. Some health and social care organisations have been offering it to healthcare professionals and social workers to deal with stress and the demands of the job. Increasing thought is devoted to how it, along with compassion, can benefit both health professionals and patients. How can health and social care professionals apply mindfulness? What techniques can be used for positive mental health and stress reduction while working? Is it effective to use mindfulness within health and social care for patients and service users? Are there any disadvantages? Is it for everybody? Join us on Thursday 19 May from noon to 2pm to discuss these questions and more.
