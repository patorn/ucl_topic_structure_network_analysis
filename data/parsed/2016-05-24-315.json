  "body": "Nova Peris, the Northern Territory senator and first Indigenous woman elected to federal parliament, will not recontest her seat after revelations she was seeking a job with the AFL. The Labor senator announced she would no longer run despite holding the NT\u2019s No 1 Senate spot for the upcoming election. Peris said she had decided to step down at the end of her term after \u201ccareful deliberations\u201d with her family. \u201cAs the first Aboriginal female in federal politics as well as the Labor party\u2019s first Aboriginal member in federal parliament I certainly had challenges, but none that I couldn\u2019t handle or was not prepared for, having already lived a very public and documented life,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m now moving on and personally looking forward to the next chapter and journey of my life.\u201d The statement did not mention the touted role with the AFL.   Related: Nova Peris says government language around Indigenous people is patronising    Guardian Australia understands Peris has not contacted either the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, or the Labor national secretary, George Wright, speaking only to Labor\u2019s Senate leader Penny Wong since the story of the AFL job broke on Monday. Her lack of contact with federal colleagues and staff had sealed her fate, according to one Labor insider. Wong confirmed she\u2019d had \u201ca number of conversations\u201d with Peris, including one on Tuesday morning. Wong told media Peris had made \u201can important contribution\u201d. \u201cShe has been a trailblazer, a champion of change, she has been an Indigenous woman in this parliament and we need more of them,\u201d she said. \u201cWe wish her all the very best in whatever endeavours she chooses to undertake in her future.\u201d Reports of a rift between Peris and NT Labor are believed to be accurate, but not behind the current crisis. Shorten said Peris would depart \u201cwith my absolute best wishes\u201d, and dismissed as \u201ccomplete rubbish\u201d suggestions she had been sacked. \u201cShe\u2019s a distinguished Territorian, and a distinguished Indigenous Australian,\u201d he told media. \u201cI\u2019m very grateful for the time she has served the Labor party and the people of the NT.\u201d Labor are now scrambling to find a replacement for its top NT Senate spot. Guardian Australia understands several names \u2013 all women but none currently in politics \u2013 are in play.  It is understood former Northern Territory politician Malarndirri McCarthy has put her hand up for the Senate spot.  McCarthy is a former ABC and NITV journalist and was in the NT legislative assembly between 2005 and 2012. It is understood in order to conform with affirmative action rules, Peris\u2019s replacement would need to be a woman because the second Senate candidate and the lower house candidates are men. Neither Peris\u2019s predecessor, Trish Crossin, nor former NT minister Marion Scrymgour is believed to be in the running. Peris won her Senate seat at the 2013 federal election, after then-prime minister Julia Gillard replaced Crossin with the dual Olympian in a divisive \u201ccaptain\u2019s pick\u201d. Crossin is now director of the Indigenous Land Corporation. Responding to reports she had called for an apology from Gillard, Crossin tweeted on Tuesday that she had not, \u201cbut some may well think it\u2019s the right thing to do\u201d.    Not my public statement @mattcunningham but some may well think it's the right thing to do @dan_bouchier https://t.co/r50GC29HJ8\u2014 Trish Crossin (@trishcrossin) May 23, 2016    Crossin said it had been \u201cchaos\u201d since Gillard removed her, and \u201cthis is what happens when you override a democracy\u201d. She told the Australian Peris did not live up to expectations. Peris has faced animosity within the party and in the Northern Territory since Crossin\u2019s ousting, but has been largely popular as a senator. She was deputy chair of the federal parliamentary committee on reconciliation, and was an outspoken advocate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The controversy erupted on Monday after Fairfax Media reported Peris had been in talks with the AFL for its top Indigenous job, while still seeking re-election to her Senate seat. While flagged as a frontrunner in Monday\u2019s reports, Peris does not yet have the job with the AFL. The top Indigenous position is a new one, after the organisation split its multicultural focus into a separate role and the position was vacated by Jason Mifsud, who became executive director of Aboriginal Victoria. The AFL chief executive, Gillon McLachlan, said: \u201cAll I\u2019d say is that clearly Jason\u2019s role will be replaced. \u201cWe\u2019re running a process and that\u2019s been going. \u201cWe\u2019ve got some high-quality candidates \u2026 I\u2019m not going to say any more than that.\u201d Coalition NT senator Nigel Scullion had earlier called for Peris to come clean on the reports. \u201cIf senator Peris is not standing for election, Labor needs to come clean and say who will be No 1 on its Senate ticket in the Northern Territory and whether there will be a democratic pre-selection process or just another captain\u2019s pick,\u201d Scullion said. The Northern Territory treasurer and former federal MP, David Tollner said Peris was \u201cprobably not up to the job\u201d, and it seemed to him the AFL was \u201ca much better fit than the Senate\u201d, AAP reported. \u201cYou are completely open to public scrutiny and criticism, some warranted, some completely unwarranted, and I think no fault to Nova but she\u2019s probably not up to the job and she\u2019s looking to bail out,\u201d he said.Tollner will be leaving politics at the NT election in August, after the Country Liberal party did not endorse him for a seat.",
