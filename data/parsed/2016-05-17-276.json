  "body": "A push by the Turkish government to strip parliamentarians of their immunity is a clear attempt by the president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, to target opposition MPs and risks inflaming tensions in an already highly polarised country, the co-chair of the pro-Kurdish Peoples\u2019 Democratic party (HDP) has said. Turkey\u2019s parliament will begin to debate the contentious draft law \u2013 which was proposed by Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ruling Justice and Development party (AKP) \u2013 on Tuesday, with a final vote expected on Friday. \u201cThe [proposed bill] will have a very negative impact on Turkey, and it is very clear that the attempt to strip MPs of immunity targets us,\u201d Selahattin Demirta\u015f, the HDP co-chair, told the Guardian in an interview, warning that there was \u201ca serious risk\u201d of violence increasing in the country as a result. \u201cDemocratic political channels in Turkey are already in great difficulty, and if the bill passes, many people will feel that these channels have been shut completely. The belief in democracy and politics of peace will drop to zero.\u201d   Related: In Turkey we can\u2019t even laugh at our politicians any more | Elif Shafak    The HDP \u2013 a party largely representing Kurds but also encompassing leftwing liberals which emerged on the national political landscape last year \u2013 opposes the bill, which aims to remove legislators\u2019 immunity in legal cases. The party argues that it is mainly designed to push its members out of parliament to strengthen Erdo\u011fan\u2019s ambition of an executive presidency. If passed, the bill would affect about 50 of the 59 HDP deputies. Erdo\u011fan and the AKP have repeatedly called for HDP parliamentarians to be prosecuted for \u201cterrorism\u201d and accused the party of being the political arm of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK) \u2013 a charge the HDP, which backs Kurdish and other minority rights, vehemently rejects. The government\u2019s push comes amid a surge of violence in the predominantly Kurdish south-east of the country, the worst Turkey has seen in two decades.  \u201cIf parliamentary politics are closed down, people will turn towards other ways [to make themselves heard],\u201d said Demirta\u015f, adding that efforts to revive the peace process were already strained by government policies in the south-east.  \u201cIt is already difficult to speak of peace in a time when Kurds are under such immense pressure. Many of our voters are giving up on hopes of peace, and some youngsters want me to use harsher language against a state they believe is only interested in war.  \u201cThere is a serious risk that violence will increase, and there is already way too much of it in Turkey. But if immunity is lifted and [HDP MPs] are arrested, the youngsters who support our party will lose all hope in democratic politics.\u201d   Related: The Guardian view on Turkey\u2019s Kurdish policies: compounding the region\u2019s troubles | Editorial    Hundreds have been killed and towns have been left in ruins since a ceasefire between Ankara and the outlawed PKK fell apart last July, shattering a tentative three-year peace process and reviving a conflict that has killed more than 40,000 people since it began in 1984. While the HDP is staunchly opposed to the bill, both the main opposition Republican People\u2019s party (CHP) and the Nationalist Movement party (MHP) voted in favour of it being sent to parliament this month.  At least 11 CHP deputies, including party leaders Kemal K\u0131l\u0131\u00e7daro\u011flu and Sezgin Tanr\u0131kulu, face legal proceedings over \u201cinsults\u201d to the president. Members of the AKP and the MHP might also face court cases if the bill is passed. Under current legislation, Turkish lawmakers are immune from all prosecution while in office, but prosecutors can file police proceedings, or \u201cdossiers\u201d, against deputies that can lead to court cases once they leave parliament. Tanr\u0131kulu, a human rights lawyer as well as a deputy, underlined that the constitution should be changed and parliamentarians made accountable for their actions, but that such a change should not be used to muzzle freedom of speech. \u201cThe current article on parliamentary immunity is wrong,\u201d he said. \u201cBut MPs absolutely must have the right to free speech and to freedom of expression, both inside and outside of parliament. Immunity needs to be lifted for all other crimes committed by lawmakers, and that is what needs to be changed, but not in the way proposed by the government.\u201d   Related: Turkish journalists accuse Erdo\u011fan of media witch-hunt    As the vote will be held by secret ballot, many expect a majority of CHP legislators to vote against the contentious bill. Tanr\u0131kulu said there was a good chance the draft law would fall short of the 367 votes needed to be passed directly by the 550-seat assembly. The bill will go to a referendum if it wins 330 votes, but Demirta\u015f said he doubted this would happen.  \u201cIt is difficult to predict the outcome, because there are large numbers of parliamentarians who are uncomfortable with the bill, especially in the CHP, but also in the MHP and even in the AKP,\u201d Demirta\u015f said. \u201cI believe that many realise that it would be disastrous, that the bill would be political suicide for Turkey.\u201d However, he underlined that he would keep pushing for the peace process to be revived, even if he had to face prosecution and prison. \u201cIf I have to go to jail I will continue to work for peace from there, I will continue to spread the HDP\u2019s message from there,\u201d Demirta\u015f said. \u201cI believe that I can do that. Erdo\u011fan will regret that he had me arrested, and he will do everything to get me out, because I know that I will be even more efficient from jail.\u201d",
