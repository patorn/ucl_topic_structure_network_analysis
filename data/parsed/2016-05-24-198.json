  "body": "The last time Tracey Emin opened an exhibition of her work \u2013 in Hong Kong in March \u2013 she caused international headlines by announcing that she had married a stone in the garden of her house in the south of France. The artist\u2019s latest exhibition, at Lehmann Maupin in New York, continues the theme. It\u2019s called Stone Love, although the title, picked out in one of her famous neons, is actually taken from the first line of Soul Love, by her late friend David Bowie: \u201cStone love, she kneels before the grave / A brave son, who gave his life to save the slogans.\u201d   Related: Don\u2019t mock the rock \u2013 Tracey Emin\u2019s wedding is a message to single women | Gaby Hinsliff    The morning the show opens, Emin meets a small group of journalists to take us through the exhibition and then give one-to-one interviews. Apologising profusely, she arrives half an hour late, having battled traffic across Manhattan from the East Village, where she has a home, after deciding years ago that she was spending too much money staying in the city\u2019s hotels (she has a third house in London). Once famous for being constantly out on the town, Emin says she hasn\u2019t exactly embraced New York\u2019s social life. \u201cI\u2019ve been coming here nearly 20 years and I don\u2019t know hardly anybody,\u201d she tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s really friendly but everything\u2019s a transaction. From the top to the bottom, that\u2019s what America is \u2013 that\u2019s why people came here. There was a gold rush. I\u2019m friends with Princess Eugenie and we were joking about the fact that in London you don\u2019t see anyone at the weekend, but here you\u2019ve got your 8 o\u2019clock breakfast, brunch, lunch then linner. I said, \u2018What\u2019s linner?\u2019 and she said, \u2018That\u2019s between lunch and dinner.\u2019\u201d Emin laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s all about a meeting.\u201d Resplendent in a black skirt and top, and gold jewellery subtly enhancing a somewhat piratical air, at 52 Emin is naturally less wild today than she was when she memorably turned up trashed to the live TV discussion programme Sixty Minutes in 1997, but Margate\u2019s most famous export still has lashings of charisma, with an attitude chaser. \u201cCan you tell someone to stop walking with high shoes?\u201d she demands as she assembles the dazzled hacks and attempts to collect her thoughts above the clomping of someone crossing the floor. \u201cIf I had a gallery, I wouldn\u2019t allow people to wear high shoes because it\u2019s too noisy.\u201d     Emin with her work My Bed, which sold for \u00a32.5m in 2014 Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/Rex/Shutterstock    Stone Love includes three neons (the other two say Just Let Me Love You and It\u2019s Different When You Are in Love), half a dozen bronze sculptures, four large embroidered calicos and a host of sparse, airy paintings, a step on from her celebrated show at London\u2019s White Cube in 2014. Almost all the works depict naked women in sprawled and anxious repose, their faces turned away or scribbled over \u2013 which doesn\u2019t entirely disguise the fact that they are clearly self-portraits. Before we even knew what a selfie was, for a full decade Emin took Polaroids of herself \u2013 she has more than 5,000. \u201cPeople presume I was narcissistic, but I\u2019m not,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s just that I was much more open about myself and how I felt. But now everybody\u2019s doing it \u2013 it\u2019s part of culture.\u201d   Related: Tracey Emin is still the real thing \u2013 and that's why we love her    The figurative works are more traditional and the materials more classical than, for instance, the used condoms, stained knickers and empty vodka bottles that went into famous works such as 1998\u2019s My Bed, which recently sold for \u00a32.45m and is currently on show at Tate Britain, overlooked by two Francis Bacons handpicked by the artist. Nonetheless, Stone Love is still unmistakably Emin, from the swooping gouache curves of her women\u2019s backs to the hot-and-heavy titles like I Just Wanted to Sleep With You, She Knelt Before Him and I Wanted More.  A year after a show at Austria\u2019s Leopold Museum, where her work was hung with that of Egon Schiele, and with exhibitions alongside Munch and Picasso to come, Emin seems to be engaging much more overtly with art history than her YBA contemporaries, though she says that has always been the case. \u201cI went to the Royal College of Art, and when my peer group were doing Freeze\u201d \u2013 the 1988 group show organised by Damien Hirst \u2013 \u201cI was in Turkey up a mountain doing watercolours of donkeys, looking at Chagall. I was not on their planet at all, and I\u2019m still not.  \u201cBut now I think it\u2019s become more evident to people, people are giving me a bit of slack, and they\u2019ve stopped being so aggressive \u2013 how fucking horrible people were about me in the press in England. It was outrageous. Someone said to me, \u2018A lesser artist would have given up.\u2019 But I\u2019m not going to give up.\u201d She might not be giving up, but Emin is going on a year\u2019s sabbatical. She announced the break with an advert in Artforum magazine, which featured a picture of her and her four representatives, their contact details and a note in her famous handwriting that, read: \u201cIf you need anything call one of these people.\u201d      You Were Here Like the Ground Underneath My Feet by Tracey Emin. Photograph: Lehmann Maupin Gallery    Having done two or three shows a year for the past nine years, Emin needs a rest \u2013 not from art, she says, but from everything that goes with it. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have an opening, I don\u2019t want to do an interview, I don\u2019t want to do any charity work, I don\u2019t want to have any meetings about specifications and framing. I want to wake up every day and make art, and go to bed dreaming about art.\u201d She wants to exercise more, too. \u201cMy mind seems very agile and working well, but I\u2019m not up to muscle. I used to swim a kilometre a day, but now I don\u2019t, so I\u2019d like to get back to that again. I like kayaking, I do some horse-riding and I just want to get physically and mentally fit for the next chapter.\u201d   Related: Tracey Emin's luxury penis bracelet works like a charm on me    At the Tate\u2019s gala dinner a couple of days before, she says, one woman made the mistake of supposing to Emin that she was taking time off in order \u201cto keep the market at bay\u201d \u2013 in other words, that the sabbatical will have a beneficial effect on her work\u2019s prices. Emin was not amused. \u201cOh my God. I said, \u2018How dare you insult me? How dare you insult my passion? You know fuck all about art.\u2019 This is my vocation in life. You wouldn\u2019t say to a nun, \u2018You\u2019re going to be really quiet for a year, are you going to stop believing in God?\u2019\u201d Her relationship with art, she says, only gets more intense over the years. Pointing at a bronze sculpture of two figures called The Wedding, Emin says gleefully that her studio manager had reservations about the piece because she said that the bride reminded her of Princess Fiona from Shrek. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Oh wow, I watched it at Christmas and absolutely loved it.\u2019 Subconsciously I must have taken in this supreme childlike character. My idea of marriage is like Princess Fiona, so I was so pleased when she said that.\u201d Emin points between the legs of a bronze, a figure on her side titled I Just Wanted to Sleep With You. \u201cHer vagina\u2019s just like this hole,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not used, it\u2019s a vacant thing. It should be a vortex, you go up inside it and come back the other side as another human being, but it\u2019s no good. So it\u2019s a different place, different space.\u201d         Tracey Emin talking about her work Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963-1995 on YouTube    Emin has always expressed and explored her sexuality through her art. Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963-1995 was a tent viewers could enter and ponder their own bedfellows; in Why I Never Became a Dancer she recalls being \u201cslut-shamed\u201d as a teenager; and a series of artworks about a botched abortion she had in 1990 formed the centrepiece of her 2011 retrospective at the Hayward in London.  This has earned her plenty of disapproval. Instead of an art critic, she snorts, one paper got a \u201cvaudeville music hall-type theatre critic\u201d to review her 2014 White Cube show (the Daily Mail\u2019s Quentin Letts, who inevitably called it \u201cvulgar\u201d). \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have been allowed. But the images looked good \u2013 45,000 people went to my show in four weeks.\u201d If there\u2019s a bad review illustrated with great images, she adds, \u201cit makes a lot of people go to the show.\u201d Emin has been single for seven years. To coincide with her Hong Kong exhibition, a magazine commissioned her ex-boyfriend Mat Collishaw to photograph her, but then turned down the results as they didn\u2019t look like the \u201cMad Tracey from Margate\u201d of the Britart years. \u201cThey wanted the photos to look sexy like I did 20 years ago. But I was going, \u2018No, I\u2019m nearly 53, it\u2019s not possible, it\u2019s not happening.\u2019 So there\u2019s this kind of weird expectation of people wanting me to be how I was.\u201d     I Promise to Love You by Tracey Emin, from a 2015 show at the Lights of Soho gallery in London. Photograph: Nick Harvey/Rex/Shutterstock    She doesn\u2019t want Stone Love to be regarded as too sexual, saying that she loves the lyrics of the Bowie song \u201cbecause they\u2019re an expression of all the other different kinds of love that you can have\u201d. Her loves, she says, are unconditional, and also unconventional. It doesn\u2019t get much less conventional than marrying a stone \u2013 not a rock, she says, which has been cut by humans, but a stone. Emin shows me a picture of the stone in question: it\u2019s large, volcanic and covered in lichen, situated under a tree, with a magnificent sea view. She was amused by the furore her wedding created. \u201cI was in Hong Kong and my mum said she put the news on and it said, \u2018And the artist Tracey Emin was married this summer in a secret ceremony in France \u2026 to a stone.\u201d Yet she says she was making a serious point, too, embracing her status as a single, middle-aged woman, as well as expressing the artist\u2019s love of her materials, and her work.  The stone, she says, is \u201cbeautiful, it\u2019s paleolithic, it\u2019s monumental, it\u2019s dignified, it will never, ever let me down. It\u2019s not going anywhere: it\u2019s a metaphor for what I prefer to live with. I prefer to be single, doing everything I want to do and how I want to do it.\u201d Better than that, it cheers her up. \u201cIf I feel really low \u2013 anything from \u2018I shouldn\u2019t have said that\u2019 to \u2018I don\u2019t feel very well\u2019, to \u2018I feel a bit lonely\u2019 \u2013 I think about the stone and it actually makes me feel better.\u201d In the UK, Emin\u2019s public persona is so enormous, and often controversial (never more so than when she revealed that she was voting Conservative at the 2010 election, though she was hardly alone in being disillusioned by the then Labour government), that it\u2019s hard to detach it from her influence as an artist. Nonetheless, her impact is pretty clear, from her sexual frankness to her refusal to be hemmed into one medium. \u201cEven if they reject or dislike what I do, the young generation can bounce against what I\u2019ve done,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I\u2019d say that about the 70s, really hardcore feminists that worked really hard, they made it possible for me to do what I do.\u201d Just as she may have anticipated the selfie, Emin also made it more acceptable to explore one\u2019s private \u2013 even abject \u2013 emotions in public, which is one of the reasons she is disliked by those who accuse her of narcissism. Look at journalism, she says. \u201cTwenty years ago, people would never have said: \u2018So, I was standing outside the school gates with my coffee, thinking about the Pilates that I\u2019ve been doing this morning, about that fact that I shouldn\u2019t have worn the purple leggings because they\u2019re so unflattering \u2026 \u2019 This is how a serious piece of journalism would start now. The person could be about to write about fucking Isis or something. Before, it just would have been cold and analytical \u2013 especially serious newspapers like the Guardian. It\u2019s brilliant!\u201d \u2022 Tracey Emin\u2019s Stone Love is at Lehmann Maupin, New York until 18 June",
