  "body": "Campaign group 38 degrees has taken down a petition calling for BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg to be sacked, saying it had become a focal point for misogynist abuse. The majority of those signing and supporting the petition expressed concerns about what they saw as biased reporting of the Labour party and its leader Jeremy Corbyn by Kuenssberg. However, some supporters on social media used abusive and sexist language in calling for the BBC\u2019s first female political editor to go.   Related: We took down the Laura Kuenssberg petition to show sexist bullies can\u2019t win | David Babbs    38 Degrees executive director David Babbs said the petition had been taken down with the agreement of the person who had posted it. He said: \u201cI am really concerned that a petition hosted on the 38 Degrees website has been hijacked, and used as a focal point for sexist and hateful abuse made towards Laura Kuenssberg on Twitter. That is totally unacceptable and, with the agreement of the petition starter, we\u2019ve taken the petition down to prevent it being used in this way. There is no place in the 38 Degrees family for sexism or any form of discrimination or hate speech.\u201d Prior to the petition being taken down, former Independent on Sunday political editor Jane Merrick told the Guardian that Kuenssberg had faced an extra layer of sexist criticism. \u201cShe has been called a whore and a bitch on Twitter,\u201d said Merrick. \u201cNick Robinson used to be accused of Tory bias but he never experienced this level of nastiness.\u201d \u201cOf course, not all Corbyn supporters are sexist \u2013 far from it \u2013 but there is a core of hard-left misogyny that comes out against women when Corbyn is under pressure \u2013 such as the abuse against Stella Creasy and Jess Phillips. Jeremy Corbyn said back in September he wanted a \u2018kinder politics\u2019 so he should condemn these vile attacks against a respected and experienced journalist.\u201d The original poster of the petition had also tried to distance himself from those using it to make misogynistic attacks, writing in an update that he \u201cwould like to reassure everyone that I am a passionate advocate for equality in all areas, not just gender equality\u201d. He added: \u201cThis petition has precisely zero to do with Kuenssberg\u2019s gender. Regardless of the gender you identify with, there is no excuse for biased reporting and misrepresentation of facts when you represent an organisation that has been famed for its impartiality and balanced approach.\u201d",
