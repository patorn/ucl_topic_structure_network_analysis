When Lewis arrived at the business in October 2014, he ordered the immediate sale of the supermarket\u2019s fleet of corporate aircraft and said he would be taking the train rather than a car into London from Tesco\u2019s Hertfordshire head office. That saving alone, he said, would pay for an extra member of staff in store for a day. Taking the train \u201cequates to one day for one colleague in-store,\u201d Lewis told trade journal Retail Week. Despite Lewis\u2019s cost-saving decree, Benny Higgins, the chief executive of the supermarket\u2019s retail bank, spent more than the annual salary of a shop assistant on London taxis between March and the end of October last year, according to documents seen by the Guardian.

Some of the taxi claims, for relatively short journeys, run to hundreds of pounds. Higgins, who is fond of quoting poetry and is known as a voracious reader, visited literary clubs The Academy and The Society Club and The London Capital Club as well as Richard Caring\u2019s Ivy Club all by taxi. He also billed the company for journeys to Japanese restaurant Roka, Belgravia bistro La Poule au Pot, and Gordon Ramsay\u2019s Bread Street Kitchen.  The taxi fares suggest Higgins tends to spend at least half the week in London, even though the head office of Tesco Personal Finance, the division which includes the bank, is in Edinburgh. A Tesco source said: \u201cThe costs are just out of control.\u201d Higgins, one of Scotland\u2019s most high-profile banking figures, has been in charge of Tesco Personal Finance since 2008. He spent more than \u00a3170 \u2013 more than twice the daily earnings of a Tesco shop assistant \u2013 on trips to and from the Royal Opera House from the Soho Hotel \u2013 a 15-minute walk.

Photograph: Alamy    A Friday trip to the Victoria & Albert museum \u2013 five stops on the Underground which would have cost less than \u00a35 with an Oyster card \u2013 resulted in a \u00a3389.85 taxi bill for Tesco. The bills submitted to the company do not explain why the taxi charges are so high, but they detail the trip, the date, any \u201cpriority fee\u201d and the passenger\u2019s name. He also billed the supermarket \u00a32,000 for trips to Tesco\u2019s corporate offices in Cheshunt, Welwyn Garden City and Finsbury Pavement.  Higgins also spent more than \u00a38,600 on trips to and from the airport, not including those for his daughters or non-Tesco executives . On at least one occasion Higgins claims for more than one trip from his London base to the airport on the same weekend. The Tesco banker uses the Soho Hotel \u2013 a boutique hotel just down the road from his London apartment \u2013 for business meetings when he is in the capital and, according to his taxi expenses, he is there several times a week, often entertaining at his favourite table.  Last year he also made taxi trips to Sopwell House, a Georgian country house hotel and spa near St Albans, east London boutique hotel Andaz and Hanbury Manor, a five-star hotel and country club in Hertfordshire.

One source said staff were unhappy that a director who earned \u00a32.2m in the year to March, up from \u00a31.7m a year before, appeared to be claiming taxi fares for personal trips while the bank faced tricky times.  A Tesco spokesperson refused to comment on the detail or scale of the claims, or whether Higgins\u2019s claims were sanctioned, but said: \u201cAll Tesco colleagues adhere to a clear policy that allows travel and other expenses for business reasons.\u201d Having previously held senior roles at RBS and Standard Life, Higgins is a multi-millionaire, having left HBOS in 2007 with a \u00a32m golden goodbye after less than two years\u2019 work. The source said there was anger that there had been no major changes to processes and Higgins continued to sign off his own expenses, including large personal taxi fares, even after the issue had been raised at a senior level within Tesco on previous occasions, under the current and former management. \u201cNobody is allowed to say anything. This is a man who could easily afford for personal taxis for his kids going to the airport.\u201d Higgins also signed off large expenses for other directors. While he personally was the biggest spender on London taxis, Therese Procter, the bank\u2019s people director, appeared to be by far the biggest claimant for other non-travel expenses. She billed the company for more than \u00a39,000 of expenses in eight months \u2013 including membership of the exclusive Ivy Club in London, favoured by celebrities such as Kate Moss and Kevin Spacey. Underlying pretax profits at Tesco Personal Finance slid 11% to \u00a3197m in the year to March 2016 excluding restructuring costs of \u00a31m and losses on financial instruments, movements on derivatives and hedge accounting of \u00a38.1m. The bank cut about 240 head office jobs last year and is understood to be considering a further 10% to 20% cut in head count as the bank tries to offset the loss of income from fees charged to retailers on credit card payments.

A further 2,500 jobs were lost with the closure of 43 Tesco stores. Lewis has also closed down the grocer\u2019s longstanding head office in Cheshunt as part of his cost-cutting programme. Store staff received a 3.1% increase in basic pay this year, ahead of the introduction of the new minimum wage for over-25s but the deal was offset by cuts in extra pay for Sunday and bank holiday shifts from July.  Lewis, who was hired from Unilever to turn around Tesco in the wake of a sales and profits collapse, has made clear that he is looking at costs across the business. He has sold a number of businesses, ranging from its Blinkbox books and video-streaming business to its huge grocery business in South Korea to pay off debts. Lewis is still trying to offload other businesses, including the Giraffe restaurant chain and the Dobbies Garden Centre business. He has pledged to \u201clook at every aspect of cost and see how that affects the customer\u201d.",
