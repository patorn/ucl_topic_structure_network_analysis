On Thursday, after a gruelling international online competition which saw 35 entries whittled down to two finalists, Museum Victoria in Australia and Virginia\u2019s Chrysler Museum of Art will compete for a coveted title: the third annual Museum Dance-Off world championship. The rules are simple: any organisation in the Glam (Gallery, Library, Archive, Museum) family can submit a video dance, set to music; entries should be between two and five minutes; and anyone involved in the institution \u2013 staff, volunteers, interns or visitors \u2013 can take part.  And thus arrives an unlikely new genre of YouTube video: lovably awkward museum staffers dancing with reckless abandon among multi-million-dollar collections. Museum Victoria\u2019s submission has made it to the grand final \u201cThunderdome\u201d round on Thursday, and the staff are abuzz.  \u201cIt\u2019s a very important achievement,\u201d deadpans Helen Privett, the museum\u2019s conservation manager-cum-dance captain. \u201cWe\u2019re all excited about it, to be truthfully honest. Everyone I\u2019ve spoken to has mentioned it.\u201d Privett\u2019s day job is not a small one: her team prepares the museum\u2019s collection of 17m objects for loan and exhibition, and develops new preservation strategies. But last month, she spent her downtime coordinating different departments to choreograph sections of Fatboy Slim\u2019s 2001 hit Weapon of Choice, before performing it to camera. Privett \u2013 also a tap dancer who features in the video \u2013 won\u2019t tell me which department dances the best (\u201cwe\u2019re all very competitive, I wouldn\u2019t be able to say\u201d), but she does mention a standout star: \u201cJohn Patton, the man in the purple pants, has routinely been pointed out as one of the highlights.\u201d  Patton is acting manager of Museum Victoria\u2019s Bunjilaka Aboriginal Cultural Centre; his work begins at 1:26.             The Museum Dance-Off is run out of Baltimore, Maryland by WhenYouWorkAtaMuseum.com \u2013 a Tumblr filled with memes and anecdotes, directed at an audience that\u2019s exactly as niche as it sounds. Maggie G, who has worked in museums for more than a decade, started the site as a joke for a friend \u201cafter too much whiskey one night\u201d.  Somewhat inexplicably, the website took off \u2013 and soon after, the Indiana State Museum sent Maggie a video that had been made as an internal morale booster. The clip features museum workers of all stripes dancing to Pharrell\u2019s Happy, in various parts of the building.            \u201cI posted it on the blog because I was having a terrible day and it cheered me up,\u201d Maggie says. \u201cAnd then other museums started sending me the dance videos that they had made internally. I was like, well, people are already doing this, and I\u2019ve always wanted to run an international dance off. I might as well just try it.\u201d Maggie announced the first-ever tournament, giving museums six weeks to create a video or send her an existing one. Twenty two museums entered that year\u2019s competition, which was won by the National Sculpture Museum in Valladolid, Spain. The next year, 28 entered. The competition got serious. Voting blocs began to form. \u201cLast year Canada colluded excessively to make sure that there was an all-Canada final,\u201d Maggie says. \u201cThey got together on Twitter and Facebook and encouraged their communities to vote for other Canadian museums.\u201d  Maggie decided to institute Judge\u2019s Choice awards, to highlight work that had been kicked out early but deserved more attention. Needless to say, the whole thing is taking up more of her life than she expected. This year, 35 museums were in competition, including five from Canada, four from the UK, four from Australia, and one from Austria. Making it through to the final round, where they\u2019ll compete against Museum Victoria, is the Chrysler Museum\u2019s Groove Is In The Heart.            \u201cIt\u2019s very weird,\u201d says Maggie of the competition\u2019s success, which she also describes as \u201codd\u201d, \u201cstrange\u201d, and \u201cbizarre\u201d. \u201cIt amazes me that people still are into this and get so excited about it ... but I\u2019m totally impressed.\u201d (Of course, she warns, not everyone can take part. \u201cMemorial sites and the Holocaust Museum \u2013 to enter a dance-off is not so cohesive to their mission,\u201d she says carefully. \u201cSo they pass.\u201d) For Maggie, Thursday\u2019s grand final represents yet another surreal moment in her working life so far. \u201cMy high-school guidance counsellor told me to go to veterinary school because I would never have a career doing anything creative,\u201d she says. \u201cIf that\u2019s what I can contribute to this field of museology \u2013 starting an international dance-off \u2013 I\u2019ll go with it. It\u2019s at least an interesting thing to have on my resume.\u201d Museum Dance-Off: A Selection Of Favourites Sir Sam Funk, by the Orillia Museum of Art and History in Ontario, Canada (2015)            Maggie: I absolutely love this video for its creativity and cinematography (the awkward elevator moment is wonderful), and I was delighted to see it win the Museum Dance-Off 2 Thunderdome title last year. I don\u2019t vote during the competition, so I just cross my fingers for the videos I like and hope they make it. Can\u2019t Touch This Museum, by the Smithsonian Museum of National History in Washington, DC (2015)            Maggie: This also one of my forever favourites. It shows a really playful side of the staff, and they are obviously having so much fun making it. Also, they get props for being the first museum to dance to Can\u2019t Touch This, which is basically the theme song to your life when you\u2019re a museum employee. Uptown Funk by the Museum of Applied Arts and Sciences in Sydney, Australia (2015)       Maggie: I love this for a lot of reasons, but especially the bit with the guy in the top hat riding the disco ball like Miley Cyrus. Sharks vs Jets, by the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania (2012)            Maggie: The National Constitution Center took the Sharks and Jets scene from West Side Story, and turned it into something that really matched their museum\u2019s mission narrative. This was an entry in the first museum dance off; they had made the video for an internal company holiday party or something, and ended up submitting it. Footloose, by Reynolda House in Winston-Salem, North Carolina (2014)       Maggie: And this one is always in my top five, because they tackled Footloose and I think they just slayed it.  Voting for the third annual Museum Dance-Off Thunderdome opens on Thursday 12 May at 8am EDT This article initially placed the Chrysler Museum of Art in Canada; it is based in Virginia, USA",
