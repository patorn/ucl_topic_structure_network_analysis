  "body": "The remake of Roots has gained widespread critical acclaim \u2013 but not from Snoop Dogg, who posted a short video on Instagram on Monday criticising the show, and suggesting that African Americans should not watch it.  In the video, the rapper said that he was fed up with watching films and TV shows that depicted the abuse of black Americans. \u201c12 Years a Slave, Roots, Underground, I can\u2019t watch none of that shit,\u201d Snoop Dogg said, also taking aim at the Steve McQueen-directed Oscar-winning film and the WGN TV series about slaves in Georgia escaping via an underground railroad, which was recently renewed for a second season.    Related: Roots remake: seminal slavery narrative still resonates in revamped miniseries    \u201cThey just want to keep showing us the abuse that we took hundreds and hundreds of years ago,\u201d said Snoop Dogg. \u201cBut guess what \u2013 we\u2019re taking the same abuse. Think about that part. Why don\u2019t y\u2019all go and make a muthafuckin\u2019 series about the success that black folks is having?\u201d       The rapper is at least leading by example, with a current web series on AOL called Coach Snoop, which follows the Snoop Youth Football League. Snoop Dogg set up the league with the aim of getting inner-city children aged between five and 13 involved in football, and is its coach and commissioner.  Roots, meanwhile, revisits one of the most successful shows in US television history for the Black Lives Matter era. British actor Malachi Kirby stars as enslaved Gambian warrior Kunta Kinte in the first episode, which aired in America on Sunday. The show is executive produced by LeVar Burton, who played Kunta Kinte in the original 70s miniseries, which was based on the book by Malcolm X biographer Alex Haley.  Snoop Dogg concluded that he would not watch Roots, and advised his fans to avoid it. \u201cLet\u2019s create our own shit based on today, how we living and how we inspire people today. Black is what\u2019s real. Fuck that old shit.\u201d",
