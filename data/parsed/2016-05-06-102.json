  "body": "Outside a Walmart Supercenter at the heart of a senator\u2019s online manifesto and not far from the geographic center of the US, 79-year-old Duane Kiekow was adjusting to the reality that Donald Trump is his party\u2019s nominee.  \u201cI\u2019m grudgingly coming around to the fact that it appears to be Hillary and Trump. I\u2019ll take Trump,\u201d said Kiekow, a registered Republican. Senator Ben Sasse reignited the debate on Trump\u2019s qualifications in an open letter posted on Facebook on Thursday. In the post, Sasse, a first-term Republican, said the majority of Americans think both parties\u2019 leading presidential candidates are \u201cdishonest and have little chance of leading America forward\u201d. As evidence, Sasse catalogued what he described as unsolicited conversations from frustrated voters at his hometown Walmart Supercenter, citing a retired Democratic meatpacker, a young evangelical mom, a middle-aged Republican male and a Trump supporter. The \u201cretired union Democrat meatpacker\u201d is quoted as saying: \u201cWhat the heck is wrong with this city where you work? Why can\u2019t they give us a normal person? Is it really so hard?\u201d Sasse replied: \u201cActually, it is for them \u2013 because most people in DC buy the nonsense that DC is the center of the world. You and I, despite our party differences, both agree that Fremont is the center.\u201d Sasse\u2019s conclusion: \u201cNeither political party works.\u201d     Duane Kiekow says he\u2019ll \u2018grudgingly\u2019 back Donald Trump in the general election. Photograph: David Steen Martin for the Guardian    Outside that Walmart on a day when the senator\u2019s online manifesto was all the rage on talk radio, Kiekow and other voters in this solidly Republican swath of the US grappled with the presidential options ahead of them. Most agreed that their choices didn\u2019t reflect their interests. \u201cI say anyone but Trump. I don\u2019t care who wins as long as it\u2019s not Trump,\u201d said Pam Eix, a nurse in this tiny Nebraska city set amid farmland. Suzie Markey, a retired medical underwriter from Fremont, said she didn\u2019t know how she was going to vote. \u201cPeople don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m not the only one. I cannot vote for Donald Trump. It\u2019s a dilemma,\u201d Markey said. She said she was no fan of Hillary Clinton but Trump\u2019s crass language and personal insults did not appear presidential. \u201cIf my kids had acted that way, they\u2019d have been grounded,\u201d she said. Jim Stillman conceded that Hillary Clinton was more qualified but said he would back Trump anyway because of his stance on illegal immigration. Stillman, 54, who worked in construction in Omaha until a back injury sidelined him, said he often lost work to illegal immigration.     Pam Eix: \u2018I say anyone but Trump. I don\u2019t care who wins as long as it\u2019s not Trump.\u2019 Photograph: David Steen Martin for the Guardian    \u201cWe need new blood in there,\u201d Stillman said. \u201cI don\u2019t know who I\u2019m going to vote for,\u201d said Lois Verbeek, 79, of nearby Ames, Nebraska. She voted for President Obama but was hoping to vote for John Kasich. \u201cI kind of like Hillary, but I think she\u2019s part of the system.\u201d Unlike other states struggling with a hollow industrial base, Nebraska\u2019s agriculture-based economy is going strong, with a 3% unemployment rate. Still, the electorate appears anything but content. Nebraska Democrats favored Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton 57% to 43% in the party\u2019s caucus in March. The Republican primary is scheduled for next Tuesday. In February, Sasse became the first elected Republican to declare he would never vote for Donald Trump. With Wednesday\u2019s Facebook manifesto, coming on the heels of Trump\u2019s win in Indiana that virtually sealed the GOP nomination, the senator showed he was not backing down. Sasse, a 44-year-old former college president with a bachelor\u2019s degree from Harvard and PhD in history from Yale, has vowed not to vote for Trump. His rationale, at least online, was rooted in the vox populi and not his doctoral dissertation on the \u201cRise of Reagan\u2019s America\u201d. \u201cWhat am I missing?\u201d Sasse asked in his Facebook post. \u201cMore importantly, what are the people at the Fremont Walmart missing? Because I don\u2019t think they are wrong. They deserve better.\u201d     Senator Ben Sasse speaks at the American Conservative Union 2016 annual conference in Maryland. Photograph: Gary Cameron/Reuters    Many outside the Walmart on Thursday agreed. \u201cIt\u2019s just not a good pool of candidates to choose from and that\u2019s a sad thing for America,\u201d said Mike Raasch, a retired teacher who said he was Sasse\u2019s wrestling coach at Fremont senior high in the late 1980s. \u201cI\u2019d support Ben Sasse for president,\u201d he added. Sasse\u2019s open letter on Facebook called on America to \u201cdraft an honest leader\u201d as a third-party candidate but in a footnote he ruled himself out. As the father of three young children, Sasse said that he was not able to mount the necessary round-the-clock campaign from now until November. Kiekow, who said his wife taught Sasse Sunday school when he was a boy at Trinity Lutheran in Fremont, said he respects the senator\u2019s right to voice his opinion but was disappointed Sasse wasn\u2019t lining up behind the party\u2019s choice. \u201cIt comes down to the lesser of two evils,\u201d the Republican retiree said. A third-party candidate, Kiekow added, would be the \u201cworst possible outcome\u201d. \u201cThat guarantees a Hillary victory.\u201d",
