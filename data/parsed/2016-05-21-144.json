  "body": "We have a wireless in the bathroom, and I always put it on while I am doing my makeup. Quite often, I just top up the makeup I\u2019ve been wearing in the daytime. If I\u2019m going to be seen from far away, I like to have a\u00a0striking look, a bright lipstick in what I call a \u201cPatsy red\u201d. I was a model in the 60s, and we had to do our own makeup, even false eyelashes. I learned how to do\u00a0it all, very quickly, and I know what suits me. I put on a full face of\u00a0makeup pretty much every day, because of the ubiquity of mobile phones and people asking for selfies. Even if I\u2019m shuffling around the supermarket, I wear plenty, so I look nice and don\u2019t spoil anyone\u2019s selfie. Before I go out, I spend a moment looking through the wardrobe at what I\u2019ve got and considering what will suit the occasion. I think generally one bit of colour or detail works best. I used to keep things for ever, but now I clear out those that don\u2019t work every fortnight, giving them to charity. We\u2019ve all kept clothes for \u201cwhen I\u2019m really thin\u201d. I\u00a0think to myself, \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen, sweetheart.\u201d   Related: How I get ready: Neil Morrissey, actor    I\u2019m 5ft 8in with broad shoulders. I\u00a0have the advantage of having been a model, so I can kind of make clothes look all right, if they\u2019re right for me. Boat necks don\u2019t work, but with a\u00a0V-neck, suddenly my neck looks longer and my shoulders don\u2019t look so broad. For 50 years I\u2019ve seen myself on screen and in photos, and sometimes I\u00a0look at photographs with terror. But occasionally I see a\u00a0picture and think, \u201cOoh, from a\u00a0great distance, I\u00a0could almost have been Brigitte Bardot.\u201d  \u2022 Joanna Lumley is supporting Marks & Spencer\u2019s Shwopping initiative to raise money for Oxfam.",
