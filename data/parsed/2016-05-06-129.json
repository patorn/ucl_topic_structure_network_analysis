  "body": "Less than a week into May and I am already certain that it will be one of the most fraught months of my four years in Brazil. This is not so much because of the haywire political situation and the impeachment of Dilma Rousseff, the president, nor the upcoming Olympics in my home city of Rio de Janeiro. It is not even the Zika epidemic, nor the economic recession. Instead, my rising level of stress is primarily driven by the impending expiration of my journalism visa, which means that for the next few weeks, I will be mired in what must surely rank among the most Kafkaesque bureaucracies in the world. This is a country where I once had to provide the names of my father and mother, as well as my address, phone number, tax registration code and passport details, simply to buy a T-shirt at a small town department store.    Related: 100 days until Rio 2016: 'It will be a great party, with a garbage legacy'    To proceed with an online newspaper subscription, I recently had to reveal whether I was married and give my parents\u2019 names. Woe betide anyone who cannot provide details of their bloodline. In Brazil, form filling appears to be something of a national pastime. The more inquisitive and complex, the better.  That may come as a surprise particularly if you \u2013 like me, before I moved here \u2013 have an image of Brazil as a modern, relaxed, informal, happy-go-lucky kind of country. But the reality, at least in terms of paperwork, often turns out to be old fashioned, rigid, time consuming, expensive and mindnumbingly inefficient. As well as being a headache for individuals, it is a major drag on the economy and a huge disincentive for investment. This was one of the biggest shocks when I first arrived in Rio de Janeiro in 2012, mistakenly expecting the bureaucracy involved in moving to Brazil to be easier than for my previous posting in communist China. To get a journalism visa in Beijing in 2003 required a letter from my employer, proof of identity, an application form, copies of wedding and birth certificates for my family, and a health check, including an Aids test. That was fiddly, to be sure, but once these were complete, the process was surprisingly quick, efficient, inexpensive and good natured.  Easier still, with the help of a good local assistant, was opening a bank account, getting a phone line and renting an apartment. I was up and running much more quickly than I dared hope. China, I decided early on, was a country in a hurry. Brazil, by comparison, seemed determined to drag things out for as long as possible.     Brazilians protest against the president, Dilma Rousseff. But they might be equally frustrated with the bureaucracy. Photograph: Sebasti\u00e3o Moreira/EPA    For the 44 years of my life in which I was not based in Brazil, the only time I recall using a registry or a notary office was to get married. But in my first few months in Rio, I must have been more than two dozen times.  My signature was registered in four cart\u00f3rios (registry offices) so I could validate the documents that I needed to rent a home, own a car, open a bank account and import my belongings. I counted more than 100 pages of contracts, inventories, powers of attorney and other papers \u2013 all of which needed signing, stamping (with glued cart\u00f3rio stamps) and, of course, queueing up and paying for.  Naturally, I started to hate cart\u00f3rios. But they were necessary, I was told, because in Brazil, documents are assumed to be fake until proven genuine by an array of stamps, seals and signatures from the relevant authorities and offices. Mistrust, it seems, is part of the institutional furniture. Take my bank. Almost every month, I had to provide the manager with a letter explaining that cash transferred from the UK was my salary, rather than money I was laundering. It was almost the same amount every month, but I still needed a new letter each time. Initially, I tried to view this red tape from a wider and more optimistic perspective. Perhaps, I wondered, rigid regulations would mean fewer crimes, higher safety standards, better labour conditions and stricter environmental protection. But it was quickly obvious that this was not the case. Instead, the contrary is often true: excessive bureaucracy is a recipe for inefficiency and corruption.  It has certainly been doing the economy no favours. According to the World Bank\u2019s 2012 Doing Business report, Brazil ranked 126th out of 183 countries when it came to the ease of starting a company.  I am told that the situation is better than in the past. Regulations have been changed, meaning that cart\u00f3rios, once the inherited monopoly of a handful of wealthy families, can theoretically be run by anyone with the relevant qualifications. There have also been modest efforts to simplify the processes for opening bank accounts, renting property and starting companies. But there is a long way to go before Brazil has anything like the flexibility, dynamism and competitiveness of China. Given Brazil\u2019s long list of problems, cutting red tape is unlikely to be high on the agenda of the interim government that the vice-president, Michel Temer, is expected to form next week if the senate moves ahead with the impeachment of Rousseff. But in the longer run, it will be essential if Latin America\u2019s most populous nation is to recover from its current slump. In the meantime, I have to crack on with my visa renewal. My letter of appointment from the Guardian has been printed, legalised, notarised and officially translated. But I still have copies to make, queues to join and forms to fill in with my details, plus, of course, the names of my mother and father.  Probably something, somewhere, will not be quite right, so I will have to return again the next day, and perhaps the one after that. I would not be surprised if I have to make a trip to the cart\u00f3rio.  May looks set to be a long month.",
