  "body": "The death last month of Maram Saleh Abu Ismael, a young Palestinian mother, and her teenage brother, Ibrahim Taha, was violent, public and confounding. The Israeli account is that the pair were armed with knives, one of which Abu Ismael threw at an Israeli soldier as they approached the traffic lane of the main Qalandia checkpoint from Ramallah to Jerusalem. Warning shots were fired before she and her brother were shot dead by private security contractors. The version offered by family members is that the pair were confused, took the wrong lane at the vehicle-only checkpoint and were shot and killed after an altercation when they posed no threat.  The incident on 27 April is now the subject of an Israeli police investigation to establish whether the rules of opening fire were broken during the incident, while an autopsy has been ordered for the siblings. But in a series of conversations with witnesses and members of Abu Ismael\u2019s family, another darker possibility has emerged that might explain what happened.  Barely acknowledged in Palestinian society, it is the phenomenon of \u201csuicide by IDF\u201d \u2013 Israel Defence Forces. According to this scenario, Abu Ismael, who some family members allege was the victim of domestic violence, deliberately acted to draw the security forces\u2019 fire as a way of ending her life. To compound the tragedy, it is possible that her brother was trying to stop her when the pair were shot.

Photograph: Ahmad Gharabli/AFP/Getty Images    From the moment of their deaths, the siblings\u2019 case has had deeply puzzling aspects.  Abu Ismael was far from the standard profile of many of those involved in attacks since the outbreak of violence last October.  During this period, Palestinian attacks have killed 28 Israelis and two Americans, and 200 Palestinians have been killed, the vast majority in what Israel says have been attacks or attempted attacks on Israeli targets. Most of those Palestinians have been young men, often teenagers. Women accused of involvement in attacks have tended to be of school age or university students.  Abu Ismael was the 26-year-old mother of two girls, aged three and five. By all accounts she was not involved in a Palestinian faction, although her family are largely supporters of the Fatah movement of the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas. When an uncle tried to put up posters on the day of her death on behalf of Islamic Jihad, it prompted furious scenes inside the mourning hall. The partial answers that have emerged as to what occurred at the checkpoint \u2013 and, perhaps, why \u2013 have only highlighted the difficulties in trying to establish hard facts in a conflict where both sides are tightly attached to well-worn narratives of blame. Different family members have told stories sharply at odds with each other regarding almost all aspects of the story, including the condition for which Abu Ismael was going to be treated at a Jerusalem hospital that day, and whether her 16-year-old brother was already at the checkpoint or had been sent by the family to accompany her. Despite the claims by the family and some witnesses that Abu Ismael and her brother had no knives \u2013 and the fact that the Israeli police so far have declined to release video footage of the event \u2013 two other Palestinian witnesses have told the Guardian she did have a knife on approach to the busy checkpoint. A Palestinian water company worker, who asked not to be named, was close to the checkpoint when the incident occurred. \u201cI was at the crossing,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cI was about 20 metres away and I saw the girl approaching the checkpoint and she was shouting.  \u201cThe soldiers were shouting back but she was carrying a knife. Then someone [the brother] came from behind and tried to grab her arm and then bullets came from everywhere. I don\u2019t really know what happened. People were running and it was chaotic. Both fell on top of each other.\u201d  Family members have also offered deeply contradictory accounts of other parts of the story, in particular relating to Abu Ismael\u2019s state of mind in the run-up to her death. Members of her father\u2019s family from the village of Qatanna insist that Abu Ismael was planning to go that day for a hospital appointment in Jerusalem. Her brother, they say, had gone to accompany her. They say, too, that everything was normal in her life.

All of which raises the possibility \u2013 and not for the first time \u2013 that an individual involved in an attempted or actual attack did so as much for personal as political reasons: seeking either death or arrest. If that theory holds true it would not be the first possible \u201csuicide by IDF\u201d in the recent months of violence \u2013 not least in an established pattern of attacks where often the Palestinian attacker would have little expectation of surviving.  According to a senior Israeli military commander on the West Bank, who briefed journalists in March, investigations into the background of attacks had identified several cases where such a suspicion existed.  \u201cIn some cases, if you check more deeply,\u201d said the officer, \u201cyou come across cases where there are far more personal reasons [behind the attack]. Family problems. An argument with parents. Problems between a husband and wife. Even economic reasons.\u201d According to relatives, Abu Ismael had reasons to be upset. A cousin, Yahya, had been killed by Israeli security forces a few weeks before. Her marriage, too, was difficult. Abu Ismael\u2019s husband, a construction worker older than her, was unemployed. His family admits the couple had argued about him being out of work. And she had left home before, on one occasion \u2013 according to one of her family members \u2013 after an alleged incident of domestic violence. Barakat Abu Ismail, a cousin of Abu Ismael\u2019s husband, admitted she had left the family home taking the children, but insisted there was \u201cno dispute between the couple\u201d. Off the record, other family members had a different story to tell, suggesting relations between the two families were so bad after Abu Ismael\u2019s death that the husband\u2019s family was not allowed to pay its condolences, suggesting they were being blamed for the death. An older male cousin of Abu Ismael went further. \u201cHe hit her. This is not the first time she ran to her family. I don\u2019t know exactly what happened, but there is a lot of speculation in the family,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think she arranged to do something with her brother.\u201d Contrary to Abu Ismael\u2019s family account that her brother had accompanied her to the checkpoint for a hospital visit, the cousin said he was already at the crossing, having gone there with friends to throw stones. \u201cHer brother was there before her. And her brother was throwing rocks. I didn\u2019t see him but everyone has been talking about it. Also, the brother said I\u2019ll be with someone else. He didn\u2019t mean the sister, he meant other guys.  \u201cI think it was a shock to her brother [when she appeared]. Even if she did what the Israelis say she did, it wasn\u2019t right. Everyone saw the number of bullets they both got. It was not enough their cousin got killed too a few weeks before.  \u201cShe didn\u2019t tell anyone she was going to do something, but maybe it was a way out.\u201d What of her brother? According to this version, he saw her approach the wrong lane at the checkpoint and tried to pull her back, getting shot in the process. In an interview for the Israeli paper Haaretz, Abu Ismael\u2019s father, Salah, said that whatever happened there was no justification for shooting and killing his children.  \u201cLet\u2019s say she had a knife, even if she had a cannon, why couldn\u2019t they shoot her in the legs?\u201d the taxi driver said. \u201cAnd why did they shoot her brother? Why did they kill them both?\u201d And in the end, with Israeli police declining to release footage of the incident it is impossible to know what is true among the competing accounts of even the moments of death, in a struggle where, for individual, family and national-political reasons, even the facts are in conflict.",
