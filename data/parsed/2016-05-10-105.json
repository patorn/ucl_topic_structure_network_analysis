  "body": "Danny Welbeck faces the prospect of surgery and months out of the game, after tests on the right knee that he injured at Manchester City on Sunday showed up significant damage.   Related: Who should take Danny Welbeck's place in the England squad at Euro 2016?    The Arsenal forward, who will miss the European Championship with England, should have a more precise indication over the next 24 hours of how long he will be out but it is clear that it will not be a matter of weeks. It is a bitter disappointment for Welbeck, given that he returned in mid-February from a nine-and-a-half-month lay-off because of an injury to his other knee, and he had shown signs of rediscovering his touch. He had scored five times for Arsenal, including the last-minute winner against Leicester City in his comeback game, before he left the pitch in obvious distress at the Etihad Stadium. Welbeck contributed six goals during England\u2019s qualifying campaign for the European Championship and he was a certainty to be named in Roy Hodgson\u2019s squad for the finals. The manager will announce his Euro 2016 party on Monday, having delayed the initial plan to do so on Thursday.",
