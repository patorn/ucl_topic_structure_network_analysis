  "body": "Last year\u2019s Sydney film festival threw down the gauntlet to cinephiles, challenging only the city\u2019s bravest vitamin D-deprived souls to sit through a five-and-a-half hour Portuguese allegorical comedy about the state of the economy. There doesn\u2019t appear to be anything so butt-crunching on this year\u2019s program, although \u00ad\u2013 staying on the butt theme for a moment \u2013 there is Swiss Army Man, the already infamous \u201cfarting corpse movie\u201d starring Daniel Radcliffe as, well, a farting corpse. We\u2019re not going to take the bait and include such irresistibly out-there indie fare on this list of 10 things to see and do at the festival. Instead we\u2019ll examine more nuanced areas of interest, such as mermaid vampires.  The Lure: Polish romance-horror-mermaid musical   Related: The Lure: mermaid musical a splashy distraction until lack of story seems fishy    Director: Agnieszka Smoczynska / Country: Poland Not wanting to get her mermaid vampire movie confused with all those other mermaid vampire movies, Polish director Agnieszka Smoczynska also made her first feature film a musical. The story of gill-equipped teenage sisters Silver (Marta Mazurek) and Golden (Michalina Olszanska) being summoned from the sea only to end up as strippers won a jury prize at this year\u2019s Sundance film festival for \u201cunique vision and design\u201d. An award that could presumably have been given sight-unseen.            Everybody Wants Some!!: Richard Linklater\u2019s \u201cspiritual sequel\u201d to his cult classic Dazed and Confused   Related: Everybody Wants Some!! review: Richard Linklater's new college comedy is infectious fun    Director: Richard Linklater / Country: US The description \u201cspiritual sequel\u201d sounds a bit naff, but when those words are applied to Richard Linklater\u2019s coming-of-age classic Dazed and Confused they start to sound pretty awesome pretty quick. Drugs, sex and rock \u2018n\u2019 roll \u2013 as well as use of words such as \u201clike\u201d and \u201cman\u201d \u2013 are guaranteed to be part of this dramedy, set during the first three days at a fictitious college circa 1980. Linklater, returning as writer/director, is on a great streak. His previous three films (Boyhood, Before Midnight and Bernie), in their own distinct ways, have all been exquisite.             Red Christmas: Horror legend Dee Wallace stars in Aussie spooker Director: Craig Anderson / Country: Australia How many Australian-made Christmas horror movies can you name? Spotting an opening in the market, writer/director Craig Anderson (one of the forces behind ABC TV\u2019s terrific Black Comedy series) imported veteran scream queen Dee Wallace. She plays a mother who defends her family from a murderous stranger who may or may not be the child she thought she aborted 20 years ago. A quick squiz at Anderson\u2019s Instagram account makes it abundantly clear that in terms of schlocktastic B-movies, the dude has done his research.             A Journey of a Thousand Miles: Peacekeepers: a group of Bangladeshi policewomen join a UN peacekeeping mission to Haiti Director: Geeta Gandbhir, Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy / Country: Pakistan, US In the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, three Bangladeshi policewomen joined a unit of 160 travelling to the country for a year-long UN peacekeeping mission. They arrived poorly trained but determined, defying stereotypes and gender norms. The documentary A Journey of a Thousand Miles was co-directed by Geeta Gandbhir and Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy. Chinoy, a two-time Oscar winner, will also discuss her experiences as a woman making films in Pakistan during a talk at Town Hall.            Beyond Cinema: the festival explores new screen cultures beyond traditional cinema A VR program at a major film festival is a virtual (no pun intended) cert these days, as the technology begins to deliver highly interesting creative results. Sydney film festival have incorporated virtual reality into a broader screen culture section, which includes an Iranian bazaar-themed video art installation at Carriageworks and a 360-degree 3D cinematic theatre (not sure what exactly that is, but it sounds great) at University of New South Wales.  Elvis and Nixon   Related: Elvis & Nixon review: Michael Shannon resurrects the King    Director: Liza Johnson / Country: US Kevin Spacey as Richard Nixon and Michael Shannon as Elvis. Nuff said.            Bliss: Ray Lawrence\u2019s wonderfully strange 1985 film restored   Related: Bliss rewatched: a dark, controversial but amusing vision of purgatory    Director: Ray Lawrence / Country: Australia If you\u2019ve never seen the first feature film from Australian director Ray Lawrence \u2013 better known for his second, Lantana \u2013 there is no finer way to do so than on the big screen, watching a newly minted restored version. Three and a bit decades after the film caused its first walkouts (some 400 people shuffled to the exit at Cannes in 1985) words still cannot describe this insanely surreal story about an adman who dies and may or may not be stuck in purgatory. Read our attempt to get our heads around it here.            Party on after Strike a Pose and Viva   Related: Strike a Pose review \u2013\u00a0Madonna's dancers vogue back in anger    The match-a-cocktail-to-a-book movement never really caught on, because reading classic literature when you\u2019re sloshed is hard. But matching a film to an after party? That sounds about right. After Viva, which follows a troubled drag queen in Cuba, The Hub at Town Hall will host a Havana-themed party. After Strike a Pose, which investigates what happened to Madonna\u2019s Blond Ambition dancers, there\u2019ll be a silent disco.                       The Opposition: a David-and-Goliath battle set in the stunning peninsula of Paga Hill on Papua New Guinea\u2019s Port Moresby harbour Director: Hollie Fifer / Country: Australia Australian filmmaker Hollie Fifer\u2019s documentary, which examines a real estate dispute in Port Morseby, has been billed as \u201ca David-and-Goliath battle over land in Papua New Guinea\u201d. Last month former PNG politician Carol Kidu was granted an injunction from the New South Wales supreme court, successfully censoring all footage of her from the film. During these moments the screen will go dark and Sarah Snook will narrate the redacted material.             Chevalier: a group of men duke it out at sea in this satire of male competitiveness and insecurity Director: Athina Rachel Tsangari / Country: Greece Director Athina Rachel Tsangari belongs to the so-called \u201cGreek Weird Wave\u201d, which began with 2009\u2019s Oscar-nominated Dogtooth (she was one of the producers). Her new film takes aim at macho rivalry, set on a luxurious boat where a group of men compete about any random thing they can think of, in pursuit of the title of \u201cthe best in general\u201d. Sports range from comparing erection sizes to assembling Ikea furniture. Like The Lure, Chevalier is part of Sydney film festival\u2019s 10 Women Filmmakers to Watch program.
