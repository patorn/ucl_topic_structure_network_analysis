  "body": "You\u2019re playing Macheath in a new production of The Threepenny Opera at the National. Is this your first singing role?I sang a bit in a play called Burnt By the Sun, which we did at the National seven years ago \u2013 I was playing a Puccini-loving member of the Russian white guard. And I used to love singing as a teenager. There was a point in university where I was thinking about leading a choral life, but I thought I wouldn\u2019t be able to do as much acting, so I didn\u2019t pursue it. It has lain dormant for about 20 years. But the foundations are there.Yeah, although I started practising again at the end of last year and it\u2019s amazing how flabby those muscles get. It\u2019s a skill of the mind, singing, as much as the body. The singing lessons are much more of a mental challenge than a physical one, just keeping track of how you are producing your voice. Then once you get into the production, you have to forget about all that and make sure you\u2019re playing the character. I\u2019ve found the whole process really enjoyable.    It chimes with our sense of a growing divide in society, an awareness that the majority are ruled by an elite minority    Before this, were you constrained to singing in the shower?Yeah, and singing Happy Birthday. I enjoy playing the piano and singing at home, but I can\u2019t say the rest of the family do, so I\u2019ve been banished. Why is The Threepenny Opera relevant today?I don\u2019t think there has ever been a time between 1928 and now when the issues it raises haven\u2019t been relevant. It chimes with our sense of a growing divide in society and an awareness that the majority are ruled by an elite minority. It rings as strongly for an audience today as it did in 1920s Berlin. Your first play, The Herd, was produced at the Bush theatre in 2013 and later staged by Steppenwolf in Chicago. Would you like to write more plays?It was probably the most rewarding experience I\u2019ve had. It was extraordinary to sit in a rehearsal room, knowing that the director, actors and a designer were all there because of something I\u2019d written. But I am very much an actor who wrote a play \u2013 the collected play of Rory Kinnear \u2013 and while I am trying to write another, Simon Stephens [who adapted The Threepenny Opera] writes more plays during my lunch break than I ever will in my entire life. I am still bewildered at the commitment it takes to be a full-time writer.   Related: Rory Kinnear: my life in five shows    I wrote The Herd because I felt I had something to say about that subject matter. It\u2019s about a family living with a severely disabled young son. In the play, the strain of looking after the son had broken up the marriage, but for my parents [their elder daughter, Karina, was born with cerebral palsy] it brought them much closer together. I don\u2019t want to write something else just for the sake of it, I want to feel I\u2019ve got something to say. You played Hamlet at the National in 2010, to great acclaim. So much importance is ascribed to that role. Did you experience a sense of deflation afterwards?No, though I did miss the play. We did it for about eight or nine months, during which time my first child was born. So for five months I performed it in a fog and morass of tiredness. But in those first few months of new parenthood, having something to do in the evening gave me a much-needed bolt of energy. People would say, aren\u2019t you knackered? But I think without it, I would have been so much more tired. It probably affected my performance but not necessarily in a bad way.     Rory Kinnear as Hamlet at the National Theatre in 2010. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian    In a weirdly prescient 2011 episode of the TV series Black Mirror, you played a British prime minister coerced into having sex with a pig. When David Cameron had his own #piggate last September, what was your first thought?My first thought was: why? A friend texted to say, \u201cYou\u2019re going to have a fun day speaking to journalists about this\u201d, but I think you\u2019re the first to ask me about it. The main thing I imagined was probably [series creator] Charlie Brooker\u2019s triumphant sense of glee when he heard the news. Are your children aware of what you do?Riley, my eldest, knows and he\u2019s reasonably interested. He likes to know what parts I\u2019m playing and what happens to the characters. But neither of them have seen much \u2013 I\u2019m trying to keep them sheltered from that particular disappointment in life. The only time Riley\u2019s seen me on screen was when someone sent over a preview copy of a TV drama I did about Lord Lucan. He came in just as I was about to bludgeon the poor nanny to death. I had to leap for the pause button before he could see the full horror.         Watch Rory Kinnear in Black Mirror    If your kids developed an interest in acting, would you encourage them?Yes. I\u2019m glad I followed this path. I love my job and the life it creates for me. I wouldn\u2019t tell them no, whatever they wanted to do. They wouldn\u2019t listen to me anyway, by the looks of things. Your parents [Roy Kinnear and Carmel Cryan] were both actors. What are the advantages and disadvantages of coming from an acting background?I can\u2019t necessarily think of any disadvantages. In terms of advantages, you recognise acting as a feasible career, as a job that can support life. I was in drama school with people who were the only members of their family to pursue acting and they probably felt a greater pressure to succeed or prove their families wrong than I ever did. Did you ever consider a different career?There was butcher, goalkeeper, maybe lawyer, when I was thinking should I do something sensible as I ended my degree. At first I probably enjoyed acting because it got me attention. I didn\u2019t really have much else in my armoury to get attention apart from acting.

Photograph: Popperfoto    Of those three forfeited careers, which would have made you happiest?I still nostalgically think of butchery. I liked the smell. When I was growing up, I would go down to East Sheen high street with my dad. I loathed the smell of the fishmongers but loved the butchers. Blood and sawdust smells: there\u2019s still something about them that chimes with a childhood sense of ambition. How do you relax?Reading is the thing I enjoy more than anything \u2013 and listening to music. I\u2019m trying to read one whopper per year and I\u2019ve just finished The Sea of Fertility by Yukio Mishima. The next one will be Roberto Bola\u00f1o\u2019s 2666. You read The Sea of Fertility knowing that weeks after Mishima finished writing it, he committed hara-kiri, which does loom over the experience. Do you tend to read dark books?I tend to read older books. I don\u2019t read much contemporary fiction or listen to much contemporary music \u2013 although my son sometimes comes home from school singing whatever\u2019s in the charts. The latest was Silent\u00f3 \u2013 \u201cWatch me whip, Watch me nae nae\u201d \u2013 so I feel I\u2019m up to date with the best stuff. What\u2019s next?The third season of Penny Dreadful starts next week, in which I play Frankenstein\u2019s creature \u2013 with makeup, I should hastily add. Then I\u2019m doing a comedy series about 19th-century doctors called Quacks. I play an arrogant surgeon; Matt Baynton is a proto-psychiatrist, Tom Basden is an anaesthetist. We\u2019re trying to be pioneers of science, but it\u2019s a comedy series so nothing goes entirely to plan. The Threepenny Opera is at the National Theatre from 18 May to 1 Sep",
