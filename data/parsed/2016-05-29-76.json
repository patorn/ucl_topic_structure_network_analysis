  "body": "England may still be a work in progress but the concept of defeat under Eddie Jones remains entirely alien. They can set out for Australia this week in optimistic mood, having scored five tries against well-beaten opponents who faded badly after a bright start. Wales, on the other hand, will leave for New Zealand in deeply contemplative mood, having also had their experienced flanker Dan Lydiate invalided out of the tour. The final margin of defeat could have been even wider against an England side missing 10 players involved in the Premiership final. George Ford has already had a tricky month and contrived to miss six of his seven attempted kicks at goal in perfect conditions. Jones defended his fly-half afterwards, pointing out that Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan also had their occasional off-days, but the contrast with the currently dead-eyed Owen Farrell was inescapable.   Related: Saracens Premiership champions after Alex Goode ends Exeter fightback    The good news for England is that, even without the all-conquering Saracens posse, there are several young players doing their best to complicate Jones\u2019s selectorial plans. If Joe Launchbury was a deserving man of the match, there were notable tries from the Harlequins pair Jack Clifford and Marland Yarde and sufficient energy on his debut from Teimana Harrison to justify his promotion. Luther Burrell, Anthony Watson and Ben Youngs also contributed well-taken tries, even if some of Wales\u2019s defence left plenty to be desired. Warren Gatland put a brave face on the outcome, insisting the problems exposed in the second half were fixable, but Wales have not conspicuously kicked on since ambushing England on this ground in the pool stages of last autumn\u2019s World Cup. Jones, for his part, took issue with those pointing fingers at Ford, suggesting that any fly-half whose side scores five tries against Wales cannot have had too disastrous a game. He was more concerned about the way in which a frustrated Dan Biggar remonstrated with the French referee Marius Mitrea following Clifford\u2019s try, which came after Dan Cole had knocked down an attempted pass from Biggar. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to be careful of that in rugby ... that shouldn\u2019t happen,\u201d insisted Jones, also disputing the Welsh view that Cole had knocked the ball forward. \u201cI didn\u2019t like how Biggar went on afterwards. When you look at the replays it\u2019s definitely a try. The ball went backwards and Coley tried to catch the ball. Tightheads should be rewarded for trying to catch the ball, don\u2019t you think?\u201d Gatland felt very differently, having watched Clifford outpace Scott Williams over 50 metres for the 47th-minute try that tilted the game England\u2019s way. \u201cThere\u2019s no attempt to catch the ball, it\u2019s been knocked down and not in any way controlled. Dan was adamant it was a knock-on. There wasn\u2019t any abuse, that would be unacceptable but there\u2019s nothing wrong with a player showing a bit of passion. It was a pretty important decision at a pretty vital time of the game.\u201d When any side lose the second half of a Test 17-0, however, it is impossible to argue too long and loud. Wales may have looked the sharper side initially, the lively Rob Evans crashing over to reward a sustained period of pressure, but their early 10-0 lead proved a mirage on a lovely sunny afternoon. The powerful Burrell, set to replace the injured Manu Tuilagi in the Australian tour party, struck back at the end of the first quarter, surging from deep to gather Youngs\u2019s short pass, but after Biggar had slotted a third penalty to extend his side\u2019s lead to 13-5 the visitors had only themselves to blame for not increasing it. A long breakout from Hallam Amos and Jamie Roberts should have yielded a score, only for Scott Baldwin to end up isolated on the left wing when moving the ball right was the obvious option. England needed some kind of response and a 33nd\u2011minute try by Watson provided it, even if some TV angles cast doubt over whether the winger reached the line before the ball was dislodged by a sliding Biggar. Ford, again, took aim only for the ball to fade past the right post for the third time in a row. Whatever Jones said at half-time clearly worked. Within three minutes Wales were caught out by Clifford switching to the scrum-half role, allowing Youngs to appear from slightly deeper and step past Baldwin to score. Clifford\u2019s long-distance gallop followed almost immediately and, at 22-13 down, Wales were toiling.   Related: England 27-13 Wales: international rugby union \u2013 as it happened!    With no Welsh sides involved in the Pro12 play-offs their players have been short of recent rugby, while Lydiate\u2019s early departure with hamstring and shoulder joint injuries scarcely helped. It still did not wholly explain the visiting bench\u2019s lack of impact, nor the poor tackling that saw Yarde power over for a fifth try. England allowed a big lead to slip in their World Cup pool game but this time they eased home with a bit to spare. It has certainly buoyed Jones \u2013 \u201cI was surprised we won so easily; I thought it would be a lot tighter\u201d \u2013 as he prepares to return to his homeland. He suspects a \u201cmuch harder\u201d assignment awaits in Australia but insists he has \u201cno doubt we can win the series\u201d against the Wallabies. The three Tests should certainly be lively affairs, particularly if conditions are good. On the evidence of this fast-moving game, the argument that top-level rugby union is better played in the depths of a European winter feels increasingly perverse.
