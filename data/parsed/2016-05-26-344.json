  "body": "When Inky the octopus made global headlines for his eight-legged getaway from a New Zealand aquarium, I seemed to be the only person on the internet whose imagination was not caught up in his \u201cgreat escape\u201d. Chalk it up to tall poppy syndrome. But Inky\u2019s \u201cdaring\u201d (ABC) pursuit of \u201cliberty over security\u201d (NPR) was no more \u201camazing\u201d (the Telegraph) a feat than that which any no-name captivity octopus, anywhere in the world, is capable of any day. It\u2019s not that Inky\u2019s overrated per se. He\u2019s just representative. To reference 2004\u2019s \u201cfirst interspecific study of octopus escape behaviour\u201d, as one does, written records of them leaving the water date back more than 2,000 years to Aristotle\u2019s time. Octopuses are a) clever and b) able to squeeze into any space that can fit their beak, the only hard part of their bodies, posing a real challenge for aquarists. Blotchy, the octopus that Inky left behind at the National Aquarium, could have done the same (but was smarter not to, given that octopuses die within about 10 minutes of being out of water). Instead he\u2019s being shamed in the New York Times for being \u201cless independence-minded\u201d when octopuses\u2019 escape-artistry is just about one of the least interesting things about them. Not because it\u2019s not interesting, but because there\u2019s so much to choose from.   Related: The great escape: Inky the octopus legs it to freedom from aquarium    Octopuses were the first intelligent beings on Earth, evolving more than 400m years ago and some 230m years before mammals. They have two more hearts and about 10,000 more genes than humans do. Three-fifths of their neurons are in their arms, which they can regrow. They\u2019re cannibalistic loners; most have sex at a distance: sucker-to-sucker, eye-to-eye, beak-to-beak. Not only can they change colour when mimicking objects and other animals, they may be able to see with their skin. I could go on all day. I love octopuses. \u201cSame, they\u2019re delicious!\u201d say acquaintances hearing this for the first time, with self-evident pleasure at their quick wit, which dissipates at the sight of my stony expression. By no means do I eat ethically. My supermarket shopping is determined by cost, not conscience or even quality, and I\u2019ve talked myself out of vegetarianism \u2013 twice \u2013 by conjuring iron deficiencies not backed up by blood tests. But when it comes to eating octopuses, squid and cuttlefish, I can finger-wag with the most boorish of vegans. No one who considers themselves interested in the inner lives of animals, the wonders and mysteries of the natural world, can eat cephalopods in good conscience. Think about this when you\u2019re next chowing down on baby octopus salad:  Octopuses can navigate mazes, solve puzzle toys, open jars \u2013 even childproof ones \u2013 without instruction. (Those in captivity stimulated thusly are said to be more likely to escape.) One was observed by a researcher bringing rocks back to its den, stacking them at the entrance, then going to sleep with peace of mind. Another was filmed carrying two halves of a coconut along the ocean floor \u2013 stopping, pulling them together, then climbing inside. The Pacific striped variety is known to tap shrimp on the opposite side of its body \u2013 its shoulder, if you will \u2013 causing it to jump into its waiting arms.  But they\u2019re delicious! It says nothing good about mankind\u2019s relationship with the natural world that news of increasing global populations of octopuses can be titled \u201cGood news for calamari lovers\u201d. A new study has found that cephalopods around the world are experiencing a baby boom \u2013 influenced by environmental changes such as overfishing and warming ocean temperatures \u2013 at such a rate that the lead author called them the \u201cweeds of the sea\u201d. You could argue that this is all the more reason to eat them. Well, fine. Just don\u2019t use population control as an excuse to make yourself feel better about eating something with the ability to use tools. \u201cThere\u2019s lots of them!\u201d Yes, and every one of them has more genes than you do.  \u201cNot all cephalopods!\u201d Sorry, squid and cuttlefish aren\u2019t excepted. They have many of the same traits as octopuses, such as the ability to tactically change shape and colour, and though less is known about their intelligence, they are more social. But tuck in, I hear they\u2019re all delicious. Chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s couldn\u2019t give up octopus for two months, even after Paul the psychic octopus correctly picked a Football World Cup win for Spain.    If Spain wins today octopus is out of all my menus! Word\u2014 Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s (@chefjoseandres) July 7, 2010      The pardon is over, my friends. We thank Paul, but octopus is back on the menu! See u @zaytinyadc and @jaleotapasbar.\u2014 Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s (@chefjoseandres) August 31, 2010    Go ahead, order the calamari. I\u2019ll sit back and scowl silently, and think about Ozymandias. A couple of years ago, I paid $20 for naming rights to an octopus newly acquired by a small, local aquarium. I called him after the king of kings: look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair.     Elle Hunt with Ozymandias at the Island Bay Marine Education Centre in Wellington, New Zealand in 2012. Photograph: Luke Appleby    Ozy quickly lived up to his name, opening a screw-top jar in fewer than 60 seconds to reach the delicious crab inside. It was never certified, but the owners of the aquarium seemed fairly certain it was a world record-breaking time \u2013 or at least faster than that set there by Cassandra, a previous charge, in 2012. As a proud octomom, \u201cfairly certain\u201d was good enough for me \u2013 and local media, who reported \u201cWellington octopus a world-beater\u201d. I showed my parents the clipping, proudly pointing out the bit where Ozy was described as \u201cresponsive and precocious\u201d. \u201cThis is the closest we might get to a grandchild,\u201d said Mum to Dad. She didn\u2019t seem all that disappointed, and why would she be. After about four months at the centre, the time came for Ozy to be released to make way for new octopuses. To mark the occasion, I threw a party at the aquarium at which Ozy roamed free in the touch-gently pool to the bemusement of my friends. The next day, deeply hungover and in front of a small audience of supportive onlookers, I carried Ozy in a big plastic box to where the rocks met the water and gently tipped him out. He sat there. I held one of his many arms. We remained like that for a minute, his little suction cups twisted around my hand. Then he was covered by a wave, and then he was gone. The British zoologist Martin Wells \u2013 the grandson of HG Wells and a cephalopod expert of some renown \u2013 was one of many to liken the octopus to an alien. But when I made eye contact with Ozymandias, I saw something akin to human intelligence \u2013 a sort of scrutiny \u2013 that I had never experienced from a dog or farm animal. The closest I\u2019ve come was the assessment of a child whose comprehension as yet exceeds their language ability, or one of the smarter parrots. Of course I might be anthropomorphising, just as the press did with Inky. But if Wells is right and octopuses are truly foreign to us, well I, for one, welcome our new cephalopod overlords. And you might come to regret those calamari rings.",
