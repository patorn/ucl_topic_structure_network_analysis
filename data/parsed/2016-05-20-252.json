  "body": "There has been a lot of discussion on open relationships lately, with ongoing reports about a celebrity threesome, and the TV personality Saira Khan saying she has given her husband permission to sleep with other women (something he later denied). Khan said on ITV\u2019s Loose Women that the reason her husband could have an affair was because she had lost her sex drive. \u201cWe used to have a fantastic sex life. I still love my husband, we cuddle up and it\u2019s lovely. We\u2019ve been together for 11 years, but I\u2019m not interested [in sex]. I don\u2019t want to,\u201d she said. Non-monogamous relationships are increasingly being talked about and in 2009 it was estimated that there were about half a million polyamorous relationships in the US \u2013 although exact figures are hard to come by. Are you in an open relationship? If so, then we want to hear from you. What are the challenges and benefits? Is it something that is more common among particular generations?
