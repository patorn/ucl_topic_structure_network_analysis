But over the course of her hour-long conversation with Variety\u2019s Ramin Setoodeh, she proved herself wrong, passionately advocating on behalf of fellow female directors.  The actor and film-maker is in Cannes to premiere her fourth feature as director, Money Monster, outside of competition. She previously directed 1991\u2019s Little Man Tate, 1995\u2019s Thanksgiving comedy Home for the Holidays and 2011\u2019s Mel Gibson vehicle, The Beaver.  The two-time Oscar winner, who famously began her career as a child actor, opened the discussion by reflecting on her 50 years in film, addressing how far she believes women have come in Hollywood despite the challenges they still face \u2013 a recent report from the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University found that women directed just 7% of Hollywood\u2019s top 250 films in 2014.

I saw faces change as time went on. When I was young, there were a lot of men on movie sets ambling around these towns, getting into trouble and unhappy. Everything changed when women got onto movie sets. Suddenly it felt more like a family \u2013 and movie sets became healthier.\u201d Foster, who played the lead in hits including The Silence of the Lambs, Nell and Contact, was asked why projects with women in the lead have largely shifted to the independent film arena, as well as television.  \u201cI think studio executives are scared, period,\u201d Foster said. \u201cI think this is the most risk-averse period in movie history. Now so many things have changed in terms of the economy, the structure of studios.\u201d She urged the film-makers in the room \u201cto realize the business is shifting\u201d and \u201cget used to the landscape\u201d.

So the rules are going to be different. The conversation has to become as complex as possible to really attend to the issues.\u201d Foster said that female directors looking to make an impact in a male-dominated industry need to be as adaptable as possible. \u201cYou want to tell stories with whatever technology is happening,\u201d Foster said. \u201cIf you\u2019re telling them on iPhones, great. You roll with the time and stay relevant \u2013 and adapt to what\u2019s around you. There\u2019s a democratization that technology has brought that\u2019s wonderful \u2013 women can take advantage of them, minorities can.\u201d Foster, who has also directed for television, taking on episodes of House of Cards and Orange is the New Black, meanwhile praised the medium for being \u201cmore open to women\u201d. Asked why women are afforded more opportunities on the small screen, both behind and in front of the lens, Foster offered: \u201cFinancially, it\u2019s less of a risk.\u201d \u201cWhen you have less risk, you\u2019re willing to take more chances,\u201d she added. Foster didn\u2019t concede that television is producing greater content than film, but did stress that \u201cTV is where you go for narrative\u201d nowadays, with studios so invested in releasing franchise films and tentpoles.  Over the course of her acting career, Foster has only worked with one fellow female director: Mary Lambert, who directed her in the 1987 film Siesta. Asked how the experience of making a film with a woman differed from working with male film-makers, Foster said it all boils down to a directing style she describes as \u201cgood parenting\u201d.   Related: The meal deal: Woody Allen, Jessica Chastain and Kirsten Dunst at the Cannes opening dinner    \u201cI was 23 or 24, and I needed somebody to tell me to change my behavior [on the set],\u201d Foster recalled. \u201cI won\u2019t tell you what that was, but Mary took me aside sat me down and said, \u2018No, you can\u2019t do that. That\u2019s disrespectful.\u2019 She took me aside the way a parent would. At that age, I really listened. I was really grateful that a director sat me down like a person. \u201cOur leadership styles are informed by our mothers and how we were raised. If you\u2019re a woman, you\u2019re going to have a different leadership style based on your background.\u201d On her own temperament as a director, Foster admitted to confusing people for being very direct with her colleagues on set.  \u201cI think men are often confused by women who don\u2019t follow traditional rules in conflict,\u201d Foster said. \u201cBut guess what: all they need to do is have more experiences with them. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big plot of men putting women down in the film business \u2013 the film industry is pretty progressive. They\u2019re just stuck with the same traditional models and they\u2019re trying to figure out how to get around that. But they haven\u2019t had enough experiences with women to do that.\u201d",
