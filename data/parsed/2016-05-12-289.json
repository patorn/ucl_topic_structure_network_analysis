After a marathon 20-hour debate that one politician described as the \u201csaddest day for Brazil\u2019s young democracy\u201d, senators voted 55 to 22 to suspend the Workers\u2019 party leader, putting economic problems, political paralysis and alleged fiscal irregularities ahead of the 54m votes that put her in office.   Related: Brazil president Dilma Rousseff suspended after impeachment vote - live    Rousseff, Brazil\u2019s first female president, will have to step aside while she is tried in the upper house for allegedly manipulating government accounts ahead of the previous election. Her judges will be senators, many of whom are accused of more serious wrongdoing. A final decision, which is likely in September or October, will require a two-thirds majority. Ominously for the president, this margin was exceeded in Thursday\u2019s vote. Speaking after the vote, Rousseff remained defiant, denying that she had committed any crime, and accusing her opponents of mounting a \u201ccoup\u201d.  \u201cI may have committed errors but I never committed crimes,\u201d Rousseff said during a 14-minute address, at one point choking up. \u201cIt\u2019s the most brutal of things that can happen to a human being to be condemned for a crime you didn\u2019t commit. There is no more devastating injustice.\u201d The impeachment is more political than legal. Similar fiscal irregularities went unpunished in previous administrations, but they are a pretext to remove a leader who has struggled to assert her authority. After Rousseff came to power in 2010, she initially enjoyed some of the highest ratings of any leader in the world. But her popularity has slumped along with the economy, now in its deepest recession for decades.  Adding to her woes have been a fractious parliament and a massive corruption scandal at the state-run oil firm, Petrobras, that has implicated politicians across the spectrum, including many close aides and the former president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva.    brazil graphic   With the Olympic spotlight now about to shine on Brazil \u2013 and the Zika virus health crisis far from over \u2013 the country is fraught with problems. Many blame the Workers\u2019 party, which has been in power for 13 years. Rousseff\u2019s approval ratings are now around 10%; close to 60% of voters support impeachment. But many are uncomfortable about how she is being pushed aside. Even many opponents acknowledge the president is one of the least corrupt politicians in Brazil.

Photograph: Evaristo Sa/AFP/Getty Images    On their way to the impeachment debate, senators walked through the long concrete corridors of the parliament building, which are decorated with timelines of epic moments in the history of the chamber: the abolition of slavery in 1888 (the last major country in the world to do so), the creation of the First and Second Republics of 1889-1930 and 1946-1964 (both of which ended in military coups), the return of democracy in 1988 and subsequent steps to improve the rights of workers, women and minorities.  Few taking part would claim the impeachment of the country\u2019s first woman president will be remembered with pride.  Unlike the triumphantly ugly scenes during the lower house vote which invited scorn around the world, most of the senators struck a sombre tone. There was no repeat \u2013 at least in the early sessions \u2013 of the cheering and singing. Instead, many claimed to be sad and said they were only reluctantly approving the suspension of the elected head of state because the economy was in crisis and politics were in turmoil.           \u2018Democracy is our oxygen\u2019: Brazilians speak out about Dilma Rousseff      All the people here are broken hearted. We don\u2019t want this, but it is unavoidable  Marcelo Crivella, senator     \u201cAll the people here are broken-hearted. We don\u2019t want this, but it is unavoidable. Brazil has come to a stop since last year,\u201d claimed Marcelo Crivella, who, as well as being a senator for the Brazilian Republican party, is a gospel singer and a bishop of the evangelical Universal Church of the Kingdom of God. \u201cWe all recognise that [Dilma] has done a good job during her life for the democracy of Brazil.\u201d Despite these respectful words, Crivella \u2013 who was once allied with the Workers\u2019 party government \u2013 said that he would vote for the impeachment of the president because the country is mired in crisis and needs a change of economic policy. Others cited problems of corruption, which have led to the arrests of dozens of politicians across the political spectrum. Rom\u00e1rio, the former striker for the national football team, looked somewhat ill at ease as he declared his vote for impeachment. \u201cI know some will disagree,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I have concluded there is sufficient evidence to admit the process.\u201d He warned, however, that removing the president would not work like a magic wand to lift Brazil out of the mire.     Rom\u00e1rio speaks during the impeachment debate.

While many acknowledge the shortcomings of a president who never appeared comfortable dealing with congress or communicating with the nation, they claim Rousseff is the victim of a \u201ccoup\u201d by the old elite who were unable to accept the result of the last election and deliberately caused instability to grab power .

It has spread like cancer'    \u201cThis is the saddest day in the history of our young democracy,\u201d said Vanessa Grazziotin, a senator from the Communist Party of Brazil. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a valid constitutional process, it is a coup that goes against the opinion of the majority in the 2014 election.\u201d However, the senator said the battle was not over because there was still time over the coming months for the population to realise they were robbed of their rights by the removal of the president. \u201cIf they suspend her today, I\u2019ll go to the streets to demand new elections,\u201d Grazziotin said.   succession graphic   Seventy percent of Brazilians support holding new elections \u2013 an even bigger majority than those who favoured impeachment \u2013 but that has been ruled out by Vice-President Michel Temer, who has now maneuvered to replace his running mate. He has spent the past few weeks canvassing candidates for the centre-right administration he is now expected to form. Advance lists of ministerial posts in the domestic media suggest his first cabinet will be entirely male and overwhelmingly white.     Lawmakers gathered for the special session on 11 May to vote on whether to accept impeachment charges. Photograph: Igo Estrela/Getty Images    It is unlikely to be more popular \u2013 nor any less tainted by corruption. Temer\u2019s ratings are almost as low as those of the outgoing president. According to the most recent opinion survey by Ipsos, he has a disapproval rating of 62%. Fewer than one in seven support him. He too faces an impeachment process, though his support in parliament makes it unlikely he will succumb. And he too has been implicated in two plea bargains in the ongoing Lava Jato investigation into the kick-back and bribery scandal at the state-run oil firm Petrobras. Several members of his proposed cabinet also face charges by prosecutors.   Senators under investigation   Senator after senator repeated the phrase that \u201cnobody is above the law\u201d, yet many are living proof that this has long been untrue in Brazilian politics. As in the lower house many of the politicians who voted for Rousseff to be stripped of her post for fiscal irregularities are themselves accused of far greater crimes. Thirty-three of the 81 senators have either been charged or are under investigation by prosecutors. Some have been found guilty by the supreme court, such as Ivo Cassol, a senator from Rond\u00f4nia, who is fighting a five-year prison sentence for fraud and has been fined for illegal deforestation of the Amazon.     Senators repeated the phrase that 'nobody is above the law', yet many are living proof that this has long been untrue    Among those who spoke was Fernando Collor, who was the last president to be impeached in 1992, and is now implicated in the Lava Jato case. He did not say how he would vote, but spent much of his time at the microphone claiming he was wrongly accused. The implications for Brazil\u2019s democracy are, at best, mixed. Of the four directly elected presidents since the end of the military dictatorship in 1985, two have now been impeached.  The upper echelons of the political class are also deeply tainted by scandal and scheming. Four of the five top figures in the nation are now either suspended or under investigation by prosecutors.      An anti-government demonstrator. The country is now in its deepest recession for decades. Photograph: Felipe Dana/AP    The third in line to the presidency \u2013 house speaker Eduardo Cunha, who orchestrated Rousseff\u2019s downfall \u2013 was suspended from his post by the supreme court for obstructing justice. Prosecutors in the Lava Jato investigation have also accused Cunha of receiving at least $5m in bribes and hiding the money in secret Swiss bank accounts. The fourth in line, Renan Calheiros, the leader of the senate who oversaw today\u2019s impeachment vote, is the subject of 11 criminal investigations, nine of which are related to Lava Jato.  Rousseff spent her last day in power largely out of the public eye. Instead of her usual morning bicycle ride, she went for a walk. Later, she fired all but two members of her cabinet \u2013 the head of the central bank and the sports minister, who has played a central role in organising the Olympics.  Now suspended, the president is unlikely to attend the opening ceremony of the Games as she had previously been expected to do. She could yet come back, but the chances are slim now that Temer controls the budget and more than 10,000 government appointments.  There is little ceremony for the handover of power. The senate will send an emissary with an intima\u00e7\u00e3o or official notification of the result and its consequences to President Rousseff, who will keep her title and residence, but lose her authority and be obliged to leave the Planalto presidential office. The same emissary will then deliver a notifica\u00e7\u00e3o to Michel Temer that he must assume the duties of the head of state. Vicentinho Alves, the senator who will serve the role of emissary, said he will carry out his duties respectfully.

Photograph: Andressa Anholete/AFP/Getty Images    \u201cI see Dilma as an upright and honest person who lacked the ability to govern in this situation,\u201d he said. \u201cIn democracy, as I see it, a leader needs to have the support of the streets, which the president currently lacks. If that is gone, then you need the support of the national congress. But that is also gone. When you lose both those elements, you lose the capacity to govern.\u201d Whether Temer will find it any easier remains to be seen. Given the circumstances under which he took power his administration starts under a cloud. Workers\u2019 party supporters have vowed to mobilise against him. During the senate vote, thousands took to the streets of major cities to protest. Outside the congress building in Bras\u00edlia there were minor confrontations as police fired teargas and pepper spray at demonstrators who threw rocks and fireworks.

The majority of them are against Dilma and democracy,\u201d said Clair Helena Santos, a housing activist from S\u00e3o Paulo, spluttering as she struggled to catch her breath. \u201cWith her out of power, things are going to get worse for social movements. But we will reorganise, continue our struggle and build a strong new left. It might not be called the Workers\u2019 party. But we will have Lula as our candidate in 2018.\u201d On the other side of the esplanade, several hundred pro-impeachment supporters were celebrating with music, dancing and drinking. Many were draped in the yellow and green national flag. \u201cI\u2019m totally delighted. The Workers\u2019 party is finally gone,\u201d said Rafael Curvo, a lawyer from S\u00e3o Paulo. \u201cFor us this is like the start of a new year.\u201d The distance between the party and the street scuffles was little more than a hundred metres, but the two sides were separated by police and a metal barrier that has been dubbed the \u201cimpeachment wall\u201d. It will come down soon. Temer may find it harder to reunify the nation.",
