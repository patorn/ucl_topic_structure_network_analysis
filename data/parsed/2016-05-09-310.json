As the referendum campaign steps up a gear this week following last week\u2019s elections, David Cameron will use a speech in London on Monday to switch the focus from highlighting the economic risks of leaving the EU to winning over voters\u2019 hearts and minds to staying. He will draw on a pageant of historical episodes, from the Roman empire to the fall of the Berlin Wall to argue that Britain\u2019s destiny is inextricably bound up with Europe\u2019s, and voting to remain in the EU on 23 June is the patriotic choice.   Related: Should we stay or should we go? UK businesses on the EU referendum    But he will warn of dire consequences if the UK opts to leave. \u201cCan we be so sure that peace and stability on our continent are assured beyond any shadow of doubt? Is that a risk worth taking? I would never be so rash as to make that assumption.\u201d And Cameron will argue that the UK\u2019s destiny has always been tied up with Europe. \u201cFrom Caesar\u2019s legions to the wars of the Spanish succession, from the Napoleonic wars to the fall of the Berlin Wall. Proud as we are of our global reach and our global connections, Britain has also always been a European power, and we always will be,\u201d he will say. The prime minister will say that even Winston Churchill\u2019s \u201clone stand\u201d against Nazi Germany in 1940, \u201cwhen Britain stood as a bulwark against a new dark age of tyranny and oppression\u201d, was not by choice, and when the war was over, Churchill tried to bring Europe back together. \u201cIn the postwar period he argued passionately for western Europe to come together, to promote free trade, and to build institutions which would endure so that our continent would never again see such bloodshed.\u201d Vote Leave campaigners frequently paint themselves as making a patriotic argument for a buccaneering, free-trading Britain to cut itself loose from the ties of the EU. But Cameron will argue: \u201cWhenever we turn our back on Europe, sooner or later we come to regret it. We have always had to go back in, and always at much higher cost.\u201d The Stronger In campaign also released video testimony from second world war veterans. The positive case for remaining in the EU will also be made by the Scottish National party\u2019s foreign affairs spokesman, Alex Salmond, on Monday, when he will condemn the warnings about the risks of Brexit as, \u201cat best puerile and at worst outlandish scaremongering\u201d. Salmond will also reiterate the argument made by Nicola Sturgeon, who won a renewed mandate in last week\u2019s elections, that the SNP would regard a vote to leave in the referendum as a \u201cmaterial change\u201d in circumstances, which would be sufficient reason to call a new independence referendum. \u201cFirst minister Nicola Sturgeon has been clear that such a material change would bring about a groundswell of anger loud enough to trigger a second Scottish independence referendum. Politicians and parties seeking to deny that right would be swept away by the political winds that would then be blowing,\u201d she will say. While argument in the days ahead is expected to switch to security and Britain\u2019s place in the world, George Osborne stuck firmly to the economic case against Brexit in an interview on ITV\u2019s Peston on Sunday, warning that a vote to leave would cause a \u201csignificant\u201d hit to house prices. The chancellor is due to publish Treasury research about the short-term costs of Brexit in the coming days, and has revealed that one key finding will be that property prices could fall if voters decide to leave the EU on 23 June. The chancellor said: \u201cYou will see the analysis we will do, but I\u2019m pretty clear that there will be a significant hit to the value of people\u2019s homes and to the costs of mortgages. That is one example of the kind of impact, economic impact, that we get from leaving the EU.\u201d Osborne also countered the argument of his colleague, the justice secretary, Michael Gove, who had said earlier on the BBC\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show, that he hoped Britain would leave the European single market. \u201cWe\u2019ve just had the leave campaign admit this morning that Britain would leave the single market \u2013 that is the largest free trade area in the world. That would be catastrophic for people\u2019s jobs and their incomes and their livelihoods. Now, some people might think wrecking the economy is a price worth paying. I absolutely reject that,\u201d the chancellor said. Boris Johnson, one of Vote Leave\u2019s key figureheads, will use his own speech on Monday to make what allies said would be the \u201cliberal, cosmopolitan\u201d case for leaving the EU.",
