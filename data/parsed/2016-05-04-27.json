  "body": "Seven Muslim women who were kicked out of a southern California restaurant are suing the business for discrimination, alleging that they were singled out for wearing headscarves in an area that advocates say has seen an increase in hate crimes.  The women, six of whom were wearing hijabs, say they were ordered to leave Urth Caffe in Laguna Beach on 22 April, ostensibly because they were violating a policy limiting seating to 45 minutes \u2013 even though video they took as they were exiting shows that there were open tables throughout the restaurant.            The business, which is located near the beach in Orange County, was half empty at the time, and other non-Muslim women seated far longer than the Muslim women were not asked to leave, according to the lawsuit filed this week. After the women protested, management at the restaurant, which boasts \u201corganic coffees and fine teas\u201d, allegedly called its security guard and eventually local police to force the women to leave. \u201cI cried the whole way home,\u201d Sara Farsakh, 29, said in an interview. \u201cI was just so shocked and hurt by what happened.\u201d Farsakh posted a Facebook video showing many empty tables, along with footage of the police who showed up to escort them out. \u201cI am completely appalled by the racist and Islamophobic treatment some friends and I were subjected to by staff at Urth Caffe in Laguna Beach last night,\u201d she wrote on Facebook after the incident. \u201cWhat began as a night out with some friends ended as a painful and embarrassing reminder of what it is like to be visibly Muslim \u2013 even in liberal California. By visibly Muslim, I mean women who wear the hijab, or headscarf.\u201d The complaint, which seeks unspecified damages, states, \u201cUrth Caffe\u2019s removal of Plaintiffs was motivated not by Plaintiffs\u2019 violation of any company policy, but by its desire to cleanse the restaurant of visibly Muslim patrons who have been targets of recent neighborhood hate.\u201d The restaurant has been the site of numerous hate crimes against Muslims this year, according to the complaint. In March and April, \u201clocals unnerved by the increasing presence of Muslims in their community\u201d threw eggs at Muslim customers at Urth Caffe, slashed their tires and yelled \u201cracial taunts and epithets\u201d, the suit says. \u201cThat\u2019s really the key to why this is discrimination,\u201d said Mohammad Tajsar, attorney for the women, who range from 25 to 29 years old. \u201cThere\u2019s a clear motivation on the part of the management to appease the discriminators and the racists who had been basically annoyed and frustrated at the increasing presence of people who seemed like they were Muslim.\u201d Laguna Beach is 90% white, according to Census data.  Even if the restaurant did not directly address the women\u2019s religion, it was a blatant case of prejudice, said Tajsar. \u201cDiscrimination in 2016 can be clear even if there isn\u2019t an outward religious slur.\u201d The restaurant has not apologized for the incident and instead defended its actions in a short Facebook post: \u201cUrth Caffe categorically denies any and all claims of racial or religious discrimination against Sara Farsakh. While a full investigation is still ongoing, it appears that Ms Farsakh and her friends violated company policies and that the staff at Urth Caffe in Laguna properly and justifiably applied company procedures.\u201d The restaurant\u2019s \u201cbusy time seating limit\u201d policy, a copy of which Farsakh posted on Facebook, says: \u201cIf tables are available, you are certainly welcome to enjoy Urth for as long as you desire.\u201d In its statement, Urth said it doesn\u2019t condone discrimination and \u201csincerely hopes that its customers will withhold judgment until all of the evidence in this case comes to light\u201d. The restaurant, a local chain with locations throughout southern California, did not respond to requests for comment on Wednesday. Farsakh, a student, said she was compelled to file a lawsuit in part because of the increasing discrimination that Muslims have faced in the wake of racist rhetoric in American politics. Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP nominee for president, called for a ban on Muslims entering the US in December. \u201cWith the current political climate, this type of stuff is increasing,\u201d she said. \u201cWe felt so embarrassed and shocked. You can\u2019t believe it when it\u2019s happening to you.\u201d  Farsakh, the one woman in the group who was not wearing a headscarf, said she stopped wearing a hijab in part because of her fears about discrimination.  \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have to be concerned about my mother, my mother-in-law, my friends and future daughters,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable for anybody to have to go through this based off of the way that they look.\u201d",
