Ranieri\u2019s award has reportedly been approved by the Italian president, Sergio Mattarella, meaning the Leicester City manager will receive the third-highest honour in Italy\u2019s six-tier grading system. The award comes as recognition for Ranieri\u2019s achievement in leading Leicester to the Premier League title, as well as for a lengthy career that has seen him coach Napoli, Chelsea, Juventus, Roma and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid over the last 30 years. The World Cup-winning striker Silvio Piola, who won the tournament with Italy in 1938, is among the other sporting figures to have received the honour.",
