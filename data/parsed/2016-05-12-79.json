  "body": "Six years ago, the American guitarist, rapper and singer-songwriter Joe Driscoll first teamed up with Sekou Kouyate, one of the finest kora players in west Africa, at a music festival in France. They are still together, after playing hundreds of shows around the world, and creating a confident, engaging fusion of their very different styles. Their second album is a classy, easygoing affair, with Kouyate\u2019s exquisite kora work and fine, soulful vocals in the Susu language matched against an often laidback, funky backing and melodic English folk-pop balladry and rap from Driscoll. Songs such as Just Live and Rising Tide are potential African-pop crossover hits, helped by bass, drums and percussion, with lyrics stressing Driscoll\u2019s cheerfully inclusive philosophy that \u201cwe\u2019re all one tribe\u201d. They end with a reminder of why Kouyate has been called \u201cthe Hendrix of the kora\u201d, with a furious live reworking of Stevie Wonder\u2019s Master Blaster.
