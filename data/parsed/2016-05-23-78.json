  "body": "Adele \u2013 rumour has it! \u2013 is the proud owner of a new \u00a390m deal with Sony \u2013 which, if true, would make it the most lucrative record contract for both a British artist and a female pop star ever. But, while Adele could soon be rolling in the deep pockets, how well have other mega-money records deals paid off? REM $80m (\u00a355m) Warner Bros, 1996  Why they paid it: In August, 1996, REM were the biggest rock band on the planet, riding a decade of indie love on IRS, plus the commercial and critical smashes of Automatic for the People, Out of Time, Monster and Green. They renewed their deal with Warner with a $10m signing bonus, a $20m advance, 24% royalties and a $10m advance for each of their next six albums. REM repaid the favour the following month with the decisively hit-free New Adventures in Hi-Fi. Was it worth it? REM never reached the commercial highs of the early 90s again; New Adventures was their last platinum album in the US. After the last in their six-album deal \u2013 2011\u2019s Collapse Into Now \u2013 they collapsed into retirement.   What a waste of money! (WAWOM!) rating: 8/10  Mariah Carey $80m Virgin/EMI, 2001  Why they paid it: From her debut in 1990, Carey spent the decade tearing up the charts \u2013 1993\u2019s Music Box sold 32m copies, 1995\u2019s Daydream, 25m. By the time her deal with Sony\u2019s Columbia Records was done, she was a no-brainer, to pick up. Was it worth it? Ixnay! After Glitter, the first album of the deal was released on \u2013 oh, Mariah \u2013 September 11 2001, to a critical mauling and (relatively) dreadful sales. EMI decided to cut their losses and paid Carey $28m to go away rather than commit to the cost of more albums. A shame for them, then, that 2005\u2019s The Emancipation of Mimi sold over 12 million copies worldwide (Adele\u2019s 25 has sold 19m). WAWOM! rating: 10/10  Robbie Williams    \u00a380m EMI, 2002  Why they paid it: Nine months after paying Carey to shut the door on her way out, EMI made Robbie \u201crich beyond his wildest dreams\u201d with this six-album deal. Williams had sold 20m albums at this point, and the deal gave EMI a cut of merchandise, touring and publishing rights (a precursor to similar mega-money deals signed by Madonna and Jay Z with Live Nation). Given the coming financial armageddon in the record industry, a canny move. Was it worth it? Robbie\u2019s first album of the deal, Escapology, sold over quarter of a million copies in a week and in 2003, he would play to 375,000 at Knebworth. Robbie\u2019s next three albums would go multi-platinum, too \u2013 but, in 2007, EMI was bought in a leveraged deal by venture capitalists Terra Firma, just as the music industry collapsed. Robbie\u2019s contract was one of the assets transferred to Universal when it bought the stricken EMI. Earlier this month he signed a new worldwide deal with Sony. WAWOM! rating: 4/10  Whitney Houston $100m Arista/Sony, 2001  Why they paid it: Whitney was already Arista\u2019s biggest artist (her Bodyguard soundtrack sold 42m copies) \u2013 when she came to renew her contract, Arista\u2019s new head LA Reid was in the midst of a golden run with albums from Usher (8701), Pink (Missundaztood) and Outkast (Stankonia). Her last album, 1998\u2019s My Love Is Your Love had sold 10m copies. Another multi-album deal seemed like obviously good business. Was it worth it? No. The new deal coincided with Houston\u2019s spiralling personal issues. She managed two studio albums \u2013 2002\u2019s Just Whitney and 2009\u2019s I Look To You \u2013 and one Christmas collection, before her death in 2012. WAWOM! rating: 9/10",
