  "body": "Riot squads have been called into volatile jails across England and Wales at a rate of 30 to 40 times a month to deal with serious disorder, according to evidence submitted to MPs by prison officers. The Prison Officers Association told the MPs that intervention teams\u2019 from the prison service\u2019s National Tactical Response Group had been called to jails with unprecedented frequency between March and November last year. They had dealt with serious disorder including rooftop protests, hostage-taking and incidents of \u201cconcerted indiscipline\u201d.  In a report on the rising tide of violence, self-harm and suicide in prisons, the Commons justice select committee says that unrest and violence in prisons are so serious that action cannot wait for justice secretary Michael Gove\u2019s ambitious prison reform programme. Bob Neill, the Conservative justice committee chairman, said the justice ministry had hoped prison safety would stabilise but in reality it has deteriorated further and continues to do so, with 100 suicides in the past year and a 20% rise in assaults in the second half of 2015 among the 85,000-strong prison population. There were also nearly 2,000 fires in prisons in 2015 \u2013 a rise of 57% on 2014.

But this cannot wait. It is imperative that further attention is paid to bring prisons back under firmer control, reversing recent trends of escalating violence, self-harm and disorder. Without such action the implementation of these wider reforms will be undermined.\u201d The MPs also crucially warn that an influx of legal highs, a more challenging mix of prisoners, and staff shortages, \u201cmay not fully explain\u201d the rapid deterioration inside jails. Plans for radical prison reform will form a major plank of the Queen\u2019s speech on Wednesday but it is unlikely to be fast-tracked through parliament. Gove has told the justice select committee that a white paper will be published first but that no precise timetable has yet been set. In a speech to prison governors on Thursday, Gove acknowledged that the penal reform programme will take several years to implement and that rapid action was needed now to improve prison safety. \u201cWe need to do much more. I will be giving further details in the weeks ahead about other urgent steps we are taking to improve safety across the estate,\u201d he said. Gove also announced the appointment of a new director of prison security, Claudia Sturt, that governors in four prisons will be allowed maximum autonomy under current legislation from July, and urged governors to make greater use of the temporary licence release scheme. The MPs say that the prisons minister, Andrew Selous, had blamed legal highs, the mix of prisoners and a high prison population for the deteriorating safety situation. But their inquiry into prison safety concludes that these factors were all in place 12 months ago and so do \u201cnot fully explain\u201d the rapid decline.   Related: Wormwood Scrubs prison staff walk out over safety concerns    The committee agreed there was a \u201cserious and deep-rooted issue of staff retention\u201d within the prison service and the recruitment of an extra 2,250 officers had only resulted in a net gain of 440 officers in 2015. They say that an action plan to improve prison safety is urgently needed that addresses the underlying factors behind the rise in violence and suicides, tackles staff retention and the problem corruption amongst some prison staff. The MPs want to see quarterly updates with details on emergency responses and serious incidents published for the first time. Selous, responding to the report, demonstrated the very serious challenges facing the prison service and showed how badly prison reform was needed. \u201cWe must do better at reducing violence and self-inflicted deaths, and preventing drugs entering prison. We must do more to help prisoners with mental health problems. We have to ensure prisoners can be rehabilitated so they are no longer a danger to others,\u201d said Selous. \u201cWe have secured \u00a31.3bn to modernise the prison estate and we have responded to staffing pressures with a national net increase of 530 officers, since January last year. These reforms will ensure prisons are places of decency and improve public safety by reducing reoffending.\u201d",
