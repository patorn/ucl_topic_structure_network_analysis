  "body": "The Fault In Our Stars is a novel written by John Green, a renowned author of Young Adult fiction. The story gives an account of Hazel, who can hardly remember life without cancer and has almost given up hope on her life. She then meets Augustus Waters, a cancer survivor, who reads her favourite books for her and hangs out with her and this helps her to gather strength. The two of them deal with cancer and love.  The story is written in a breathtaking way which makes us become a part of the characters and feel the same emotions. Hazel and Augustus appeal to readers through their sense of humour and their courage. But behind this courage, both of them hide their pain to protect their families. John Green, through Hazel and Augustus, brings both: tears and laughter.          The Fault in Our Stars is a beautiful novel and I would recommend it to anyone who believes in love and has the courage to fight for it. Through this book I realised that cancer not just touches victims, but it also touches all those who love.
