  "body": "Making a change can be challenging at all stages of our lives, whether it\u2019s taking your business in a new, more experimental direction, moving house, or choosing a new car. How do you know if it\u2019s the right move? Or the right time?  No one knows this better than shoe designer and architect Julian Hakes. He studied architecture at Cambridge, moved on to \u201cworking in engineering and specialising in bridges,\u201d he says, and then started designing shoes much later in his career. He is perhaps best known for the Mojito, which was the first 3D printed shoe to walk the runway. We talk to him about taking the right risks at the right time. You can evolve a traditional design Julian\u2019s story is definitely one of twists and turns, and proves that sometimes a business can develop in a direction you never anticipated, particularly when you take advantage of new technology: \u201cWe designed one shoe \u2013 the Mojito \u2013 and it became very popular,\u201d he says. \u201cOff the back we launched a footwear brand and our shoes are now sold all over the world.\u201d Don\u2019t stick with one discipline  You might think that architecture and shoes don\u2019t mix, but they\u2019re similar in terms of the route from conception to completion: \u201cIt\u2019s to do with the architectural thinking process. I\u2019m interested in the performance of materials that result in an aesthetic. I didn\u2019t even know I was designing a shoe but soon realised we were onto something special.\u201d  By experimenting with his approach, Julian found an entirely new business to expand into that came with its own advantages. \u201cArchitectural projects have a long lead-time, fashion is much shorter. And I need that immediacy as well as the long-term things. For me, fashion and footwear is slightly shorter-term version of architecture,\u201d he adds. Setbacks can turn into success One of the most interesting parts of Julian\u2019s journey is the fact that it was a combination of potentially damaging economic circumstances that led to the creation of the shoe. \u201cDuring the recession, we had more creative freedom and it wasn\u2019t as frenetic. There was time to think rather than constantly rushing to deliver,\u201d he says.  \u201cSo we thought, let\u2019s do something for us rather than someone else. Something that wasn\u2019t a one-off. Now, our main business is fashion footwear, with a little bit of architecture going on. We\u2019ve got offices in Hong Kong, Paris and New York.\u201d Be open to change  When it came to choosing a company car, Julian did his research. He knew he wanted a sustainable economical form of transport, but test drove a number of electric cars to find the one for him: \u201cI looked for benefits such as driving style and response. And the Kia Soul was the best \u2013 they are really quite sporty; there\u2019s no delay at all in the acceleration, it\u2019s immediate. For me it\u2019s like a mini SUV and it\u2019s really nippy.\u201d  Get the facts When considering swapping from petrol to an electric car, many people are concerned about how far you can get on a charge. There is a need to raise the public\u2019s awareness of the advantages and allay such fears. \u201cRange is not an issue,\u201d says Julian. \u201c You can get 100 miles out of a charge in summer. In winter, it\u2019ll be 80 miles minimum.\u201d Regenerative braking \u2013 where going downhill generates more charge from the spinning wheels \u2013 adds even more range.  The Kia Soul is not difficult or time consuming to charge either. \u201cWhat I really like about it is that it is designed to charge really quickly. In the time it takes to walk inside and grab a coffee, it\u2019s charged.  \u201cIt\u2019s an efficient technology \u2013 and it changes everything,\u201d he concludes. Save money where possible While there are lots of incentives to drive a low-emission car, there are still only a handful of businesses who have embraced the technologies in the day-to-day running of their operations. \u201cFrom a business point of view, zero emissions make sense. From a social responsibility point of view, zero-emissions make sense too,\u201d he says.  It also saves the business money: \u201cThe Kia Soul is cheaper to run than we were spending in fuel per month, so it\u2019s a no brainer,\u201d he says. \u201cNo congestion charge in London, no parking costs in Westminster, and no charge to charge.\u201d Find out more, including the full specifications and charging locations on the KIA website.
