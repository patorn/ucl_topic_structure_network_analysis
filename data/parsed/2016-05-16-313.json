To commit to the metaphor, one of the stitches in Turnbull\u2019s side is the Liberal candidate for Fremantle, Sherry Sufi, who has been revealed to have misrepresented his work history on his application for preselection. It has also emerged that Sufi is against an apology to the stolen generations and also same-sex marriage (on the grounds that it could lead to polygamy). \u201cGreat!\u201d said Shorten, in a quote on AAP. \u201cAnother knuckle-dragger from the far right who\u2019s going to be one of Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s team.\u201d All things considered, it was perhaps no surprise that Sufi did not show at a press conference with Turnbull in Perth this morning. Asked about the candidate\u2019s absence, Turnbull said he was in Perth to talk about a $282m contract with Austal to build 19 Pacific Patrol Boats \u2013 a national announcement. \u201cI\u2019m the prime minister and I hope he\u2019s out there engaging with the people of Fremantle and doing good door-knocking,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cVery character-building. I\u2019ve done it myself.\u201d Turnbull told reporters he did not share Sufi\u2019s views on same-sex marriage or the stolen generations.    Keeping ahead of the PM-just @murpharoo @GuardianAus #politicslive pic.twitter.com/Fa3JoCIOln\u2014 Mikearoo (@mpbowers) May 16, 2016    Turnbull was clearly irked by questions that strayed from his jobs-and-growth message, wrote Katharine Murphy in our politics live blog. \u201cElection campaigns are endurance tests for political leaders, largely centred around the key test of concealing your irritation,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIf you can\u2019t conceal your irritation that never ends well. Impatience tends to escalate.\u201d Another far-from-elementary takeaway from the West Australian story: Sufi is a member of the Sherlock Holmes Society of WA. Labor not-so-positive about its position on penalty rates Meanwhile, Labor has found itself in a bit of a muddle over its stance on penalty rates. Before the campaign kicked off, Shorten said on Melbourne\u2019s 3AW that he would respect the findings of the Fair Work Commission on penalty rates, but industry spokesman Kim Carr said on Radio National today that the party\u2019s defence of them was \u201cabsolute\u201d.  Given that the commission may decide to reduce penalty rates or scrap them altogether, these positions might appear to be contradictory. The waters were further muddied by the opposition\u2019s finance spokesman, Tony Burke, who claimed Turnbull\u2019s government had told the Commission to cut penalty rates \u2013 which is not the case.    Bill Shorten fired up talking about defending penalty rates. \"This is my working life.\" @murpharoo #ausvotes pic.twitter.com/9QO27BhRSe\u2014 Calla Wahlquist (@callapilla) May 16, 2016    Shorten was forced to clarify while on a tour of a metal stamping and rolling plant in Geelong, stating that Labor would abide by the Commission\u2019s decision but, if elected, would aim to defend the rates as \u201conly as a government\u201d can. He was confident this would be sufficient protection, but neither he nor the shadow employment minister, Brendan O\u2019Connor, would go so far as to say they\u2019d legislate to prevent a cut.  The Greens were quick to capitalise on this confusion, with Richard Di Natale vowing to protect penalty rates in law, regardless of the Fair Work Commission\u2019s finding. \u201cYou can\u2019t on one hand say that you\u2019re strongly deeply committed to penalty rates and then on the other hand say, \u2018We\u2019re not going to do anything to legislate for those conditions\u2019. You simply can\u2019t do that.\u201d Murphy wrote in the blog that it was \u201csharp, aggressive, uncompromising\u201d campaigning \u2013 \u201cBut whether it yields what the Greens need this campaign? Only time will tell.\u201d The election will be won on memes    I think 'living within our memes' is the theme of this election #ausvotes #auspol\u2014 Ashley (@ashleypratt) May 9, 2016    To a certain extent, any speculation this far out from 2 July is redundant, with the latest iSentia analysis showing that most people \u2013 particularly those who are as yet undecided \u2013 haven\u2019t started to tune into the campaign yet. A slow start is to be expected in a campaign of this length, but it will ramp up fast. Pre-polls open in week five and this year as many as 25% of voters are predicted to go to the polls before 2 July. Until then, #auspol memes are about as robust a form of political commentary as any \u2013 or so one of Australia\u2019s largest unions seems to have decided.    51 days until the election!Reminder: only one party has a leader who is named in the Panama Papers. #whatup pic.twitter.com/9ck6DcYRFP\u2014 The AMWU (@theamwu) May 11, 2016    The AMWU is embracing the internet\u2019s latest impenetrable in-jokes and a lot of retro clip-art in its campaigning against the government on Twitter, beating BuzzFeed at its own game.

The AMWU later acknowledged the announcement with the comment, \u201cCan\u2019t build a better future without a strong manufacturing sector\u201d \u2013 a somewhat po-faced remark in amongst the meme madness.

The Daily Telegraph \u201crevealed\u201d today that Turnbull is choosing his own clothes this election campaign, making him reportedly the first prime minister in almost a decade not to have image consultants.    who's a big boy. pic.twitter.com/7Hb8rKqmtO\u2014 brad esposito (@braddybb) May 16, 2016    Liberal party strategists are comfortable that the prime minister has both the \u201cwide-ranging designer wardrobe\u201d and \u201cfashion sense\u201d to be able to dress himself without assistance. To quote Justin Timberlake\u2019s Suit & Tie and \u2013 presumably \u2013 Malcolm Turnbull to his fellow party leaders: \u201cLet me show you a few things.\u201d         \u201cGo on and show \u2018em who you call \u2018Daddy\u2019.\u201d      Good afternoon @billshortenmp and @RichardDiNatale, just wanted to know if you dress yourselves?
