  "body": "If you can bear another blow-by-blow account of English football\u2019s finest hour, this is as good a time as any, and nobody could begrudge Bobby Moore his documentary closeup. In film-making terms, it\u2019s very much route one: archive clips, talking heads, nothing fancy. And being a defender, Moore\u2019s heroics are inherently less cinematic than, say, a Pel\u00e9 or Cristiano Ronaldo. But if there\u2019s any evidence Moore was ever less than a cool-headed leader on the pitch and an East End gent off it, this adulatory doc doesn\u2019t find it. It does, at least, acknowledge his later problems: insomnia, depression, bankruptcy, cancer and, perhaps most painful of all, cruel rejection by the football establishment, which saw him reduced to managing non-league clubs and commentating on local radio.",
