  "body": "How many units of alcohol do you drink each week? It\u2019s a question most people stumble over.  It\u2019s not easy to monitor alcohol intake. So often a doctor asks and the patient tries to quickly calculate the recommended weekly units, before settling on a slightly lower figure. It\u2019s an issue too for those who want to figure out whether they have reached drink-driving limits. But tech companies claim to have a solution to this problem. The San Francisco-based BACtrack, for example, makes breathalysers for law enforcement agencies. But recently it won a $200,000 (\u00a3136,000) government prize for an alcohol-monitoring device of a different kind: one that users can apply to their bodies.  Skyn, BACtrack\u2019s winning entry, looks like the sort of wristband runners wear to measure their speed and heartbeat \u2013 but it measures the body\u2019s alcohol content. Three quarters of an hour after drinking, the Skyn\u2019s wearer can see their blood alcohol content (BAC) on the wristband.      BACtrack Skyn device with app Photograph: BACtrack    The prototype device, which will be available at the end of the year and retail for $99 (\u00a368), works by tracking ethanol molecules escaping through the skin. It\u2019s intended for \u201cserious use cases \u2013 people with a serious alcohol issue who could benefit from continuous, non-invasive monitoring,\u201d says Keith Nothacker, BACtrack\u2019s president and CEO.  \u201cHaving a low-cost, small, discreet, wearable can dramatically simplify treatment for millions of people ... Imagine going out for drinks and your smart watch displaying your estimated BAC. No pausing to take a breath test \u2013 the result is just there, continuously.\u201d The competition won by Skyn was organised by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the US. That a government agency is looking to incentivise alcohol-measuring gadgets suggests that the US government is trying to find new ways of preventing alcohol-related diseases, which cause about 88,000 deaths each year in the country.  It is also a nod to the fast-growing market for alcohol-measuring apps and gadgets. Among the many iPhone apps now available is IntelliDrink ($2.99/\u00a32.29). Users enter the number of drinks they are consuming and the app calculates their BAC based on their age, weight, height, gender, drinking frequency and stomach contents. It can also be set to alert a friend when the user has reached a certain alcohol level.  Another iPhone app, R-U-Buzzed?, measures the user\u2019s alcohol level using height and weight in addition to the amount of alcohol consumed, and flashes \u201cYou\u2019re buzzed\u201d when they reach the driving under the influence (DUI) level.  In Sweden, Alcosystems, a company working in collaboration with a teaching hospital has developed a wireless, fuel-cell powered breathalyser connected to an app, which recovering alcoholics are using several times a day to monitor their progress. The device is available for consumers and companies too. However, this is a relatively expensive option \u2013 while the app is \u00a31.49, the breathalyser is \u20ac229 (\u00a3175).     Demonstration of Alcosystems iBAC breathalyser for consumers   The apps and gadgets form a useful new resource, says professor Eileen Kaner, chair of public health and primary care research at Newcastle University: \u201cMany people drink heavily but don\u2019t want to talk to their doctor about it. And a lot of patients worry about taking up too much of their doctor\u2019s time trying to figure out how much they drink. Gadgets are useful in such cases.\u201d  Indeed, many people consciously or unconsciously under-report their drinking in conversations with their doctor, and often have no way of backing up their self-reported drinking habits. \u201cA product like BACtrack Skyn helps people become more aware of their alcohol consumption habits,\u201d says Nothacker.  While apps and gadgets are no substitute for doctors and nurses, Kaner says they can help people find out more about their behaviour,. \u201cA very small part of the population are alcoholics, but a much larger part are heavy drinkers. Tech solutions can help them address potential health problems before it\u2019s too late.\u201d Some are more sceptical. \u201cThere\u2019s no convincing evidence that tech gadgets are better than older techniques in changing behaviour,\u201d says Professor Matt Field of the UK Centre for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies (UKCTAS) at the University of Liverpool. Besides, he adds, in most countries DIU levels are so low that it\u2019s safer not to drink at all.",
