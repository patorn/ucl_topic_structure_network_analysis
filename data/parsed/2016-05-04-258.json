  "body": "From a distance, an ocean away, it looks a cool breeze, doesn\u2019t it? In truth, the line from European soccer star to NFL kicker is about as linear as a Christopher Nolan plot, a path lost in translation. There? The one that gets the girl. Here? The one that gets the water. There? Pecs on billboards. Here? Nipple envy. \u201cThere aren\u2019t many underwear models that are a kicker,\u201d Nate Kaeding says with a laugh. \u201cI can promise you that.\u201d And yet that hasn\u2019t stopped the underwear models from being curious. Leicester City defender Christian Fuchs, an Austrian national who lives in New York City when he\u2019s not winning the Premier League, drew some clicks \u2013 and raised eyebrows \u2013 recently when he declared an interest in kicking for an NFL team once his soccer days have passed.   Related: Leicester City\u2019s place in an unequal world | Letters    Which raises the question: as the sporting world gets smaller by the download and the global village homogenizes, during an age in which the Kansas City Chiefs have a supporters club in Leighton Buzzard, and Leicester City claims fans in North Carolina, why haven\u2019t more European football players made the transition to the NFL as a career postscript? \u201cIt\u2019s not the most glamorous position in the world, and I think honestly that might make for a little part of it,\u201d offers Kaeding, one of the top 10 most accurate field-goal kickers in NFL history (86.2% conversion rate with San Diego and Miami from 2004-12, No6 all time). \u201cEspecially these English soccer players, they\u2019re the Michael Jordans of [European sports]. They\u2019re the Peyton Manning or LaDainian Tomlinson of Europe. You want to be a kicker in the NFL, you\u2019re kind of at the bottom of the glamour totem pole.\u201d To put it another way, most American franchises \u2013 and American teammates and fans \u2013 don\u2019t give a Fuchs. Unless you screw up. \u201cI would think that the closest thing that relates to soccer players would be the penalty-kick shootout,\u201d says Tony Meola, the US soccer Hall of Fame goalkeeper who\u2019s managed to walk in both worlds. \u201cThe fifth penalty kick where if you miss it, you lose. I would think that\u2019s probably the single closest thing.\u201d   Related: How one young coach is modernizing the NFL's most meaningless weekend    There? Goat. Here? Goat. \u201cOne, it\u2019s probably not as easy as it looks,\u201d says Meola, the coach of the NASL\u2019s Jacksonville Armada, who once famously \u2013 or infamously, depending on whom you ask \u2013 camped with the New York Jets in the summer of 1994. \u201cBut it\u2019s not impossible. \u201cThe other thing is being ready to have your heart racing when you figure out (there\u2019s) a 350lb guy who can run a 5.0 40-yard dash, and he\u2019s coming at you full-steam. Trust me, there\u2019s a lot to think about. It\u2019s not just kicking a football.\u201d A football fan growing up in Kearny, New Jersey, Meola, fresh off the glow of 1994 World Cup fever, was offered a lifeline by Jets coach Pete Carroll, every bit the free thinker then as now. The NFL had moved kickoffs from the 35-yard line to the 30; Meola was signed, in principle, to try to take advantage of the distance \u2013 while accurate veteran Nick Lowery\u2019s leg strength was fading \u2013 only one of his five kick-off attempts reached the end zone. He wound up getting cut after the third pre-season game.     Tony Meola camped with the Jets in the summer of 1994. Photograph: Bob Thomas/Getty Images    \u201cAnd I fulfilled a dream, short-lived as it was,\u201d Meola says. \u201cI will tell you, from my standpoint, soccer is so much more exciting than kicking a football. Literally, we met at 8.30 in the morning with the team, met at 8.45 with the special teams [coach] and the kickers didn\u2019t kick until 2.30 in the afternoon. So I became a guy that was in the weight room [watching] every talk show there was. At the time, there was Sally Jessy Raphael and Geraldo Rivera. Jerry Springer was becoming a big deal at the time. And there was nothing to do. And then you got five kicks at the end of practice. And if you don\u2019t make one, you get screamed at.\u201d A pause. A chuckle. \u201cIt may have changed [since 1994],\u201d he says. On the plus side, Meola says Carroll let him run with the wide receivers and work with the \u201chands\u201d team for onside kick returns. But otherwise, \u201cyou can expect to live what you\u2019d call the athletic life of isolation,\u2019\u201d he notes. \u201cYou\u2019re isolated and waiting for your [chance].\u201d There? Action. Here? Atrophy. \u201cThe other thing is, I grew up with football,\u201d Meola says. \u201cI knew from the time I was 10 years old that I always wanted to try kicking. I don\u2019t know how many guys [overseas] grow up watching the NFL. It\u2019s probably less [embedded] in their culture to want to do it.\u201d And the cultural hurdle is a biggie, even if everyone on the field is ostensibly speaking the same tongue. When former Chelsea and Milwall striker Derek Smethurst was signed by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1977, he turned up to find that Abe Gibron \u2013 the Joy-to-the-World-singing, pot-bellied head coach of the Chicago Bears from 1972-74 \u2013 was in charge of putting him through his special teams paces. \u201cIt\u2019s like taking a Great White Shark and putting it into the Disney World tank,\u201d chuckles Smethurst who, like Meola, didn\u2019t stick. \u201cIt\u2019s strange to them. It\u2019s very strange to them. The environment\u2019s strange. I don\u2019t know. The money can\u2019t be the problem. The opportunities can\u2019t be the problem, because they\u2019ll give you opportunities to walk in and do it.\u201d Smethurst was 29 when he hooked on with the then-fledgling Bucs, having already found his feet Stateside with the NASL\u2019s Tampa Bay Rowdies. The South African native wanted a change of pace, and the Creamsicle Bucs, after a disastrous 0-14 mark in their 1976 debut, needed all the positive press they could muster. \u201cEverybody thought it was a joke until they signed me to four one-year contracts,\u201d says Smethurst, who netted 57 goals in 71 outdoor contests for the Rowdies from 1975-78. \u201cIt took me about a week to get used to it. The NFL football is harder, tougher on the outside, and the pressure in it is what we used to call a \u2018brick\u2019 in soccer, like hitting a brick. When you put the extra ounce of air in it, you might as well make it a brick. The NFL football feels like that in the beginning.\u201d There? It\u2019s about the now. Here? It\u2019s the zen. \u201cIf you\u2019re technically minded, it\u2019s easy,\u201d says Smethurst, now a soccer coach and tutor in Valrico, Florida, just outside Tampa. \u201cThe only thing is you\u2019ve got have, like a putt in golf, you\u2019ve got to have ice in your veins when you\u2019re kicking. And regarding everything else, it\u2019s all technique. Basically, it comes down to a penalty kick. Ice in your veins. If you have that, you\u2019re going to be fine.\u201d \u201cSome guys have a knack for it,\u201d adds NFL placekicker Billy Cundiff, most recently of the Buffalo Bills and a veteran of five different clubs. \u201cRarely [in soccer] are two shots ever the same in a game. You\u2019re trying to get a soccer guy to take a golfer\u2019s mentality. If you watch the Premier League, those two really don\u2019t equate.\u201d Which isn\u2019t to stay the stars can\u2019t align \u2013 it\u2019s just rare. Also, it\u2019s been a while. The most noteworthy European professional to succeed in the NFL ranks was, like Fuchs, an Austrian \u2013 Toni Fritsch, who led the NFL in field-goal tries (35) and makes (22) in 1975 with the Dallas Cowboys and was selected to the Pro Bowl with Houston in 1979. \u201cI always said that the difference between kicking a football and a soccer ball \u2026 if you miskick a soccer ball, you can miskick it 60 yards.\u201d Meola muses. \u201cA football, it doesn\u2019t go where you want it to go. The sweet spot is so small. It\u2019s either kicked well or not kicked well \u2013 there really is no middle ground.\u201d There? Bend it like Beckham. Here? Slice your way out of a job. When Meola got to Jets camp, he remembers the coaches drawing a little circle on the ball where they wanted kickers to aim. \u201c(And it\u2019s) the size of a 50\u00a2 piece,\u201d Meola says. \u201cA soccer ball has a big circumference. You can hit it one side or the other side and it still goes 60 yards. That\u2019s not the case with a football.\u201d There? Variety. Unpredictability. Here? Consistency. Monotony. \u201cIt\u2019s not how good your best kick is,\u201d Kaeding says. \u201cIt\u2019s how good your worst kick is.\u201d \u201cThe technique is different, No1,\u201d Cundiff says. \u201cAnd No2, guys in the States have just been practicing for so long. \u201cWhen I was in college, I had just started to specialize with it by the time I was a senior. That\u2019s almost unheard of now. Guys are specializing in high school. Some kids now in the NFL, when they get in the league, they\u2019ve been specializing for 10 years \u2026 you\u2019re going to tell me a Premier League guy is going [to come over] and work on his technique and be ready? He\u2019s got nothing to fall back on.\u201d Still, Meola thinks a guy such as Fuchs could make the switch, given enough practice and a long rope. He says he\u2019s curious what PSG\u2019s David Luiz, Chelsea\u2019s John Terry and Arsenal keeper Petr Cech would look like on an NFL stage. And Smethurst has wondered the same about Fuchs\u2019 teammate, forward Jamie Vardy. \u201cWatching Vardy, the man has a pure, short delivery,\u201d the coach says. \u201cEven when he\u2019s got a wild backswing, he comes down through the ball very short. And you better be aware to catch it because it just comes at you very quick. \u201cThey could do it, yeah, there\u2019s no problem. Technically, they could do it. They have to take their technique and apply it now to a different system \u2026 the wind will push it a little bit, but not a lot. If I start turning a lot is when you hook your [attempt]. Three inches of knee hook will take you 12 [inches] to the left or right, you know what I mean? And welcome to my golf swing again.\u201d There? A star. Here? A specialist. The average Premier Leaguer\u2019s wage is reportedly \u00a32.29m annually, or $3.25m. According to OverTheCap.com, the average NFL kicker contract is worth $1.7m a year, and much of that money isn\u2019t guaranteed. And only five NFL kickers\u2019 salaries average out to more than $3.25m \u2014 the Ravens\u2019 Justin Tucker tops the charts, at $4.57m \u2014 while 19 average out to $650,000 or less. \u201cThe Premier League is bigger than the NFL,\u201d Cundiff says. \u201cThey\u2019re global stars. The NFL is big in the US, don\u2019t get me wrong, it\u2019s huge \u2026 these [soccer] teams have worldwide access. It sounds cool on paper, but if you\u2019re playing well and even if you\u2019re playing for a Spanish team, you\u2019re with Barca, you\u2019re going to now play for the Jets? No offense to the Jets, but a lot of these guys, I think they grow up wanting to play soccer where a lot of [American] guys who go into the NFL grow up wanting to play [American] football.\u201d The average length of a kicker or punter\u2019s career is reportedly 4.87 years, according to the NFL Players Association, better than the overall league average of 3.3 seasons. But like Premier League managers, opportunities to remain in one town for long stretches \u2013 such as Kaeding had with the Chargers \u2013 tend to be rare. Cundiff\u2019s experiences have fallen more in line with nomadic norm: the Iowa native was with Dallas for four seasons (2002-\u201905), hooked on with New Orleans (2006), then returned to an NFL roster after a three-year absence to kick for Cleveland (2009), Baltimore (2009-11), Washington (2012), Cleveland once more (2013-14) and Buffalo (2015). He\u2019s currently a free agent again at 36, pursuing postgraduate studies and business opportunities with one eye while scanning the waiver wire with the other. \u201cYou have a great game, that (gives) you at least two or three more weeks,\u201d Kaeding says. \u201cIf you have three bad weeks in a row, the management and coaching staff is going to look toward [whatever options] are out there. Yeah, it\u2019s a very fungible position.\u201d There? Indispensible. Here? Disposable. \u201cBut it\u2019s not impossible, there\u2019s no doubt,\u201d Meola says. \u201cIt\u2019s not impossible. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if a soccer player like Fuchs comes over here and does it. It would not surprise me at all.\u201d",
