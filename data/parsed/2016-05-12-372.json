  "body": "Malcolm Turnbull says the objective of the government\u2019s Syrian refugee settlement program is to place people where there are opportunities to work, underlining LNP MP George Christensen\u2019s opposition to settling the refugees in his Queensland region.  The prime minister spoke to Christensen after the backbencher told constituents that he had received assurances from the assistant minister for multicultural affairs, Craig Laundy, that no Syrian refugees would settle in the region of Mackay. Laundy\u2019s office confirmed the minister had told Christensen that refugees would only be settled where there were current settlement service providers. This did not include Christensen\u2019s seat of Dawson. Turnbull said Christensen was entitled to express his opinion about his own area.  \u201cI understand it from George ... in his community, where there has been a downturn in the economy because of the downturn in the mining construction boom, and that\u2019s happened in a number of big cities in North Queensland,\u201d Turnbull said.  \u201cTownsville being another example, of course. What he\u2019s saying is because there aren\u2019t a lot of jobs around ... it\u2019s better for refugees who come in the humanitarian program to be located in places where there are more opportunities for work.   Related: George Christensen tries to put pressure on Labor over Syrian refugee settlement    \u201cBut plainly the objective, when you bring in refugees into Australia, indeed any arrivals into Australia, is to put them in a position where they are given the skills and the opportunities to get into work \u2013 that is the whole objective.\u201d Christensen revealed his assurance from the minister on the day before Bill Shorten was due to campaign in his seat with the Labor candidate, Frank Gilbert. He called on Gilbert to make the same assurances given Gilbert\u2019s wife, Julieanne Gilbert, is the Labor state member for Mackay. \u201cGiven that Mrs Gilbert has repeatedly stated that she wants to see some of the 3,500 refugees that may be settled in Queensland come to the Mackay region, I ask Mr Gilbert to be straight with Mackay people and state his position,\u201d Christensen said. Shorten has been campaigning with the opposition education spokeswoman\u200b, Kate Ellis, and his candidates in north Queensland for the first four days of the marathon election campaign. While Labor has sought to focus on education, Shorten has had to answer difficult questions on Labor\u2019s asylum seeker policy this week after his Melbourne candidate, Sophie Ismail, questioned her party\u2019s stance on the issue.  The Labor candidate for Herbert, Cathy O\u2019Toole, also came under pressure to publicly back Labor\u2019s asylum seeker policy after a photo of her emerged protesting outside LNP MP Ewen Jones\u2019s office with a sign that said \u201cLet Them Stay\u201d.  Gilbert told Guardian Australia the people of Dawson were sick of Christensen\u2019s divisiveness and said he believed the community was welcoming. \u201cPeople have had enough of Christensen\u2019s grandstanding,\u201d Gilbert said. But he reiterated support for Labor\u2019s turnback policy, combined with the humane resettlement of asylum seekers who apply through the proper processes. The Coalition has sought to keep the asylum seeker issue in the news to capitalise on Labor\u2019s discomfort. Christensen quoted Laundy as ruling out any of the 12,000 Syrian refugees settling in the area, saying that any settlements would take place where there are refugee services.  \u201cIn his reply to me Mr Laundy clearly stated: \u2018Sarina [in Mackay] is not currently a designated settlement location\u2019 and \u2018decisions on settlement locations are still being finalised, however the locations are expected to align with those where settlement service providers are already operating.\u2019\u201d Laundy\u2019s office confirmed that the comments were accurate but would not comment any further. When Shorten did a street walk in Townsville on Wednesday, resident Jenny Gaylard told him the biggest issue in Townsville was unemployment. She said her son-in-law was unemployed, while her son was on short-term contacts with no job security. \u201cHe\u2019s 27, he would like to have a house, get married and have children, but there is no security,\u201d she said. Her daughter is in the vocational training centre, which she said had been hit by cutbacks. Gaylard said she had not made up her mind which way she would vote but would assess the policies. She rejected the tag swinging voter. \u201cI like to think I think about the policies and whether they suit the times\u201d.",
