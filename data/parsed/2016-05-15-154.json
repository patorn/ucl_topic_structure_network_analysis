  "body": "Ok. This series is asdfgjhjkl amazing. I\u2019m sorry, this series just made up my reading life. Now on to the actual book.  This is the first of the Mortal Instruments series, which is itself part of the Shadowhunters franchise (which includes four book series, 2 standalones, a slightly rubbish movie, and one of the best TV series of all time).  This story is about Clary Fray, who witnesses a stabbing when she\u2019s at an all-ages night club, Pandemonium, with her best friend Simon. Suddenly she is dragged into a world of demons, vampires and shadowhunters that leaves her questioning her history.          One of the reasons I love this is the realism in the imagery with so many supernatural elements too. This is what got me into high fantasy, and there\u2019s a Star Wars twist too.
