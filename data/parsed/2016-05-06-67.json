Evander Holyfield predicted the Bolton underdog may beat the WBC middleweight champion, Sa\u00fal \u201cCanelo\u201d \u00c1lvarez, and Oscar De La Hoya \u2013 his promoter\u2019s grin never far from showing off his perfect white teeth \u2013 also gave due praise to the challenger for moving up two weight classes and \u201cdaring to be great\u201d.   Related: Amir Khan, the road to Vegas \u2013 in pictures    Lennox Lewis, looking more statesmanlike every time he reappears, spoke with quiet eloquence on behalf of British fighters, luxuriating in the statistic that we have 11 world champions and putting a reasonable case for Khan. \u201cSpeed plus weight equals power,\u201d the former undisputed heavyweight champion pointed out to his illustrious colleagues, who nodded sagely. But it was Bernard Hopkins who made the most piercing observations. At times having to talk through the interjections of the moderator, the 51-year-old who looks as if he has stolen the body of someone 25 years younger was adamant that any boxer who believes he can do great things is more than halfway to achieving great things. This clicks with the very American addiction to \u201cgoals and dreams\u201d, the sort of aspirational hokum that sustains Hollywood and bad novels, but there is no denying it is a presence in boxing and always has been. As Hopkins pointed out, during his career he was rarely the favourite \u201cin the fights that really mattered\u201d \u2013 even when he fought the man sitting next to him, De La Hoya, whom he cut down with a wicked body shot in the ninth round when they fought at a catchweight of 157lbs \u2013 two pounds up from Saturday night\u2019s agreed limit \u2013 in 2004. It has been Hopkins\u2019 theme all week: salvation and miracles. Earlier he told Boxing News: \u201cIf you want to be great, or dare to be great, you do what Amir Khan has done and no one is going to blame you if you fail, because you didn\u2019t really fail. It\u2019s called credibility in boxing. Do you want to be talked about for a minute or do you want to be talked about in time?\u201d Ever the contrarian, Hopkins predicted \u00c1lvarez will stop Khan in the later rounds \u2013 and he is in good company. For all the admiration being bellowed on behalf of the smaller man, there are not too many experts in this gambling oasis prepared to match those fine words with finance. Most outlets give Khan a 4-1 chance, or thereabouts; \u00c1lvarez mirrors the polar price as a hot favourite. The good news for both fighters was that Donald Trump has decided to stay on the presidential campaign trail rather than accepting an invitation from De La Hoya, his some time golfing partner, to take a seat in the T-Mobile Arena on Saturday night. The Republican front-runner would surely have received a hot reception from the Mexican-Muslim Massive that would threaten security. \u201cMany reports that I will be attending the Alvarez/Khan fight this weekend in Vegas,\u201d Trump tweeted. \u201cTotally untrue! Unfortunately I have other plans.\u201d The bile and contempt he has spilled on both communities in recent weeks and months does not seem to have dented his popularity among the hardcore fanatics who believe in him but there are few of those in this town, where Bernie Sanders won over Clarke County Democrats at their convention last month. Sport and politics have always had an edgy relationship in the United States and \u00c1lvarez gave voice to that when he was asked what he thought about the possibility of Trump coming to the fight. He reminded the presumptive Republican candidate that his poor and struggling compatriots had not come to his country \u201cto rob and steal\u201d. They were out in the fields, \u00c1lvarez said, working hard. Khan came to the two-party party, as well, making a pointed joke about Trump\u2019s threat to ban Muslims from entering the country as a counter-terrorist move. \u201cYou never know,\u201d he said on Wednesday, \u201cthis could be the last fight for me and Canelo here if Donald Trump becomes president.\u201d And that set a tone that has been a feature of this promotion and this fight. The champion and his challenger have rich veins of decency and good manners running through them. So polite are they that the edge promoters crave has been almost totally absent. Whatever contractual points of difference they had \u2013 and the weight was a sticking point for a while \u2013 were resolved long ago. The fight was one of the easiest in recent memory to secure, both combatants keen to take it. The seats have been sold. The talking has all but dwindled to zero. And into that weird and unique calm will step \u00c1lvarez and Khan, primed to entertain and, inevitably, to suffer. In that most relevant department of the debate, Hopkins and the bookmakers have probably got it right.",
