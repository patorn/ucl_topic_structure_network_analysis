  "body": "You\u2019ve battled lesson plans and essay deadlines, got to grips with objectives and pedagogy, and handled cranky children and awkward staff. The chequered flag is in sight, but what should you keep in mind as your training year enters the home straight?  It\u2019s likely that your teaching load will have increased in the final term. Greater independence gives you the chance to spread your wings and find your feet as a fully fledged teacher. But every silver lining has a cloud, and your marking and planning pile will probably have expanded. So here are a few thoughts to keep in mind through the chaos to make sure you are celebrating in the summer.  Get your paperwork together   Related: How to ace lesson observations: 10 tips for PGCE students    No matter how much you shine in the classroom or nail the assignments, there\u2019s no escaping the paperwork that comes with a PGCE. Little and often is a better way of tackling it than pulling an all nighter, desperately seeking proof that you\u2019re aware of children\u2019s social development. You\u2019re judged against the teaching standards so the best approach is to systematically present evidence that you have met them. Getting everything in order now will help you spot any areas which are a little thin, and give you time to address them before judgement day. Gabrielle Cliff-Hodges, senior lecturer in education at the University of Cambridge, recommends collating a mixture of evidence including the teaching file, reports and written feedback on lessons. Final lesson observations You\u2019ll probably have had your fill of lesson observations, but the ones in the last term can take on a different feel. You know your class and will have built a relationship with them, meaning lessons can lose the stiltedness of the early days. This offers a great opportunity to demonstrate that you\u2019ve met any of the standards that are missing. Some trainees also find it useful to observe experienced teachers for a few lessons at this stage. You might find that you see them differently now you have had more experience, and it\u2019s the type of thing you rarely have time to do as your career continues. Say no It probably won\u2019t have escaped your attention that many schools are a little strapped for cash. When they see a young, dynamic and capable teacher they can sometimes be tempted to stretch your role beyond what you should be doing. While a bit of professional development can be great, there is a fine line between that and being overworked. I was asked to cover for a teacher on maternity leave when I was training \u2013 I still wake up in a cold sweat remembering the carnage. Remember you\u2019re still a trainee and entitled to support and time away from the classroom to reflect.  Apply for jobs I fondly remember the mild awkwardness of sitting between two fellow trainees as we competed for the same job. While there can be a rush to apply for jobs after Christmas, you will be in a really strong position after summer halfterm. Established teachers on a permanent contract won\u2019t be able to apply for any posts which are a September start, so you will be extremely attractive to schools that have vacancies for the beginning of the year.   Related: If you're a newly-qualified teacher without a job for September, don't panic    But you must make sure the job will be right for you. Cliff-Hodges points out the importance of sharing information about your professional development thus far with your new school to ensure you continue to improve. She says: \u201cYou should think about how you will continue developing during your newly-qualified teacher (NQT) year, and share with your mentor the areas you feel you will need to address, as well as any ideas about how they can support you to achieve your aims.\u201d Remember how far you have come You will undoubtedly be caught in a whirlwind of busyness but, especially when the going is tough, it\u2019s worth remembering how far you have come. Whatever the difficulties you have faced, you\u2019ve made it this far and you probably feel like a different person to the one who rocked up in September. You have very nearly made it \u2013 that is an incredible achievement and testament to your resilience and determination. When you get to the graduation celebration you will have earned that glass of fizz and then some. Follow us on Twitter via @GuardianTeach.
