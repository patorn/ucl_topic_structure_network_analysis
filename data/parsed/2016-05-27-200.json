  "body": "They are both leading experts in all things Shakespeare, sharing between them two of the most prestigious Bard-related cultural positions; but where one is left \u201cfurious\u201d by revisions to the text, the other would happily cut words and sentences audiences might not understand. Erica Whyman, the deputy artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company, set out her views on how to treat the Bard at the Hay literary festival, in stark contract to those offered by Emma Rice, the new boss of Shakespeare\u2019s Globe. Rice has ruffled feathers with her forthright views on Shakespeare. She has admitted to not having read all his plays, believes it is like learning a new language and will be brutal with the text if she decides audiences will not understand it.   Related: Midsummer Night's Dream team: 'play for the nation' unites professionals and amateurs    Meanwhile, speaking before her talk at the festival, Whyman was asked how she feels when \u201cdifficult\u201d bits of text are cut. \u201cI get furious, I do get furious,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I mean by furious is when people cut because the syntax is difficult, or unusual. They start cutting great passages of it, which actually messes with the rhythm and the plot in a really unnecessary way. That condescends to the audience.\u201d Whyman was in Hay speaking about her mammoth touring production of A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream, which features amateur companies alongside a professional cast. She has made some cuts, Whyman said, but only when it was not necessary to the plot, or Shakespeare repeating himself; or they were obscure references.     Erica Whyman, deputy artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company: \u2018We love the story that Shakespeare is hard, it is for clever people.\u2019 Photograph: Teri Pengilley for the Guardian    One of the biggest talking points thrown up this year, the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare\u2019s death, is how understandable he really is to modern audiences. Rice believes a lot of Shakespeare is like cultural medicine and people often pretend to understand. A survey for the British Council recently revealed that only 58% of Britons said they understood Shakespeare compared to, for example, 83% of Indians. Whyman blamed bad teaching at school. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a couple of generations of people who had a miserable time of it, reading it at school and being asked \u2018what does it mean? what does it mean? what does it mean?\u2019 There are quite a lot of us at the RSC who had a rotten time with it who are evangelistic about making sure other people don\u2019t.\u201d Her eyes had been opened by the hundreds of children who have been involved in her production \u2013 they completely understood Shakespeare\u2019s words once they got the emotional story, she said. \u201cThey have no sense that they shouldn\u2019t understand it. They haven\u2019t yet lived in the world that tells them it\u2019s not cool to understand it or the majority of the population don\u2019t understand it. \u201cWe love the story that Shakespeare is hard, it is for clever people. We are attached to it. Children don\u2019t know that story. They explain to you what it means, because they are so inside the emotion of it.\u201d     Emma Rice, artistic director of Shakespeare\u2019s Globe, says hearing the Bard\u2019s plays is like having to learn a whole new language. Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian    Rice has been heavily criticised for saying she does not understand Shakespeare and would rather listen to the Archer\u2019s than read it. But Whyman issued a note of caution. \u201cI\u2019ve known Emma for a long time,\u201d she said. \u201cDon\u2019t believe she doesn\u2019t understand it. \u201cI say it with respect because I think it is extremely helpful having Emma represent people\u2019s fears and anxieties and fears about the language. I\u2019m also very happy to be on the other side of the debate and say let\u2019s not make life impossible for an audience but let us trust that when we speak these words and enable people to hear them, they still live. They live partly because of the amazing heartbeat of the words and the rhythm and they live partly because so many of them are still our language.\u201d Whyman and Rice may disagree on language but they are in agreement when it comes to a fairer distribution of roles. Rice has promised to bend gender, to not worry if Gloucester is a man or a woman.  Whyman agrees, and when the call went out to amateur companies there was no stipulation about gender. Hence two female Bottoms \u2013 a first for the RSC \u2013 lots of women playing Quince and professional actor Lucy Ellinson playing Puck.   Related: Shakespeare's first four folios sell at auction for almost \u00a32.5m    This year, \u201cit is becoming inappropriate not to consider the possibility of women playing roles that have been considered more suitable for men for 400 years,\u201d said Whyman. \u201cGiven Shakespeare messed around with gender so liberally I don\u2019t know why it has taken us so long. Right now it does feel like we are opening up to all sorts of possibilities.\u201d Whyman said her Play for the Nation tour of A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream had been \u201cthe most rewarding experience of my career \u2026 life. Because I\u2019ve met so many people and it has mattered so much to every single one of them. It is very, very rewarding, very gruelling and I think everyone involved, on the professional side, would say the same. It is shattering and yet every time it enlivens us because on a human level it is an extraordinary thing to do.\u201d A lot of people were seeing Shakespeare for the first time and a lot of parents were visiting a theatre for the first time, she said. \u201cThey get on their feet at the end because they understood it and they had a really enjoyable evening at an event they thought was for somebody else.\u201d Whyman said directors were sometimes intimidated by the text. \u201cShakespeare is simpler than it first sounds, when you read it on the page and realise it\u2019s in this old rhythm we don\u2019t think we speak any more, you might immediately think you\u2019re reading a poem and you need to give it the reverence of a poem. But is is a play, it\u2019s dialogue. \u201cIt is our language and it is false to think that it isn\u2019t. It lives in modern English. Of course it is a little different, but it is remarkable how little the difference is. He knew how to get inside our minds and capture things which haven\u2019t been put into words before. It lives in our language now.\u201d",
