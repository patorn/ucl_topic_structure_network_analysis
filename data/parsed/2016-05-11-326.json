  "body": "I have always wanted to be a writer. I remember realising that all the books in the local library had been written by actual human beings, and imagining what it would be like to create something that lived inside someone else\u2019s head the way The Twits and The Famous Five lived in mine. I became an absent-minded child, wrote stories on Post-it notes using plots I stole from library books, and dreamed that one day I would write a book people would read. As a child I didn\u2019t much care what it might be \u2015 just to see my name on a spine would be enough.    Related: Northern Lights by Philip Pullman as a graphic novel \u2013 in pictures    That vague intent was great for the slow ambition of childhood, but when I began to take my writing more seriously I found I didn\u2019t entirely know what kind of writer I wanted to be. I enjoyed the books I studied at university, but they were often dry, worthy tomes that left me cold and made me feel a bit cramped by a style of writing that wasn\u2019t really me.      The author of His Dark Materials trilogy: Philip Pullman. Photograph: Ulf Andersen/Getty Images    Then, when I was about 21, I read the book that changed everything.  Philip Pullman\u2019s Northern Lights kicked around my shelves for a while. It was passed on by a friend who thought I might like it, but I don\u2019t like feeling as though I have to read something \u2015 I like finding things for myself. And this children\u2019s book, well\u2026 I was an adult, wasn\u2019t I? I had outgrown books like this, with its cartoonish cover and its young protagonist. So I promised my friend I would read it, and figured I\u2019d get round to it eventually.    Related: Martin Stewart: 'The best stories are a bit strange'    Reader, I got round to it.  It wasn\u2019t anything like I\u2019d expected. It wasn\u2019t a book for children at all, it was a book about children, for everyone: so beautifully, elegantly written, so imaginative and exciting, and so delicately insightful about what it means to be a human being. Lyra, the gyptians, Iorek, Lee Scoresby\u2026 their voices fizzed in my blood. I\u2019m sure it goes without saying I immediately longed for a d\u00e6mon more than I\u2019d longed for anything in my life. I even took an online test to find out what my d\u00e6mon was \u2015 a secret I will take to my grave!    I immediately longed for a d\u00e6mon more than I\u2019d longed for anything in my life.  Martin Stewart      After I\u2019d finished reading, I sourced the other books in the trilogy at once (a wonderful luxury) and devoured them both. Philip Pullman\u2019s masterwork made me realise with a terrifying clarity that these were the kind of books I wanted to write \u2015 stories that young readers would enjoy throughout their lives.          There are many, many books that have had a deep and lasting impact on me, but only The Northern Lights had such a life-changingly profound effect. And that, I think, is the power of great stories: they tell us something about who we are, and who we\u2019d like to be. Martin Stewart\u2019s debut Riverkeep is available from the Guardian bookshop",
