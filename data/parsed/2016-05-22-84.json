  "body": "Claims by the UK justice secretary, Michael Gove, and the Vote Leave campaign that Turkey could achieve full membership of the EU by 2020 will come as a big surprise to the Turkish government and people.  Turkey\u2019s application has been languishing since 1987, when Ankara first asked Brussels to consider its case for joining. It was not officially recognised as a candidate until 1999. That was 17 years ago. Since then, things have not gone well. Formal negotiations did not begin for a further six years, and when they did they rapidly got bogged down \u2013 which is how matters broadly stand now.  Aspiring members must adopt existing EU rules and standards. They do so in stages, a process that involves agreeing separately to each of 35 chapters. After nearly 30 years, only one negotiating chapter has been agreed with Turkey. Fifteen are, in theory, open for discussion, while talks about the remainder \u2013 the most difficult bits, such as freedom of movement \u2013 have not even begun.   Related: Will staying in EU really lead to an influx equal to Scottish population?    The main reason why matters have proceeded so slowly is that the EU\u2019s big beasts, France and Germany, do not want Turkey to join. Hardly anything happens in the EU without the agreement of these two founding members. Nicolas Sarkozy, the former French president and now tipped to return to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e next spring, was first to put the boot in, and others followed. Almost the first thing Sarkozy did after he was elected in 2007 was block talks with Turkey on the key area of economic and monetary policy. Sarkozy argued that Turkey was geographically not part of Europe and had no place in the EU. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, Sarkozy\u2019s successor, is similarly unsympathetic. More importantly, perhaps, Angela Merkel, Germany\u2019s long-serving chancellor, also opposes Turkish membership. She repeated this view in a television interview in October last year. \u201cErdo\u011fan knows this,\u201d she said, referring to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. Merkel has used the carrot of accelerated negotiations to facilitate a deal with Turkey on returning Syrian migrants. But her basic position, backed by large cross-party majorities in Germany, is that Turkey should not be granted full membership. So, in short, even if David Cameron\u2019s government enthusiastically advocated swift Turkish accession, which it does not, it would certainly be blocked, for the foreseeable future, by the EU\u2019s two most powerful states, backed by other influential members such as Poland.  And even if, despite all this, Turkey were somehow allowed in, the EU\u2019s freedom of movement rules would almost certainly not apply in the first instance. Like Romania and Bulgaria after they joined in 2007, Turkish workers would not be allowed simply to move en masse to the UK or other EU states. Britain\u2019s non-membership of the Schengen area creates another specific barrier in this respect. Similar obstacles face other current EU applicants \u2013 Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania. Apart from specific concerns about immigration and jobs, the EU is suffering what is known as \u201cenlargement fatigue\u201d. Many European politicians feel 28 member states is more than enough. New members are not welcome from any quarter \u2013 and all 28 national parliaments have a right of veto. This reluctance, incidentally, would affect any future membership bid by an independent Scotland. Turkey\u2019s leaders know all this only too well, as does the Turkish public \u2013 even if Gove and the Brexiters do not. Support for EU membership has dropped in Turkey in recent years, part of a backlash against perceived discriminatory treatment by what Erdo\u011fan calls a \u201cChristian club\u201d. Turkey under Erdo\u011fan has turned eastwards, away from Europe, looking to wield influence in the lands of the old Ottoman empire. It has cultivated closer ties with Middle Eastern powers such as Saudi Arabia. Stung by European criticism of human rights abuses and a crackdown on press freedom, Erdo\u011fan has sometimes given the impression that he would like to scrap the EU talks altogether. Sunday\u2019s appointment of a party loyalist, Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, as prime minister, who is expected to follow the president\u2019s line in all main policy areas, means Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Europhobia may develop unchecked and become more extreme. Vote Leave\u2019s argument that millions of Turks would move to the UK if they could is borderline fantasy for other reasons. Although Turkey\u2019s economy has faltered of late, its record of expansive GDP growth since the 1990s is impressive. Living standards have risen for most Turks amid rapid urbanisation.  In other words, Britain is a less attractive destination for Turkish economic migrants than it might think. Against this backdrop, Gove\u2019s claim that more than 5 million people \u2013 exceeding the population of Scotland \u2013 could move to the UK from the EU by 2030 reveals a surprising ignorance of European realities. Truth be told, it\u2019s a load of old kebab.",
