  "body": "Hundreds of residents have been evacuated from their homes in Bath after an unexploded 500lb second world war bomb was found in a playground.  A 300-metre exclusion zone was set up following the discovery at the former school in Lansdown Road, and residents were woken up in the night and told to leave.  About 1,100 homes were in the evacuation zone, but police did not know how many people had decided to leave. Some residents were put up in a marquee on the nearby racecourse. Others were spending the day in a pavilion at the Recreation Ground close to the city centre and were told they may not be able to return for 48 hours. Schools were shut and road diversions put in place.

The bomb is 1.42m long and 0.4m wide. Ch Insp Kevin Thatcher, of Avon and Somerset police, said: \u201cWe recognise the disruption this incident has already caused to residents inside the exclusion zone and we\u2019d like to thank them for their patience. Decisions to evacuate houses are never taken lightly but during these incidents public safety will always be our primary concern. \u201cWe also appreciate the anxiety many in the local community may feel following the discovery of the device and the time required to remove it but we would urge people not to be alarmed. The EOD are working as quickly as they can to remove the device and we will provide regular updates on their progress.\u201d     Building a big sand castle around a WW2 bomb #bathbomb #eod pic.twitter.com/MMuRgPoX6Z\u2014 Murray Kenneth (@MurrayKenneth) May 13, 2016    The EOD team was building a barrier around the device using 250 tonnes of sand. Once this was in place, they planned to remove the bomb and, with a police escort, take it to a safe location and carry out a controlled explosion. A police spokesman said: \u201cUnfortunately, once outside the exclusion zone, residents are unable to re-enter while the incident is ongoing, which at this stage is believed may be up to 48 hours. Some residents inside the cordon have chosen to remain in their homes and they continue to be advised to move to a safe distance. Those who have remained inside the exclusion zone will be prevented from moving within 100 metres of the device for their own safety.\u201d The \u201cBath blitz\u201d took place over an April weekend in 1942. More than 400 people died, more than 800 were injured and hundreds of buildings were destroyed or damaged. Other UK cities targeted in what came to be known as the \u201cBaedeker\u201d air raids included Exeter, Norwich, York, and Canterbury \u2013 all with a \u201cthree-star\u201d rating in the German Baedeker guidebook to Britain \u2013 as part of Hitler\u2019s retaliation for RAF attacks on Germany\u2019s historic Baltic ports of Rostock and Lubeck. A spokesman for Bath and North East Somerset council said: \u201cIn order to minimise disruption and any knock-on effects, members of the public are advised to carefully consider if it is absolutely necessary for them to travel into Bath today or whether they can avoid making the journey \u2013 such as working from home or an alternative location, or visiting the city on a different day.\u201d Residents have been writing on Twitter about the incident, using the hashtag bathbomb.

He said: \u201cWe thought the bomb was somewhere else in the school grounds, which is a huge area, so we went into the back of the house and all camped in the basement bedroom.  \u201cBut at 3am I could hear noises and we discovered the bomb was right outside our house.\u201d    Bath bomb evacuee Harriet Gillingham, spending the day at Bath racecourse. https://t.co/4NStmqwg6G\u2014 steven morris (@stevenmorris20) May 13, 2016    Married couple Bob and Jan Lawrence, 70 and 67, spent an uncomfortable night in an executive box at Bath racecourse. Mr Lawrence squeezed himself into a corner. \u201cIt was like being single again,\u201d he said. Mrs Lawrence was not so impressed: \u201cI didn\u2019t sleep at all. I wish we\u2019d stay put. I feel pretty grubby now and am desperate to go home.\u201d  The Lawrences had been out for a curry on Thursday night and were walking back up the hill toward their house when they came upon police officers. \u201cWe thought there had been a road accident,\u201d said Mr Lawrence, a former soldier and civil servant. \u201cWe went home and then at about 9pm there was a frantic knocking on the door. Police explained there was a bomb and suggested we evacuate. We\u2019re a couple of streets away. We decided to go. We weren\u2019t scared \u2013 we\u2019re pretty sure they know what they are doing.\u201d    Police officer and Bath bomb evacuees at the racecourse. pic.twitter.com/2eJjTvEKkH\u2014 steven morris (@stevenmorris20) May 13, 2016    Mrs Lawrence, a retired laboratory technician, said she had got into her dressing gown and was planning to doze off in front of the television when they were advised to flee. \u201cI just took one lot of clothes. Bob was telling me to hurry up. I\u2019m not feeling worried. I\u2019m a fatalist. When your time has come, your time has come.\u201d  Like the Lawrences, student Harriet Gillingham, 20, was spending the day in a room at the racecourse usually reserved for horse owners and trainers. Gillingham and her dog Pepper spent the night at a friend\u2019s house and she said she would go to another friend if she needed to on Friday night. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit inconvenient,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I\u2019m glad I left, I think it was the right thing to do.\u201d     Bath bomb - examining a map of the exclusion zone. pic.twitter.com/3PcQ3ZIBUb\u2014 steven morris (@stevenmorris20) May 13, 2016    Glyn, who lives about 150m from the bomb, decided to remain at home. He told the BBC: \u201cTo be fair the bomb\u2019s been there for 70 years. I\u2019ve lived long enough with that bomb next to me and if it was going to go off, it would have gone off by now.\u201d Ch Supt Ian Smith, of Avon and Somerset police, estimated that several hundred people had been displaced but thousands had been disrupted by the road closures. There are 1,100 homes and businesses within the cordon.  The bomb was found under the playground of Hope House, the old junior school for what is now the Royal high school. The celebrity baker Mary Berry would have played in the playground where the bomb was found. She attended Hope House, where she was inspired by her domestic science teacher, Miss Date. Her first creation was a treacle sponge pudding, which she took home. The Royal high school said: \u201cAs a boarding school, we remain open and the boarders, boarding staff and members of the leadership team are on site. \u201cShould day girls come into school they will be taken care of; however, access to the school is likely to be very difficult and police are advising to limit any travel today. Public examinations are scheduled to take place as planned.\u201d",
