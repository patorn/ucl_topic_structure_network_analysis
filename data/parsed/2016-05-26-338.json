  "body": "Egypt has called in European deep-sea search crews to find the \u201cblack boxes\u201d of EgyptAir flight 804 as the recovery effort marks one week since the plane crashed into the Mediterranean Sea. The Airbus A320 crashed with 66 people on board, including 30 Egyptians and 15 from France. Investigators on Thursday still had no clear picture of its final moments. Some wreckage and body parts have been found but the bulk of the plane and its flight recorders \u2013 which could explain what brought down the Paris-to-Cairo flight as it entered Egyptian air space \u2013 have not been located. EgyptAir chairman Safwat Musallam said French and Italian companies able to carry out searches at a depth of 3,000 metres were being brought in.

The source said the costs of the contract would be shared between France and Egypt. Neither source was aware of talks with the Italian company. The flight recorders are believed to be lying in up to 3,000 metres of water, on the edge of the range for the locating signals they emit. Maritime search experts say this means acoustic hydrophones must be towed in the water at depths of up to 2,000 metres in order to have the best chance of picking up the signals. Searches for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 have used the same technology, albeit in a much more vast search area, without success.  Until recently, aviation sources say, the US navy or its private contractor Phoenix International were considered among the only sources for equipment needed to search on the correct frequency for black box \u201cpingers\u201d at such depths.  The US navy said on Tuesday it had not been asked to help.  Batteries powering the signals sent from the black boxes typically last 30 days, but EgyptAir\u2019s deputy chairman Ahmed Adel said the search would continue beyond then if necessary, using other means to locate the recorders.  \u201cThere are many examples in similar air accidents when 30 days passed without finding the box yet ... these planes\u2019 black boxes were found,\u201d he said.           Missing EgyptAir flight: what we know so far    Musallam reiterated earlier comments from sources within the Egyptian investigation committee who said the jet had shown no sign of technical problems before taking off from Paris.  He said the Airbus 320 was given a regular check by an Egyptian engineer and two Egyptian technicians at Paris airport.   Related: MH370 search: 'decreasing possibility' plane will be found, say authorities     \u201cThe engineer and the pilot both signed the aircraft technical log which stated that the check found that all the plane\u2019s machines were safe,\u201d he said.  The investigation sources said the plane disappeared off radar screens less than a minute after entering Egyptian airspace and \u2013 contrary to reports from Greece \u2013 there was no sign that it had swerved sharply as it went down.  The crew did not make contact with Egyptian air traffic control, they said.  With no flight recorders to check and only fragmentary data from a handful of fault messages registering smoke in the plane in the minutes before it crashed, investigators are also looking to debris and body parts for clues.  One Egyptian forensics official said the small amount of human remains recovered pointed to an explosion on board though no trace of explosives had been detected.  But Hisham Abdelhamid, head of Egypt\u2019s forensics authority, said this assessment was \u201cmere assumptions\u201d and that it was too early to draw conclusions. With Reuters",
