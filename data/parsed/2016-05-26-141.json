  "body": "\u2018I miss everything about England,\u201d says Neil Gaiman, dressed in his customary black jacket and jeans. \u201cI get so ridiculously happy when I land here. It irritates my wife like nothing on earth. She\u2019s like, \u2018What is it about this place? And why doesn\u2019t New York do that for you?\u2019\u201d The Hampshire-born author, who now splits his time between Minneapolis and upstate New York, has lived in the US since 1992. Back then, he was a writer whose fans were found in specialist comic bookstores. How times have changed. \u201cI used to be a cult author,\u201d says the 55-year-old, his dark, wild hair now lightly flecked with grey. \u201cPeople would either say, \u2018Neil Gaiman? I\u2019ve never heard of him,\u2019 or, \u2018Neil Gaiman? He\u2019s my favourite author!\u2019 There was nothing in between.\u201d He pauses and looks around the BFI cafe on London\u2019s south bank. \u201cThese days,\u201d he says, \u201cpeople\u2019s mums have heard of me.\u201d The author has flown in, full of beans, with his wife Amanda Palmer and their baby, Ash, to discuss the imminent onslaught of his work: his first non-fiction book, The View From The Cheap Seats, and Neil Gaiman\u2019s Likely Stories \u2013 the first of many TV adaptations in the works.  Likely Stories is Tales of the Unexpected for the 21st century \u2013 four standalone stories of obsession, sex, death and consumption with a huge cast from Rita Tushingham to Johnny Vegas. And this is just the start: next year will bring TV shows of his novel American Gods (starring Ian McShane) and Good Omens, the apocalyptic comedy he wrote in 1990 with Terry Pratchett, who died last year.     Rita Tushingham in Feeders and Eaters, in which she lives on raw meat alone.    \u201cThere is a lot of stuff coming out at the moment and about to come out,\u201d he admits. \u201cBut it has been a long time coming.\u201d \u201cAmerican Gods was published in 2001,\u201d he continues. \u201cStarting that year, I would get calls from directors so famous even you and I knew who they were, saying: \u2018I just read American Gods and I want to make it into a movie. How do I do that?\u2019 My answer was always: I have no idea. They always figured I would have the answers \u2026 just drop this section, do this or that, and I never did.\u201d   Related: Good Omens: Neil Gaiman to adapt Terry Pratchett collaboration for TV    Back then, a movie was the only way to go. \u201cIf that didn\u2019t work, you might get a movie made for TV or a miniseries, and that was considered quite a step down,\u201d he says. \u201cBut now people want to make TV.\u201d Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead have proved there is a massive appetite for long-form, fantasy-based TV shows. \u201cHere we are 15 years later, and what worked against us is actually on our side. It\u2019s wonderful.\u201d  Gaiman\u2019s fanbase will be amped and ready to lap up any screen version of his work. But, he admits, he doesn\u2019t necessarily want to do them himself. \u201cI never intended to adapt any of my stuff really,\u201d he says. \u201cI wound up doing Good Omens because it was Terry\u2019s last request.\u201d But this was not, as was widely reported, a command from beyond the grave. Gaiman says, \u201cBecause Rob Wilkins [Pratchett\u2019s assistant] had been talking about letters sent posthumously, people thought the idea must have come in one of those. It hadn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t like a reading of the will, where Terry left the instruction: \u2018And to my friend Neil Gaiman I leave the obligation to write a television series.\u2019 Terry asked me way back when he was still alive and still very much compos mentis. He wrote me this very sweet email and said: \u2018You\u2019ve got to do it.\u2019 And I went: \u2018Fuck. Now I have to.\u2019\u201d     Johnny Vegas as Danny, a raconteur telling a ghost story in Closing Time.    Although he\u2019s been involved in Likely Stories, he has taken a back seat to allow series producers Jane Pollard and Iain Forsyth, who rose to prominence with the Nick Cave biopic 20,000 Days On Earth, to have their head.  The four stories are Foreign Parts, about an introverted banker who believes he\u2019s slowly being taken over by a venereal disease he cannot have contracted; Feeders and Eaters, in which a woman (Tushingham) subsists on raw meat alone; Closing Time, a ghost story being told to club members by raconteur Johnny Vegas, and Looking For the Girl, about a pornographer\u2019s fixation with a model. The choices shocked and fascinated Gaiman, who had offered up the 40 or so short stories not already under option. \u201cThey\u2019re much darker than I would have picked,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re weird, they\u2019re intangible. They\u2019re all about loneliness and alienation, about the lack of connection, about compulsion and consumption and they don\u2019t come with closure ... there are nooses left hanging.\u201d He would have \u201ctried to find ones that had proper endings rather than ones that leave you feeling faintly disturbed, that you may have been lied to, or thinking \u2018weird shit just happened\u2019\u201d.     George Mackay in Foreign Parts, playing an introverted banker who thinks he\u2019s slowly being taken over by a venereal disease.    Gaiman is already steeped in TV \u2013 he wrote the original screenplay of Neverwhere for the BBC in 1996, which he later novelised, and which is rumoured to be heading for a remake by Hunger Games director Francis Lawrence \u2013 and has also written for Doctor Who. His tastes are wide-ranging, from the original Muppet Show (\u201cone of the comedic glories of the human race\u201d) to The Twilight Zone (\u201cthe ones that work just sit there, in the back of your head, creeping you out.\u201d) He accepts that while ambiguity can work in prose, it\u2019s often harder on screen \u2013 precisely why Forsyth and Pollard had their work cut out. Gaiman says, \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the normal thing of \u2018we\u2019ll send you the script for your comments\u2019, it was more them phoning up and saying: \u2018What were you thinking, why did they do this?\u2019 I would wind up explaining the iceberg underlying the story. It\u2019s all right to be coy and evocative in a story, but you\u2019d better at least know yourself.\u201d Gaiman briefly appears in each episode, often on a static-y TV screen in the background, quietly expounding some theory on storytelling or horror or human nature. The show is not called merely Likely Stories, but Neil Gaiman\u2019s Likely Stories. Does this mean he has finally gone mainstream? \u201cYou are no longer a cult author at the point where people have heard of you. They might not have read your stuff, but they know who you are. John Grisham isn\u2019t a cult author, because even though you might never have read his books in your life you know he writes legal thrillers.\u201d Does he get recognised in the street now? He nods. \u201cIt\u2019s odd, and I never get used to it and I\u2019m never entirely comfortable with it, though people are usually very nice.\u201d He pauses. \u201cI do miss those cult author days a bit.\u201d Neil Gaiman\u2019s Likely Stories begins tonight at 9pm on Sky Arts. The View From The Cheap Seats is published on 31 May.",
