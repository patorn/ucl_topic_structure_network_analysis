  "body": "Eddie Jones has poured scorn on suggestions from Toulon\u2019s owner, Mourad Boudjellal, that Steffon Armitage has been promised an immediate route back into the England squad this year, insisting the flanker will have to move back across the Channel before he is considered for international duty and denying having spoken to anyone at the French club. This week Boudjellal claimed Armitage had \u201ccome to see me to say he had the opportunity to play with the England team and that Eddie Jones had called him\u201d, but that version of events has been rubbished by the Australian. \u201cYou have to remember the bloke who makes the comments writes comic books,\u201d said Jones, referring to Boudjellal\u2019s publishing background. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether he writes them or sells them but he has made plenty of money out of them. Batman and Robin won\u2019t be in the team. People have false Facebook posts and false Twitter accounts so I suppose you can have a false phone call.\u201d Jones, who is putting 26 England tour hopefuls through their paces at a training camp in Brighton this week, says he will wait to discover where Armitage plays next season before he even starts to consider him for squad selection. \u201cI don\u2019t\u00a0control him \u2026 at the moment he is not eligible to play for England. It\u2019s not up\u00a0to me, it\u2019s up to him. If he signs for Wasps, gets fit and plays good rugby I\u2019ll pick him.\u201d The prospect of Armitage signing for Wasps will hinge on the club buying out the final year of the back-rower\u2019s contract. \u201cHe\u2019s asked to leave Toulon and go and play in an English club and for the England team \u2026 it\u2019s his ambition so why not?\u201d said Boudjellal. \u201cHe is under contract, though, and I have no intention of playing Father Christmas. I am ready to let him leave but that has a price and it\u2019s expensive.\u201d The Wasps director of rugby, Dai Young, also stressed no deal had yet been finalised and insisted the same applied to Willie le Roux, the Springbok full-back reportedly being lined up to replace the departing Charles Piutau. \u201cWe are always looking to improve and it would be silly for me to say we\u2019d never be interested in Armitage or other players,\u201d said Young. \u201cBut are we anywhere near doing a deal? No we\u2019re not. The players that do interest us will interest everybody else so it\u2019s a battle to get them across the line.\u201d With Kurtley Beale, subject to his recovery from the knee injury that has ruled him out for the next six months, and Danny Cipriani already heading to Wasps next season, there is plenty of potential excitement heading in the direction of Coventry, although Cipriani may have his work cut out to make next month\u2019s tour of Australia. Jones says a pending drink-driving ban will not count against the fly-half but did not sound bowled over by what he has seen on the field to date. \u201cToday he might have needed a car at stages. He has got to understand that at the age of 28 or 29 he has got to evolve into a different sort of player. Whether he can make himself into a worthwhile international player is his challenge.\u201d Jones sounded rather more impressed with the impact of Dylan Hartley, who has barely played since being concussed against France in March, but says there are still spaces \u201cup for grabs\u201d in his squad to face the Wallabies. \u201cYou have 10-15 players involved in the semi-finals and they come back into consideration but 44 doesn\u2019t go into 31 or 32 or 33.\u201d He is also stressing there can be no excuses of tiredness when England fly south for their three-Test series next month: \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t go to Australia and play super rugby, it\u2019s all about how you look at the tour. We can\u2019t have any excuses because this is an important part of the calendar. The World Cup draw is being done in May 2017, which gives us 13 Tests to get in the top three in the world. We play the sides at one and two this year so they\u2019re massive opportunities for us.\u201d",
