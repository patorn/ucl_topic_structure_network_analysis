  "body": "Think about your passions and interests If you are considering changing career direction, it\u2019s worth starting off by exploring your passions and interests. \u201cYou don\u2019t only need to focus on your work-based skills [when looking to change career], also think about what you enjoy doing in life and where you have the energy and enthusiasm to develop skills,\u201d says Denise Taylor, a career psychologist at Amazing People. Andrew Fennell, director of StandOut CV, says it\u2019s essential to find out as much as you can about the industries you want to break into. \u201cIf you are changing career, research your new field thoroughly and try to gain some voluntary or freelance experience to get a real feel for the work before committing to a new role.\u201d Test out your career idea before making the leap Career changes can be time-consuming and expensive if you need to retrain, so you have to know you are committed before making the move. \u201cTest out your idea on a small scale first,\u201d recommends Sarah Byrne, career coach at Careershifters. \u201cFor example, take a short course before enrolling in a time-intensive course; work shadow or volunteer to see if the reality matches the idea in your head.\u201d   Related: Want to test drive a career change? Do the side hustle    Corinne Mills, managing director of Personal Career Management, agrees that you should test out a new career before committing. \u201cAsk to get involved with a project group at work. Or try to find a mentor in your chosen industry. There are lots of opportunities where you can learn more while continuing to develop your experience,\u201d she says. Reach out to all contacts in your job search You need to go all out when job hunting, says Lydia Fairman, founder of Fairman Consulting. She also recommends identifying key contacts in the type of company you would like to work for and contacting them speculatively.  \u201cBe methodical and keep a list of who you\u2019ve contacted and when, and follow up a week or two later if you\u2019ve had no response, even if it\u2019s just to see if they got the message,\u201d she says. \u201cBe targeted and specific in each application and speculative approach you make.\u201d In the emails, Fairman advises explaining why you are applying or approaching them and what you can offer. If that approach doesn\u2019t work, find a recruiter who specialises in your area, Fairman adds. \u201cBecome active on social media, LinkedIn groups and other forums. Build contacts and you\u2019ll soon find opportunities come to you,\u201d she says. Identify which skills are transferable to your new career In your job applications, it\u2019s important to highlight the skills you can bring across from your previous roles. \u201cGet an idea of what to include in your key skills section by exploring job adverts and role descriptions \u2013 identify which strengths you have that match what an employer is looking for,\u201d advises Lisa LaRue, a career coach at CareerWorx, a career consultancy providing CV advice. \u201cI\u2019d argue all CVs should be skills-focused,\u201d says LaRue. \u201cThis means dedicating at least a quarter of the first page of your CV to highlighting your key skills and strengths.\u201d For example, \u201cpersonal skills that you learn on the job are highly transferable into different industries,\u201d adds Jon Gregory, a job search and interview specialist. Match your CV to the role you are applying for On your CV, you need to stand out as the best person who can fill the vacant position, rather than someone who can do their current job, says Lis McGuire, founder of Giraffe CVs. \u201cWhen you are making a career change, every line of your CV needs to work as hard as possible, showing how you meet the target role requirements and have the necessary skills to do the job. Don\u2019t be afraid to rip your CV up and start again from scratch for each role you apply for to achieve the best results,\u201d she says. Katherine Burik, founder of The Interview Doctor, agrees: \u201cHiring managers don\u2019t want to [have to] work hard to determine whether someone is qualified or not. So if your job search materials aren\u2019t exact they will discard your application in favour of people who more obviously meet the criteria.\u201d Likewise Victoria McLean, founder of CityCV.co.uk, adds that you should match your CV as closely as possible to the hiring manager\u2019s job description. \u201cYour CV should be elegant, impactful and persuasive, with a laser focus on skills and achievements relevant to your target role.\u201d Practise interview questions before you are assessed Interviewing when changing sectors can be particularly difficult, says LaRue. Ensure you are prepared to tackle any tough questions on your career change by practising your answersahead of the interview. \u201cBe sure to include the most common questions, such as \u2018what made you apply for this role\u2019, \u2018why do you want to work for us\u2019, \u2018why are you making this transition?\u2019 Practise answering these with a friend so that they can give you candid feedback and you can pick up on any red flags that might crop up in your responses,\u201d advises LaRue.
