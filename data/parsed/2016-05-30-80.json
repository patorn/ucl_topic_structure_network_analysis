  "body": "Labour needs more women from diverse, non-political backgrounds who understand the lives of real people if it wants to be successful at the next general election, says the party\u2019s candidate to replace Sadiq Khan at Westminster.  Rosena Allin-Khan, an A&E doctor and local councillor selected to stand in Tooting after Khan became mayor, adds that she has had to rent so she can stay in the area and complains that the tabloid media attention she has had could make people like her not want to become an MP.    Related: Junior A&E doctor selected as Labour candidate for Tooting    \u201cI\u2019m local born and bred. My mother and father are ageing in the constituency. I am trying to raise my young family in the area,\u201d she says as she greets voters on the doorstep. \u201cI work on the NHS frontline, in St George\u2019s hospital, I do shifts day and night, weekends, standing up for the whole community. I\u2019m a councillor with a track record for standing up for all of Wandsworth. I\u2019m Tooting through and through.\u201d Allin-Khan\u2019s background and experience stands in clear contrast to that of Westminster career politicians. Her father was a TV repair man and her mother worked in a petrol station and as a child minder and a cleaner to make ends meet. Careers advisers at her secondary school told her that medicine was not a realistic choice for girls like her, but she ignored them and studied medicine at Cambridge.  \u201cMy mum\u2019s Catholic, my dad\u2019s Muslim. I\u2019m completely mixed: half-Polish, half-Pakistani, I married a Welshman, I went to a Church of England school. I am about uniting communities,\u201d she says, adding that her husband has converted to Islam and they are raising their two daughters, one and three, to be Muslim. It\u2019s a mix that would have confounded the attempts of Zac Goldsmith\u2019s mayoral campaign to categorise and target London\u2019s electorate according to their ethnicity.  She does not know Suliman Gani, the local imam who was at the centre of Conservative efforts to discredit Khan, and dismisses attempts to stoke up religious division. \u201cTooting is a community that is proud of being diverse. People from Tooting are proud to live alongside each other,\u201d she says.     Allin-Khan is campaigning in Tooting. She wants to make housing a priority. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian    \u201cI hope that if I were to be successful I would be a voice for doctors, but also for the female population, for the Polish and Pakistani populations, mothers. We need a parliament that reflects real people.\u201d  Her arguments will resonate in party headquarters as politicians digest the conclusions of last week\u2019s Fabian Society report suggesting recent council elections indicated that Labour was struggling to attract working-class voters.  She is too careful and on-message to suggest that Labour remains excessively male and white, but she does concede that when she first joined the party when she was at Cambridge \u201cthere weren\u2019t very many role models\u201d. Things have improved and Labour now has 99 female MPs, compared with the Conservatives\u2019 68.  She says: \u201cWhen I look at Labour, I am really proud to see people who have worked hard to represent society, but there is always room for more. Having me there as the 100th female Labour MP, as a Muslim, as a mixed-race woman, as a mother \u2013 these are all things that are positive and would be a step forward. There aren\u2019t enough MPs across the board that reflect all of those things.\u201d     Allin-Khan has her picture taken on the campaign trail. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian    She says she has first-hand experience of the issues she believes concern voters in the area \u2013 not least the cost of housing. Allin-Khan and her husband, who is an economist at Shell, cannot afford to buy a property in the constituency, where house prices have risen dramatically in the past decade, and are renting instead.  \u201cWe\u2019re struggling. The cost of renting is high. When you factor in having to pay for childcare, a lot of people can\u2019t save up for a deposit for a house. We fall into that category at the moment,\u201d she says. She wants to stay in the area where she has always lived because she is caring for her father who has dementia, and wants to be close to her mother who helps look after her children.  Despite being in a two-income household, the process of standing for election has meant taking unpaid leave from her job, plunging her family temporarily into debt until the byelection on 16 June.  This, along with the media\u2019s race to find embarrassing material about her (the Daily Mail dredged up some swimwear model-style photographs on the internet), has convinced her that this is why many people from normal backgrounds might decide becoming an MP is unpalatable. \u201cI don\u2019t take it too seriously but, I worry that it\u2019s the sort of thing that puts women off standing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit frustrating.\u201d House prices are also a concern for traditional Conservative voters in Tooting \u2013 and Allin-Khan hopes to persuade them the London mayor\u2019s vision for building affordable housing on Transport for London land is one of a number of projects that could ease the situation. \u201cThey might have somewhere lovely to live, but they do worry about their children coming back from university with debt and not being able to buy near them, or anywhere near them,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m the renter that\u2019s struggling to pay for a deposit, but I also can\u2019t afford to buy where I\u2019ve grown up.\u201d     Allin-Khan is hoping to replace Sadiq Khan, who was voted in as mayor of London in May. Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA    Her Conservative rival, fellow long-term Tooting resident Dan Watkins, is also campaigning for affordable homes for the area. He lost to Khan by just over 2,800 votes in the general election. Labour\u2019s majority has dropped from about 15,000 in 1997.  Allin-Khan says her experience as a doctor has given her frontline experience of social problems in the area, many of which have intensified with \u201ccuts to social services \u2026 carers who can\u2019t cope at home\u201d. \u201cYou see the effects of homelessness. You meet vulnerable adults and vulnerable children. We see people who have drinking problems as a result of mental health issues,\u201d she says. As a junior doctor she has supported the strike action but will vote in favour of the compromise resolution negotiated this month.  Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, came to Tooting to congratulate her after her selection, but her cheerfulness dries up a notch when she begins to talk about his leadership. \u201cJeremy Corbyn has done a lot for health issues and housing issues,\u201d she says cautiously, edging dangerously close to damning him with faint praise. \u201cI applaud him for that; they are issues that ring true for me.\u201d Do people talk about him on the doorstep? \u201cNot much, to be honest. It\u2019s more about the issues.\u201d Can he lead the Labour party to victory in 2020? \u201cI don\u2019t think this is about Jeremy Corbyn or Sadiq Khan or anyone else,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not taking any sides, I\u2019m not getting involved in any of that. I\u2019m just about running and winning here.\u201d",
