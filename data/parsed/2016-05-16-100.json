  "body": "Copenhagen primary school in north London does not immediately stand out as a pollution hotspot. The school gates open on to a quiet cul-de-sac, while along one side runs the Regent\u2019s canal, where birds swoop in the afternoon sunshine. The large Victorian building is topped by an \u201cedible roof garden\u201d, designed to allow the children to grow fruit and vegetable in a restful environment.   Related: Boris Johnson accused of burying study linking pollution and deprived schools    But the small housing estate in which the school sits is framed by two busy roads, York Way and Caledonian Road, along which buses, taxis and construction lorries thunder night and day towards nearby King\u2019s Cross station and on into the city centre. Researchers found average NO2 levels of 60.2 micrograms per cubic metre here, well above the EU air quality objective of 40 micrograms and placing Copenhagen among the 20 schools with the highest levels in London. For parents collecting their children at the gates, the figures were troubling, if not entirely surprising. \u201cIt\u2019s quite quiet around here, but it does get a lot of cars,\u201d said Kerry Anderson, picking up her eight-year-old son, Jaden, on Monday. \u201cSometimes if I\u2019m walking along a busy road round here, the smog in the air from the exhaust pipes, you can really feel it in your throat. It does concern me.\u201d     Kerry Anderson and her eight-year-old son, Jaden.

Everywhere you go, it\u2019s polluted.\u201d Though a retired minicab driver himself, he believes emissions should be capped in the city, \u201cor they should bring in electric cars\u201d. But for Aki Rahman, whose son, Ishrat, is in year three at the school, parents can also play their part in reducing pollution around schools. \u201cThis is a really small road, but you see a lot of parents with cars, and I have noticed they are often really local parents. More people could walk, definitely.\u201d She said she would love to see \u201can old-fashioned school bus\u201d to cut down on the number of cars but thought London mayor Sadiq Khan\u2019s new \u201chopper\u201d bus fare, costing a flat rate for an hour\u2019s travel, could also help steer parents on to public transport.      Aki Rahman and Ishrat: \u2018I have noticed it\u2019s got worse. I need my inhaler and I\u2019ve always got watery eyes.\u2019 Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian    Rahman, who lives nearby, said she became asthmatic while pregnant with her five-month-old daughter, and \u201ccan really feel pollution in the air. Not every day, but because of the recent weather change, I have noticed it\u2019s got worse. I need my inhaler and I\u2019ve always got watery eyes.\u201d Her children, meanwhile, have allergies. \u201cI don\u2019t know if the pollution is making that worse. Yes, it\u2019s definitely something that I worry about.\u201d",
