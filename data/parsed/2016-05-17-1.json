  "body": "Muirfield is in danger of losing its Open status with members close to blocking the admission of women. An announcement on that vote could arrive as early as Thursday. Muirfield, as controlled by the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, has presided over an historically male-only membership policy. That bias has come into intense focus around recent Opens, most recently in 2013 when the R&A, which controls the third major of the year, was vehemently criticised for utilising the East Lothian venue.   Related: Royal Troon will host 2016 Open Championship as a men-only golf club    Since 1892, 16 Opens have been held at Muirfield. Should current membership rules be endorsed by a 2016 vote, two-thirds is needed to allow female members, scope for a 17th in the near future would be removed. A consultation exercise with members opened after the events of three years ago, but it was never a given that Muirfield\u2019s policy would change. It has now emerged that a group of 30 members, fronting a \u201cno\u201d campaign against the admission of women, has had a strong influence. In their letter to them, as obtained by The Scotsman, they state: \u201cIt is recognised that it is a very sensitive matter and the club is in a difficult position, but associations like ours with a very long and venerable history have strengths which are derived from that history. \u201cChange must come slowly and for choice should be evolutionary. A traditional resistance to change is one of the foundations of our unique position in golf and our reputation.\u201d The letter continues: \u201cIt is accepted that we may have to change, but we should not do so now on the basis suggested. We have had a lengthy process, but it is felt that there is time to pause and consider further options to develop the club and it is hoped retain the Open. \u201cIt is recommended that members vote against the resolution to change our rules to include the admission of lady members.\u201d Royal Troon, which hosts this year\u2019s Open, announced on Tuesday that it has written to its 800 members regarding the possible including of female members.",
