Allied Commercial Exporters (ACE) then went on to make millions from a series of real estate deals with the department store chain. ACE, which is run by Guy and Alexander Dellal, the son and grandson of property investor \u201cBlack Jack\u201d Dellal, backed Chappell\u2019s takeover with the consortium Retail Acquisitions before buying an office block from BHS and loaning the retailer money at such a fierce interest rate that it was known by management as the \u201cWonga\u201d loan. Arcadia executives told MPs investigating the collapse of BHS that the \u00a335m payment was vital in determining the credibility of Retail Acquisitions, the consortium led by Chappell, before it bought BHS in March 2015. Paul Budge, Arcadia\u2019s finance director, said: \u201cWe actually asked them to make sure that they deposit \u00a335m with Olswang [Retail Acquisitions\u2019 lawyers] in the Olswang client account to confirm their intentions. If we were going to go forward, sign up some heads of terms and give them a period of exclusivity, they had to do that. So they put \u00a335m into an escrow.\u201d Mishcon de Reya, the legal firm acting for ACE, confirmed the payment had been made by ACE. It said: \u201cIn February 2015 an amount of \u00a335m was transferred by Mishcon de Reya on behalf of ACE to the client account of Olswang against an Olswang solicitors\u2019 undertaking to repay on demand.\u201d Sources close to Arcadia said the group was unaware that ACE had made the payment on behalf of Retail Acquisitions at the time, but subsequently became aware of their involvement. \u201cBlack Jack\u201d Dellal helped to finance Green\u2019s takeover of retail group Sears in 1998. However, sources close to the deal said Chappell was an associate of Alexander Dellal and that was how the agreement came about. \u201c[Arcadia] didn\u2019t know he knew him,\u201d a source said. Following the \u00a335m payment, on the day that Retail Acquisitions bought BHS from Arcadia for \u00a31, ACE bought North West House, a BHS office building next to its headquarters in north London. ACE acquired the building from BHS for about \u00a333m. Two months later ACE sold the building for \u00a338m. ACE also lent \u00a35m to Retail Acquisitions in March, which was paid back when BHS sold its warehouse in the Midlands in August, and loaned \u00a325m to BHS, which cost the retailer \u00a36m in interest and fees in just three months. The profits from the sale of North West House and the charges on the loans mean that ACE collected more than \u00a310m from its dealings with Chappell and BHS. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by ACE. The company has said the various agreements were not connected and at commercial rates. The fact that ACE backed the deal raises further questions about whether Chappell had the financial strength to take control of BHS. Chappell has been declared bankrupt three times and had little experience of the retail industry. The Guardian revealed on Friday that a \u00a35m \u201cbonanza\u201d cited by Chappell to bolster his business credentials when buying BHS was an accounting estimate and not the cash payment he had previously claimed. Chappell had presented the windfall in the accounts of Olivia Investments, his family\u2019s holding company in Gibraltar, to counter concerns that the former bankrupt had little relevant experience when acquiring the retailer in 2015. BHS collapsed into administration last month with a pension deficit valued at about \u00a3571m. The retailer has been saddled with the deficit despite Green and other investors collecting more than \u00a3580m in dividends, rent and interest payments during his ownership. The retailer was owned by Green for 15 years until he sold it for \u00a31 to Retail Acquisitions, a consortium of little-known accountants and lawyers led by Chappell. Retail Acquisitions received payments of more than \u00a325m from BHS during its 13-month ownership of the retailer. Administrator Duff & Phelps is in talks with a Portuguese-backed consortium about a rescue deal for BHS. The consortium is being led Greg Tufnell, the former managing director of Mothercare and Burton, and the brother of former England cricketer Phil Tufnell. An announcement about a rescue deal is likely on either Wednesday or Thursday. Chappell did not respond to requests for comment.",
