  "body": "The daughter of a Hong Kong bookseller believed to have been abducted last year in Thailand by Chinese security agents has accused China of carrying out \u201cillegal operations\u201d beyond its own borders and urged the international community to confront Beijing over her father\u2019s disappearance. Gui Minhai, a Swedish citizen who ran a publishing house in the former British colony specialising in risque books about China\u2019s political elite, vanished from his beachfront home in the Thai town of Pattaya last October. Three months later the 51-year-old publisher suddenly reappeared in the custody of security officials in mainland China, promoting claims Beijing had snatched him, in violation of international law, in order to silence criticism of the Communist party leadership.  In a televised \u201cconfession\u201d that relatives and activists believe he was pressured into making, Gui claimed he had surrendered to Chinese authorities over a hit-and-run incident that had taken place in China more than a decade earlier.  Speaking at a congressional hearing in Washington DC on Tuesday, Gui\u2019s daughter, Angela Gui, called on the US to demand her father\u2019s release. More than seven months after his disappearance she said her father\u2019s precise whereabouts remained a mystery.  \u201cI still haven\u2019t been told where he is, how he is being treated, or what his legal status is, which is especially shocking in the light of the fact that my father holds Swedish, and only Swedish, citizenship,\u201d she said.  Gui said she had received messages from her father \u2013 in November and January \u2013 asking her to \u201ckeep quiet\u201d over his case but believed these had also been sent under duress. \u201cDespite having been told to stay quiet, I believe speaking up is the only option I have,\u201d the publisher\u2019s UK-based daughter told Tuesday\u2019s hearing. \u201cI\u2019m convinced my father would have done this for me, were I the one abducted and illegitimately detained.\u201d Gui said she suspected her father\u2019s alleged confession had been \u201cclearly staged\u201d in an attempt to \u201cfabricate a justification\u201d for his abduction. \u201cIn his so-called confession my father says he travelled to China voluntarily, but if this is true, then why is there no record of him having left Thailand?\u201d she asked. \u201cOnly a state agency, acting coercively and against both international and China\u2019s own law could achieve such a disappearance.\u201d         Angela Gui\u2019s testimony at a congressional hearing    Gui\u2019s statement was part of a hearing by the congressional-executive commission on China investigating what it claimed were intensifying Chinese efforts to silence its critics around the world. \u201cThe methods used by Beijing to enforce a code of silence are going global,\u201d Chris Smith, the Republican congressman who chairs the commission, warned. \u201cThe heavy hand of the Chinese government has expanded beyond its borders to intimidate and stifle critical discussion of the Chinese government\u2019s human rights record and repressive policies.\u201d China was now \u201cactively engaged in trying to roll back democracy and human rights norms globally,\u201d Smith added. He cited the forced repatriation of Uighur refugees and dissidents from Thailand and Cambodia, the harassment of relatives of journalists and activists and Beijing\u2019s denial of visas to dissidents and foreign academics who criticised China\u2019s government. Angela Gui called on the international community to demand an end to China\u2019s \u201cillegal operations on foreign soil\u201d. A spokesperson for the Swedish embassy in Beijing said that, despite repeated requests for access, China had not allowed its officials to visit Gui Minhai since 24 February.  During that visit he was \u201cfeeling well considering the circumstances\u201d. \u201cThe Swedish government continues to view the situation very seriously, and Gui Minhai has been mentioned on several occasions with high representatives of China, including on minister level,\u201d the spokesperson added. \u201cWe continue to request full clarification from Chinese authorities on what has happened to, and is happening to, our citizen.\u201d",
