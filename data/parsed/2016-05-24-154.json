  "body": "Ask those around the Golden State Warriors what Draymond Green means to them, and they say their undersized power forward \u201cgives us our edge\u201d. The rest of the team\u2019s top players \u2013 Steph Curry and Klay Thompson \u2013 do not let anger drive them. They win with confidence and savvy. Green is their fire. He is their enforcer. What he did to Oklahoma City center Steven Adams on Sunday night was not a basketball play. No amount of exaggerated flailing justifies an extra thrust of the knee into another man\u2019s groin. Even he seemed to understand that as he repeatedly tried to justify his actions while protesting that he didn\u2019t intend to hit Adams in the unmentionables.   Related: Draymond Green's kick to the groin was a metaphor for the Warriors' shock loss    Green\u2019s protests, along with the fact the game officials called Green\u2019s kneeing a Flagrant 1 instead of the more serious Flagrant 2, probably saved him from suspension. In keeping him on the floor for Tuesday night\u2019s Game 4, the NBA gave the Warriors their biggest break of the Western Conference finals. They allowed Golden State to have their \u201cedge\u201d in a game they almost have to win if they want to keep the dreams of a second title alive. The Thunder have definitely hit the Warriors hard in this series. Golden State had worried about this matchup, knowing how rugged and defensive-minded Oklahoma City had become. Through three games, they have not found an antidote for the aggressiveness of the Thunder\u2019s new style \u2013 especially down low, where Adams has gone from a center with big elbows to a more complete player who can switch on screens to challenge players like Curry and Thompson. Oklahoma City have taken open shots from the Warriors shooters. They have disrupted the rhythm of a machine that stormed through the regular season. The shots Curry and Thompson are taking now feel forced, pushed up a second or two earlier than they have all year, because the Thunder have been so effective at rattling their offense. Golden State absolutely needs Green if they are going to come back in this series. It\u2019s hard to imagine the NBA would have pulled him off the floor for Game 4. That would have been a near-death sentence for the league\u2019s most sellable asset right now. When under control, Green\u2019s fury is the essential ingredient that makes the Warriors work as well as they have the last two seasons. Curry is their spiritual leader, but Green is the player who will scream in the locker room and physically challenge anyone on the court. Golden State dodged disaster when the league didn\u2019t suspend him.   Related: Steven Adams interview: 'I\u2019m not trying to be a bad guy'    Green also may have helped himself in his reaction to the incident. He expressed regret after the game, and said many times that he did not mean to kick Adams in the groin. On Monday he told The Undefeated\u2019s Marc Spears: \u201cI would tell [Adams]: \u2018My bad. I didn\u2019t try to do something like that.\u2019 Honestly, I wanted to go up to him during the game and say that. But I know what type of competitor he is and I think I know how he would react. If he would have reacted the way I thought he would have reacted, I know what that would have done to me, as well. I just kind of erred on the side of not saying anything and was hopeful I may catch him after the game.\u201d He seemed genuinely remorseful for what happened, as opposed to Cleveland\u2019s Dahntay Jones, who didn\u2019t sound nearly as apologetic for hitting Toronto\u2019s Bismack Biyombo in the groin in Game 3. Jones was given a one-game suspension. Of course, Jones is a fringe role player and nowhere near as essential to the Cavs as Green is to the Warriors. He made it easy to be suspended. With his apologetic tone, Green gave the league that doesn\u2019t want him to miss Game 4 an out. In doing so, he just might have talked himself and the Warriors into a last great chance at getting back to the finals.",
