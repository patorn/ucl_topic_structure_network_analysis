  "body": "A former senior federal Liberal party official has branded the practice of funnelling allegedly prohibited developer donations to the New South Wales branch through the Free Enterprise Foundation (FEF) \u201cunacceptable\u201d. Michael Yabsley, who was the honorary federal treasurer of the Liberal party from 2008 to 2010, has admitted knowledge of the practice was widespread. In 2014 the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption found a range of verbal and documentary evidence that showed the NSW party was sending donations from property developers to the foundation and arranging to have them funnelled back. State law had banned donations from property developers from January 2010.   Related: A tale of two charitable foundations, and a flood of donations to the Liberals    According to an ABC report, Yabsley told Four Corners: \u201cNow looking back on it \u2026 those practices are not acceptable and should not have been acceptable in the past.\u201d Asked if he was aware at the time that donors who were prohibited from donating in NSW were being asked to do so through the FEF, Yabsley replied: \u201cIn a couple of cases, yes, and you know there we\u2019re talking about property developers, owners of certain licensed premises. \u201cYes, I don\u2019t think it was a great secret about the fact that that was happening.\u201d Asked about the lawfulness of the practice, Yabsley said: \u201cIt struck me as being something that had been happening over a long period of time, and there was no particular reason to suggest that it was unlawful in a way that was different with what had been done in the past.\u201d Yabsley said reputations of individuals, companies and major political parties had been damaged by controversies over donations. \u201cIt all points to the absolute case to do away with the system of political fundraising that we currently have,\u201d he said. According to the report, the foundation denied it had ever broken the law or breached its regulatory requirements because the gifts it received were not political donations and the funds were not subject to the direction of the original donor. Arthur Sinodinos, the party\u2019s treasurer and chairman of its finance committee at the time, has denied knowing that a \u201csubstantial\u201d amount of the $700,000 donated by the foundation had come from property developers.   Related: Political donations: Liberals provide list of those who gave to Free Enterprise Foundation    Sindinos told Icac he accepted no responsibility for the events. Earlier this year Icac reportedly advised Sinodinos that no corruption findings had been made against him. Icac has yet to bring down its final report. In May the Liberal party provided the NSW  Electoral Commission with a list of donors to the foundation after the commission announced it would withhold $4.4m in public funding if it did not do so. Asked about Yabsley\u2019s comments, Coalition federal campaign spokesman Mathias Cormann said they were state matters and referred them to state authorities. \u201cAll political parties need to comply with all the relevant laws,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rules are there for all to see, and all parties ought to comply with the rules.\u201d The NSW Liberal party has been contacted for comment.",
