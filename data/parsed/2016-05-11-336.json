The visiting Manchester United team bus was pelted with missiles before the game and their goalkeeper, David de Gea, targeted during the match, which ended in a thrilling 3-2 victory for the home team. West Ham said the behaviour was unacceptable and it would work with police to identify the perpetrators. Earlier, the club co-chairman, David Sullivan, appeared to blame United \u2013 and said match officials and police had been \u201ckind\u201d to the visitors by delaying kick-off by 45 minutes.  \u201cIt is depressing really,\u201d he told BBC Radio 5 Live. \u201cIt will be a late night for our fans and some of them won\u2019t be able to stay. I don\u2019t understand why United couldn\u2019t get here at 4pm. They could have got here early. They knew it would be busy. It\u2019s crazy.  \u201cThere was congestion in the street and they couldn\u2019t get the coach in. There were people around the coach, but there was no attack on the coach.  \u201cIf you check the coach there won\u2019t be any damage to it. If we arrived late at Old Trafford they wouldn\u2019t put the kick-off back.\u201d  West Ham promised to ban for life any supporters who are identified following the trouble and said in a statement: \u201cIt was an extraordinary night full of extraordinary moments in front of extraordinary fans, 99% of whom behaved impeccably and were a credit to the club.  \u201cWe have already had thousands of tweets and emails from fans to say how proud they were to be a part of such a special evening in West Ham\u2019s history. However, we are aware that there were some supporters outside the Boleyn Ground who didn\u2019t act in an appropriate way when the Manchester United team bus was damaged. \u201cThat was not acceptable and we will work with the police to identify those responsible and ban them for life.\u201d      A woman and a child are helped outside the ground.

Windows were damaged as bottles and other missiles were thrown by supporters. The decision had been taken to open the turnstiles later than usual before the kick-off and, with many more people than normal turning up to be a part of a historic occasion, there were worrying levels of congestion outside the stadium. Briefly, there was panic on Green Street as a crush threatened to develop. The 7.45pm kick-off had to be put back to 8.30pm.  De Gea had a bottle thrown in his direction after he celebrated his team\u2019s equaliser at 1-1, while a fan ran on to taunt him towards the end of the match. The fan was led away by stewards.

That\u2019s not for me to say but I think it was disappointing. We know it\u2019s a big game for West Ham. It\u2019s a big night for them, leaving the stadium, but I\u2019m sure West Ham as a club will be disappointed with what the fans have done.\u201d   The Metropolitan Police said on Wednesday that four police officers were injured during the trouble. No arrests have been made over criminal damage to the coach.  Three men were arrested during the game, including a 20-year-old on suspicion of affray and a 47-year-old and 18-year-old for pitch incursion.  Officers from the Met\u2019s Central Football Unit are examining CCTV footage and have appealed for witnesses.",
