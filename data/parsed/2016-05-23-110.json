In an interview with the Guardian, Scotland\u2019s first minister called for politicians to make a positive case for remaining in the EU instead of using \u201cfear-based\u201d arguments to convince voters.   Brexit explained: campaign rules   \u201cIt\u2019s straying into the territory of insulting people\u2019s intelligence,\u201d she said, referring to a Treasury report released on Monday that claims a vote for Brexit would plunge the UK into a year-long recession. \u201cLet\u2019s try and instil a bit of hope and vision and optimism.\u201d The SNP leader said the tone of the remain campaign, which is being closely coordinated from Downing Street, was reminiscent of the \u201cProject Fear\u201d strategy pursued during the Scottish referendum. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard it all before in Scotland of course. Sometimes you wake up in the morning and it feels like hearing the referendum arguments all over again. You take the Treasury report today, I think most people in Scotland are going \u2018yeah, yeah, yeah\u2019.\u201d While ultimately successful, the approach pursued during the Scottish referendum arguably led to a collapse in support for the pro-union Labour party, as voters saw it as too closely identified with the Westminster establishment making the case for the status quo. Sturgeon was speaking during a visit to London to meet her party\u2019s MPs and the new Labour mayor, Sadiq Khan. The trip was planned before stories emerged about her deputy, Stewart Hosie, who is standing down following revelations of an affair with a journalist, Serena Cowdy. Sturgeon said: \u201cThe issue with Stewart Hosie is a private matter. Many people from many different walks of life have marriages that break up and those are deeply personal, deeply painful, but ultimately private matters \u2026 He\u2019s decided to put his health and his family and his constituency first. It\u2019s a credit to him that he\u2019s taken that decision.\u201d Cowdy was reportedly also pursuing a relationship with another SNP MP, Angus MacNeil, and questions have been raised about his expenses claims for overnight hotel stays during that period. Sturgeon said she had seen no evidence to suggest a misuse of parliamentary expenses.  \u201cClearly any issues about breaching of expenses rules should be properly investigated. I understand that there have been references made to the parliamentary authorities and it will be for them to decide. But I\u2019ve not seen any evidence of any breach of any rules of parliamentary expense and I think it\u2019s very important to stress that,\u201d she said.  Asked whether she was concerned that the SNP might no longer be seen as separate from the historical sleaze associated with Westminster politics \u2013 given that these revelations follow continuing police investigations into alleged financial impropriety by two former SNP MPs, Michelle Thomson and Natalie McGarry \u2013 Sturgeon responded that none of the individuals in question had been \u201cproven to do anything wrong\u201d. She said: \u201cBoth of them [McGarry and Thomson] have chosen to step aside from the SNP while there are investigations ongoing. That\u2019s the right thing to do. \u201cWhat I\u2019m proud of is that the SNP right now is providing the only effective opposition to the Tories in Westminster. On a whole range of issues it has been the SNP \u2013 while Labour is tearing itself apart \u2013 that\u2019s been standing up against David Cameron and his government, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll continue to do.\u201d Sturgeon said Labour remained in \u201cterminal decline\u201d in Scotland, and the Conservatives \u2013 who leapfrogged Labour to take second place in recent Holyrood elections \u2013 remained far behind the SNP. \u201cThe Tories, by their standards, had a good night at the Scottish parliament elections. But they got 22% of the vote, they got half the number of seats than the SNP has at the Scottish parliament.\u201d She suggested the Scottish Conservatives\u2019 success was due to a combination of their leader Ruth Davidson\u2019s forceful personality and a fractured Labour party at Westminster. \u201cThe Tories\u2019 saving grace at the moment is always going to be that Labour is such a shambles,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Tories are quite rightly getting plaudits for doing that [winning second place] but it\u2019s more a feature of Labour\u2019s collapse.\u201d Asked whether Jeremy Corbyn had boosted Labour\u2019s popularity, in Scotland, Sturgeon laughed: \u201cFar from there being a Corbyn bounce in Scotland \u2026 Labour\u2019s support in Scotland depends on their ability to be electable. If they are divided and unelectable, what\u2019s the point?\u201d",
