  "body": "I was about 11, I think, when my grandparents took me to Stratford (-upon-Avon) to see Shakespeare\u2019s Henry VI. All three parts in two days. Throw him in at the deep end, they must have thought, with the least accessible \u2013 some say least successful \u2013 work. Hours and hours and hours of it, that will get him hooked. Obviously, it had the opposite effect. He \u2013 I \u2013 thought whatever was the late-70s equivalent of WTF, and from that moment on had a difficult relationship not just with the Bard but with the theatre itself, which has only recently shown some signs of improvement. It will be interesting then \u2013 Freud might agree \u2013 to see how I get on with The Hollow Crown: Henry VI Part 1 (BBC2, Saturday). And to see what director Dominic Cooke has done to bring a tricky work to an audience with a remote control in its hand. Taken the sword to it, that\u2019s what he\u2019s done. Chopped and changed, brazenly. We begin with a horseman galloping along Albion\u2019s white cliffs (to a modified quote stolen from another play altogether, Troilus and Cressida, you will have noticed, of course) now leaping over a bush of roses, both red and white: not the last we see of them, I\u2019ll bet \u2026 And that sets the tone: chopped and changed, galloping, leaping. Big chunks have been removed, Jack Cade\u2019s rebellion gone, lines redistributed. Henry VI Part 1 it\u2019s called, but actually that is dispatched within an hour: we\u2019re well into Shakespeare\u2019s Part 2 by the end of Cooke\u2019s Part 1. We need to be: there are the four three-and-a-half-hour wars of the roses plays (the three Henry VIs plus Richard III) to get into three two-hour televisions shows. Perhaps chopped isn\u2019t the right word, though. It suggests crudity, and this is top-notch swordsmanship, cut with great thought and precision to leave no scar. Some crafty re-splicing too; I like the action alternating between Talbot and Joan of Arc as they rally their troops before clashing in bloody battle. And between Gloucester\u2019s murder in the Tower and Margaret and Somerset\u2019s illicit hookup, so that a muffled death scream and a cry of passion melt into one. A bit Game of Thrones? Absolutely. As is the fighting (Joan skewering Talbot from behind could be straight outta Westeros). Then Joan\u2019s own grim demise on a pyre, drawn out almost unbearably. There\u2019s voodoo, too. And a falcon-cam. This is Shakespeare that hasn\u2019t just been trimmed down, it\u2019s been sexed up for a television audience, and there will probably be complaints from a stuffy old scholar or two. Not from me, though: I haven\u2019t even thought about that remote control. There are moments of great tenderness as well \u2013 it\u2019s hard not to shed a tear as Talbot cradles his slain son on the battlefield (\u201cmy Icarus, my blossom\u201d). Plus there\u2019s modern resonance and relevance wherever you look, like politics descending into petty personal battles and jealousies (the bickering dukes and earls in Westminster is pure last week\u2019s PMQs). Oh, and the language is rather good, too, even if you (I) don\u2019t understand every word of it. He could write a bit, couldn\u2019t he? And this is his worst work.   Related: Richard Eyre on the Hollow Crown's Henry IV: from the pub to the battlefield    Maybe there is a slight feeling that we are galloping (still) through Henry VI, to get to the main event, a winter of our discontent, Richard III, and Cumberbatch. Bring it on, though, all of it. I\u2019m enjoying the ride. And pre-Sherlock, there are loads of other familiar faces from the small screen, partying like it\u2019s 1439, giving it everything, giving it Shakespeare. Maya Cobbina QC, Superintendent Ted Hastings, Lord Grantham, DCI Gene Hunt. Actually, Ben Miles\u2019s Somerset is the pick of them, as steely as his sword. Henry himself isn\u2019t the greatest part, he\u2019s basically an early hippy (\u201cso let us continue peace and love\u201d), but it should get more fun for Tom Sturridge in the next one. One more shout out, and another tear for another Tom \u2013 Tom Beard, who plays Sir William Lucy, and to whose memory the episode is dedicated. It was his final part, he died last summer, aged 50. Tom was \u2013 Tom is \u2013 my cousin.     Wonderful \u2026 David Attenborough. Photograph: Daniel Hambury/EPA    Attenborough at 90 (BBC1, Sunday) was basically This is Your Life without the big red book and the big surprises. This is Your Life on Earth. Kirsty Young chats to Sir David about his life, about his work, and lots of people, some famous, some not, come on, or send messages, to say that he\u2019s wonderful. Fair enough, I suppose. He is.",
