  "body": "Barcelona\u2019s radical mayor, Ada Colau, faces her first popular revolt after rioting broke out on Monday night in the fashionable Gr\u00e0cia district of the city following the eviction of squatters from a former bank. Protesters have promised five more nights of confrontations. Police baton-charged demonstrators and fired foam-tipped rubber bullets while protesters set bins alight, overturned cars and smashed the windows of shops and banks. The trouble began around 10pm when a large crowd of sympathisers gathered in Pla\u00e7a de la Revoluci\u00f3 and some of them tried to reopen the bank that had been sealed up following the eviction. The bank was squatted in 2011 and since then has served as an ad hoc community centre known locally as \u201cthe expropriated bank\u201d. The owners ignored the squatters for several years. Last year Barcelona\u2019s then mayor, Xavier Trias, agreed that the city would pay the owners \u20ac65,500 (\u00a350,000) rent if they let the squatters be, although the squatters were unaware of this deal. Trias was facing re-election and, having been severely criticised over the demolition of Can Vies, a similar centre in the Sants area of the city, which led to five nights of rioting, he was prepared to pay for peace. However, Colau was elected mayor and in January this year she announced that it was inappropriate for the taxpayer to pay rent \u201cin order to buy peace during an election campaign\u201d. Colau, a long-time housing activist who had her own confrontations with the police before she became mayor, has spent her first year in office fending off attacks from the establishment and vested interests. Now she faces the ire of some of her natural constituents. She is deeply rooted in Barcelona\u2019s long tradition of grassroots militancy. One activist who has been involved with the expropriated bank told the Guardian that people were divided between those who resented what they saw as a lack of solidarity on Colau\u2019s part and those who understood the city could not intervene when \u2013 unlike at Can Vives \u2013 it was not the property owner.   Related: Barcelona mayor-elect Ada Colau calls for more 'feminised' democracy    Speaking on Monday, before the court order was carried out, Colau said: \u201cThe occupants have made it plain that they\u2019re not interested in any sort of mediation or alternative and therefore it\u2019s something between private persons that has been resolved in the courts.\u201d She said that although it wasn\u2019t the business of the city council to interfere, \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean we are trying to avoid the issue\u201d. In response, the protesters tweeted: \u201cAda Colau says it\u2019s between private parties \u2013 people without scruples, like her and the police.\u201d On Tuesday Colau condemned the violence but said: \u201cWe have to look at what\u2019s behind this, residents who are angry and defending a social space with roots in the community [that is] part of the fabric of the neighbourhood.\u201d She has offered to find the squatters an alternative location.  Catalan MPs from the left-wing CUP (United Popular) party have condemned Monday night\u2019s police action and called for the resignation of Albert Battle, head of he local Mossos d\u2019Esquadra police force.  \u201cWe condemn the police action,\u201d said MP Mireia Veh\u00ed. \u201cPolice repression should never be the response to political conflict. And if the foam bullets are a precision weapon, how is that some ended up on balconies?\u201d",
