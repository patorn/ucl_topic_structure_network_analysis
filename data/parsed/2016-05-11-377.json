  "body": "Gary Foley, in the words of artist Richard Bell, is \u201ca rock star of the Aboriginal protest movement\u201d. These days he is more likely to be found teaching history at Victoria University, but 40 years ago he was a long-haired whippersnapper with a microphone and a major figure behind the Aboriginal Tent Embassy. The embassy, which was first assembled by activists on the lawn of Parliament House in Canberra in 1972, still exists today, representing Indigenous Australia\u2019s ongoing struggle for land rights and self-determination. In 2013 Bell made a tribute to the embassy that has been touring the world. It is a green canvas tent bearing painted signs: \u201cWhite invaders you are living on stolen land\u201d and \u201cIf you can\u2019t let me live Aboriginal why preach democracy.\u201d During the opening weekend of the Sydney Biennale in March it was erected on the foreshore of Sydney\u2019s Museum of Contemporary Art, hosting panel discussions and screening documentaries such as Ningla A-Na (1972) and The Redfern Story (2014) which examine the tent embassy\u2019s legacy. Surrounded by some of Sydney\u2019s most expensive real estate, where foreign tourists mill about and snap photos of the Harbour Bridge and Opera House, it is an incongruous smudge of black protest on a rigorously polished facade.

He speaks to the audience without notes, in long, angry and affecting polemics about the endless struggles of the black rights movement in Australia. If he were a musician these would be his guitar solos, and he plays them with Jimi Hendrix-style conviction and flair.

Photograph: Document Photography    The genesis of the Aboriginal Tent Embassy was not in Canberra but on the noisy streets of Sydney\u2019s Redfern, the Aboriginal population of which Foley says ballooned from 1,500 to 35,000 between 1966 and 1969. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest Aboriginal community that\u2019s ever existed in the 80,000-year history of Australia and it came about because of the slow but sure breakdown of the old apartheid system,\u201d Foley says. \u201cAll of the people in Redfern in those days were landless refugees that moved from the rural areas in a big mass exodus to escape the concentration camp system that had been the old Aboriginal protection board system.\u201d For non-Aboriginal people, the slums of Redfern seemed a frightening place \u2013 a reputation that persisted well into the 90s and would only be shaken off when gentrification hollowed out the suburb\u2019s black soul. The diverse community, whose people hailed from different parts of New South Wales and disparate Aboriginal nations, struggled with extreme poverty, hunger, alcohol and drug problems. Archival news footage included in The Redfern Story shows an Aboriginal woman clutching a single white candle: \u201cThey were supposed to put electricity on,\u201d she says.  Foley says: \u201cThe one thing everybody had in common was poverty.\u201d But what the housing lacked in graces was compensated for by affordability. Redfern had good public transport and was a short walk to the CBD. Young Indigenous Australians would arrive from small towns, clutching a suitcase. The Foundation for Aboriginal Affairs helped usher them into this brave new world, including employment opportunities and offering a safe place to socialise on the weekends.   Related: Australia's painful journey towards indigenous rights    In The Redfern Story, Foley is filmed saying of the foundation: \u201cIt was a place to meet beautiful young Aboriginal women on a Friday, Saturday night ... the instant you left the foundation building and then preceded to walk up Regent Street back to Redfern, that was when you got harassed by the coppers.\u201d Throughout the 1960s and 70s, the Empress Hotel, also known as the Big E, was one of the few pubs in Sydney Aboriginal people felt comfortable to patronage. Foley describes it as a pub, \u201cso tough that even the police, when they raided it every Friday and Saturday night, would not enter by themselves. They\u2019d wait till there was enough police there and they\u2019d form a flying squad and burst through the doors and arrest everyone they could grab\u201d. Police brutality became fuel to the fire for a generation of Aboriginal rights activists. \u201cThe beginning of my political education was when I got a good kicking from a bunch of thug coppers in the Regent Street police station in Redfern,\u201d Foley says. One book destined to make a significant impact on young Foley was the autobiography of Malcolm X, lent to him by friend and future prominent activist Paul Coe. Not long after, Coe began a discussion group with a handful of young people in the community. They were furious over the endless and unwarranted police harassment of their people. Self-education, they decided, was key to change. They were inspired by radical wings of the American civil rights movement, including the Black Panther party, as well as the anti-war and decolonisation movements happening around the world. In those pre-internet days, a bookstore on Goulburn Street was one of the few to stock provocative literature. In groups they would sneak in: somebody would distract owner Bob Gould, others would lift the books. \u201cOne day he come to us and said, \u2018Look you guys, instead of nicking them why don\u2019t you give me a list of what you\u2019re interested in and I\u2019ll just give them to you,\u201d Foley says. One evening, Coe, Foley and friends Gary Williams and Billy Craigie decided to begin monitoring the police. \u201cPig patrol\u201d began at the most notorious site for arbitrary arrests: the Big E. \u201cWe walked into there one Saturday night armed with only three notebooks and pencils. And when the police started doing their usual animal act, we started writing down who they were arresting; we wrote down the numbers of their wagons, we wrote their numbers on their badges until they realised what we were doing and removed them.\u201d Conducted over six months, the more lasting impact of \u201cpig patrol\u201d was the 1970 establishment of a free legal aid centre, staffed by voluntary lawyers, to mount defence cases for Aboriginal people who had been arrested. The following year came the Aboriginal Medical Service, run by the indefatigable \u201cMum Shirl\u201d (Shirley Smith), and after that the National Black Theatre.

Photograph: Mick Tsikas/AAP    On Australia Day 1972, then-prime minister Billy McMahon stated that his government would never grant Aboriginal land rights. Deciding an immediate and impactful response was necessary, four of Redfern\u2019s young activists \u2013 Craigie, Michael Anderson, Bertie Williams and Tony Coorey \u2013 travelled to Canberra and planted a beach umbrella on the lawn in front of Parliament House (now known as Old Parliament House). They had established the Aboriginal Embassy. Over the following months the sole umbrella swelled into an 11-tent village (any more and it would have contravened the law), populated by young Indigenous and non-Indigenous activists from across the country, including Foley. A list of demands \u2013 ultimately rejected \u2013 was submitted to the government, covering land and mining rights, preservation of sacred sites and compensation for land dispossession. Forty-four years might have passed, but the Foley of today can talk about it with the kind of heat that would convince you it was just yesterday. He recalls: \u201cIt was a tremendous embarrassment for the McMahon government to be asked by the foreign journalists: \u2018an embassy inside Australia? An internal embassy? Is there an internal nation of people here?\u2019 \u201d   Related: Outgoing MP Linda Burney decries 'paternalistic' approach to Aboriginal affairs    On 20 July 1972, the government amended the law, allowing police to move in and forcibly dismantle the embassy. \u201cI mean they were never the sharpest bunch of politicians in Australia anyway, the McMahon government crew, but this particularly unhinged them. And it was that that prompted them in the rash decision to make us illegal and smash us in front of the eyes of the world.\u201d Foley says the Aboriginal Tent Embassy ended the era of assimilation, a policy which had been maintained by both Australia\u2019s major political parties since federation. \u201cThe whole idea of the assimilation policy was to make Aboriginal people cease to exist by turning us into white people in here,\u201d \u2013 Foley taps his chest \u2013 \u201cwith brown skin. We were supposed to, under the assimilation policy, lose all of those attributes that made us Aboriginal people.\u201d That assimilationist policy changed when then-leader of the opposition Labor party, Gough Whitlam, met with the activists. In hearing Coe\u2019s impassioned argument \u2013 essentially that \u201cassimilation equalled genocide\u201d \u2013 Whitlam quickly became their most high-profile ally. And while his ability to make their demand for land rights proved impotent once he was ushered into government, Foley maintains it was a \u201cremarkable and significant achievement\u201d. Foley is as scathing about the progress made since the heady days of 1972 as he is optimistic about the future. \u201cThe people who were involved in the Aboriginal Embassy were a small number of Aboriginal people, all [aged] about 18, 19, 20, and to all the young people who are here who believe that this is an inequitable and unjust society: we\u2019re proof that you can change the world. You don\u2019t need to be a university professor to change the world. I hadn\u2019t been to uni when I did that. We were all young, crazy, but we believed in a quest for justice and we achieved it.\u201d     The letterbox outside the Aboriginal Embassy in Canberra on its 30th anniversary in 2002. Photograph: Alan Porritt/AAP    His encouragement ends with a warning: \u201cBut when you go and change the world, don\u2019t be like us. Don\u2019t take your eye off the ball.\u201d  Successive governments have \u201cdeliberately undermined and destroyed the gains made in that brief period of history\u201d, Foley says. He talks of the heavy burdens his people continue to carry: the high incarceration rates, the poor health and life expectancy. In the intervening years Australia put a \u201cchip shop owner from Ipswich\u201d on the political centre stage, who together with the Liberal prime minister John Howard gave permission for middle Australia to let their racist tendencies run riot. \u201cWe took our eye off the ball after we changed the world, and the bastards changed it back on us.\u201d  He barks the last bit out with machine gun-ferocity: \u201cSO DON\u2019T LET THEM!\u201d It\u2019s the Foley equivalent of a mic drop. A few decades have passed since the \u201crock star of the Aboriginal protest movement\u201d sported wavy locks and groovy denim bell-bottoms, but he\u2019s lost none of his teenage chutzpah. Then he chuckles, and relaxes. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019ll say for now.\u201d  Richard Bell\u2019s Embassy is being re-erected at the 20th Biennale of Sydney 12-15 May featuring a new generation of Indigenous Australian activists",
