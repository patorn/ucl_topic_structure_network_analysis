  "body": "A man was shotdead in west Belfast on Monday night. The victim, in his 50s, was injured in the neck and chest during the shooting in the republican Divis area. It is understood he was a delivery driver and was targeted inside the car he was driving. He died later of his wounds. Local reports suggested that the man had been shot in the past.  The incident was the third shooting in the city in the past 24 hours following incidents which were believed to be so-called paramilitary punishment shootings. Earlier on Monday evening, a teenager was wounded in the legs in the republican New Lodge area of north Belfast. On Sunday night, a man in his 20s was shot several times in the legs. Newly re-elected assembly member Alex Attwood condemned the spate of violence in the city. \u201cWe must demonstrate the same resolve we did in the past \u2013 resist those who carry out these atrocities, who use guns to reject Irish democracy and ignore the rule of law,\u201d the Social Democratic and Labour Party assembly member said.",
