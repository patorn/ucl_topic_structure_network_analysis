The health secretary has demanded that the British Medical Association\u2019s junior doctors committee (JDC) agrees in writing to discuss whether Saturdays should become part of a junior doctor\u2019s normal working week as he agreed in principle to holding new talks following a plea from the medical royal colleges for a truce. The BMA committee will meet on Saturday to decide whether to agree to the ultimatum. Failure to do so would risk seeing the best chance of a peace deal to end their eight month-long protest campaign disappear. Hopes had risen that ministers, the doctors\u2019 union and NHS Employers will return to the negotiating table on Monday after three months of an increasingly angry and damaging impasse as both sides backed a \u201cpause\u201d initiative from leaders of the medical profession designed to break the deadlock. Hunt, the health secretary, wrote to the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges on Thursday, saying he was willing to pause the introduction of the new contract if the doctors\u2019 union agreed to discuss Saturday pay, the major sticking point. However, in a move designed to put the BMA on the back foot Hunt said that he would require a written guarantee from the doctors\u2019 union of discussing the issue a pre-condition of holding new talks. \u201cThis is a significant show of good faith by the government to break the deadlock,\u201d he said. \u201cWe now need the BMA to agree to negotiate on Saturday pay, the biggest single area of difference, in order for the talks to proceed.\u201d     Jeremy Hunt wants to discuss whether Saturdays should become part of a junior doctor\u2019s normal working week.

After Hunt\u2019s offer, Dr Johann Malawana, the BMA\u2019s junior doctor chair, said: \u201cJunior doctors have said since the outset that we want to reach a negotiated agreement, and have repeatedly urged the government to re-enter talks. \u201cAs suggested by the academy, we are keen to restart talks with an open mind. It is critical to find a way forward on all the outstanding issues \u2013 which are more than just pay \u2013 and hope that a new offer is made that can break the impasse.\u201d BMA insiders say the JDC, some members of which favour an indefinite all-out strike or mass resignation of medics, will have trouble agreeing to that and faces a potentially stormy session when it meets during the weekend. \u201cThe JDC will be a divided house,\u201d said one official. Saturday working has been a source of huge rancour in the dispute. Hunt has accused the BMA of agreeing in writing last November to discuss an expansion of junior doctors\u2019 normal hours as part of his plan to make the NHS a \u201ctruly seven-day service\u201d, but then reneging on their pledge. The union disputes that it ever agreed to do a deal on what it saw as a \u201cred line\u201d. The government has agreed to the request to pause in imposing the unpopular contract for five days from Monday and the British Medical Association has agreed not to call further strikes while both sides attempt to reach a resolution to the bitter eight-month dispute.  Tension may emerge over the exact scope of the talks. Hunt wants them to focus on Saturday working but the BMA is keen to change the contract so that it addresses the discrimination within it that the government\u2019s own equality impact assessment admits will disproportionately disadvantage female medics, especially those with children or who are lone parents, and those working part-time. Sources close to Hunt were unsure on Thursday night if he would countenance discussion of other issues, given that the contract has been in a supposedly final form since the end of March. But they also said that he would negotiate \u201cin good faith\u201d and may make some further concessions in order to allow a final settlement of a dispute that has seen over 37,000 operations cancelled and well over 100,000 outpatient appointments cancelled.

The government wants to reclassify Saturday up until 5pm as a normal working day, but the BMA says junior doctors must be entitled to a premium rate of pay for all weekend working, as they do now. There have been four more walkouts since the end of January \u2013 one strike was held while talks were ongoing \u2013 leading to the cancellation of tens of thousands of operations. Concerns about patient safety escalated during the latest round of industrial action last week, which for the first time was an \u201call-out\u201d strike that included junior doctors in emergency care. But with both sides at loggerheads, it was becoming increasingly difficult to see a way out until the academy\u2019s intervention. The BMA was refusing to return to the negotiating table unless the government lifted the threat of imposition, while the Department of Health would not back away from introducing the contract and said that the doctors\u2019 union must be prepared to discuss Saturday pay. The JDC meeting on Saturday was due to discuss ways of ramping up industrial action, including an indefinite walkout or mass resignation. BMA sources believe it will give Hunt the assurance he seeks so that talks can resume, but also seek to widen the remit of the discussions. In a letter to Prof Dame Sue Bailey, chair of the academy, Hunt wrote that the government remains committed to introducing the new contract in August but is willing to agree to a temporary suspension \u201cto play our part\u201d. He wrote: \u201cThe JDC have previously backed away from their own written agreement made through Acas to negotiate on unsocial hours and Saturday pay. \u201cIn the light of this I hope you can agree with our position that any talks should not proceed unless we have written agreement from the JDC that they will agree to negotiate substantively and in good faith on this single biggest outstanding disagreement and that they would ratify and recommend any negotiated agreement to their members.\u201d Hunt stressed that discussion must be focused on issues that were outstanding in February before talks collapsed and must not visit the \u201c90% of issues that were agreed\u201d.",
