  "body": "There are a couple of rules Hollywood studios have when it comes to making blockbuster movies these days, rules that are as absurd as they are well-established: 1. Audiences don\u2019t want to see a comedy with a female lead. 2. A woman can star in a movie only up to the age of 35. 3. No woman in a movie can be over a UK size 10. When I mention these rules to Melissa McCarthy \u2013 who made her film breakthrough at 41, is a US size 14 (UK 18) and now the most bankable comedy star in the world \u2013 she rolls her eyes and gives a what-century-are-we-in shake of her head. \u201cI mean, you just have to think, why not?\u201d she says. We are in a photographer\u2019s studio in West Hollywood, where McCarthy has just finished her shoot for the Guardian. She is feeling a little off her game today, suffering the early effects of a flu that will knock her out for the next five days. But I wouldn\u2019t have guessed if her publicist hadn\u2019t told me; aside from a slightly husky voice, there is no sign of frailty. She is eloquent and sparky, and the more we talk, the more her initial protective shield of uber-perkiness (\u201cHi! How ya doing? Cute pants!\u201d) comes down to reveal someone with genuine warmth. \u201cI\u2019m not normally such a \u2018done woman\u2019,\u201d she says, touching her eye makeup with a mixture of pride and self-consciousness more generally found in women who are not used to being the centre of attention. From the third highest-paid actress in the world (only Jennifer Lawrence and Scarlett Johansson currently earn more), it comes across more like an attempt to hold on to at least the image of normality. The truth is, McCarthy has been at the centre of the spotlight for a few years now, breaking those Hollywood rules over and over. After a successful TV career (Gilmore Girls, Mike & Molly), she moved into movies in 2011, playing the deliciously weird Megan in Kristen Wiig\u2019s Bridesmaids and getting promptly nominated for an Oscar (another Hollywood rule broken: comedies rarely get nominated for Oscars). Since then, McCarthy has proved herself not just the most bankable comedy star but also the best value: her movies make (a lot) more and cost (a lot) less than those starring, say, Will Ferrell or Jack Black. In three years, films such as The Heat and Identity Thief have made $792m, with an average film budget of $33m. Her position as queen of comedy (in what has been largely a boys\u2019 club) will be consolidated this summer with the release of Ghostbusters.     As Megan in Bridesmaids (fourth from left). Photograph: Allstar/Universal Pictures/Sportsphoto    New York magazine recently wrote that McCarthy is \u201cin the middle of one of the all-time great comedy rolls, akin to ones we\u2019ve seen in past decades from the likes of Eddie Murphy, Mike Myers, Jim Carrey, Adam Sandler, Will Ferrell, Jack Black and Ben Stiller\u201d (their inability to find a female comparison was both telling and, sadly, understandable). She has excellent comic delivery but she\u2019s also a critically underrated actor, one who immerses herself in character without a lick of vanity. As bridesmaid Megan, her absurd and sustained seduction of an air marshal (played by her real-life husband, Ben Falcone) made for the funniest scenes in the movie (\u201cHey, wanna get back in that rest room and not rest?\u201d). In The Heat, a striking comparison can be made between her and co-star Sandra Bullock who, in a scene in which the two women dance drunkenly in a bar, moves stiffly and maintains her perfect hair; the closest she comes to physical comedy is unbuttoning her blouse. McCarthy, on the other hand, throws herself into dorky dancing and waggles her bottom. I can\u2019t think of another actress working today who has so little concern for her onscreen appearance.    What\u2019s better to give somebody than a sturdy work ethic and reasonable confidence? I hope to pass that on to my kids    Some critics have complained that McCarthy always plays the same role, which seems even less fair than saying Bill Murray always plays the same role (and no critic ever complained about that). But if there is a McCarthy type, it is the woman who does things you pretty much never see a woman do on screen. There is Megan, who memorably has diarrhoea in a sink (not many Oscar-nominated performances can claim that); Shannon Mullins, the foul-mouthed police officer in The Heat, who lives in squalor and extracts information from male suspects by threatening to shoot off their testicles; Diana in Identity Thief, who beats up men while on the run from the law; Susan Cooper, the international spy who outwits all the James Bond wannabes in Spy; the eponymous sort-of heroine in Tammy (which McCarthy co-wrote with Falcone), who drinks too much and holds up fast-food restaurants; and now Michelle Darnell in The Boss, which she and Falcone also wrote, who merrily betrays her lovers and friends in a quest for corporate power. \u201cPeople say to me, \u2018These characters are crazy\u2019, and I\u2019m like, \u2018Are they?\u2019\u201d says McCarthy, slapping her hands down on the table in front of her, making the fruit bowl jump. \u201cBecause I\u2019ve seen three people in Rite Aid drug store act like that. I think when a female character acts more defiant, it\u2019s seen as a little more crazy. There are women in the world like this, we\u2019re just not used to seeing them portrayed. We generally just see The Pleasant Lady who stands behind her husband going \u2018Oh, Jack.\u2019 But I really love a female character who is not playing by the rules.\u201d     McCarthy wears vintage Victor Costa cape and Gaspar gloves. Photograph: Mary Rozzi for the Guardian    She says her new film and Tammy are her favourites of those she\u2019s made, which says more about her love for her husband, who directed both, than her judgment. Neither is bad, exactly, but they can\u2019t hold a candle to the slick brilliance of The Heat and Bridesmaids, both directed by Paul Feig. The Boss feels like a sketch that has been drawn out over two hours which, in fact, it is: she and Falcone came up with the character almost a decade ago, when they met in the legendary Los Angeles improv troupe the Groundlings (which also launched Ferrell). And, just like Tammy, The Boss has been loathed by US critics and embraced by the public. The New York Times begrudgingly wrote that \u201cMelissa McCarthy succeeded at the box office in The Boss, but just barely\u201d, shrugging grumpily at the fact that this small comedy made more money that weekend than the mammoth Batman v Superman: Dawn Of Justice. Similarly, industry website deadline.com called The Boss \u201ca warning sign for Melissa McCarthy\u201d. Did she take it as one? \u201cI try to read very little, as I don\u2019t want it to affect my work,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I do know that if Ben and I open a movie and make back our money in the first week, we\u2019re a bomb, and if someone makes back 1/18th of their movie it\u2019s, \u2018Bravo! What an unexpected weekend!\u2019\u201d she says, struggling to keep the sarcasm out of her otherwise determinedly chipper voice. McCarthy insists, somewhat unbelievably, that she has experienced no sexism within the movie industry, only from the critics. No director, she says, has ever suggested she change her looks \u2013 which would make her unique among Hollywood actresses. But it is true that critics have been predicting the end of McCarthy\u2019s career pretty much since she first emerged. There were complaints about her \u201ctiresome\u201d schtick, as the New York Times put it when reviewing Tammy, which went on to make a not-very-tiresome $85m in America. The New York Observer\u2019s critic dismissed her all the way back in 2013 as \u201ca gimmick comedian who has devoted her short career to being obese and obnoxious with equal success\u201d. \u201cI really feel bad for someone who is swimming in so much hate,\u201d was McCarthy\u2019s dignified reply. Today she says, \u201cI don\u2019t feel anger, I just feel trepidation when I think of my girls. Like, is this still really going on today? I guess it is.\u201d (McCarthy and Falcone have two daughters: Vivian, who is nine, and Georgette, six.)     In Ghostbusters (second left) with Kate McKinnon, Kristen Wiig and Leslie Jones. Photograph: Frank Ockenfels/Columbia Pictures    What really riles her \u2013 and she mentions this twice \u2013 is when critics \u201ctalk about the way Ben \u2018allows\u2019 me to look in movies. I\u2019m like, \u2018Are you seriously saying that?\u2019 There\u2019s so much wrongness there.\u201d In truth, I found only one instance of a critic saying that, in a review of Tammy, but it clearly unnerved her \u2013 so much so that McCarthy confronted that critic at the Toronto film festival last year, demanding, \u201cDo you tell your daughter she\u2019s only worthwhile when she\u2019s pretty?\u201d Yet it is noticeable that in all of her films, and especially those she co-wrote, McCarthy\u2019s characters are dowdy and often the butt of the joke. (In person, for the record, she is very attractive with a gorgeous smile.) Is it easier to find the comedy if she\u2019s playing a schlump? She looks a little miffed by the question, but valiantly keeps up the good cheer. \u201cFor me, it\u2019s the joy of acting. If someone said, \u2018The part is very similar to you and you\u2019ll look like yourself and basically behave like you\u2019, I think I would short-circuit. I mean, oh God, I\u2019m so boring! Let me play someone else with their tics and quirks, that\u2019s part of the joy.\u201d At this point, McCarthy is dragged off to a doctor\u2019s appointment and we arrange to meet a few days later, at what she prosaically refers to as \u201cmy office\u201d. This turns out to be something akin to a luxury apartment, with huge windows looking out on to the Warner Bros studio lot. Scripts keep arriving by courier, including, much to McCarthy\u2019s excitement, one for the reunion of Gilmore Girls, which she is filming in a few days\u2019 time. This is, without question, the office of a serious Hollywood player, but one who is doing things her way: there are brightly patterned wallpapers, Slim Aarons\u2019 photographs in the waiting room and, in McCarthy\u2019s personal office, a plush white rug and funky vintage furniture. \u201cBen and I always say, \u2018We\u2019re not running a bank \u2013 we want to feel silly and creative here,\u2019\u201d McCarthy says. \u201cWhere else can I make a room look like the set from Dynasty? At home, my little one would be climbing everywhere.\u201d     Vintage Victor Costa cape. Beth Ditto jumpsuit. Gaspar gloves. Alexander McQueen heels. Photograph: Mary Rozzi for the Guardian    It would be an egregious wrong to say that Melissa McCarthy got where she is today thanks to any man, but there are two men she credits in particular for helping her. The first is her father, Michael, a retired railroad arbitrator (her mother is a former secretary). When she was growing up in the small town of Plainfield, Illinois, the youngest of two daughters, her father would stand on the sidelines at school sports events, bellowing at her that she could win. Even if she was competing against a 6ft 2in athlete, he\u2019d tell her, \u201cYou have an advantage, your centre of gravity is lower!\u201d \u201cMy dad\u2019s attitude made me always like, \u2018Why not you?\u2019 So it just never occurred to me that being a woman, or from a small town, or not being some other being, made me not in the running. What\u2019s better to give somebody than a sturdy work ethic and reasonable confidence? I hope to pass that on to my kids. Not that they\u2019re perfect in every way, but they\u2019ve got a shot at it, right?\u201d she says. She is part of a big Catholic family, and grew up with \u201ctons of cousins\u201d. One of those cousins is Jenny McCarthy, the actor now best known for her long-running and very public contention that vaccinations cause autism. Does McCarthy share her cousin\u2019s views? \u201cNo, my kids have been vaccinated. But, um, whatever your stand is, you can\u2019t say that she hasn\u2019t put autism in the forefront of everyone\u2019s minds,\u201d she replies, with considered tact.    Four women doing Ghostbusters will destroy your childhood? I mean, really: I hope you find a friend    The second man is Paul Feig, who has directed McCarthy in Bridesmaids, The Heat, Spy and the forthcoming Ghostbusters, two of which he co-wrote, creating a part for her in each script. I tell McCarthy I interviewed Feig the day Bridesmaids came out and he said, \u201cI want to make Melissa McCarthy a star. That\u2019s where my focus is now.\u201d \u201cHe said that?\u201d McCarthy says, tears suddenly standing in her eyes. \u201cAww, that guy...\u201d Up to this point, Feig and McCarthy\u2019s collaborations have been pretty universally loved, but with Ghostbusters, which opens in July, they face their first potential fan backlash. Already, the trailer has received more negative votes than any other has on YouTube. Ever since the female-led reboot of the beloved 1980s comedy was announced, it has been vilified online, largely by manboys furious at the idea of oestrogen inside the Ghostbuster uniforms. The stars and Feig have been targeted with sexist abuse; notably less trolling has been directed at the male stars of other remakes, such as Jurassic Park or The Karate Kid. \u201cAll those comments \u2013 \u2018You\u2019re ruining my childhood!\u2019 I mean, really,\u201d McCarthy says drily. \u201cFour women doing any movie on earth will destroy your childhood?\u201d She shrugs. \u201cI have a visual of those people not having a Ben, not having friends, so they\u2019re just sitting there and spewing hate into this fake world of the internet. I just hope they find a friend.\u201d I\u2019m excited about the movie, I say, but I was disappointed to see that it recreates the one flaw in the original: the setup in which the one African American ghostbuster \u2013 last time played by Ernie Hudson, now by Leslie Jones - is the streetwise outsider to the three white scientists. She looks surprised: \u201cI think originally Paul had written me as that part and then he switched, so she could have been white, Hispanic... It was truly just a coincidence.\u201d I must look sceptical because she adds: \u201cHonestly, Paul was not sitting there like, \u2018Aha!\u2019\u201d She rubs her hands together and makes an evil cackle. \u201cAnyway,\u201d she adds emphatically, \u201cwe\u2019re not doing those original characters.\u201d McCarthy never intended to be an actor. Her ambition was to be a fashion designer and she followed her best friend, the shoe designer Brian Atwood, to New York to attend fashion school. Instead, at Atwood\u2019s suggestion, she gave standup a go, moved from there to acting classes, and then to the Groundlings, where she met Falcone.     With husband Ben Falcone. Photograph: Jenny Anderson/WireImage    After 11 years of marriage, McCarthy still smiles every time she mentions his name. The few magazine covers that hang on the walls mostly feature the two of them. She tells me she is glad she didn\u2019t become famous until her 40s, as that \u201ckept me steady\u201d, but I suggest that having Falcone by her side has probably been a bigger factor. \u201cFor sure,\u201d she nods. \u201cThe calmest, most reasonable, funniest man in the world.\u201d (Falcone clearly feels similarly content: his Twitter biography is \u201cBen is a happy dad and husband\u201d and then, as an afterthought, \u201cHe\u2019s an occasional actor, and directed Tammy and The Boss.\u201d) One of the rewards McCarthy has given herself, now that she has celebrity clout, is the production company she and Falcone run. The other is her longed-for fashion line, Melissa McCarthy Seven7, which goes up to size 24 and launched last summer. \u201cYou know, I\u2019ve been every size in the world, from a six to a 22 [UK 10 to 26] and it was mind-blowing how, at a certain size, clothes just became tarp with a hole in it. If I had to do [the red carpet], everything was so mother-of-the-bride. I couldn\u2019t ever put anything on and be like, \u2018I love this!\u2019 All I could say was, \u2018Well, it\u2019s on and it\u2019s not a garbage bag.\u2019 I was like, \u2018I feel bad. I feel bad about myself\u2019 and it just wasn\u2019t me,\u201d she says. Did it make her feel bad about herself in general? \u201cIt certainly took away my love of clothes for a long time,\u201d she says. Plus-size clothes, she says, are generally oversized, loose and dark: \u201cAnd that sends the message: \u2018We don\u2019t want to see you, and we sure as hell know you don\u2019t want anybody to see you,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I just thought, \u2018Why not?\u2019\u201d Once she decided to launch her own line, manufacturers told her the rules: plus-size women want only dark colours; they don\u2019t like patterns; they never wear sleeves. \u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019m the only woman in the room you\u2019re referring to, and I disagree with everything you\u2019re saying.\u2019\u201d Her line \u2013 bright, patterned, plenty of sleeves \u2013 has been well-received and is selling well. She walks me through the clothes in a room next to her office, showing off this seam, that piping, squeezing my arm with excitement. As an unexpected bonus, she says, finally having a wardrobe she loves has helped her give up \u201cthose crazy diets\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m not fun to be around when I\u2019m on those. I\u2019m cranky with my kids and I\u2019m sharp with Ben. I feel healthy now. It\u2019s allowed me to have fun getting dressed again.\u201d Her assistant comes in to take her away to the first of several meetings. \u201cAwww!\u201d she says. \u201cWe were just getting started!\u201d But she has to go, and gives me a big hug: there is a clothes collection to plan, and she and Falcone are preparing to shoot their new movie. After all, there are plenty of rules in the movie and fashion industries still waiting to be broken. And why not? \u2022 The Boss is released on 10 June; Ghostbusters is out on 11 July.
