Published in 1981 soon after John Lennon\u2019s murder, it was buoyed by the wave of nostalgia that ensued \u2013 the first stirrings of the over-the-top Beatles worship that is now an immovable part of popular culture all over the world. Norman delivered arguably the first literary look at Beatledom: the book divided their career into four parts \u2013 Wishing, Getting, Having and Wasting \u2013 and told the story in gleaming prose. But Shout! has one big drawback: a glaring bias against Paul McCartney, who was portrayed as a kind of simpering egomaniac, and a correspondingly overgenerous view of Lennon, who, Norman later claimed, represented \u201cthree quarters of The Beatles\u201d. Norman went on to write John Lennon: A Life. Now, eight years later, comes this new book, introduced with a blunt mea culpa. Norman\u2019s damning of McCartney, he now says, was a reaction to how much he had once not just admired him, but wanted to somehow be up there, in his place. \u201cIf I\u2019m honest,\u201d he now writes, \u201call those years I\u2019d spent wishing to be him had left me feeling in some obscure way that I needed to get my own back.\u201d Now, he has a more generous view \u2013 and so, with McCartney\u2019s \u201ctacit approval\u201d (assistance with sources and information, but no direct involvement) he has written the Lennon book\u2019s companion piece. Norman is an enviably skilled pen-portraitist, with a consummate ability to conjure the presence of \u201cthe left-handed bass guitarist whose delicate face and doe-like eyes were saved from girliness by the five o\u2019clock shadow dusting his jawline\u201d. He rightly observes that McCartney served as the group\u2019s courteous \u201cPR man\u201d, and had an air of \u201crefinement\u201d, partially traceable to his mother Mary\u2019s insistence on good manners. The fact she was a midwife, Norman points out, meant the McCartneys were viewed as being a few notches above their neighbours, though Paul was still looked down on by Lennon\u2019s stand-in mum, the comparatively bourgeois Aunt Mimi: the early Beatles story is not only an account of the evolution of rock\u2019n\u2019roll, but of the tiny gradations of the old English class system. A powerful sense of McCartney the man comes across in this book\u2019s evocative high points: the school years he spent, after passing his 11-plus, at the Liverpool Institute; the pre-marriage life of artsy urbanity he built for himself in St John\u2019s Wood, London; and the 10 days he spent in a Japanese jail in 1980, having been busted for carrying marijuana, during which time he apparently chose to avail himself of the communal showers and regularly \u201cled a sing-song of old standards his father had loved, such as \u2018When the Red Red Robin Comes Bob-Bob-Bobbin\u2019 Along\u2019\u201d. There are also sketches of McCartney and his late wife Linda\u2019s aptitude for maintaining family life in the midst of what other people might consider impossible circumstances: according to one long-estranged associate, \u201cI\u2019d never seen such great parents before, and I never have since.\u201d This is, then, a capably executed biography, brimming with detail. But there are also three big problems. First, when the story gets to the Beatles\u2019 rise and fall, the idea of telling the tale from McCartney\u2019s perspective tends to fall away; in its place we have a very familiar saga. Second, though Norman is good at placing his subject in the midst of various histories \u2013 of the Irish diaspora, Liverpool and the socio-cultural passage of the 1960s \u2013 he has a tendency to write about music in a register rather redolent of the op-ed pages of the Daily Mail. The Sex Pistols\u2019 \u201cGod Save the Queen\u201d is definitely not \u201ca shrieking parody of the national anthem\u201d, any more than Kate Bush\u2019s \u201cunearthly wail\u201d, \u201cWuthering Heights\u201d, ever made Yoko Ono\u2019s ear-shredding shrieks \u201cseem positively normal\u201d. These odd touches are also applied to his subject\u2019s career and work: anyone who knows what the term \u201cglam rock\u201d denotes, for example, would know McCartney\u2019s post-Beatles vehicle Wings were anything but.   Related: Philip Norman: 'John Lennon influenced the 20th century in so many ways' \u2013 audio interview    This feeds into probably the book\u2019s biggest flaw of all: its neglect of McCartney\u2019s talent. Perhaps the most baffling omission is any appreciation of its subject\u2019s astounding, trailblazing playing of the bass guitar. Similarly, there is not nearly enough attention paid to the compositional gifts that began to flower around 1964, and arguably reached their peak in 1969, with McCartney\u2019s underappreciated work on Abbey Road and Let It Be. There is an associated failure to get to grips with the underachievement that largely defined McCartney\u2019s later 1970s and 80s. Norman once lamented the gap between McCartney\u2019s output and what he \u201ccould do if only he would try\u201d; here, perhaps thanks to the shadow cast by the \u201ctacit approval\u201d of his subject, he simply describes one post-Beatles release after another, and tends to damn them with faint praise. However \u2013 and despite the 80 grinding pages devoted to McCartney\u2019s doomed marriage to Heather Mills \u2013 Norman still delivers an affecting study of a man too often misunderstood. The idea that emerges most strongly is that for someone who has lived such a surreal life, McCartney has long had a remarkable sense of \u201ceveryday\u201d morals. He ensured his first four children went to state schools, and was careful not to spoil them. His reported outbreaks of stinginess were probably traceable to the spend-happy chaos he witnessed at the tail-end of the Beatles\u2019 career, and are more than counterbalanced by Norman\u2019s reports of his generosity: the campaigning to save the local hospital in his adopted Sussex hometown, and the \u00a31m that paid for a new care centre; his footing of the $200,000 (\u00a3137,000) bill for treatment for the 11-month-old daughter of one of the Beatles\u2019 old comrades from their spell in Hamburg. To compare two lives that turned out to be so different probably isn\u2019t fair, but is telling: Lennon, by contrast, spent most of his last years cloistered in an opulent New York apartment building that had an air-conditioned room reserved for a collection of fur coats, and often did as he was told by astrologers and numerologists. In that sense, and others, for all its imperfections, this is a book that redresses a lingering imbalance \u2013 with the piquant twist that one of the people who so skewed things in the first place was the author himself. \u2022 To order Paul McCartney for \u00a320 (RRP \u00a325) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.
