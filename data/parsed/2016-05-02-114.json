Trump has switched positions or lied about his true feelings on virtually every single issue that has come up during this primary campaign. Yet for some reason, he keeps getting credited with having principled beliefs.  The latest example was in Sunday\u2019s New York Times, where columnist Maureen Dowd referred to Donald Trump as a foreign policy \u201cdove\u201d \u2013 or at least less hawkish than Hillary Clinton \u2013 because he\u2019s made a few comments, most recently last week, about not starting additional wars in the Middle East.   Related: Donald Trump's foreign policy speech proves: we have no anti-war candidates  | Trevor Timm    Dowd eventually undermines her own argument, since he is nowhere close to anything of the sort. Three quarters of the way down her column lauding \u201cDonald The Dove\u201d, almost as an afterthought, she adds: \u201cHe can sound belligerent, of course, saying that he would bomb the expletive-deleted out of Isis and that he would think up new and imaginative ways to torture terrorists and kill their families.\u201d That has to be one of the most ridiculous \u201cto be sure\u201d paragraphs in recorded history: Trump keeps insisting he\u2019ll commit a bunch of war crimes, but other than that he\u2019s as anti-war as they come! That\u2019s the thing with Donald Trump: every foreign policy position he\u2019s ever taken appears to be made up \u2013 just like his famous statement about being \u201ctotally against the war in Iraq\u201d, which Dowd also uncritically repeated. The only recorded comments from Trump before the Iraq war consist of him supporting it. The same thing goes for the Libya military intervention in 2011, which he also claims he was against, despite publicly stating at the time that he was in favor it. When he\u2019s not outright lying about his past statements, he\u2019s totally changing them: Months ago he claimed he\u2019d cut the military budget, but he now keeps saying he\u2019d increase it. He told the New York Times in March that the \u201cbiggest problem, to me, in the world, is nuclear, and proliferation\u201d. Yet he also said last week that the US should expand its arsenal, he wouldn\u2019t rule out using nukes against Isis in Europe, and he recently said South Korea and Japan should get nuclear bombs. Last Wednesday, he blamed Barack Obama for the Egyptian revolution that swept dictator Hosni Mubarak from power. But surprise, surprise: in 2011, he said Mubarak\u2019s ouster was \u201ca good thing\u201d and that Obama wasn\u2019t to blame for what happened there. It\u2019s not just foreign policy, though. Trump\u2019s domestic agenda is so riddled with contradictions that it\u2019s hard to find a topic upon which he hasn\u2019t totally flip-flopped. Last month, he had as many as five different positions in three days on whether to punish women for abortions. (Years ago he was \u201cvery\u201d pro-choice, but now his baseline is \u201cabsolutely pro-life\u201d.) He was once a vocal opponent of the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, and now he says that states shouldn\u2019t even be able to legalize marijuana. He was once an advocate for gun control; now he calls anything remotely restricting access to guns an assault on the second amendment. But Trump doesn\u2019t only tack right; he\u2019s moved to the left on other issues during the campaign when advantageous. He called social security a Ponzi scheme in his 2000 book, saying: \u201cPrivatization would be good for all of us.\u201d Now he says he\u2019ll \u201cdo everything within my power not to touch social security, to leave it the way it is.\u201d One day in October 2015, he said Ben Carson\u2019s proposal to do away with Medicare in favor of \u201chealth savings\u201d accounts was \u201ca good idea ... it\u2019s an idea whose probably time has come\u201d. The day after, he told MSNBC there\u2019s no way he would abolish Medicare. Even his well-known extreme positions were once completely different. Trump has notoriously claimed we should not let any Syrian refugees into the country. Yet the first day the Syrian refugee crisis made headlines, he was one of the only Republican candidates to say that the US had an obligation to help. Once his xenophobic crowds started booing, he quickly did a 180. On immigration, he met with Dream activists two years ago and left the meeting saying: \u201cYou convinced me.\u201d That was before he promised to deport 11 million people. There\u2019s more: H-1B visas, Obamacare, the flat tax, even his feelings on Monica Lewinsky. Google any topic that could possibly come up during the campaign \u2013 there\u2019s almost no doubt Donald Trump has held at least two positions on it. None of this seems to matter to his core supporters. His GOP opponents tried to criticize him for one flip-flop or another during the primary season, even his past support and good words for Hillary Clinton, and he vanquished all of them one by one. But it should at least matter to journalists reporting on him and pundits attempting to analyze his nonexistent positions.",
