  "body": "It seems fitting that the extensive celebrations planned for the 40th anniversary of punk have caused controversy, even if it\u2019s not the kind of controversy that punk caused 40 years ago.  Chief among the critical voices has been that of Joe Corr\u00e9, son of Malcolm McLaren and Vivienne Westwood, who has claimed the events have been \u201cgiven the Queen\u2019s blessing\u201d, and represent \u201calternative and punk culture being appropriated by the mainstream\u201d. This once radical movement, he said, is becoming \u201clike a fucking museum piece or tribute act\u201d. In response, Corr\u00e9 has announced that he\u2019s going to burn \u00a35m worth of punk memorabilia \u2013 an action that, rather winningly, has been added to Punk London\u2019s online list of upcoming commemorative events: \u201c26 Nov: Joe Corr\u00e9 burns his punk stuff.\u201d   Related: Happy Birthday Punk: the British Library celebrates 40 years of anarchy and innovation    Clearly this is just the kind of cocktail of recklessness, provocation and look-at-me self-publicising that his late father would have loved. Nevertheless, you could argue all night about whether Corr\u00e9 has a point, or whether the co-opting of punk by the mainstream happened so long ago as to render his argument irrelevant.  It\u2019s nearly 20 years since the Sex Pistols\u2019 1976 appearance on the Today Show, once a source of national outrage, took its place next to Benny Hill and Morecambe and Wise on a collection of classic Thames TV moments. You might also wonder where exactly Corr\u00e9 got his intel that Her Majesty is on board with, say, the Design Museum\u2019s fanzine-making workshop.  But even if you don\u2019t share Corr\u00e9\u2019s aversion to nostalgia, it\u2019s easy to feel that the story of punk has become over-told in recent years. That the movement has been reduced to a series of tired and occasionally inaccurate bullet points by endless BBC4 documentaries that are apparently obliged by law to cut from footage of an angry man standing by a brazier and rubbish piling up in Leicester Square in early 1979 to the Sex Pistols performing Anarchy in the UK on ITV\u2019s So It Goes nearly three years earlier.     Don Letts Presents Punk on Film is at the BFI Southbank in August. Photograph: Erica Echenberg/Redferns    Perhaps a slightly more complex, nuanced account of what happened in 1976 will emerge from all the events scheduled in London over the coming months. The centrepiece is probably Punk 1976-78, an exhibition that opens at the British Library on 13 May, featuring rare material from the collection of Jon Savage, punk archivist and author of the definitive punk history, England\u2019s Dreaming.   Related: Joe Corr\u00e9 on burning his Sex Pistols collection: \u2018It\u2019s the ideas that are important, not the memorabilia\u2019    Elsewhere, there are a multitude of photography exhibitions \u2013 certainly no one is going to be able to complain that they didn\u2019t see enough black and white shots of Johnny Rotten \u2013 of which the pick might be Anita Corbin\u2019s Visible Girls, a collection of photos of youth subcultures that includes new romantics, mods and rockabillies as well as punks.  There\u2019s also a film festival at the BFI curated by the musician and film-maker Don Letts; a weekend of music and spoken word at the Roundhouse to commemorate the Ramones\u2019 legendary 4 July 1976 concert at the same venue; and a special \u201cpunk strand\u201d at the Stoke Newington literary festival \u2013 presumably something to do with key player in the festival and \u201ccoolest librarian in the world\u201d, former Buzzcocks manager Richard Boon.  There\u2019s also a major exhibition at a venue yet to be confirmed, which purports to show \u201cthe lasting impact of punk on British fashion from Westwood to McQueen and Vogue to Vice\u201d \u2013 a description that raises the question of where the curators of Punk London think the movement\u2019s legacy resides 40 years on, if anywhere. \u2022 Punk London: 40 Years of Subversion, various London venues until 26 November.",
