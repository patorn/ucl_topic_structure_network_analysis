According to the public broadcaster ORF, Norbert Hofer of the rightwing populist Freedom party (FP\u00d6) was neck and neck on 50% with his rival Alexander Van der Bellen, a former Green party leader who is running as an independent. Postal ballots, accounting for 14% of eligible voters and expected to favour the left-leaning candidate, are being tallied on Monday, and a full result is not expected until Monday afternoon. Fifty per cent and one vote would suffice to hand the presidency to one of the two candidates. Data from Austria\u2019s interior ministry, which does not take into account the projected postal vote, put Hofer on 51.9% and Van der Bellen on 48.1%.

Initial exit poll results had shown a slender lead for Hofer. However, the economist academic Van der Bellen performed strongly in cities across the country, gaining 62% of the vote in Graz, 61% in Vienna and 56% in Salzburg.     Alexander Van der Bellen.

Hofer arrived at the FP\u00d6 party to enthusiastic chants of \u2018Norbert! Norbert!\u2019 as the party chief Heinz-Christian Strache paid tribute to his achievement. \u201cThe entire encrusted, failed system has linked arms with Norbert,\u201d he said. \u201cHalf of Austrians chose to take Norbert\u2019s path ... it\u2019s a new awakening! Today history has been made.\u201d Hofer, sporting a spotty tie and a pink handkerchief in his jacket pocket, said nobody yet knew who would be president of Austria on Monday, \u201cbut we\u2019ve made history. Eleven years ago this party had just 3% ... today every second Austrian voted for the FP\u00d6.\u201d    Related: Who are the two men competing to be Austria's next president?    He repeated the assessment of election observers who say that postal votes, which are still being counted, will be the deciding factor in the final outcome. \u201cIt could well be the case that after counting postal votes that we\u2019re not quite at the front, but I\u2019d say we\u2019ve won anyway,\u201d Hofer said.  He added there were only two scenarios: either he would be Austria\u2019s Head of State, or he would be supporting Strache in his ambitions to become Austrian chancellor in or before 2018. With the FP\u00d6\u2019s standing currently at around 35%, its chances of entering government are widely believed to be good. Hofer said he had been deeply hurt throughout the campaign by how often his disability - he walks with a stick following a serious paragliding accident - had been used against him. \u201cThey have repeatedly abused me, saying I\u2019m a cripple,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I tell you, the stronger the pressure they put me under, the stronger I become.\u201d  He then introduced his whole family, including his wife Verena, and his four children, before Marlies Grasser, the presenter of FP\u00d6-TV, told the crowds \u201cnow it\u2019s time to celebrate our dear Norbert,\u201d and the party leaders linked arms to sing the FP\u00d6\u2019s anthem, \u201cAustria Forever\u201d, while the crowds, bathed in a blue light, joined in, needing no prompting with the text: \u201cWhen I sing this song, I have tears in my face, but they\u2019re tears full of pride of which I\u2019m not ashamed\u201d.

Supporters from both camps celebrated the initial results. The mood at the FP\u00d6\u2019s election party at Vienna\u2019s Prater amusement park, close to the city\u2019s famous big wheel, was upbeat. Over beer and sausages, members sat amid balloons in the party\u2019s trademark blue and Austrian flags, glued to a large screen at the Alpendorf bar as the results came in. A folksy band sang Alles Wird Gut (all will be well), with the lead singer telling the cheering crowds: \u201cFor 25 years now, we\u2019ve held the dream of a new Austria and now we\u2019re so excited to be on the verge of finally getting it.\u201d On Sunday night, Van der Bellen said he had been moved in the two weeks since the first round by the Austrians who had mobilised to support him \u201cfrom across the generations and classes. That has carried me considerably and I\u2019m very grateful.\u201d He said that if he won, one of his first priorities would be to create more jobs. Austria\u2019s unemployment rate has doubled in the past three years. During a fraught election campaign that divided the country, 45-year-old Hofer and 72-year-old Van der Bellen clashed on a series of issues, including the refugee crisis and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership agreement (TTIP) between the European Union and America. The FP\u00d6\u2019s leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, accused the public broadcaster ORF of deliberately not showing the figures of the interior ministry, which had put Hofer in the lead. In a television interview, Hofer said: \u201cWhoever wins will have the task of uniting Austria once again. At the end of the day, we\u2019re all Austrians.\u201d     Norbert Hofer during the final election rally in Vienna. Photograph: Leonhard Foeger/Reuters    Asked whether, in the event of victory, he would try to appease his critics from abroad who liken the political mood in Austria to that before the rise of the Nazi party, Hofer responded: \u201cOf course it\u2019s completely absurd to claim that \u2026 it\u2019s just a baseless claim.\u201d The journalist pressed him: \u201cBut how would you try to convince them you\u2019re not extreme right as they claim?\u201d Hofer said: \u201cI\u2019d tell them that this is not a reflection of the facts. I\u2019d sort things out very quickly just by the daily contact I have with them. I\u2019d be able to persuade them they have nothing to fear.\u201d While the Austrian presidency has been interpreted mainly as a ceremonial role by the centrist politicians who have held the post in the past, there are fears that Hofer could use the instruments of the president\u2019s office to dissolve the government and usher in a chancellor from his own party, which is currently leading in the polls. Some constitutional experts question whether a president would be able to dissolve the government without presenting a plausible reason to do so. Poor results in the first election round for the two governing parties, the centre-left SP\u00d6 and the centre-right \u00d6VP, triggered the resignation of the social democrat chancellor Werner Faymann, who has been replaced by Christian Kern, previously the head of Austria\u2019s federal railway company. Austria is scheduled to hold its next federal election by September 2018.",
