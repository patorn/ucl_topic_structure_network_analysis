News that she had not been seen since early on Sunday morning immediately sparked alarm as reports emerged on Monday that authorities were concerned for her health. Police in the Chicago suburb of Wilmette released a statement on Monday in which they said they were \u201cseeking to check the wellbeing\u201d of the 49-year-old. O\u2019Connor \u201creportedly left the Wilmette area for a bicycle ride yesterday (Sunday) at 6 am (1100 GMT) and has not returned\u201d, the statement said. Worried messages were soon posted on the singer\u2019s Facebook page and concern intensified as it became clear there had been no reported sightings of O\u2019Connor for more than 24 hours. But she surfaced not long after, Wilmette police confirmed. A concerned caller had contacted police after seeing O\u2019Connor on a bicycle on Sunday. One report said O\u2019Connor was riding a Raleigh motorised bike wearing a black parka, black leather pants and a sweatshirt with \u201cIreland\u201d on the back. O\u2019Connor appears to have posted on her official Facebook page at around 9am on Sunday, addressing her adult son Jake and talking about her custody battle with her ex-partner Donal Lunny. But she also wrote a post on 14 May declaring that she was heading for North Carolina to take part in a protest about the new legislation there that dictates that transgender people must use the bathroom that matches the sex on their birth certificate even if that does not match their gender identity. O\u2019Connor has previously posted distressing updates on Facebook, including last November, when she wrote that she had taken an overdose. \u201cThere is only so much any woman can be expected to bear,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhat was done to me this week was appalling cruelty. \u201cThe last two nights finished me off. I have taken an overdose. There is no other way to get respect. I am not at home, I\u2019m at a hotel, somewhere in Ireland, under another name.\u201d O\u2019Connor was later found safe. The singer has opened up about her struggles with suicidal thoughts in the past. In 2007, she told Oprah Winfrey that she had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and attempted suicide on her 33rd birthday. In recent weeks, she became embroiled in controversy after the death of Prince, who wrote her breakthrough hit Nothing Compares 2 U. The talkshow host Arsenio Hall filed a $5m lawsuit against O\u2019Connor after she posted on Facebook to allege that Hall had given Prince drugs \u201cover the decades\u201d. She said she had reported Hall to the Carver County sheriff\u2019s office in Minnesota, which is investigating Prince\u2019s death, and that \u201canyone imagining Prince was not a longtime hard drug user is living in cloudcuckooland\u201d.  O\u2019Connor had been living in Wilmette, on the northern outskirts of Chicago, since February, according to a report in the Chicago Tribune.  The singer has performed at least twice in Chicago this year, with blues legend Buddy Guy in January and at a cancer charity fundraiser at the Metro Chicago theater in March. O\u2019Connor has recorded 10 solo albums, and became a global star in the early 1990s, but she has never been a stranger to controversy. She memorably tore apart a photo of Pope John Paul II during Saturday Night Live in 1992, declaring: \u201cFight the real enemy!\u201d  The Associated Press contributed to this report",
