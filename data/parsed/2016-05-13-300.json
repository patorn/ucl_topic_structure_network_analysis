It was a new world to me.\u201d The architect Luis Miguel Velez Wiesner is recalling the first time he set foot in Santo Domingo, one of Colombia\u2019s most notorious comunas (slums), when the Medell\u00edn cable car opened in 2004. \u201cThe first time, I felt like I was going to be kidnapped. Now it\u2019s quite different \u2013 there are lots of places to eat and shop. It feels safe now.\u201d For intrepid residents such as Wiesner, stepping off the cable car to enter the once out of bounds \u201cother side\u201d of Medell\u00edn, was a seminal moment in the history of their city. Their photos in front of Giancarlo Mazzanti\u2019s dramatic new Espa\u00f1a library in Santo Domingo sent an altogether different image of Medell\u00edn to the world. The long-entrenched division between the gridded city in the valley and the informal settlements on the hills was finally disappearing. The world\u2019s most dangerous city had become accessible, and safe. \u201cI always lived in a gated compound,\u201d Wiesner says. \u201cWhen we were young, my mother was afraid when we had to leave the house. We were in a shopping mall once when a bomb exploded. It was quite normal. It\u2019s really different now though \u2013 they\u2019re not shooting everyone, everywhere.\u201d Medell\u00edn\u2019s revival is a story of dynamic interplays between key figures on either side of the divide \u2013 not least mayors Luis Perez, Sergio Fajardo and Alonso Salazar, and the drug lords Pablo Escobar and Don Berna \u2013 and of radical experiments in urban planning and participatory forms of governance.

It might seem a little unorthodox to consider one of the world\u2019s most powerful and violent criminals an urban planner, but to ignore his role in the story of Medell\u00edn\u2019s development would be to grossly distort history. Escobar and his cartels helped set the conditions for urban change to happen. They led Medell\u00edn to the brink of disaster, then demanded it change. In 1982, Escobar launched his \u201cMedell\u00edn Without Slums\u201d programme \u2013 a politically motivated but nonetheless heartfelt campaign to rid the city of its slums and provide a \u201clife of noble dignity\u201d for the urban poor who, in Escobar\u2019s words, had been living in an \u201cinferno of garbage\u201d. Besides increasing his popularity, power and even election-winning potential \u2013 Escobar was elected to Colombia\u2019s house of representatives for a brief period in 1982, before his associations with drug trafficking had him expelled \u2013 Medell\u00edn Without Slums was the first effort to make change for the poor from within. Through it, Escobar \u2013 who was eventually shot and killed by security forces in December 1993 \u2013 gave the city\u2019s comunas a political voice and a vehicle through which to demand change. He radicalised, politicised and militarised the poor, turning them against the citizens of the formal city in all-out civil war. Escobar\u2019s legacy, in planning terms, was this transformation of the spatial divide between formal and informal territories, between rich and poor, into a violent opposition of territories.

Photograph: Alamy    At one point, Medell\u00edn was the most dangerous city on earth. From 1990 to 1993, more than 6,000 people were murdered annually, and not just in the slums. Drive-by shooting was regular and indiscriminate. The accounts of suffering and violence are truly obscene \u2013 not simply of warfare between gang lords and drug criminals, but of children being tortured and mutilated for accidentally crossing an invisible territorial boundary, of growing up with homicides taking place in their bedrooms, of bullets flying through their curtains at dinner. The need for change was urgent \u2013 and perhaps only such extreme conditions could have led to such radical urban experimentation. According to Colombian architect and UCL lecturer Catalina Ortiz, who worked on Medell\u00edn\u2019s strategic city plans of 2005 and 2013 under Mayor Fajardo, the critical moment came a quarter of a century ago. \u201cFor me, 1991 was a key turning point for the whole country. It was the worst and the best moment \u2013 a time of complete crisis and a moment of hope,\u201d Ortiz says. \u201cIt was truly a moment where everyone felt it could not get any worse \u2013 we had to do something.\u201d    Medell\u00edn\u2019s security issues could not be dealt with through policy measures alone  Catalina Ortiz     The country\u2019s new constitution, ratified that year, gave greater independence to local governments to elect their own leaders, offering more control over urban development to local people with local knowledge and expertise. It was also the moment when the national government, with international support from the United Nations, started to intervene in Medell\u00edn, dismantling and demobilising guerrilla paramilitary groups. \u201cThe interest of the national government was an acknowledgement that the situation was out of control,\u201d Ortiz explains. \u201cThey recognised that governance in Medell\u00edn had been lost.\u201d But this was also a key moment for urban planning \u2013 the point at which the city\u2019s issues were considered a matter of urban design. \u201cThe government recognised that Medell\u00edn\u2019s security issues could not be dealt with through policy measures alone. It was the point at which the governing entities started to recognise and address the urban context of the problem,\u201d Ortiz says.

Photograph: Raul Arboleda/AFP/Getty Images    Medell\u00edn\u2019s authorities started a series of radical programmes to reorganise the social fabric of the comunas and mobilise the poor. The city\u2019s planners began addressing its endemic violence and inequity through the design of public spaces, transit infrastructure and urban interventions into the slums. Key to their approach was a commitment to the public realm as a truly shared space, and a faith that they could transform Medell\u00edn\u2019s public spaces from sites of segregation and warfare into spaces where communities would come together. But Medell\u00edn\u2019s social urbanism stretches way beyond the more modest experiments with participatory planning and community consultation that are now vogue in cities across the globe. The sheer enormity and complexity of the issues here demanded something unique \u2013 an urbanism of inclusion, where the dispossessed became partners in driving urban change. Influenced by European regeneration models, notably in Barcelona, Medell\u00edn\u2019s 1995 and 1999 strategic plans set a new agenda for the city. \u201cThey redefined the realm of what \u2018public work\u2019 is. Participatory planning became a key question of social equity,\u201d Ortiz explains. In 1998, it became constitutional law in Colombia that every municipality had to develop a masterplan, and that planning could not happen without social participation. Into this situation parachuted mayor Fajardo and the architect Alejandro Echeverri. Fajardo surrounded himself by a team of experts and specialists at his Urban Development Corporation (EDU), working with architects, planners, engineers and sociologists to collectively manage Medell\u00edn\u2019s change. On many projects, the design team worked with a \u201cman on the ground\u201d \u2013 a community representative who was mouthpiece and interpreter for the community in which interventions were being proposed.     Cable cars and escalators now carry tens of thousands of people a day between Medell\u00edn\u2019s comunas and the city centre. Photograph: imagebroker/Alamy    Echeverri says this level of collaboration and integration of professions and disciplines was fundamental to the success of Medell\u00edn\u2019s projects \u2013 which meant also having to \u201ccall on the bad guys\u201d to help. He explains: \u201cOften the person we needed to deliver the plan was one of the bad guys, part of the problem.\u201d In a context as divided and oppositional as this, where the establishment was hated and figures of authority treated with distrust, the gulf between the rich and the poor, the authority and the individual, had to be bridged through joint decision-making and co-design. Unlike previous political figures, Fajardo was often present at community meetings in the comunas. His team held \u201cimagination workshops\u201d in which comuna dwellers were given the opportunity to imagine alternatives; to redesign where they lived. The EDU achieved a truly integrated form of participatory planning, establishing a common ground between once warring factions and a common will to make change.  The projects were seen as chains of interventions that stitched the city together. Integrated mobility systems consisting of elevated metros, cable cars, bridges and escalators were planned to keep the city moving and link previously disconnected neighbourhoods. These were accompanied by socially minded, architectural-scale interventions in the poorest areas: libraries, community buildings and cultural centres \u2013 places for people to come together, interact and learn. Fajardo invested in Medell\u00edn\u2019s civic centre as well as the slums; a two-pronged approach that legitimated the previously neglected comunas by treating them as equal parts of the whole city. Architecturally, one of Echeverri\u2019s major successes was striking a balance between the embedded and the iconic \u2013 integrating spaces, places and systems into the social fabric of the city on the one hand, while also creating buildings of international quality which would be photographed again and again.     Former mayor Sergio Fajardo focused on developing downtown Medell\u00edn as well as the comunas. Photograph: Alamy    But as well as sending a new image of the city to the world, changing its reputation and attracting a tourist economy, there is a more subtle design intelligence at play here. Watching people slide up and down the brightly coloured escalators in Comuna 13 (still believed to be one of Medell\u00edn\u2019s most dangerous comunas), with their decorative metal canopies, air-conditioning and soft music, set against the haphazard irregularity of the slum, is a collision of worlds. And perhaps this is key to the success of the projects: bringing two alien worlds together and forcing them to interact, adjust to one another, and forge a new identity.  Fajardo was something of a political anomaly. A maths professor with no previous background in politics, he managed to overcome the traditional political parties, all rife with corruption, to become mayor in 2003 with no tarnish. He used this autonomy well, entering political and spatial territories that were previously out of bounds. His independence enabled people to accept him and get to know him \u2013 the new mayor from nowhere who walked in the city\u2019s slums. Many explain Medell\u00edn\u2019s relative stability between 2003 and 2009 as thanks to an accord between the city\u2019s two independent leaders, Fajardo and drug lord Don Berna \u2013 both of whom commanded peace and calm from different sides of Medell\u00edn\u2019s divide. In establishing the EDU, Fajardo instigated a bureaucratic independence \u2013 free of Medell\u00edn\u2019s corrupt and inefficient ways \u2013 that was key to the city\u2019s successes. This independence allowed the EDU to look freely at the city as a whole, enabling its experimental and visionary approach that exceeded what previous authorities had achieved. In this, it is a lesson to cities around the world of the importance of independent design bureaus working alongside local authorities.

A unique institution, the EPM is owned by the city municipality, and is a wealthy institution that exports energy to the rest of Colombia and other parts of South America too. The 1991 constitution decided that the EPM would contribute 30% of its profit to the city for municipal use \u2013 a crucial source of funding that subsequent mayors have been able to use to power their urban interventions.  \u201cSeveral entities were crucial for physical change in Medell\u00edn,\u201d Ortiz says. \u201cThe centralised agencies of the state, with their strategic city plans, and the semi-autonomous entities like the EDU and EPM, who had less accountability.\u201d But also key to Medell\u00edn\u2019s transformation was an attitude towards urbanism as a tool for promoting social mobility and equity \u2013 a process in which comuna dwellers became clients, participants and stakeholders in the city, with the chance to design their own destiny. This approach succeeded in crossing boundaries where political policy, social strategy, policing and corruption had previously failed. The city transformed itself by allowing the people to stitch it back together themselves.
