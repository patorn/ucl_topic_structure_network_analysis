  "body": "Former Miles Davis and current Keith Jarrett drummer Jack DeJohnette\u2019s decisive energies and musicality make him, at 73, one of the marvels of contemporary jazz. This trio joins him with John Coltrane\u2019s saxophonist son Ravi, and bass guitarist Matthew Garrison, son of Coltrane Sr\u2019s quartet bassist Jimmy Garrison. Classic covers include the Coltrane civil rights hymn Alabama and the dreamy Kind of Blue ballad Blue in Green, but this is a thoroughly contemporary set in its fusion of Ravi Coltrane\u2019s lyricism (often on the piercing, silvery-toned sopranino sax), Garrison\u2019s rockish bass sound and electronics, and DeJohnette\u2019s dramatic punctuation.          Watch video for Jack DeJohnette Made in Chicago    Alabama wells up from deep in Coltrane\u2019s tenor sax against Garrison\u2019s rolling bass-guitar line. Blue in Green is a quietly abstract dialogue for Coltrane on sopranino and DeJohnette on piano. Earth Wind and Fire\u2019s Serpentine Fire funkily glimpses the DeJohnette of Miles Davis\u2019s Bitches Brew era, and Rashied is a scalding free-jazz drums/sax exchange with Coltrane at his most whoopingly uninhibited. It\u2019s a partnership that gets the best out of its powerful participants.",
