  "body": "Cycling into the office the other day my eye was caught by the bike of a fellow rider. It was a proper head-turner \u2013 anodised paint job, tapered carbon forks, T-section top tube \u2013 and a brand I hadn\u2019t heard of: Bowman. I guessed it was one of those poncey pricey frames that bankrupt you and then leave you too terrified to actually enjoy it. But it turns out Bowman builds rugged, rideable frames for the year-round, no-nonsense cyclist. The firm is the brainchild of Neil Webb who, after 20 years in the industry, decided to go it alone. His bikes are designed at his base on the outskirts of southeast London and then built in Taiwan. There are currently five models, each named after a landmark familiar to cyclists in the southeast\u2013 Palace, Pilgrims, Foots Cray and Layhams. This one is the Pilgrims (named after the Pilgrims\u2019 Way). It features generous \u2018RoadPlus\u2019 geometry which gives you the clearance to fit wider tyres or mudguards so you can swap in bigger rubber and turn off the road to tackle trails. In all you\u2019ll get bespoke looks for Sundays, but a sturdy worker for weekdays (Bowman Cyles).

Photograph: Alamy    Anyone who has enjoyed the thrill of escaping the city traffic and heading out into the open countryside on two wheels has also probably experienced the frustration of having a puncture or a mechanical in the middle of nowhere. It\u2019s important to be able to look after your cycle \u2013 both before and during a ride \u2013 and Halfords are running free workshops for women for the rest of this month and in June. Book yourself into one at your local Halfords and learn the basics of bike maintenance. Next time you break down and get yourself home, you\u2019ll be very pleased you did.
