  "body": "The $10m defamation suit against Hollywood producer Lee Daniels by actor Sean Penn has been settled, with Daniels apologizing for insinuating Penn abused his ex-wife Madonna and paying to the charity Penn founded.  \u201cI am so sorry that I have hurt you, Sean, and I apologize and retract my reckless statements about you. How thoughtless of me. You are someone I consider a friend, a brilliant actor and true Hollywood legend and humanitarian,\u201d said the director of The Butler and Precious, in a joint statement released on Wednesday. Penn slapped Daniels with a $10m defamation suit last September, after the creator of hip-hop royalty television show Empire spoke about how actor Terrence Howard received intense criticism for admitting he\u2019d punched his ex-wife. Daniels told the Hollywood Reporter Howard \u201cain\u2019t done nothing different than Marlon Brando or Sean Penn, and all of a sudden he\u2019s some fucking demon\u201d.   Related: Sean Penn's El Chapo interview 'horribly misguided' says Cartel author    Rumors had swirled for years that Penn had been violent towards Madonna during their marriage, after the singer once called the Los Angeles police department to their home in 1988. However, Madonna provided a sworn affidavit to the Penn side that \u201cSean has never struck me, \u2018tied me up,\u2019 or physically assaulted me, and any report to the contrary is completely outrageous, malicious, reckless, and false.\u201d In his statement Daniels noted that it was \u201cwrong to reference gossip as fact, as I did here. That can be very damaging and hurtful. \u201cDomestic violence is a very serious issue,\u201d he added. \u201cMy comments were cavalier; it was not my intention to diminish the severity of the issue, but rather to express a view regarding the disparate treatment of men of color in our national conversation.\u201d In response, Penn said: \u201cI accept Lee\u2019s heartfelt apology and appreciate the sincerity with which it was delivered.\u201d Penn also thanked Daniel\u2019s \u201cgenerous\u201d donation to J/P Haitian Relief Organization, the charity Penn founded, noting the money \u201cwill have a transformative effect on the lives of those we serve in Haiti\u201d. It\u2019s unknown how large the settlement and donation was. Penn\u2019s lawyer, Mathew Rosengart of Greenberg Traurig in Los Angeles, declined to comment when contacted by the Guardian. Daniels\u2019 lawyer, James Sammataro of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, was away on leave.",
