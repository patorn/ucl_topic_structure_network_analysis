  "body": "Invictus: the Road to\u00a0the Games 7pm, BBC1 The Invictus Games return this Sunday, showcasing international teams of armed services personnel moving forward after life-changing injuries or illnesses. The 2016 Games take\u00a0place in Orlando with 15\u00a0countries competing in 10\u00a0events, from archery to wheelchair basketball. Nick\u00a0Knowles launches the\u00a0BBC\u2019s coverage by shadowing competitors hoping to secure their place in the UK squad, while founding patron Prince Harry catches up with some London 2014 veterans. Graeme Virtue Posh Neighbours at War 7.30pm, Channel 4 This documentary about disputes between top tax bracketees opens with a proper Kensington kerfuffle. Zipporah Lisle-Mainwaring has painted her home in a manner befitting a barber\u2019s pole, setting neighbourhood curtains a-twitching. Meanwhile, Notting Hill resident (and sibling of Boris) Rachel Johnson bemoans living alongside a\u00a0basement build. Viewers arriving home to a bucketful of bills may wish they had set enough money aside to\u00a0purchase the world\u2019s smallest violin. Mark Gibbings-Jones MasterChef: the Finals 8.30pm, BBC1 Stripped across the week, the last five contestants standing must cook ever-more impressive things, adding flourish and flavour while retaining the basic principles of cooking, or else\u00a0Baldy and Jowly will frown. Tonight, the five travel to Bristol\u2019s Old Vic theatre to whip up dramatic delights for five leading actors. Then, back to the stainless-steel persecution kitchen to produce a personally inspired dish before one of them is eliminated and left in a wheelie bin in the car park. Julia Raeside Veep 10pm, Sky Atlantic A double bill to kick off season five, with Julia Louis-Dreyfus\u2019s unceasingly and hilariously obnoxious Selina Meyer suffering a stress pimple as the presidential race produces a dead heat. (\u201cDidn\u2019t those founding fuckers ever hear of an odd number?\u201d) But could there be a recount in Nevada? Somehow she retains the loyalty of her fretful, ambitious staff, with even Amy back in the fold. The wit is as sharp as ever, while memorable calamities, including an all-white race symposium, abound. David Stubbs The Island with Bear Grylls 9pm, Channel 4 The latest marooning at the hands of adventurer Bear Grylls comes to an end \u2013 and the group are not in a particularly good way, suffering from a combination of brutal storms, insufficient shelter and not enough food. In a final push, the female competitors gather their energy for a last search for grub, while Simon leads a hunt into the jungle, seeking out the most dangerous predator on the island, the caiman crocodile. What could possibly go wrong? Ben Arnold Marcella 9pm, ITV The pace gathers in the fifth\u00a0episode of eight, with a\u00a0confession, more deaths, a\u00a0vanishing and a revelation that\u2019s bigger than all of the above. It\u2019s the kind of plot that leaves characters having to open scenes by saying, \u201cRemember \u2026?\u201d If you\u2019re keeping up, you might not mind that this whodunnit doesn\u2019t have the deft character work of creator Hans Rosenfeldt\u2019s masterpiece, The Bridge. Glassy views of\u00a0empty central London lend Marcella its tone instead: eerie, if a little hollow. Jack Seale Fear the Walking Dead 9pm, AMC from BT The zombie-related carnage continues in this entertaining prequel. While there\u2019s a lot to be said for his decision to put his family on Strand\u2019s boat, Travis\u2019s role as a general common-sense man able to fix things isn\u2019t without its issues. Meanwhile, a scavenging mission to some twisted fuselage reveals hidden talents in rehab regular Nick \u2013 and some nasty surprises for Chris. It\u2019s all gripping stuff, like an Alan Ayckbourn drama but with quality undead content. John Robinson TV FILMS Killer Joe, (William Friedkin, 2011), 11.25pm, Film4 Something evil stirs in deepest darkest Texas \u2026 Adapted by Tracy Letts from his play, this gruesome noir stars Matthew McConaughey as saturnine cop-cum-hitman Killer Joe, hired by a family of trailer trash to dispose of the father\u2019s (Thomas Haden Church) ex-wife and pocket an insurance payout; Joe\u2019s reward being comely daughter Dottie (Juno Temple). But when you deal with the devil, there\u2019s a high price to pay \u2026 Paul Howlett LIVE SPORT County Cricket: Nottinghamshire v Yorkshire 10.55am, Sky Sports 2 Last year\u2019s County Champions visit Trent Bridge. World Championship Snooker 2pm, BBC2 The final reaches its conclusion at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield. Premier League Football: Chelsea v Tottenham Hotspur 7pm, Sky Sports 1 Either a title decider or just a fiercely contested London derby, depending on Leicester\u2019s result.",
