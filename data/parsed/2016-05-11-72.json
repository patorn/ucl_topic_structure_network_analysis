Campaigners say women born in the 1950s will be left out of pocket by a government decision made five years ago to speed up the phasing in of an increase from 60 to 66 in the age at which women can retire. They have argued that protections should be introduced to ease the impact on women, for example by allowing women to take their pensions earlier at a reduced rate and thereby neutralising the cost of the change.  But, speaking to the work and pensions select committee, Crabb said: \u201cAs far as I can see there isn\u2019t a policy solution emerging out of all these intense discussions that people are coalescing around.\u201d He said he understood women who said they felt that they were taken by surprise by the changes but said it would be \u201cimpossible\u201d to unwind changes dating back more than 20 years. \u201cI don\u2019t see that there\u2019s a doable policy solution.\u201d  He added: \u201cIt is just fiscally impossible. And I think it\u2019s irresponsible of anyone in this House of Commons to try to pretend and lead these women on into thinking that somehow there\u2019s an easy decision to be made.\u201d    Related: Ministers accused of 'mis-selling' during debate over women's pensions    Campaigners have argued that the government failed to properly inform women about the changes. The Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi) group has lobbied for \u201cfair transitional arrangements\u201d. Waspi said it was surprised that Crabb had seemingly ruled out transitional arrangements without consulting them, especially as the pensions minister, Ros Altman, had said last month that she was examining ways to deal with the issue. \u201cI am disappointed, but still hopeful,\u201d Marion Smulders, a co-founder of Waspi, told the BBC. Labour said that by ruling out government action Crabb was slamming the door in the faces of women hit by what it called \u201cmishandled\u201d pension changes. Owen Smith, the shadow work and pensions secretary, said: \u201cThere is growing pressure from across the political spectrum for the government to listen to Labour\u2019s demands to bring forward protections to help those who are set to lose out.  \u201cYet today the newsecretary of state attempted to wash his hands of the issue. However, the Labour party has no intention of letting him off the hook so easily and we will continue to campaign for a fair settlement for the Waspi women.\u201d  Crabb also told MPs he would push ahead with the government\u2019s universal credit policy, shrugging off criticisms that it no longer served its original purpose of making people better off in work than on benefits. He felt optimistic that UC \u201cstill did what it said on the tin originally\u201d despite claims that Treasury cuts to work incentives meant that the flagship welfare policy had been reduced to a cost-cutting exercise that left millions worse off. In his first appearance before the Commons work and pensions select committee, Crabb said he had spent the past six weeks \u201ckicking the tyres and looking under the bonnet\u201d of UC and was confident the programme should be rolled out as planned. Crabb was responding to an analysis by the Resolution Foundation thinktank, which found that cuts to work allowances would leave 2.6 million claimants up to \u00a346 a week worse off, even after higher minimum wage and tax cuts had been factored in. He confirmed that there would be no further cuts to welfare spending during this parliament, despite a \u00a34bn budget gap opened up by the government\u2019s U-turn on disability benefits in March. He said: \u201cWhat that does mean is that when we get to the autumn statement there\u2019s a \u00a34bn gap. As a government we have to think about what that means. But we won\u2019t be looking to other parts of welfare spending to offset that decision.\u201d Although it was a \u201cpersonal priority\u201d to get more disabled people into employment, plans to publish a a white paper, originally scheduled for the spring, would now be put on hold while he consulted charities and employers over the best way forward. Crabb criticised employers who fail to \u201cdo the right thing\u201d by taking on people with a disability, contrasting a family-owned sports shop in his constituency that employed a man with Down\u2019s syndrome to meet and greet customers, with its high-street rival, the chain retailer Sports Direct. Crabb said: \u201cSports Direct have no track record as far as I am aware of doing the right thing by way of support for people with disabilities.\u201d The government has committed to ambitious plans to halving the disability employment gap, which would entail getting more than 1 million people with a disability into a job by 2020.",
