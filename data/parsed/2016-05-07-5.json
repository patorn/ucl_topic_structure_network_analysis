  "body": "Those among us who have observed the slow, painful decline of Labour in Scotland are now spoilt for choice in trying to identify the party\u2019s darkest day. The third Holyrood election in 2007 \u2013 which first brought the SNP to power \u2013 was, until then, the blackest one it had ever experienced. How could the natural party of government in Scotland, the people\u2019s own representatives, have lost to this outfit? Wasn\u2019t this the party that, just a few years earlier, was still being dismissed as a single-issue pressure group possessing sizeable numbers of hairy-arsed caber-tossers who sought every day to re-enact Bannockburn? How could it have come to this? Lessons would need to be learned and all ideas of complacency jettisoned. This was just the jolt the party needed. The people had administered a friendly warning, but Labour\u2019s values were Scotland\u2019s values, weren\u2019t they? Life would soon get back to normal. Four years later, it grew darker still. The SNP didn\u2019t just repeat its defeat of Labour in 2011, it left them without a shred of influence at Holyrood and, in so doing, turned Scottish politics on its axis. Not to worry, though: the Scottish people had never shown any passion for independence and, horrified at the prospect, would return to the mother-ship. More lessons would need to be learned \u2026 and they would be. Last year though, the people (ungrateful bastards) decided simply to stop messing about and simply evict its former masters. Was there ever a day darker than this? The Westminster elections were supposed to be different from those pretend Holyrood ones. Real power still resided at Westminster, where only the big boys were allowed to play. But the SNP were the big boys now, the masters of Scotland\u2019s two separate jurisdictions, having left Labour with only one seat from 59. And Labour were lucky to get one. More lessons would be learned. The Scottish people were just conducting a wee extra-marital affair; Scotland\u2019s core values were still Labour ones. The people knew it, and would soon tire of these shallow assignations and return to the security of home and family. If the Labour party has indeed reached the end of its natural life as a viable entity in Scotland, then 5 May will be remembered as the day the lights finally went out. Being replaced by the SNP as the favoured party of social justice in Scotland is humiliating enough. But how do you recover from defeat by the Scottish Conservatives at a time when their Westminster brethren are making poor people bear the burden of reducing the UK deficit while ringfencing the fortunes of the rich? Even as recently as five years ago, you would have got shorter odds on East Stirlingshire beating Real Madrid than on the Scottish Conservative and Unionist party gaining more seats at Holyrood than Labour.    Many of Labour's senior figures still refuse to apologise for the party\u2019s conduct during the independence referendum    Labour didn\u2019t run a bad campaign for Holyrood 2016. It was certainly an improvement on any of the previous three. In Kezia Dugdale the party possesses a smart young leader who, though inexperienced, was sure-footed enough not to repeat the aberrations of her predecessors. She was not Jim Murphy and she never chastised her party\u2019s supporters for wanting a \u201csomething for nothing\u201d society. It\u2019s Dugdale\u2019s personal misfortune to have inherited a party in disarray and to have encountered in Nicola Sturgeon the most formidable politician Scotland has ever produced. When it comes to authentic, socially progressive policies, Scotland\u2019s first minister has been criticised for merely talking a good game. That may be so. Labour\u2019s problem, though, is that words and phrases such as anti-austerity, social justice and equality now somehow sound better when delivered by Sturgeon than by them. The Labour party has also grossly underestimated how much the constitutional question of Scottish independence still dominates political discourse in Scotland. That is forgivable; what is not forgivable is how, even now, many of its most senior figures still refuse to apologise for the party\u2019s conduct during the independence referendum. Everyone else who participated in that campaign gained something; the Labour party in Scotland lost its soul. Scottish Tories are already overstating the scale of their achievement on Thursday but they need a reality check. Scotland is still an intensely anti-Tory country and Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, will have next to no influence on the next parliamentary session. This, though, should not diminish how bad Scottish Labour\u2019s situation is. The party\u2019s decline is on the verge of being terminal. In these circumstances, one more wrong move will be fatal. Doing nothing is not an option, either. In the short term, removing Dugdale as leader is inadvisable, and certain men in grey suits from the west of Scotland must back off now. Instead she must be allowed the opportunity to get a Labour dog into the constitutional fight. There is only one way of doing this short of fully embracing Scottish independence. She must go back to 2008, when one of her more able predecessors, Wendy Alexander, challenged the Scottish Nationalists on an independence referendum she knew they were reluctant to stage by daring them to \u201cbring it on\u201d. Perversely, the political terrain in Scotland is now more favourable to such a tactic by the Labour leader. The SNP\u2019s leaders are walking a high wire on the independence question. They daren\u2019t get the timing wrong as they know the second one will also be the last one. Nor can they risk leaving it for too long, lest the idea of independence and separation in an increasingly inter-connected world lose its charm. The last thing the SNP needs as it seeks to convince its own supporters that it is serious about radical reform of health and education is the Labour party each week \u2013 and it has to be each week \u2013 shouting: \u201cWhat are you afraid of? Bring it on. We\u2019re now comfortable with independence. Are you?\u201d There is some risk attached to this strategy but it\u2019s the only card the Labour party possesses. For, at this curiously delicate point in Scottish political history, the SNP is most assuredly not comfortable with the idea of Scottish independence.",
