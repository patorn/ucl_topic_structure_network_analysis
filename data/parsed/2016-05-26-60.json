That is not the case: as the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills pointed out in a statement issued after the article was published, the variable interest rate for loans taken out after September 2012 has not been changed; it\u00a0remains at 3% above inflation. \u2022 A long read article about Ada Colau (Is this the world\u2019s most radical mayor?, 26\u00a0May, page 27) said incorrectly that she obtained a degree in philosophy at the University of Barcelona. Colau, who\u00a0was elected as the first female mayor of the Catalan capital last year, did study philosophy there but did not complete her degree. \u2022 Homophone corner: \u201cBack in the 1990s and early 2000s, it wasn\u2019t common practice to commission organisations lead by service users\u201d (\u2018My anxiety has been a motivator\u2019, 25\u00a0May, page 37).",
