  "body": "Much of Thank You \u2013 the follow-up to 2015\u2019s 2m-selling Title \u2013 finds Meghan Trainor ditching her All About That Bass doo-wop shtick in favour of 90s chart R&B. Unfortunately, the core problem remains \u2013 Trainor just isn\u2019t a convincing pop star. While the Britney-lite lead single No has its moments, most of the other songs are identity-free filler. Me Too\u2019s bragging (\u201cIf I was you I\u2019d wanna be me too\u201d), for example, sounds misplaced, while the toe-curling \u201canthem\u201d Woman Up (\u201cYou\u2019re more than good enough\u201d) is plain embarrassing. Just when you think things can\u2019t get worse, however, Mom shows up, featuring a cameo from her actual mum, Kelli. No thank you.",
