  "body": "In the hours before he disappeared, Kusai talked about returning home to Syria. Navigating the Islamist checkpoints and shoot-to-kill Turkish border guards to reach the destroyed city of Aleppo was preferable to waiting for the border to open. The 16-year-old, a slight boy with a pensive air, had hoped to reach his brother in Germany but had spent two months stranded in the squalid improvised refugee camp at Idomeni in northern Greece, praying for Macedonia to reopen the gateway to central Europe. Around 7pm on Tuesday, Kusai made a snap decision. Hastily packing his one-man tent, the youngster set off walking from Idomeni, alone. His small frame could be seen following the tree line until eventually it was swallowed by the dense forest cloaking the border. No one has heard from him or seen him since. His phone is silent. \u201cHe didn\u2019t mention any smugglers or if he had help or money, he just took off,\u201d said Ghaled, 30, from Damascus, who knew Kusai for many weeks in the camp. Hundreds of unaccompanied minors have gathered in Idomeni since the border was arbitrarily slammed shut by Macedonia in February. Effectively abandoned by Europe, these children are trapped in a wretched state of suspended animation. If they officially register with the Greek authorities, they are taken by the police; reports of prolonged detention in custody and alleged mistreatment are commonplace. Should they choose to enter Macedonia illegally, they risk being severely beaten by the country\u2019s notorious border patrol.   Graphic: location of Idomeni camp   Life inside the sprawling camp of 10,000 refugees is fraught. Criminal syndicates rule by extortion and the threat of violence. People-smugglers operate with absolute impunity. Many of the unaccompanied children have simply vanished, according to volunteers at the site. There is no audit or clue to where these scores of children have ended up, or who they are with. Some are caught by Macedonian police or military and forced back to Greece through a tiny gap in the razor-wire border fence in aggressive operations known to the camp\u2019s residents as \u201cpushbacks\u201d. Munir, a 15-year-old from Herat, Afghanistan, described being pinned down by Macedonian police a week ago and beaten with a truncheon so ferociously they broke his arm. As dusk drew in on Thursday night, the teenager, his left arm heavily bandaged, set off again towards the border. It is children like Munir whom the British government will seek to resettle in the UK, after David Cameron was forced last week to quash a growing rebellion from his backbench MPs and allow more vulnerable child refugees sanctuary in the UK. The prime minister remains reticent about how many, but up to 3,000 children might be offered the chance of a fresh start. From Monday, councils will be contacted by Home Office officials and told they should be prepared to accept unaccompanied minors from Greece, Italy and France.     Ahmed, 17, from Daraa, Syria.

Hours after Cameron announced his U-turn, teenager Musab confided that he would be attempting to cross the border the following night. The 17-year-old planned to stuff the pockets of his Adidas tracksuit full of bread and then hope for the best. Musab left Aleppo in January after his parents persuaded him to find work in Europe, while they opted to retreat to the Syrian city of Raqqa, the de facto capital of Islamic State (Isis). \u201cThey hate Isis but, to them, it was safer than staying in Aleppo where 70% of my city has been destroyed,\u201d said the teenager, shaking his hands in the air to emphasise the ferocity of the bombing from Bashar al-Assad\u2019s warplanes. Musab had been inspired by the recent escape attempt of his fellow Syrian, Ahmed. Six days ago, the 17-year-old evaded the Macedonian troop carriers that patrol the border. \u201cI got beyond the mountains,\u201d he said, pointing to the first row of hills beyond the border fence. \u201cBut after a few hours, the police found me and brought me back here, but I\u2019ll keep trying.\u201d Ahmed, from the city of Daraa, hopes to reach Sweden, where his mother\u2019s brother, Abu, arrived last year. Abu proposed travelling down to rescue him personally but has been told it is not possible. The perils of the journey north to western Europe from Idomeni are frequently discussed. Macedonia is referred to with dread among the child refugees. Rumours include accounts from refugees caught crossing the country of being held down in puddles which are then Tasered to give them an electric shock, a technique that enables torture without leaving any physical marks. Then there are the \u201cattack dogs\u201d, the tales of fearsome animals trained to maul migrants, the vigilante mobs and the rugged, remote tracks they must follow to avoid being spotted. Munir walked through the country for four days, following a Pakistani smuggler he had paid \u00a32,000 to guide him to Hungary. \u201cWe would walk through the jungle all night, and lie still, sleeping, all day. It rained all the time and I was very cold.\u201d The teenager, sent by his family to find work in Europe after their father, a doctor, suffered a stroke and became too ill to provide, survived on packets of biscuits. When Munir was finally found, asleep under a tree, he was only 10 miles from the Serbian border.     Munir, 15, from Afghanistan. Photograph: Mark Townsend for the Observer    \u201cAn officer said: \u2018Hello, wake up.\u2019 And then he started beating me.\u201d The Macedonian police took the 15-year-old\u2019s remaining money \u2013 \u00a325 \u2013 and tore up his identity documents before returning him to Idomeni. The smuggler was not arrested. Smugglers operate without restriction inside Idomeni. Their fees are common knowledge among the camp\u2019s inhabitants. Currently, the cheapest deals with guide included are \u00a3630 to Serbia, \u00a31,900 to Austria or Germany, with the camp\u2019s premium package \u2013 \u00a32,750 \u2013 involving a false passport, relevant forged paperwork and the opportunity to fly direct to France, Sweden or Germany. Smugglers can readily be found at Idomeni\u2019s disused railway station, haggling with refugees who have lost hope the border will ever reopen. Munir was given a \u201chotline\u201d to call and informed that were prices dependent on the level of risk. On 26 April, the youngster was told to meet his smuggler by the road south of Idomeni at dusk from where they headed through the woods to Macedonia. For many of the unaccompanied minors here, Idomeni does not offer their first experience of smugglers. Many admit relying on them to cross the border from Syria into Turkey. Mohammed, 16, from the war-torn city of Idlib, paid \u00a390 to bribe Turkish border guards. \u201cIt was cheap, a good price,\u201d he said, adding that he intends to be reunited with his brother in Berlin. Others said they were fired at by Turkish border guards while attempting to cross. At least three children have been shot dead fleeing the Syrian civil war in recent months.   Idomeni refugee camp Idomeni refugee camp   Within the refugee camp youngsters have learned to fear other weapons. Many adult men are said to carry knives. Stabbings are frequent, say volunteers. At night the mood in the makeshift camp becomes tangibly tense and fearful. One major concern is that the site is completely porous \u2013 anyone, no matter how unsavoury their intent, can enter at will. A 60-strong gang of Syrian men are currently said to be the dominant criminal force, operating an extortion racket with seeming impunity. Although Greek police are present, they rarely intervene, according to those who have monitored the site since its chaotic inception. It leaves the unaccompanied children wholly vulnerable. Many attempt to blend in by acting older, but 15-year-old Mazin, 4ft 4in tall, and with the face of a child three years younger, had chosen to pitch his tiny tent alongside the camp\u2019s boisterous food queue in an effort to stay conspicuous and theoretically safer. His biggest fear is arson. \u201cThere was a girl whose tent was set on fire and her arms were badly burnt.\u201d Mazin, also from Aleppo, has already lost everything once to criminals. When crossing Turkey in January, he was attacked by \u201cthe mafia\u201d in Gaziantep. \u201cThey took my phone and \u00a380, all the money I was carrying,\u201d he said, crossing his arms behind his back to mimic how his attackers tied him up. He aims to be reunited with his sister, who claimed asylum in Munich last year.     Mazin, 15, from Syria. Photograph: Mark Townsend for the Observer    \u201cIt is very difficult to know what to do,\u201d added Mazin, clearly in acute discomfort when he speaks. An inspection of his mouth revealed an abscess and several rotten teeth. He promised to visit the dentist the following day, but the nearest was a 20-minute drive away and he wondered who would take him. The latest rumour sweeping Idomeni is that soon the camp, in effect a huge outdoor waiting room to Europe, will close. Many of the unaccompanied minors are already hatching plans to leave, convinced that the border might forever remain shut. Others concede the uncertainty is making them feel suicidal. \u201cI feel so bad that I want to die, I cannot wait here anymore,\u201d Musab said. Daily life in Idomeni is bleak with few distractions. \u201cSame tea, no sugar,\u201d said Ahmed of his existence. Phoebe Ramsay, a volunteer helping co-ordinate the food and basic needs of the thousands stranded at the border, said: \u201cThe waiting is having a deleterious effect on mental health. Europe has chosen not to help, so it has largely been left to us, volunteers, to make sure these people can survive.\u201d Another volunteer, Zoe Gilchrist of the Aid Delivery Mission, is helping compile a census of how many unaccompanied minors there might be in and around Idomeni. Estimates suggest up to 300. \u201cIt is remarkable that no official audit exists. Another issue is that we can\u2019t round them up and put them all in the same place because the police might just take them away or they become a vulnerable target for criminals.\u201d The police have already taken many. A month ago campaigners estimated 30 minors were being held in the border region\u2019s five police cells, effectively imprisoned.     Mohammed, 16, from Syria. Photograph: Mark Townsend for the Observer    \u201cIn fact, the conditions are worse than prison because they don\u2019t have showers or proper living facilities; the police are not trained to deal with minors,\u201d said one volunteer, who did not want to be named. Ramsay said she had heard of cases of unaccompanied refugee children being detained for several months. Munir never made it across the border on Thursday night. As he approached the section where the razorwire had been trampled into the mud by hundreds of refugees he was informed by the Observer of Cameron\u2019s promise to allow more unaccompanied minors into Britain. Munir stopped to digest the news, turned and smiling broadly, began walking back to Idomeni. \u201cReally?\u201d he beamed. \u201cI can join my four uncles in London? My mother has never stopped crying since I left. All I\u2019ve done in my life is study hard for my family and I would like to help them.\u201d Yet others are still being lost. Even as Munir prepared to tell his mother that he might have a chance of living in England, a search for Musab proved fruitless. His tent was gone. As good as his word, the youngster had left, heading towards a fate it is impossible to foresee.",
