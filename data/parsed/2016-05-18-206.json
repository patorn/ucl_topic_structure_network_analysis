It has been fascinating to watch American politicians and pundits adjusting to the prospect that the real-estate dynast and TV celebrity might not explode this spring, but actually become the Republicans\u2019 candidate to face Hillary Clinton in November. He might even win against such a vulnerable candidate.   Trump is \u201cmuch more bipartisan and technocratic than many people expect\u201d, an FT columnist tentatively advised readers from New York back in March when leading Republican congressmen and moneybags were scrabbling around to block the Beast of Trump Tower. No longer: most of them are busy making peace.  I\u2019m not quite in the same position myself. Slower than some but faster than others, I have been facing up to the awful possibility that this loudmouth fraud may soon be elected president of the United States. But he\u2019s still a loudmouth fraud, not even a Republican one either: he\u2019s a Trump, the mythical strongman promising to solve our problems as if we were children.  None of this makes for comfortable thinking, does it?   Authoritarian populists, usually armed with an insecure and bullying streak of nationalist assertiveness, belong to a model we thought we had discarded at least 25 years ago. Despite their breezy upbeat rhetoric, corruption and brutality grow in such regimes while the economy shrinks and crony capitalism thrives. Scapegoats will be needed. What\u2019s not to dislike? But they\u2019re back.  What a change! A generation back east Asia was growing fast, central Europe had been cleared of Russian tanks, Latin America\u2019s taste for generals was in retreat, and Mandela had left Robben Island, so even Africa was moving forward. Wonderful. But too much happened too fast. Too many people felt left behind and angry.  That\u2019s what Cameron has to deal with daily, and most world leaders in his position too, albeit less urgently than a self-inflicted Brexit referendum demands.  As the rules currently work \u2013 that may change if the new generation of musclemen rewrite them \u2013 picking a fight with Washington is rarely a good idea. Neil Kinnock tried it over nuclear weapons. Michael Howard did it in openly regretting his vote for the 2003 Iraq war. Cameron probably thought he wasn\u2019t doing it when he made his \u201cdivisive, stupid and wrong\u201d remark about Trump\u2019s anti-Muslim comments during PMQs \u2013 or that it didn\u2019t matter much. Trump was not going to win, right?   But a week in politics can be a very long time. Appearing with his \u201cfriend\u201d Piers Morgan \u2013 what an ego fest that must have been off-camera! \u2013 on ITV, Trump again signalled his eagerness to nurse a grudge against Cameron and the London mayor, Sadiq Khan, who called him \u201cignorant\u201d.  When Trump demanded an IQ test, Khan\u2019s people explained that ignorance was not the same as a lack of intelligence. Round one to Khan. But the White House is still the White House. No 10 pluckily stood by its \u201cstupid, divisive (etc)\u201d line, but George Osborne, Cameron\u2019s Grand Vizier, was wheeled out to make placatory noises.  A similar process seems to be under way in Washington. The Bush family is holding out against reconciliation with the man who humiliated the hapless Jeb. So is Mitt Romney, whom Obama thrashed in 2012. But most of the other big guns are starting to come to terms in the name of party unity. No bust-up or \u201cbrokered\u201d backstairs deal at the Cleveland convention after all, eh! Even the speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, a likely future president himself, if there still is a Republican party, has met Trump and toned down his language.  This is what always happens. \u201cHe\u2019s not as bad as people say,\u201d they tell each other, after telling each other: \u201cHe hasn\u2019t got a chance\u201d for months. In March, the FT columnist Gillian Tett, the paper\u2019s managing editor in New York, reported a small meeting of senior politicians from all sides in New Hampshire, convened to discuss bipartisan strategic goals for the US.  That\u2019s not a secret plot. It\u2019s sensible. Imagine if Westminster politicians could do the same over, say, London\u2019s third runway, the needs of Scotland or the \u201cNorthern Powerhouse\u201d, over the EU even. Voters don\u2019t have to endorse it.  Guess what? Trump turned up and was bipartisan and technocratic too, no loudmouth aggression or verbal bullying. We have the word of another participant, the Mandarin-speaking ex-governor and diplomat Jon Huntsman, a former presidential wannabe too. People who deal with Trump in politics or business find him privately sensible, Tett reported.  Ah, \u201cprivately\u201d. Assuming Tett\u2019s evidence is solid, that\u2019s already a problem for Trump. He keeps telling us he\u2019s a dealmaker who will take ideas from anyone and anywhere if they work and be admirably pragmatic as he battles to \u201cmake America great again\u201d. The loudmouth stuff is just a campaign device, you mark his words.  There\u2019s evidence that Trump is now hiring people who know how to run \u2013 and finance \u2013 a real presidential campaign, people too who have real expertise, not just in dirty politics either. As readers of the Guardian and most other media (not Fox News?) know, he will need it. Around the same time Tett was sounding positive Trump visited the Washington Post\u2019s HQ and casually dropped the possibility that the US might not be able to afford Nato any more. Israel, Iran, Palestine, Brexit, Trump says whatever will please an audience.  Remind you of anyone closer to home? Let\u2019s not talk Boris Johnson today; Trump matters more. For all the offensive things he has said about women and Hispanic Americans, for all that he seems to offend black Americans, he ought to be heading for certain defeat. Isn\u2019t his core constituency, angry white voters, especially men, declining both as a proportion of US voters and \u2013 awful thought \u2013 because their mortality rates are actually rising?   Yet Clinton\u2019s candidacy is more vulnerable than it should be. If we could be sure she will maximise her appeal in ways that draw in moderate Republicans as well as the Democrats\u2019 own full strength \u2013 the Obama coalition \u2013 it will be all right on the night. But we\u2019re not sure, are we? Feminists and young female voters have flocked to Bernie Sanders\u2019s standard and persist in doing so \u2013 another win for Bern overnight \u2013 in ways that damage the candidate and help Trump.   Even the Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, a distinguished public figure and presidential material (she declined to stand), is equivocating, despite gossip that Clinton may offer her the No 2 spot and double down on her gender credentials. Not a smart gamble in my view. It might look like a gimmick to angry blue-collar wives.  Her sex won\u2019t defeat Clinton, nor her distinguished record. It\u2019s a character thing, character and judgment. Investigators are still poking around her \u201csecret\u201d (private?) email channel and, now, the charity funds she may have diverted to an energy company owned by friends. That\u2019s the American way \u2013 LBJ would not have hesitated and look at George W Bush\u2019s cronies \u2013 but we live in more censorious times.   The Clintons look and smell rich. They sound entitled. Only this week Hillary suggested her husband would be in charge of revitalising neglected regions like West Virginia (where Bernie hammered her last week), the same Bill who was photographed at a fancy dress ball with \u201cKing\u201d Philip Green of BHS fame. At least Bill is very likeable. Hillary admits to being a poor campaigner.  All this stuff and plenty more is going into the Trump election file. On the evidence, Trump will say anything to win and, if he goes all soft and technocratic to please FT or Washington Post readers between now and November, plenty of supporters he has fired up along the way will get mad at him too. They\u2019re armed to the teeth, those who still have teeth under US healthcare.   Trump has made a reckless Faustian bargain with such voters which they expect him to keep, Mexican wall and all. If he wins this brutal contest \u2013 I am starting to fear he may \u2013 it will be at a price far greater than the expected $1.5bn cash cost. Things easily said cannot always be easily unsaid, as we are learning in our referendum campaign.",
