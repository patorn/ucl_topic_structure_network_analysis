  "body": "Election night, 8 November 2016 Mar-a-Lago Club, Palm Beach, Florida  Thank you! Thank you all! This is beautiful! You\u2019re amazing people! Amazing! I love you all!  Can you believe this? Great evening. We will be celebrating for a long time tonight. Of course if you listen to the pundits, we weren\u2019t expected to win. We won with evangelicals. We won with young. We won with old. We won with highly educated. We won with poorly educated. I love the poorly educated. It\u2019s so great to be in Florida. It\u2019s so great to be at Mar-a-Lago with friends and the press and the media and everybody. What a turnout! They have 6,000 people outside that can\u2019t get in. The press will never report how many people are here. They\u2019re horrible people. Absolutely dishonest. Absolute scum.    Related: Reality check: Does the electoral map work in Trump's favor?    I\u2019ll be the greatest unifier of all!  My wife is always saying, \u201cDarling, be more presidential\u201d. I can be more presidential than anybody! Everything that\u2019s been involved in Hillary has been losses. She was favored to win and she got schlonged!  According to Drudge, according to Time Magazine, I won every single debate on every single poll. If I acted presidential, I guarantee you I wouldn\u2019t be here. We\u2019re being laughed at all over the world. So our country needs a truly great leader. I\u2019m going to represent our country with dignity very, very well. I\u2019m a solid, stable person. I\u2019m a man of great achievement. I went to an Ivy League school. I\u2019m like a really smart person.  I don\u2019t have to brag. I don\u2019t have to, believe it or not. I built an empire. I own some of the greatest assets in the world. I built up a net worth of much more than $10bn. I have never gone bankrupt, or close. But I use the bankruptcy laws, but so does everybody else. Nobody knows the banking system better than me. I understand business better than anyone that\u2019s ever run. We sell water. We sell steaks. And by the way, you want to take one; we charge you about, what, 50 bucks a steak. We make the finest wine as good a wine as you can get in the world. Everything I\u2019ve done virtually has been a success. I\u2019m the most successful person ever to run for president.    I\u2019m a solid, stable person. I\u2019m a man of great achievement. I went to an Ivy League school    I have a great temperament, very calm. The doctor said: \u201cYou have the blood pressure of a great, great athlete who\u2019s 20 years old.\u201d I get along with everybody.  [Commotion on the ballroom floor]  Get him out of here! Get him out! I\u2019d like to punch him in the face! These people; where do they come from? Go home to mommy! Go home to mommy! [Security escort protester from the ballroom while the crowd chants: USA! USA! USA!]  Hey, do we love our police in this country? Our people take care of our people, right? The biggest story in all of politics worldwide right now, and I think you might agree to this, is what\u2019s happened. Millions and millions of people have come to the Republican Party. Folks, I\u2019m a conservative but at this point, who cares? I want to thank my family, Melania, my boys Eric and Don. Ivanka and Jared. I want to thank my boy Barron.  [He forgets to mention daughter Tiffany, daughter of his second ex-wife Marla Maples.]  I have so many friends up here. They are special, special people. Carl Icahn endorsed me. Chris Christie and Sarah Palin and Jerry Falwell Jr. Mike Tyson endorsed me. Bobby Knight was unbelievable. Sheriff Joe Arpaio. Nobody has seen anything like it.  So here\u2019s the story, we have to be cheerleaders. I want to do something that\u2019s going to make our country feel good. We\u2019re like a third world country. Our whole system is badly, badly broken. If we don\u2019t fix it we\u2019re not going to have a country anymore. Our military is a disaster. Our healthcare is a horror show. Common Core is a total disaster. We can\u2019t continue to allow China to rape our country. It\u2019s the greatest theft in the history of the world. When Mexico sends its people, they\u2019re not sending their best. They\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. We either have a country or we don\u2019t.    The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics! They love me! I love them!    Who\u2019s going to pay for the wall? [Crowd] Mexico! Who? [Crowd] Mexico! The wall will go up and Mexico will start behaving! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics! They love me! I love them! Everybody loves me!  So I bring people together. I have a great relationship with African Americans, as you possibly have heard. I just have great respect for them. And they like me. I don\u2019t have a racist bone in my body. Believe it or not, I have a lot of friends that are Muslim. I want mosques surveilled. We\u2019re allowing people to come into this country that we have absolutely no idea who they are, where they come from. We\u2019re going to straighten it out folks. I love the Muslims.  I love women. I will take care of women like nobody else can. Hillary Clinton said you shouldn\u2019t cherish women. If Hillary can\u2019t satisfy her husband what makes her think she can satisfy America? I do cherish women. Nobody in this country, and maybe in the history of the country, politically, was worse than Bill Clinton with women. He was a disaster.   Related: Illma Gore: 'If anyone is going to be threatened by a small penis, it's Trump'    I will take care of women like nobody else can. Ivanka said: \u201cDad, you respect and love women so much but people don\u2019t really understand how you feel.\u201d My wife said: \u201cYou know if you run, you know you\u2019re going to win.\u201d She\u2019s actually very smart. Melania, say something. Go ahead, please.  [Melania Trump steps to the microphone and speaks]  Congratulations to my husband, he was working very hard. And he loves you. [Trump returns to the microphone]  We\u2019re tired of being the stupid people! So we will repeal and replace Obamacare with something terrific. I will be the greatest jobs president God ever created. We\u2019re going to make great trade deals. I\u2019m the strongest guy militarily that you could ever have. I know more about Isis than the generals do.  We\u2019re going to have a great relationship with China; we\u2019re going to have a great relationship with Putin. He called me \u201ca genius\u201d. I will get along with others, and we will have a much more stable, stable world.  We are totally predictable. We tell everything. We\u2019re sending troops. We tell them. We\u2019re sending something else. We have a news conference. We have to be unpredictable. And we have to be unpredictable starting now!    Look at those hands, are they small hands? I guarantee you there\u2019s no problem    When you talk about the nuclear button, the ones I\u2019m worried about are the other people on the other side that have the nuclear. But don\u2019t worry about me. And finally, you will be so proud of your country again and we\u2019ll start winning, winning winning. You\u2019re going to say, \u201cMr. President, we can\u2019t take it anymore\u201d. And I\u2019m going to say, \u2018We\u2019re going to win, win, win\u2019! And we\u2019re going to make America great again! Look at those hands, are they small hands? I guarantee you there\u2019s no problem.  I guarantee. My hands are fine. You know, my hands are normal. Slightly large, actually. In fact, I buy a slightly smaller than large glove, okay?  I don\u2019t want people to go around thinking that I have a problem.  Thank you very much everybody. We love you. The people of this country are absolutely amazing! All the lines in Trump\u2019s acceptance speech were said by Trump during his presidential campaign.
