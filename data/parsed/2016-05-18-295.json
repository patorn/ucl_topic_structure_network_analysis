  "body": "Romelu\u2019s Lukaku\u2019s father believes the Everton striker will have left the club before the start of the European Championship, with Bayern Munich or Manchester United his preferred destination. The 23-year-old scored 25 goals for Everton this past season but struggled for form and fitness in 2016, finding the net only three times in the Premier League since the turn of the year. Now Lukaku\u2019s father, Roger \u2013 a former striker himself for Zaire (now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo) \u2013 has admitted he expects his son to leave Goodison Park this summer if Everton\u2019s valuation is met.   Related: Phil Jagielka warns Everton squad could be severely depleted by summer exits    \u201cEverton are asking around \u00a365m for Rom. I think a transfer will be done before the Euros,\u201d he told the Belgian magazine Humo. \u201cI hope and believe that Mino [Raiola, Lukaku\u2019s agent] is fair, and that he is acting in the best interest of the player. \u201cRomelu will decide his future, but agents have the last word most of the time. I hope and I think Mino Raiola is a honest man. \u201cNow, with Romelu it will be quickly arranged. Whether the transfer has been sorted? Almost. I think it will be in place before the European Championship.\u201d Lukaku, who joined Chelsea from Anderlecht in 2011 for an initial fee of \u00a310m, has been linked with a return to Stamford Bridge this summer. However, his father has revealed he would prefer a move to the Bundesliga. \u201cRight now, I think the most suitable clubs for him are Bayern Munich or Manchester United,\u201d he said. \u201cEspecially Bayern as the club every year are at least in the semi finals of the Champions League, and the Bundesliga suits him perfectly. I do not think he will go to Italy because the game is far too closed at the back. What is certain is that to continue to progress, he needs to change club, he must make the right choice.\u201d",
