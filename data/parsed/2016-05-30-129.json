  "body": "This book is about the Devil\u2019s youngest son, called Jinx, who isn\u2019t good at being evil. His Dad, Satan, gives up on him and wants to send him to an army camp. Jinx runs away and finds that a girl his age has been sent to hell when that is not allowed. She is called Tommy and they make friends. They find out about a plot to destroy the wall between heaven and hell and get rid of Jinx\u2019s Dad. They know they have to do something about it. This is a hilarious book and I kept on reading and couldn\u2019t wait to read the sequel. Recommended reading age: 9 yrs and above.
