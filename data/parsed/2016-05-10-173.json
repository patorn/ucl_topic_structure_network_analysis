  "body": "With the road now clear for the remaining \u201cshort campaign\u201d to the EU referendum, both sides are accusing their rival of panic: David Cameron for allegedly warning of future European wars, Iain Duncan Smith and Boris Johnson for assorted wild exaggerations. Six more weeks of this second-rate hysteria.  Me, my money for the day\u2019s top panic is on IDS\u2019s \u201cexclusive\u201d Sun revelation. It recycles old news that Angela Merkel vetoed Dave\u2019s plan back in late 2014 for EU member states to apply an \u201cemergency brake\u201d on internal migration. It was well reported at the time.  So that\u2019s about as \u201cexclusive\u201d a bit of news as last weekend\u2019s burst of sunshine for which neither side in the referendum campaign has yet claimed credit. Give them time, give them time. Both sides are saying some self-evidently silly things. For Duncan Smith of all people to say EU membership will \u201churt the poor\u201d is certainly chutzpah.   Related: Iain Duncan Smith: Cameron let Germans veto 'emergency brake'    But IDS\u2019s claim to have \u201cseen the Merkel correspondence\u201d did have a purpose. It served to knock the latest weighty, anti-Brexit blasts, round robin letters from retired Nato and senior US officials, off the front pages. The dear old BBC, the Brexit crowd\u2019s other pet hate, swallowed the story whole. I don\u2019t share Jonathan Freedland\u2019s fear that the ploy may be effective among unconverted waverers. Can you imagine how the Daily Beast and the Brute would react if Jeremy Corbyn dared promote a half-baked (\u201cTrust me, I\u2019m a politician\u201d) strategy condemned by the entire US policy establishment, by the EU (of course) and most other countries, but given encouragement by Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin and other mouthy nationalists? Before we turn to the Sun\u2019s equally exclusive poll of road users \u2013 you\u2019ll have to wait to know which way \u201croad users\u201d will vote \u2013 let\u2019s look at the widely sort-of-reported rival speeches made on Sunday by Cameron and Johnson. Here\u2019s Cameron\u2019s. And here\u2019s the ex-London mayor\u2019s. Personally, I don\u2019t greatly care for either. Few substantial arguments are marshalled in major political speech these days, few compelling moral arguments mustered with conviction, fewer still have the courage to offer the British people \u201cblood, toil, tears and sweat\u201d instead of a cosier existence. Cameron\u2019s history is flaky as usual (that Oxford degree in general studies doesn\u2019t quite do the business), though not as sentimentally tendentious as the Tory/republican court historian Andrew Roberts in Tuesday\u2019s Mail. It\u2019s worth a glance, too, though clever Martin Kettle handles the delicate \u201cwas Churchill a remainer or a Brexiteer?\u201d question more judiciously here. In the 1950s Churchill steered clear of the \u201ccommon market\u201d but would he in 2016? Above all, he was a realist.     Winston Churchill in 1951. Photograph: PA    A cut-price Churchill, more Aldi than Fortnum & Mason, Boris\u2019s speech, long by the standards of his soundbite career and 1,100-word weekly column in the Telegraph, will appeal to some. It makes some good points about excessive immigration, though with no wider context (all those migrants in \u201csovereign\u201d Norway, eh, Boris?), let alone offer a remedy.  He complains about the busybody European courts, rightly so. Ditto, the EU\u2019s economic errors. But he is still asking questions at a stage in the campaign when the fractious leave campaign should be providing answers. If immigration is its best card \u2013 they don\u2019t have an answer to that either \u2013 then its failure to provide any coherent or convincing vision of a post-Brexit Britain is what may \u2013 may \u2013 finally sink them and (with luck) Boris too.  Everyone who knows him well also knows how he agonised over which way to jump on Brexit. It shows. Polly Toynbee argues here that Dave should show up Boris\u2019s flakiness in a TV debate. Risky, but worth considering. Years ago Polly did a head-to-head programme with Boris on Sky that had to be dumped because he simply didn\u2019t know enough. It shouldn\u2019t all be like this, of course. At a typically downbeat pro-EU discussion staged by the FT\u2019s 125 flagship programme on Monday night, the chancellor, George Osborne, conceded there are valid arguments on both sides, but that the balance of advantage lies with In. That\u2019s the Cameron message.   Related: David Cameron v Boris Johnson live on TV: the EU debate we must have | Polly Toynbee    But Osborne added that Britain\u2019s two main EU policies since the 80s, Labour as well as Tory, have been promotion of the single market (not yet achieved) and of expansion to include the former Soviet bloc states (still a fragile project in every sense), while rejecting two key policies that we judge unsuitable and unwise: the single currency and the Schengen borderless zone. That glosses over problems and failures that have mostly been our own, not Europe\u2019s. But on balance he\u2019s right. Yes, the EU fumbled the crisis in Ukraine, as Boris said. But did British foreign policy do better? Or on Libya or Syria? No. Not a single German soldier in European uniform in sight there to frighten the Daily Express! That must be why so many professionals in so many fields \u2013 science and medicine as well as house building, security and intelligence, manufacturing business and finance, US presidents and CIA chiefs (etc, etc) are queuing up to tell British voters that Brexit would be a serious mistake, costly to their endeavours in a networked world. Who does the other side promote? IDS, Liam Fox, Chris Grayling, Priti Patel, B team entrepreneurs, professional gamblers and hedge fund types who don\u2019t make much impact even when turbo-charged by Brexit headlines in Fleet St. The former chancellor Nigel Lawson who got so many things wrong himself? He\u2019s a climate change sceptic too. No coincidence there. Even normally fluent Michael Gove falters. And the Sun? Daft as ever (its readers are often so much smarter) it promotes a gloriously pointless \u201cpoll\u201d \u2013 billed as the biggest ever because it was culled from a quiz run by a website called petrolprices.com. I won\u2019t spoil the result by revealing which way a self-selected group of price-conscious motorists might vote after a hard day in traffic.  Pretty panicky stuff, I\u2019d say. And it doesn\u2019t explain how restored \u201csovereignty\u201d would lower prices or ease those bottlenecks either.",
