  "body": "The rumour was there would be chicken.  Word had spread that a delivery of poultry meat was due at the Central Madeirense supermarket, and long before dawn a queue of shoppers was snaking around the block.  Kattya Alonzo was one of them. The 48-year-old mother of three was already planning to make the traditional chicken and rice dish arroz con pollo \u2013 if she could also find some rice. \u201cI haven\u2019t been able to buy chicken in more than a month, so I was there early at about 4am,\u201d she said. At about 6.30, two trucks finally drew up outside the store, but before the drivers could start to unload, national guardsmen told them to drive on.    Related: Venezuelans on the food and economic crisis blighting their daily lives    Venezuela is rich in oil, but dogged by chronic shortages of basic goods and essential medicines, electricity and water rationing, spiraling inflation and rampant crime.  Perhaps it was not surprising that the mood outside the supermarket quickly turned ugly: frustration turned to despair, anger to violence. Before long, the incident on Tuesday had escalated. Mobs tried to loot several bakeries and delis and another food delivery truck. The unrest soon spread throughout this city of 200,000 just outside the capital, Caracas. Protesters shouted \u201cWe want food\u201d as they blocked intersections with burning tyres and clashed with security forces.  Police and the national guard quickly controlled the outburst, with some 14 people reportedly arrested, and at least one person was injured, according to witnesses. The protests were not related to marches in Caracas and other major cities, which were called this week by opposition leaders seeking to cut short the term of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro who they say has driven the country into the ground through mismanagement. But spontaneous outbursts such as the one in Guarenas may present a more serious challenge to Maduro\u2019s rule than any efforts by his political rivals.

Maduro blames the country\u2019s woes on an \u201ceconomic war\u201d against his government by rightwingers and foreign interests. Last week Maduro decreed a 60-day state of emergency because of the \u201cthreat\u201d against his government.  Maduro has described the referendum push as an attempt to justify a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat or a foreign intervention, and on Friday the Venezuelan armed forces began two days of military exercises as show of force in the face of such threats. But as the events in Guarenas show, the country is on a knife-edge.           Blackouts, looting and murder: Venezuela\u2019s state of emergency    Venezuelans have been living with shortages of food and essential items for nearly three years as the oil-dependent economy began to buckle. And patience is wearing thin. The Venezuelan Observatory of Social Conflict registered 2,138 protests between January and April, most of them spontaneous manifestations of anger or frustration. Incidents of looting have nearly quadrupled in the same time. \u201cWe are like a bomb going tick-tock, tick-tock,\u201d said Zenovia Villegas, a 54-year-old housewife who waited in line at a Guarenas supermarket since the early hours of Thursday only to be told at 3pm that the store would not be opening its doors that day. Dejected, she went home empty-handed. Authorities have reason to be nervous of unstructured shows of dissent, particularly in protest-prone Guarenas. It was in here that protests in 1989 against neoliberal reforms and a hike in bus fares sparked a wave of looting and violence that came to be known as the \u201cCaracazo\u201d in which as many as 3,000 people died.     A public bus burns in Caracas during riots to protest increases in gasoline and transport fare hikes in 1989. Photograph: AP    Those events are said to be what motivated an attempted coup in 1992 by an army lieutenant-colonel named Hugo Ch\u00e1vez who would later become president and set the country on a \u201crevolutionary\u201d path under the banner of 21st-century socialism. At the entrance to Guarenas a sign boasts that the city was the \u201cbirthplace of the revolution\u201d.  The charismatic and wily Ch\u00e1vez, who led the country from 1998 till his death in 2013, enjoyed unprecedented support for his oil-funded social programs that brought health services, education and housing to poor Venezuelans. Maduro, his successor, has not managed to win the same levels of popular support and as oil prices dropped the country\u2019s economy has gone into a tailspin.   Related: President says Venezuela won't be next to fall, but he may not have a choice    An opposition coalition, known as MUD, is trying to force a recall referendum on Maduro, which would cut his six-year presidential term in half. They have collected the first batch of signatures to begin the process but accuse electoral authorities of stalling in processing them. But for people on the street that\u2019s just politics. \u201cWe don\u2019t care who\u2019s in Miraflores,\u201d said Marlene Pineda who runs a newsstand in Caracas, referring to the presidential palace. \u201cWhat we want is food,\u201d she says reflecting the sentiment of many Venezuelans far removed from politics who are struggling to get by day to day. \u201cFood is what moves people,\u201d says Carlos Perdomo, who sells unrefined sugarloaves known as papel\u00f3n in an area called Sam\u00e1n where protesters congregated on Tuesday. But so does the feeling of impotence. A rash of mob justice has gripped Venezuela as violent crime soars with little response from security forces. In the Mesuca neighbourhood of Caracas \u2013 considered the most dangerous area of the world\u2019s most murderous city \u2013 motorcycle taxi drivers swap horror stories as they nervously wait for fares. Accepting the wrong fare may cost any one of them their motorbike or their life.  \u201cWhen a passenger comes the first thing we do is look at their waist\u201d for any sign of a gun, said Carlos Paredes. \u201cFor us, going to work is like a lottery.\u201d Impunity is so widespread that lynchings have now become common. Several months ago a thief stole a motorcycle at gunpoint in one of the steep winding streets of the neighbourhood. A group of motorcyclists chased down the thief, beat him, doused him with gasoline and set him on fire. John D\u00edaz, 25 said he didn\u2019t participate in the mob but saw the man\u2019s charred remains on the street. \u201cPeople are fed up. With everything,\u201d he said. The lynching and looting are manifestations of anger and impotence that clinical psychologist Liliana Castiglione is seeing in her practice where 80% her patients\u2019 problems are related to the country\u2019s economic and social crisis. \u201cPeople are desperate, they are depressed and they\u2019re angry,\u201d said Castiglione, who launched a blog called Psic\u00f3logas al Rescate (Psychologists to the Rescue) where she and partner Stefania Aguzzi offer low-cost or sometimes free consultations for Venezuelans struggling to cope. \u201cOne woman this week told me straight out that she wanted to kill people,\u201d said Castiglione. \u201cLike many Venezuelans she feels trapped.\u201d One way to channel that frustration is by standing up and expressing through protests, Castiglione said, but security forces are quick to stifle them. At the time of the Caracazo, police and soldiers at first stood by when the looting and protests started. Today security forces are under orders to quell any sign of protest immediately. Several days after the unrest in Guarenas, the city remained tense. Groups of national guardsmen in riot gear watched over a busy informal street market to prevent any further turbulence.  \u201cIf you complain too loudly, they arrest you,\u201d says Mar\u00eda David, a 71-year-old retired nurse. \u201cAs soon as people protest, the military is there.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the reason things haven\u2019t blown over, yet,\u201d she says. \u201cFear.\u201d",
