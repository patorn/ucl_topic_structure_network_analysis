Being thrust into the spotlight can be difficult enough \u2013 never mind the added pressures of completing a busy promo circuit or travelling the world on a non-stop tour \u2013 but it can also expose or create much deeper problems.  During Mental Health Awareness Week this year, from 16 to 22 May, the Mental Health Foundation has placed a special focus on relationships. \u201cWe believe we urgently need a greater focus on the quality of our relationships,\u201d says the charity. \u201cWe need to understand just how fundamental relationships are to our health and wellbeing. We cannot flourish as individuals and communities without them. In fact, they are as vital as better-established lifestyle factors, such as eating well, exercising more and stopping smoking.\u201d   Related: Insomnia, anxiety, break-ups \u2026 musicians on the dark side of touring    In the music industry, there should arguably be no greater working relationship than that between an artist and their manager. Far from the cliche of a cigar-chomping penny counter, a good modern music manager will protect their client\u2019s emotional, mental and physical state just as passionately as their business interests. It\u2019s a role that can make all the difference for artists who may be struggling with the demands of stardom, along with any other mental health challenges they harbour.  \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing that\u2019s for sure, it\u2019s that success and adulation never made any human being any more normal,\u201d says Marc Marot, a former UK record label boss and chairman of Crown Talent Management, which has the likes of Ella Henderson, Becky Hill and Jay McGuiness on its music roster. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do for our artists on a daily basis is make them more extraordinary. So we\u2019re setting people up to have a different way of thinking to the rest of humanity. Then we wonder why they think differently!\u201d Recently, there has been an increased awareness of mental health in the creative industries. The stigma surrounding mental illness appears to be fading, if slightly: last year, prominent music stars such as Pete Doherty and Florence Welch talked openly about their own battles with anxiety and depression. Meanwhile, the death of Amy Winehouse in 2011 has forced more discussion around mental health, addiction and adequate care across the music industry.     Battles with depression \u2026 Pete Doherty. Photograph: Anita Russo/Rex/Shutterstock    \u201cI think it\u2019s come to the fore more recently,\u201d says David Enthoven, a veteran of the business and co-founder of management company ie:music, which looks after big names including Robbie Williams, Will Young, Passenger, Lemar and Ladyhawke. \u201cWhen I came in, nobody had heard of anything like Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous. It was around, but you just didn\u2019t talk about it, and a lot of artists died young in the 60s because of a drug overdose or too much alcohol. I think it was almost seen as a badge of honour to get up on stage and be completely wrecked.\u201d The demands on modern-day musicians are far greater than they were in those days, he adds. \u201cThere weren\u2019t camera phones back then, so you couldn\u2019t be caught in unguarded moments. Things have definitely changed and your faults are magnified and spread.\u201d Enthoven is particularly well qualified when it comes to looking after artists struggling with addiction. Now in his 70s, he himself had a serious drug problem 30 years ago. But rather than try to bury his experiences, he is ultimately able to draw on them to help troubled artists. \u201cIf anybody asks, I\u2019ll immediately offer to help,\u201d he says. \u201cI think artists are more susceptible to having issues \u2013 whether its mental issues or drug-related. Much of it is to do with self-esteem and fear. Most of the artists I work with are sensitive in certain areas, they have heightened awareness, heightened sensitivity, and a lot of them do have low self-esteem. That\u2019s interesting because they go out, become somebody else and perform. I think they are very brave. I have one artist who is almost physically sick before going out on stage but she is so determined and wants to do what she is doing so much that she pushes through that fear.\u201d  If the demands of being a prominent musician are greater than ever, and management companies are shouldering an increasing responsibility for their clients\u2019 overall wellbeing and career, then it is often the manager who is the first responder if mental health deteriorates. But, as multiskilled as they need to be in 2016, managers are not qualified therapists. So how do they handle complex mental illnesses if they begin to emerge? For Ellie Giles,, who looks after Bill Ryder-Jones, the most important thing is simply to lend an ear. \u201cAll you need to do is listen and work out what help they need,\u201d she says. \u201cGreat managers in any industry are there to work out what an artist or person needs and then mentor, support and advise them. Ultimately that\u2019s what management is: it\u2019s enabling and empowering that person.  \u201cBill Ryder-Jones has a dissociative disorder,\u201d she offers as an example. \u201cWhen he gets into a bad place, he ends up unable to see himself in the mirror and feels that he\u2019s part of a computer game, which is something that I\u2019d never come across before I managed him. The only way that you can manage something like that is by listening.     Dissociative disorder \u2026 Bill Ryder-Jones. Photograph: Rachel King    \u201cWhen it comes to managing people with mental-health issues, it\u2019s all about working out where their head is at. Are they actually in the middle of an episode or not? It can be a hard judgment to make but it\u2019s ultimately the only thing you can do. Then it\u2019s about finding help.\u201d For Crown\u2019s Marot, that final step is crucial. Just as a suffering artist needs the support of their manager, the manager themselves must rally the wider team to bolster that support before seeking out professional help where necessary.  \u201cThe problem for many young managers is they\u2019re on their own, so they don\u2019t have resources around them,\u201d says Marot. \u201cPerhaps your artist has got a major record deal but, because the manager is young and inexperienced, they don\u2019t know how to reach out to people or they think that doing so is a sign of weakness when it isn\u2019t.   \u201cIt\u2019s got to be confronted as early as possible,\u201d he adds. \u201cThe Amy Winehouse lyric about not wanting to go to rehab was aimed at a manager, legend has it, but you can\u2019t be put off having that confrontational conversation early and trying to break the pattern of self-harm, stress, or whatever it is by seeking professional help quickly rather than trying to cope on your own.\u201d Although artists and managers seem increasingly able to face these battles, there is a consensus that more needs to be done across the music business as a whole.   Related: 2015: when music destroyed mental health stigma    One website, MusicSupport.org, appears to be a big step in the right direction. A non-profit collective providing confidential help and support for individuals across the UK music business, it is driven by industry figures such as Squeeze\u2019s Chris Difford, artist manager Matt Thomas, session musician Rachael Lander, tour manager Andy Franks and drummer Mark Richardson, along with clinical director Johan Sorensen. Meanwhile, at the Music Managers Forum, we\u2019re researching the potential for a range of resources that will help young and established managers dealing with mental illness and addiction \u2013 whether it\u2019s their clients who are affected or anyone else on the large teams many artists require to help drive success.  As MMF co-chair Diane Wagg explains: \u201cWe looked at all the training that we do for managers. The thing that seemed to be missing was that we weren\u2019t teaching our membership what to do when a client is having real problems \u2013 a nervous breakdown, relationship problems on tour, writers\u2019 block, panic attacks on stage \u2026 It\u2019s one area that we\u2019re really developing in terms of modules and resources. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about dealing with problems when they arise \u2013 and we do need to develop some really great support systems for that \u2013 but also educating people so they are able to spot the signs. When does it go from someone feeling down to being really depressed, for example? \u201cThere are a number of things we can do. We are developing courses and modules about what to look out for and how to deal with them. We\u2019re also getting a lot of calls into MMF HQ from managers asking when they should take action. I think by talking more openly about it, we\u2019ll develop better forums where we share experiences.     Rumer: \u2018We talk a lot about sustainability; remember that an artist\u2019s health is at the core of that.\u2019 Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer     \u201cAnd we have to remember that it\u2019s not just artists who are susceptible to mental health problems,\u201d adds Wagg. \u201cThe fact that artists increasingly feel able to talk and be open about problems is fantastic and is encouraging discussion and development of much better support systems, but people on the management, business and tour sides have generally felt less able to share their problems, feeling they may lose clients if they do. We hope we\u2019re building a world where everyone will feel supported.\u201d  Speaking from experience, singer-songwriter Rumer Shirakbari \u2013 who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder \u2013 says that the biggest positive impact can come simply from putting small things in place to help look after an artist. The music industry as a whole needs to understand the physical, mental and emotional strain that acts are under. \u201cI remember thinking to myself, \u2018I now know why people take drugs. They\u2019re not trying to kill themselves, they\u2019re trying to stay alive,\u2019\u201d she says.  Having released three studio albums on major labels between 2010 and 2014 and been nominated for two Brit awards in 2011, Rumer, who is also a board director at the Featured Artists Coalition, has witnessed the success that the business can bring but also the damage it can do. \u201cMaintaining an artist\u2019s health is in the best interest of everyone \u2013 the label and the management as well as the artist themselves,\u201d she says. \u201cFor that reason, there needs to be more investment in acts\u2019 wellbeing: making sure the schedule is reasonable, hiring a good PA, getting the best doctors, making sure they have access to counselling even on the road. We talk a lot about sustainability; remember that an artist\u2019s health is at the core of that.\u201d  For mental health problems in the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123, or visit Mind\u2019s website.
