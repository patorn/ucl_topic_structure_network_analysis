  "body": "1) It\u2019s play-offs time in the Football League which seems like a perfect excuse to cast our minds back to Fabian de Freitas sweeping home, a seven-goal thriller from 1993 featuring Craig Maskell and the most satisfying in-off-the-post sound ever heard at Wembley and Sunderland and Charlton going one better in a 4-4 draw in 1998 \u2013 poor old Michael Gray. 2) England begin their summer of cricket with the first Test against Sri Lanka at Headingley on Thursday, a full 10 years after Chamara Kapugedera ruined Murali\u2019s fun at Trent Bridge.            3) Better later than never \u2026 Bartolo Col\u00f3n hits his first career home run at the ripe old age of 42.  4) What do you do when you hit your tee shot on the 18th at Quail Hollow into a chalet?

Gauntlet picked up. 5) Thou shall not pass. Spotters badges chestnut52, TheCorporal, whobroughtoranges, TheCedarRoom Guardian YouTube football channel Do subscribe, if you fancy.
