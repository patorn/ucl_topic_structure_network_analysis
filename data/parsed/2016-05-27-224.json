South Africa appointed a committee to study the idea of trading horn internationally, which has been banned for more than four decades, but the government backed away from such a proposal in April.  Days later, neighbouring Swaziland put forward a proposal for a legal trade, citing the 1,000-plus white rhino poached in South Africa each year. Dr Richard Leakey, the chair of the Kenya Wildlife Service which burned the biggest ever stockpile of seized horn last month, told the Guardian: \u201cSwaziland will be seen for what is is, a puppet.\u201d Opponents of a legal trade fear it would stimulate the black market, which is driven by demand in south-east Asia. But in its proposal, Swaziland said: \u201cAt present 100% of the proceeds from the sale of rhino horn are taken by criminals, while rhino custodians pay 100% of the costs of rhino protection and production yet they desperately need funds to cover these costs.\u201d  Separately, South Africa lost the latest round in an ongoing battle in the courts last week, theoretically legalising the domestic trade there. But the environment minister, Bomo Edna Molewa, told reporters on Thursday the government had lost on process, not substance, and was now taking counsel. The jockeying on opening a trade in horn, which is worth more than gold at up to $60,000 (\u00a340,900) a kilo, is accompanied by a similar fight on ivory ahead of a major international meeting. Economically struggling Zimbabwe has tabled a proposal to allow the trade in ivory for it to raise funds, which will be discussed in Johannesburg this September at a conference of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites), which regulates the legal international trade in wildlife. The country also moved earlier this year to sell 18 elephants to US zoos to raise money. But Leakey argued that Zimbabwe could not use elephants and a legal trade to solve its economic woes. \u201cIt\u2019s perennially broke but the ivory is not going to get them out of their economic hole,\u201d he said. John Scanlon, secretary general at Cites, admitted that the consensus for several years on banning international trade in horn and ivory was beginning to tear, and \u201ccompletely opposite viewpoints\u201d would be aired in Johannesburg. \u201cWe had a situation [three years ago, at Cites\u2019 last major meeting] where we were dealing with a surge in illegal trade and some of the differing views about to trade or not were put to one side, as we focused our attention purely on how we were going to tackle the illicit trade. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen through the last few months [through countries\u2019 proposals] \u2026 is some of the differences of opinion have clearly re-emerged, and we\u2019ll see those played out at the COP [the Johannesburg meeting], particularly on elephant ivory and rhino horn.\u201d Scanlon would not be drawn on the merits of a legal international trade in ivory and horn, which many conservationists oppose based on the experience of previous one-off legal ivory sales. \u201cThe history of the convention has shown well-regulated legal trade can work for people and species, but it\u2019s very species- and region-specific,\u201d he said. The Kenyan president, Uhuru Kenyatta, told delegates from 170 countries at the UN environment assembly on Thursday that Kenya would play an active role at the Cites meeting. \u201cKenya will be seeking a total ban on the trade of ivory, and we hope you can stand with us as we take this critical step to preserve animals that contribute so much to our ecosystems and way of life,\u201d he said.  Leakey said that he was confident that proposals to move all ivory to the strongest protection listing in Johannesburg would succeed. \u201cI think we will get a swinging majority vote,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we get that, I think we\u2019re on a winning line, but we just need to be more relentless about keeping up the pressure on the far east.\u201d He added that he thought the west had misunderstood how committed China was in reducing its citizens\u2019 demand for illegal wildlife products including ivory and horn. \u201cI think we\u2019ve blackened China\u2019s image without really understanding what\u2019s going on. China is moving towards becoming a superpower, she wants to be a world leader. You don\u2019t want to be a world leader that\u2019s got dirt on the ropes, and if wildlife trade becomes a really dirty matter, the Chinese government isn\u2019t going to have that tarnishing their image.\u201d  The Guardian\u2019s travel and accommodation was paid for by the UN.",
