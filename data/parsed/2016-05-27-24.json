  "body": "For the definitive pre-final verdict the place to call is the Baxter family farm on the outskirts of Exeter. \u201cThe sky\u2019s the limit as long as you keep your feet on the ground,\u201d cautions the 71-year-old John, father of Rob, as he prepares to join the West Country exodus up to Twickenham for Saturday\u2019s Aviva Premiership final against Saracens. Baxter Sr, like his son, is not the type to count any Devon chickens before they hatch into fully fledged English champions. Almost everyone else in the region, however, is going Chiefs bonkers. Every train seat to London is booked out, any spare coaches or mini-buses have been commandeered. For anyone with a rural background it is a pilgrimage to savour, perhaps the most evocative since Somerset brought scrumpy and haystack chic to one-day Lord\u2019s cricket finals in the late 70s and early 80s. In many ways Exeter\u2019s pitchfork rebellion against the old Premiership elite reflects the simplest of farming parables: sow the right seed and eventually thou shalt reap, even if it all starts in a muck heap. Tony Rowe, the club chairman, still remembers the first time he visited the County Ground, the club\u2019s former home. \u201cIt was 125 years old and used as a dog-track on a Monday night. I went up there and they said: \u2018This is our VIP lounge.\u2019 I walked in and it was worse than the worst transport cafe you\u2019ve ever seen in your life.\u201d For all Rowe\u2019s business acumen in selling the old ground for housing and building a more commercially flexible fortress at Sandy Park, however, Exeter\u2019s glorious story is a family saga at heart. The aforementioned John Baxter served the club for 47 years as player, chairman and director; Rob led the first team for 10 years; and his brother Richie played a record 431 games for the club. The trio and their respective families still live in different parts of the same rambling farmhouse \u2013 the farm itself covers 300 acres \u2013 and remain their local side\u2019s conscience. \u201cBreak Rob in half and he\u2019s got Exeter Rugby Club written through him,\u201d says Rowe affectionately. \u201cHe\u2019s also from farming stock and they never waste money. If you give Rob \u00a320 and send him to the shop, he\u2019ll come back and give you change. Other coaches will come back and say: \u2018I need another \u00a320.\u2019\u201d Dig slightly deeper, though, and there is rather more to Baxter than that. Not many will be aware, for example, that his parents hail from Lancashire, he knows all the songs in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers and is not averse to a spot of karaoke in his local village pub. His son, Jack \u2013 he also has a teenage daughter, Annie \u2013 is studying law at Exeter University. Ideally he would fire up a barbecue every night and is possibly the only top-level coach in the country who knows how to shear a sheep. Even rarer is his emotional intelligence; this is not a straw-chewing yokel who got lucky. His father, a good enough lock forward to have had an England trial in the 1960s, helped lay the foundations of the modern Exeter long ago along with another influential club legend, Bob Staddon, and Baxter Jr has continued their legacy. \u201cThe game that sticks in my mind was the day we got promoted up at Reading,\u201d recalls his father, using his son\u2019s full name for extra emphasis. \u201cRobert Baxter gave everything he had and coming home that night he collapsed because he was so exhausted. You could see then what it meant to him and that\u2019s how he is with the coaching.\u201d Was he always destined to prosper? \u201cOh yes. Rob has always had that inner strength and knowledge of the game. As a family we\u2019ve always enjoyed rugby for the right reasons. It makes a man of you.\u201d Baxter Sr certainly instilled an intense work ethic on the farm \u2013 \u201cI let them knock off a bit early for rugby provided they started an hour earlier the next morning\u201d \u2013 but declines to take credit for the other qualities \u2013 \u201cHe gets it from his mother\u201d \u2013 that make Baxter a fine leader of men. Talk to Baxter\u2019s assistant Ali Hepher about the club\u2019s recruitment methods and honesty and integrity soon emerge as essential cornerstones. \u201cThe easiest way to describe it is that we look for good characters,\u201d says the impressive Hepher, newly installed as the England Saxons head coach for their South Africa tour in June. \u201cOpen-mindedness is huge but we don\u2019t just want robots; we want human beings.\u201d   Related: Exeter Chiefs grind out win over Wasps to reach first Premiership final    Trust and player empowerment are equally crucial. Even when Hepher phoned up the Ministry of Defence to inquire about buying pop-up targets of the type used by practising military snipers \u2013 he is constantly seeking new ways to help players identify space quicker \u2013 no one raised an eyebrow. Exeter must be the only professional team where back-line moves are named after curry dishes and weekly cake-eating sessions are positively encouraged. On the flip side they are conditioned by ex-Marines, work wincingly hard on Exmouth beach during pre-season and care deeply about each other. \u201cThe one thing I\u2019ve learned off Rob is that you can be emotional about it,\u201d says Hepher. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be deadpan. Rob drives the side a lot on emotion \u2026 he\u2019s got the guys to perform way above their means, based on that emotional buy-in.\u201d Baxter was never shy of putting his own body on the line, once captaining a Barbarians side including South Africa\u2019s Bobby Skinstad against Portugal\u2019s national team. Hepher shudders at the memory of playing opposite him \u2013 \u201cI just tried to stay away from him\u201d \u2013 and the former Exeter wing Mark Foster used to tell a similar story. \u201cMy old Gloucester team-mate Will James played against Rob a lot. He said that, if you didn\u2019t knock him out or kill him, he\u2019d keep coming back again and again.\u201d Not much has changed. Saracens might be title favourites but John Baxter says his club have as rich a heritage as any. \u201cWe\u2019ve always been a first-class rugby club and that\u2019s what people seem to forget.\u201d Rowe also brushes aside the \u201cExeter fairytale\u201d narrative. \u201cI don\u2019t have dreams because sometimes you wake up and discover it\u2019s a nightmare. Our ambition is to be the best in England and, eventually, the best in Europe but we\u2019re in no hurry. We\u2019re here for the long haul.\u201d His head coach feels similarly. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to be a team that just goes there and enjoys walking round in the sun at Twickenham beforehand. We are going to turn up and, if we do, we can make it very interesting. The big thing we have always done here is believed. The only thing that would really frustrate me is if we don\u2019t show the best of our qualities and put up a bit of a fight.\u201d The extended Baxter family, young and old, will expect nothing less.",
