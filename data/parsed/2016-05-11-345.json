De Gea had a bottle thrown in his direction after he celebrated his team\u2019s equaliser at 1-1 in provocative fashion, while a pitch invader ran on to taunt him towards the end of West Ham\u2019s thrilling 3-2 win. The fan was led away by stewards.   Related: West Ham sink Manchester United in thrilling Upton Park sendoff    The Football Association pulled no punches in a statement after what was a night of extreme emotion \u2013 both positive and negative. \u201cThe FA strongly condemns the unsavoury incidents involving both the Manchester United team coach outside West Ham United\u2019s Boleyn Ground and objects thrown from a section of the home support during the game,\u201d it said. \u201cWe will work closely with both clubs and the Metropolitan Police to fully investigate these matters.\u201d It was West Ham\u2019s final match at their home of 112 years before their move to the Olympic Stadium next season and the volatile tone was set when the United bus became snarled up on Green Street and attacked. Windows were damaged as bottles and other missiles were thrown by supporters. The decision had been taken to open the turnstiles later than usual before the kick-off and, with many more people than normal turning up to be a part of a historic occasion, there were worrying levels of congestion outside the stadium. The United bus was one victim of the situation but, briefly, there was panic on Green Street as a crush threatened to develop. The 7.45pm kick-off had to be put back to 8.30pm. The United captain, Wayne Rooney, discussed flashpoints in an interview before the game with Sky Sports. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t nice,\u201d Rooney said. \u201cThe coach got smashed up but we\u2019re here now, so have to prepare for the game and go out and do our job.\u201d Pushed further on the supporters\u2019 behaviour, Rooney said: \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019ll see the images. That\u2019s not for me to say but I think it was disappointing. We know it\u2019s a big game for West Ham. It\u2019s a big night for them, leaving the stadium, but I\u2019m sure West Ham as a club will be disappointed with what the fans have done.\u201d     Bottles, beer and missiles are thrown at the Manchester United team bus as it tries to make it\u2019s way through the crowds outside Upton Park. Photograph: Catherine Ivill - AMA/Getty Images    Louis van Gaal suggested the pre-match trouble might have affected some of his players, although he refused to use it as an excuse for a result that damaged his club\u2019s hopes of Champions League qualification. \u201cWe live in this world,\u201d the Manchester United manager said. \u201cIt is not the first time it happens. OK, I have a long experience in football but there are players who don\u2019t have the [same] experience, so it shall have an influence. But we don\u2019t need to have excuses. We chased the match in the second half and we were 2-1 ahead, so we don\u2019t have to look for the excuse.\u201d The United team were understood to have left their hotel in Canary Wharf 10 minutes earlier than on previous trips to the stadium, pre-empting a potential delay because of supporters inevitably gathering to make the most of the stadium\u2019s final fixture. United also arrived late for their previous league match in London \u2013 a 3-0 defeat against Tottenham Hotspur last month \u2013 on account of being directed down a road where a low bridge stopped the bus from getting through en route to White Hart Lane. United appear blameless for Tuesday night\u2019s incidents. When the bus turned on to Green Street from Barking Road, surrounded by West Ham fans on their way to the game, several dozen supporters outside a pub began throwing missiles. A number of windows were broken and footage emerged soon after of children and passers-by being led away from the trouble. The coach arrived at the ground at 7.10pm. The West Ham co-chairman, David Sullivan, blamed United for the delay, suggesting they should have arrived at the stadium at 4pm to avoid congestion, and even claimed their players and staff should have got off the coach and walked the remaining couple of hundred yards to the ground. \u201cIt is depressing really,\u201d Sullivan said on BBC Radio 5 Live before the game got under way. \u201cIt will be a late night for our fans and some of them won\u2019t be able to stay. I don\u2019t understand why United couldn\u2019t get here at 4pm. They could have got here early. They knew it would be busy. It\u2019s crazy. There was congestion in the street and they couldn\u2019t get the coach in. There were people around the coach but there was no attack on the coach.\u201d The footage and photographs of the bus being attacked were unequivocal but Sullivan said: \u201cIf you check the coach there won\u2019t be any damage to it. If we arrived late at Old Trafford they wouldn\u2019t put the kick-off back. Man United should have got here at 4pm. They made the same mistake at Spurs. I\u2019d make them kick off at 7.45pm. The police have been kind to them.\u201d The Metropolitan Police said one officer and a member of the public sustained minor injuries during the trouble on Green Street but no arrests had been made at the scene. They said \u201can appropriate policing plan\u201d was in place and are likely to investigate video footage and take retrospective action.",
