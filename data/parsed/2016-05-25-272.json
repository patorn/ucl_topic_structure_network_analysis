  "body": "Jo Brand is to make her sitcom debut for Channel 4 in a bittersweet comedy about two social workers co-starring Alan Davies. Brand, whose mother was a social worker, will co-write and star in the six-part series, Damned, set in the nightmarish bureaucracy of a children\u2019s services department.  Brand, who won a Bafta for her BBC4 comedy Getting On, set in a hospital, said being a social worker was \u201clike being a traffic warden without the perks\u201d.  \u201cAs the daughter of a social worker who worked for many years in child protection, I grew up seeing social workers go unrecognised for the good things they did and castigated for the bad,\u201d said Brand. \u201cDamned is an attempt to portray the tragic-comic lives of social workers \u2013 always under pressure, always in possession of a grim sense of humour and always wrong in the eyes of the public.\u201d Created and co-written by Morwenna Banks, who will also star in the show, Damned\u2019s other co-writer is Will Smith, whose credits include Armando Iannucci\u2019s Veep and The Thick Of It. It was previously made as a one-off comedy for Sky two years ago. Brand is a regular face alongside Jonathan Creek star Davies on BBC2\u2019s Stephen Fry panel show, QI. Her last high-profile series for Channel 4 was 10 years ago, the stand-up show Through The Cakehole. Damned will also star actor and comedian Kevin Eldon, star of Brass Eye and Nighty Night who recently appeared in HBO\u2019s Game of Thrones, along with Himesh Patel (EastEnders), Georgie Glen (Waterloo Road), Marjorie Yates (Shameless) and British Comedy Award winner Aisling Bea. Nerys Evans, deputy head of comedy at Channel 4, said Damned was a \u201cbrilliant bittersweet series [that] highlights some of the challenges and dilemmas facing frontline social workers in this time of austerity. \u201cThe characters are warm, honest and human and often have their own set of challenges outside the office as well.\u201d Brand recently returned to the role of nurse Kim Wilde in a sequel to Getting On, called Going Forward, co-starring Omid Djalili.            Producer Claire Whalley said the sitcom would \u201cbring humour to some of life\u2019s most difficult and challenging subjects and to create a fresh, new comedy which comes out of the real world\u201d. Jointly commissioned with Channel 4\u2019s head of comedy, Phil Clarke, the new series begins filming next month. It is made by independent producer What Larks Productions. Channel 4 said Damned would be based around the lives of two jaded social workers, played by Brand and Davies \u201cswimming against a tide of bureaucracy and pedantry, and contending with the absurdities and irrationalities of life in a county council office\u201d.",
