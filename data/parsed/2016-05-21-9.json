Teenage hooliganism is nothing new. Youth clubs have been smashed up and street battles fought before now, without provoking speeches from MPs and moral outrage from magistrates. Indeed it is difficult to know what is more depressing: the violent behaviour of the youngsters or the self-righteous reaction of some adults. But two serious questions remain. The first is whether the affrays at Brighton, Bournemouth and Margate, like the earlier ones at Clacton, signal some new development of which society should be aware. The other question is how we can prevent such incidents from recurring. It is clearly undesirable that hordes of teenagers should invade seaside resorts in search of trouble \u2013 whether as jokers, spectators or participants. Key quote \u200b\u201cThrough the high gloss of the older Hemingway\u2019s retrospection we can see a young man who was brash, perhaps, but also brave, honest and passionate.

Both America and China have a heavy emotional investment in their present policies. But at least de Gaulle\u2019s initiative offers them the hope of escaping from a situation which is becoming increasingly dangerous to the peace of the world.
