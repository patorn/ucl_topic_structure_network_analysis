  "body": "Kristen Stewart has said that she would \u201ckill\u201d to work with Lars von Trier. Stewart confessed to her love for von Trier to the Guardian while discussing Allen\u2019s Cannes-opener, Caf\u00e9 Society. Speaking at a press event for Cafe Society, Stewart was asked which film-makers she was keen to work with and said: \u201cI love Lars von Trier. It\u2019s hard for me to think of those things and I\u2019m reluctant to say [who] because they follow you around. Seems horse before the cart. But I would kill to work for Lars von Trier.\u201d  Since breaking out in David Fincher\u2019s Panic Room in 2002, Stewart has continued to align herself with a strong array of directors, including most recently Woody Allen and Olivier Assayas, who both have films at the Cannes film festival starring the Twilight actor.   Related: Kristen Stewart: 'Sometimes I do feel a bit like I have my limbs cut off'    The Danish auteur fits the bill: he\u2019s a Palme d\u2019Or winning and Oscar-nominated film-maker - but he\u2019s also among the industry\u2019s most controversial figures, following his Nazi jokes while promoting Melancholia at Cannes in 2011. Female actors have done well by working with von Trier: Emily Watson earned an Oscar nomination for his 1996 drama Breaking the Waves; Bj\u00f6rk won at Cannes in 2000 for her performance in Palme d\u2019Or winner Dancer in the Dark; ditto Kirsten Dunst for 2011\u2019s Melancholia.

The Guardian\u2019s Peter Bradshaw called her \u201ctremendous\u201d in the film.  The film marks her second collaboration with Assayas, following 2014\u2019s Cannes competition entry Clouds of Sils Maria. Her role in that drama earned Stewart a C\u00e9sar award (France\u2019s equivalent to an Academy award) for best actress, making her the first American actor to net the honour.",
