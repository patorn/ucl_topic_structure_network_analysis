As traditional banks have floundered, so demand for new methods of funding has risen. The Pushing Boundaries report by Nesta says that alternative finance, which includes a range of non-traditional online fundraising methods, has evolved from a \u201cfew plucky startups\u201d in 2010, to an industry worth over \u00a33.2bn in 2015. Furthermore, 2016 is the year the alternative goes mainstream, the report predicts. Crowdfunding platforms such as Crowdcube, Kickstarter and Seedrs are now central to many business plans. The ability to pitch a business plan online and receive funding, in return for either equity or rewards, is an enticing idea for entrepreneurs that need investment. But entrepreneurs must understand that crowdfunding is not easy money. There are significant costs and responsibilities involved and success is far from guaranteed.    Related: Crowdfunding is music to the ears for small businesses    Luke Davis, co-founder of Crowdfinders, organises crowdfunding events and co-founded Money & Co with CEO Nicola Horlick. Davis advises entrepreneurs to hone their pitches to perfection before posting online. \u201cMost people have a short attention span, so it\u2019s important to get the pertinent points across quickly and in a confident manner,\u201d says Davis. \u201cCite what the product is and why consumers need it, detail the principles of the business, the traction the business has had so far and how scalable the company could be.\u201d  Consumer products tend to be more attractive to the public than B2B propositions. Among the most successful pitches are food and drink brands. New breweries such as Brewdog and Camden Town Brewery, as well as wine makers such as Chapel Down, have all boosted their profiles and cash reserves with crowdfunding. Demand for beer and wine is so intense that there are dedicated crowdfunding sites for them: CrowdBrewed and Fundovino, respectively.  For non-alcoholic businesses, a strong and easily identifiable consumer brand is also the key to success. David Atkinson, founder of the Yorkshire Meatball Company, recently raised \u00a3130,000 via Crowdcube to invest in his Harrogate-based restaurant and retail products. But, as Atkinson and others attest, successful crowdfunding involves a substantial amount of marketing and pitching prior to launch. Simply put, entrepreneurs should line up investors before they go live.  \u201cWe were advised that you need to have identified a third of the funds beforehand from friends, family and investors,\u201d says Atkinson. \u201cThen, you expect that the platform and its membership will provide a third, and then there\u2019s your customer network to provide the rest.\u201d Atkinson says he didn\u2019t have \u201cthe third from investors, friends and family\u201d but put his customer database to work and hired a PR and marketing company to get their story out there. Crucially, Atkinson spent several months speaking to investors and preparing the pitch. \u201cYou have to realise there\u2019s a huge amount of work in crowdfunding,\u201d he says. \u201cYou get emails from potential investors, you answer their questions and then they might only invest \u00a310. Some don\u2019t invest anything.\u201d  Crowdfunding platforms have attracted the attention of academics. Psychologist Dr Mark Earls spoke at a recent Crowdfinders event at the Royal Institution and took issue with the idea that investment decisions are always rational. \u201cWe are much less like Mr Spock in Star Trek than we think we are. He\u2019s rational, considered and intellectual. We are far more like Captain Kirk: impulsive, intuitive, illogical, emotional,\u201d he said. Earls argues that human beings tend to \u201coutsource their decision making\u201d to others \u2013 we seek recommendations, the opinions of experts, copy the behaviours of others and very often \u201cfollow the herd\u201d. Therefore, crowdfunding relies on the appearance of success and popularity, Earls says. \u201cPopularity and creating a buzz is really important for a fundraising programme.\u201d   Related: Inside the mind of tech investors: what are they looking for?    Crowdfunding entrepreneurs and platforms will talk about the importance of not getting \u201cstuck on the sandbank\u201d. But for bigger fundraisers, this will in practice mean that an entrepreneur might need to get a major backer lined up prior to launching their campaign. This might be an existing shareholder, or the business may require the help of a private investor, otherwise known as a business angel. Bill Morrow is the co-founder of Angels Den, which connects entrepreneurs with private investors. He says the growth of alternative finance is \u201cstaggering\u201d, but has some reservations and concerns about crowdfunding, which he believes lacks sufficient legal protections for the investor. He also warns entrepreneurs to ensure they really understand all of the terms and conditions on a platform before signing up. \u201cCrowdfunding platforms are not all the same. You need to understand what those legal terms actually mean,\u201d he says. Morrow adds that entrepreneurs need mentorship more than they do finance. This means that finding a business angel and raising money, be it through crowdfunding or by private means, is not just about getting the cash, but about getting the business heading in the right direction.  \u201cThere\u2019s so much money out there. You will be able to raise capital, but raising capital isn\u2019t the end of the game,\u201d says Morrow. \u201cWhat businesses ask for is money, but what they need is mentorship \u2013 contacts, business experience and then, after that, they need the money.\u201d Raising money from angels and the crowd have many things in common. But the main thing for the business owner is to be able to present a sensible and straightforward pitch that defines their business in terms anyone can understand. Five tips for success in crowdfunding  Define your proposition and hone your pitch. Spell out simply what you want the money for. Research the platforms carefully \u2013 they are not all the same. Calculate the costs of the fundraising \u2013 don\u2019t forget legal fees. Be sure this is the best route for you \u2013 there\u2019s no going back.
