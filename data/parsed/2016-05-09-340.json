  "body": "Invictus Games 2016 7.30pm and 8.30pm, BBC1 Taking place in Orlando, Florida, and continuing all week, the Invictus Games offers the chance for servicemen and women who have suffered life-changing combat injuries to compete across a range of sports. Former US president George W Bush \u2013 ironically, some might say \u2013 is honorary chair of these games. Today\u2019s opening events include the cycling, while former Royal Marine JJ Chalmers, who was himself severely injured by a Taliban bomb, meets athletes from the teams of the 14 countries taking part. David Stubbs Choose the Right Puppy for You 8pm, BBC2 Apparently, getting a young dog involves an \u201cextraordinary journey\u201d. Really? Let\u2019s settle for \u201cbig decision\u201d, and welcome the help of Kate Humble and pooch behaviourist Louise Glazebrook, who offer tips to wannabe puppy owners. \u201cDo your research\u201d is the overriding advice, as they take on subjects such as hair shedding (grooming a German shepherd produces a \u201chair mountain\u201d), doggy energy levels and the lifetime cost of ownership of different breeds (\u00a330,495 for a great dane). Jonathan Wright Game of Thrones 9pm, Sky Atlantic As predicted by, well, everyone, a certain Lord Commander of the Night\u2019s Watch returned to his old stomping ground last week. But what now for Jon Snow and the miscreants stationed at Castle Black? In King\u2019s Landing, full-on religious insurrection is brewing, so milquetoast King Tommen confronts the High Sparrow before things get out of hand. Meanwhile, Arya \u2013 after weeks of being hit by a big stick \u2013 is allowed to continue her training at the House of Black and White. Gwilym Mumford Nev\u2019s Indian Call Centre 9pm, W Will Nev Wilshire\u2019s world of impromptu air-guitar sessions and mandatory banter translate to India? This new series sees the star of BBC3\u2019s The Call Centre move part of his operation to Delhi in order to circumvent UK cold-calling laws. Nev\u2019s relentless effrontery wears everyone down in the end, but the culture clash element is tiresomely overplayed, while the economic imbalances that make this move viable aren\u2019t explored. Swansea\u2019s loss is Delhi\u2019s loss, too. Phil Harrison Upstart Crow 10pm, BBC2 What\u2019s in a name? When it\u2019s Ben Elton, quite a lot, considering his new sitcom marks the writer\u2019s return to a historical setting for the first time since Blackadder. The principal character in this comedy should offer more meticulous wordplay than Bladders could: the action revolves around one William Shakespeare (David Mitchell). Sadly, this veers towards Elton\u2019s insufferable The Wright Way, with double-entendre-strewn dialogue masking a distinct lack of laughs. Mark Gibbings-Jones Very British Problems 10pm, Channel 4 This harmless take on the Grumpy Old Men-style talking heads show enters a second series. The thesis of the series is this: comedians and celebrities celebrate the social awkwardness that is held to be representatively British. This opening episode focuses on school: unfathomably enduring nicknames, playground meanness and the difficulties of fitting in. Standup comic Romesh Ranganathan nails the latter with his account of attending a comprehensive school \u2013 but doing so with a public school accent. John Robinson Random Acts 11.05pm, Channel 4 The experimental short film showcase returns, now with an actual host: cult US comic Eric Wareheim, most recently seen co-starring with Aziz Ansari in Master of None. Wareheim\u2019s deadpan links can make Random Acts seem like a bizarrely mutated episode of You\u2019ve Been Framed! but the real stars are the films, including a pulsing, reptilian collage from the Chapman brothers and poet Hollie McNish\u2019s takedown of a sex-saturated culture that frowns on breastfeeding in public. Graeme Virtue Film choice The Producers (Mel Brooks, 1968) 11am, Film4 The original film, from which they made a show, then another, much inferior film. This is Brooks\u2019s first and funniest movie, with Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder as fixers aiming to stage the worst musical in Broadway history, then pocket the production money they\u2019ve charmed out of various rich women. So it\u2019s Springtime For Hitler, a show so tasteless it is guaranteed to fail (\u201cDon\u2019t be dumb, be a smarty/Come and join the Nazi party\u201d) in one outrageous night. Only it\u2019s a raging success, and the backers are soon clamouring for their profits \u2026 Paul Howlett Live sport IPL Cricket: Kings XI Punjab v Royal Challengers BangaloreFrom the Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium in Nagpur. 3pm, Sky Sports 2 Uefa European Under-17s Championship Football: France v EnglandThe Group C fixture, which takes place in Baku, Azerbaijan. 4.45pm, Eurosport 1 Elite League Speedway: Coventry Bees v Wolverhampton WolvesFrom the Brandon Stadium. 7.30pm, Sky Sports 1",
