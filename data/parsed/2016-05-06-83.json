  "body": "\u201cI\u2019ve got a pipe in my mouth,\u201d said the German artist Ulay (pronounced \u201cOoh-lie\u201d), speaking on the phone from New York City. \u201cUsually, I\u2019m smoking all the time, but I\u2019m smoke-free during an interview.\u201d That\u2019s typical for this well-known performance artist \u2013 he hasn\u2019t lost his playful, or courteous, spirit. The former collaborator and partner of Marina Abramovi\u0107 for more than a decade in the 1970s and 1980s, Ulay (born Uwe Laysiepen) returns to New York City this week for his first performance there in 30 years.   Related: Ulay v Marina: how art's power couple went to war    \u201cPeople always asked me if I would do performance again,\u201d Ulay said. \u201cThe answer was always the same: I am not old enough. Now I am 72, I am old enough. I don\u2019t want to perform in the perfect body. I\u2019m unable to reach \u2018the ultimate\u2019 or \u2018the perfect\u2019. Ageing is imperfect and that\u2019s what\u2019s going on right now.\u201d On Friday night, Ulay will perform at Kustera Projects Red Hook for a Frieze art fair piece entitled Water Mark. A collaborative artwork with Slovenian artist Ja\u0161a, who is building an installation called Cutting Through the Clouds of Myth, Ulay\u2019s water-themed performance is a comment on the privatization of water. \u201cIt\u2019s a crime,\u201d said the artist. \u201cSafe drinking water should be accessible to everybody. It\u2019s totally unacceptable.\u201d It\u2019s no secret that Ulay isn\u2019t a fan of rehearsing \u2013 the plan is to have no plan. \u201cI never rehearse performances and I never rehearse interviews, either. It\u2019s about spontaneity \u2013 no rules, no time limits, no substitution.\u201d A strategic partner of the We.Are institute project is New Water Culture, a nonprofit devoted to protecting the planet\u2019s water (which has an artist\u2019s list of collaborators including John Baldessari, Marcel Dzama and Marilyn Minter). The work is produced by Rosa Lux, who is Ulay\u2019s Slovenian stepdaughter. Since Lux is a frequent collaborator of Ja\u0161a, a Slovenian artist who represented his native country at the Venice Biennale in 2015, he\u2019s creating a site-specific installation for Ulay\u2019s performance which involves text and architecture. Since the 1970s, Ulay has been a pioneer in performance art and experimental photography, and his relation works with Abramovi\u0107 from 1976 to 1988 explored the tensions of the relationships between women and men. In AAA AAA the couple screamed in one another\u2019s faces for a long period of time; Relation in Space saw them slam into each other with painful force, and in Rest Energy, Ulay held a bow and arrow with its string tensed, aimed at his wife\u2019s abdomen. The art duo split in 1988 with one last tragic artwork called The Lovers, where they walked toward each other along the 2,500km Great Wall of China until they met and finally parted. \u201cPrior to my collaboration to MA,\u201d said Ulay, which is how he refers to Abramovi\u0107, \u201cI had done performances. Then I stopped doing performances for some time. I picked up performance again at the St\u00e4del Museum in Amsterdam last February and I enjoy it tremendously. It came with age.\u201d From the 90s onward, when Ulay wasn\u2019t doing performance work, he turned to environmental issues, specifically water, as a topic. \u201cWater popped up in my head when I stopped doing performances,\u201d says the artist. \u201cI was looking for a substitute of the body, I came to water. Our bodies are 72% water, our brains are 90% water, we live on a planet which is 72% water on the surface, so water is a substitute to the human body.\u201d Ulay is the founder of the Earth Water Catalogue, an online archive of water-related artworks built in 2012, and has created public artworks such as Whose Water is It?, a neon phrase written on the side of a water tower in Maribor, Slovenia. \u201cThe number of water activists is increasing because of the privatization of water resources,\u201d says Ulay. \u201c\u2018Sustainability\u2019 is an expensive word; water is not sustainable. There is a certain amount of saltwater. Our liquid excrements are salty, we can\u2019t drink saltwater. Unless we have a good policy and good control over it, rather than multinational control over it, only a limited number of people will have access to clean water.\u201d According to water.org, every 90 seconds a child dies from a water-related disease, which affects more 1.5 billion people annually. Unicef claims that 6,000 children die of water-related diseases a day, including diarrheal diseases and malaria, while water, sanitation and hygiene-related disease kills roughly a million people a year. \u201cOne of the biggest problems on planet Earth is population explosion, food supply or water, is not enough to feed all people,\u201d Ulay says. \u201cOur life-nourishing reserve is absolutely limited. Nothing lasts forever and neither do we.\u201d Ulay also made a 2013 documentary called Project Cancer; he had lymphatic cancer, from which he recovered from in 2014. \u201cMy oncologist told me my life expectancy was four to six months, it was shocking,\u201d Ulay said. \u201cI worked myself out of it, I\u2019m really lucky.\u201d Even though this is Ulay\u2019s first performance in New York in three decades, some could say he \u201cperformed\u201d when he visited Abramovi\u0107 at the Museum of Modern Art in 2010 for the opening of her exhibition, The Artist is Present. (The work saw members of the public sit opposite Abramovi\u0107 and lock eyes.)  Ulay doesn\u2019t agree with this interpretation. \u201cNo, my attitude was not to do a performance, it was very sporadic,\u201d he said. \u201cI was invited by the MoMA as honorable guest for the opening. MA was seated at her table and her gallerist Sean Kelly grabbed my arm and said \u2018You are next.\u2019 I was not prepared to do so, but I was willing. It was a very touching moment, but it was totally sporadic.\u201d            That fairytale moment ended when Ulay filed a lawsuit against Abramovi\u0107 last year for violating a contract for their collaborated works from 1999. But maybe they\u2019re on good terms? Since Ulay went to Abramovi\u0107\u2019s MoMA opening, is there a chance she might come to his show? \u201cI don\u2019t think so, I don\u2019t know,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s welcome, though. It would be great!\u201d  ULAY & JA\u0160A: Cutting Through the Clouds of Myth opens 6 May and runs until 1 June at Kustera Projects Red Hook This article, and the subheading was amended on 19 May 2016 to make clear that this is Ulay\u2019s first performance in 30 years in New York, not his first anywhere in that time, and to clarify some details of his project.",
