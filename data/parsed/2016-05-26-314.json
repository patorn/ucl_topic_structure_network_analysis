  "body": "\u201cI\u2019ve always taken our right to freedom of movement for granted, and it\u2019s only now this is being threatened that I realise how truly valuable it is,\u201d says Natalie Collins, a British master\u2019s student who worked as a teacher in Italy last year. Her feeling of insecurity surrounding the Brexit issue is echoed by the 1.22 million Britons already living and working in other EU countries, and the 2.9 million European expats in the UK. If Britain were to leave after 23 June, she and many others fear it would make it much more difficult to work abroad. But Roland Smith, a fellow at UK think tank the Adam Smith Institute, doesn\u2019t think Collins has anything to worry about. \u201cNothing will happen to them; everything will be as before,\u201d he says. Why is he so sure? Because he believes the only viable option after a Brexit would be to join the European Economic Area (EEA), which would maintain the single market \u2013 meaning free movement of goods, services, capital and of course, persons between the remaining member states. So this would have the least effect on UK migrants already working in EU states. It\u2019s what Catherine Barnard, professor in European Union law at Cambridge university, refers to as \u201cdoing a Norway\u201d (the country has remained in the EEA despite voting in 1994 to reject EU membership). Free movement is preserved, so British workers would continue to have equal treatment abroad as would EU workers in the UK. But while some such as Smith are adamant this would be the only viable option if the country were to vote leave, the leave campaign\u2019s frontmen, Michael Gove and Boris Johnson, are both adamant that Britain would be better off outside the single market. After all, immigration and free movement have been at the heart of the EU debate for some time.  It has also been argued that being a member of the EEA means \u201cwe pay but have no say\u201d. Norway is still the 10th biggest budget contributor, but doesn\u2019t participate in decision-making in Brussels although it has to abide by its policies. This would not appeal to many Brexit supporters who long for more sovereignty. If Britain did leave the single market, it\u2019s possible that the UK could make bilateral agreements with EU member states, which could include free movement of persons, such as Switzerland\u2019s deal. But after a Swiss referendum in 2014 where the country voted in favour of quotas for EU migrants, it\u2019s hard to believe that free movement would be guaranteed if Britain went down this route.   Related: Work after Brexit: the biggest winners and losers for UK jobs    Barnard believes many Britons will be put off moving abroad to work in EU states because \u201cUK workers will no longer be able to rely on any EU-related rights\u201d if there\u2019s a \u201cpure\u201d Brexit (leaving the single market). Without these EU rights, potential expats would have to rely on domestic immigration law. And the reality may be that highly skilled workers will be the most desirable, meaning low-skilled labourers will have the most difficulty getting visas to work abroad.  \u201cAs a Brit I take for granted how easy it is to move and work here [Germany]. Legally it\u2019s no more difficult than moving within the UK,\u201d says Tom Cox, who\u2019s been living and working as a freelance journalist in Berlin for the last four months. \u201cWith a Brexit, British expats would be shunted from the \u2018welcome\u2019 to the \u2018questionable\u2019 pile. I\u2019m worried because I\u2019d have to apply for a visa to work in Berlin, and there\u2019s always a risk of rejection.\u201d However, Barnard emphasises that UK migrants needn\u2019t panic. \u201cEven if there\u2019s a vote to leave on 23 June, it won\u2019t look any different on 24 June,\u201d she says. \u201cIn terms of rights for people, nothing will change until the article 50 process has been completed, and there\u2019s a two-year negotiating period.\u201d (Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty allows member states to withdraw from the union.) So for the near future at least, working migrants would be protected under existing EU laws. John Springford, a senior research fellow at the Centre for European Reform echoes Barnard\u2019s sentiments. \u201cThose who have already left the UK are probably going to have their rights respected,\u201d he says. There is also an argument that anyone who has already moved has vested rights under international law. \u201cThere are alternative safety nets,\u201d Barnard says. All EU states are signatories of the European Convention on Human Rights \u2013 separate to EU law \u2013 so anyone working in members states will have protection under the European Convention, \u201cwhich means they can\u2019t be just promptly deported\u201d. So for British expats who moved to EU member states before 23 June it\u2019s likely that little will change in terms of their jobs and right to work \u2013 at least for the foreseeable future. But without knowing what negotiations would take if Britain were to vote leave, many people will have to come to terms with this uncertainty. Looking for a job?
