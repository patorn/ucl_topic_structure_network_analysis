The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, speaking after the polls closed at 10pm, said: \u201cLabour has fought a strong campaign, working hard for every vote, standing up for working people who have been let down by the Tory party.\u201d He stressed that Labour\u2019s key target was to cut the Conservatives\u2019 lead in the national share of the vote. \u201cIf we can narrow that gap, we will demonstrate steady progress,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we are looking to do is build over the next four years so that we steadily, steadily build our support and then we are ready for 2020.\u201d But with more than half of the results from local government elections in England counted, Labour had lost control of 43 seats. The party was facing a torrid night in Scotland, with results so far suggesting it had been pushed into third place behind the SNP and the Conservatives. Labour\u2019s share of the vote was also down in Wales.     John McDonnell talks with young Labour party members ahead of the elections.

The MP for Dudley, Ian Austin, a former minister, said: \u201cWe should be making real progress across the country \u2013 including winning back disaffected Labour voters who chose the Tories or Ukip in 2015. We\u2019ve been working really hard here in Dudley and we need to win hundreds of seats elsewhere.\u201d Alison McGovern, chair of the Progress group of MPs, said: \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be losing any councils. Labour is providing real leadership in the face of grim Tory incompetence and austerity. We can\u2019t afford to start losing that.\u201d   Local election results graphic   Sadiq Khan was widely expected to win the London mayoral race, after a bitter campaign in which the Conservative candidate, Zac Goldsmith, suggested he was a \u201cradical\u201d. Khan had sought to distance himself from Corbyn during the campaign, including criticising his failure to \u201cget a grip\u201d on antisemitism. But the shadow international development secretary, Diane Abbott, who is a key ally of Corbyn, told the Guardian that in the capital \u201cmore people have heard of Jeremy than have heard of Sadiq. In London, it\u2019s all about Jeremy.\u201d     Diane Abbott: \u2018In London, it\u2019s all about Jeremy.\u2019 Photograph: Jeff Overs/BBC/PA    Andrew Boff, the Conservative leader on the Greater London Assembly, criticised Goldsmith\u2019s campaign. He told the BBC\u2019s Newsnight it had \u201cdone real damage\u201d and had \u201cblown up\u201d bridges the Conservative party had built with London\u2019s Muslim communities. Elections expert Prof John Curtice told the BBC that early indications, from councils including Sunderland and Newcastle, suggested \u201ca clear drop in the Labour vote since 2012 and 2011, while being better than in 2015\u201d. Jonathan Carr-West, chief executive of the thinktank Local Government Information Unit (LGIU) said: \u201cSo far, Labour are holding safe councils (Newcastle, Liverpool, Sunderland and Halton) - but we expect to see them losing significant numbers of seats as the night progresses. To put this in context, the last time these councils were contested Labour gained 823 seats. \u201cWhile a Khan victory will be spun as the story of the night, the reality is that no opposition has lost councils seats in this way for thirty years.\u201d In Scotland, Alex Salmond, the former SNP leader, suggested Labour could be driven into third place, and the SNP could even win a clean sweep in Glasgow, pushing Corbyn\u2019s party out of what was once a traditional stronghold. The Liberal Democrats were the first party to win a Holyrood seat, when sitting MSP Liam McArthur held one of the party\u2019s only two constituencies with a substantial 4,500 vote majority in Orkney over the SNP. That was quickly followed by the first defeat for Labour as James Kelly failed to hold his seat, with the Scottish National party winning by a 3,770 vote majority. With counting under way across Scotland, Scottish Labour sources are braced for a very difficult night and believe they have clear evidence that the open feuding over alleged antisemitism in the party in London has had a direct impact on its vote in Scotland.   Scottish election results graphic   In Wales, a poll carried out for ITV suggested Ukip had performed well, with the EU referendum campaign forcing the issue of immigration up the agenda. The party, which has poured resources into the battle in Wales, was projected to take up to eight of the 60 seats in the Welsh assembly. Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader, described it as a \u201cbreakthrough night\u201d for his party. Elsewhere in the country, Labour faces a testing day on Friday as the results are declared, and there were signs even from among Corbyn\u2019s core supporters on the Labour frontbench on Thursday night that there is growing disquiet about his style of leadership, and whether his team have the right skills to manage the party. The former Labour health secretary Andy Burnham confirmed during the evening that he was seriously considering standing as the mayor of greater Manchester, when elections are held next year as a battery of new powers are devolved to the city as part of George Osborne\u2019s \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d.

Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images    Burnham\u2019s allies insisted that he would remain in the shadow cabinet, and continue to serve Corbyn, for the time being, but the news will underline fears that Labour big beasts with governing experience could decide to leave Westminster rather than wait for the party to win back power. There were also two byelections in safe Labour seats: Ogmore in Wales, where Huw Irranca-Davies stepped down to contest a Welsh assembly seat, and Sheffield Brightside, where the sitting MP, Harry Harpham, died earlier this year. Several other cities, including Salford, will elect mayors, and 41 police and crime commissioners will be selected. Labour insiders will be picking over the results for evidence of whether Corbyn\u2019s anti-austerity message is helping the party to make progress towards a general election victory in 2020. The Scottish Tory leader, Ruth Davidson, confidently predicted her party will come second, and Scottish Labour\u2019s leader, Kezia Dugdale, is now facing the possible embarrassment of guiding her party to third place at a Holyrood election, putting Labour behind the Tories in Scotland for the first time in more than a century. That would immediately raise challenges to her continued leadership of the party and fuel further attacks on Corbyn\u2019s leadership at UK level. Shadow ministerial sources said there was very little chance of a coup against Corbyn until after the EU referendum poll on 23 June, however. One said Dan Jarvis and Angela Eagle both appeared to be \u201corganising hard\u201d and people associated with them were having \u201chypothetical conversations\u201d with MPs about support if they were to challenge Corbyn. One Labour MP said the only exception to that would be if Sadiq Khan loses in London, the party loses control in Wales and comes third in Scotland in a toxic combination of bad results that could trigger shadow cabinet resignations. The Conservatives will also be watching the electoral map carefully, to gauge whether their own loyal voters have been turned off by David Cameron\u2019s enthusiastic endorsement of the remain campaign for the forthcoming EU referendum, which will follow just weeks after Thursday\u2019s polls.",
