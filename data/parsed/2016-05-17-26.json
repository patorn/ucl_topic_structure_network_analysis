  "body": "Even in the mining states of Queensland and Western Australia, most voters support phasing out subsidies for fossil fuel industries, two new polls show. Fossil fuel companies receive about $7.7bn a year in subsidies and tax breaks \u2013 most of which is a fuel tax credit, which the industry denies is a subsidy. In Western Australia, 78.1% of respondents supported either ending the subsidies now or phasing them out over time. Among undecided voters, the number was even higher, with 80.3% saying they supported either ending the subsidies or phasing them out. In Queensland the figures were similar, with 76.6% supporting the immediate or gradual ending of fossil fuel subsidies and 75.9% of undecided voters agreeing. Only 11.9% of voters in Western Australia and 13.2% in Queensland said they did not support ending fossil fuel subsidies.   Related: Insurance companies feel activists' heat for underwriting fossil fuels    The polling was conducted on 1 May 2016 by ReachTEL. It surveyed 1,203 people in Western Australia and 1,241 Queenslanders. It was commissioned by WWF-Australia, GetUp and the Australian Conservation Foundation. The margin of error was 3%. A WWF-Australia spokeswoman, Kellie Caught, said getting rid of the subsidies was \u201cnot only good for the planet, it\u2019s also a no-brainer in terms of budget repair\u201d. \u201cFossil fuel subsidies cause harm, stifle innovation and divest billions of dollars that would be better invested in renewable energy, job creation and the environment,\u201d she said. Caught said the poll showed that the arguments made by the mining industry no longer persuaded the public. \u201cThe poll finds arguments made in support of continuing fossil fuel subsidies, in particular by the mining industry, no longer stack up. Everyone should do their fair share for the future of the planet and the next generation.\u201d The chief executive of the Australian Conservation Foundation, Kelly O\u2019Shanassy took aim at the $5.5bn of the subsidies in fuel tax credits.  \u201cWhile most Australians pay almost 40 cents in tax for each litre of fuel they buy, big mining companies pay no tax at all on the fuel they use,\u201d she said. \u201cThis senseless subsidy is damaging the environment and holding back innovation \u2013 it should be consigned to the rubbish bin of history. \u201cThe fuel tax credits scheme is a dinosaur subsidy from last century that allows multinational mining companies to effectively get their diesel for free and discourages them from making their operations more efficient.\u201d  The Minerals Council maintains the fuel tax credit is a legitimate tax deduction, avoiding them paying tax twice on fuel.",
