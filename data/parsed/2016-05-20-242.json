  "body": "The first time I met Nigel Farage, in 2013, he boasted that within five years Ukip would have \u201cchanged the face of British politics\u201d. It seemed an almost comic ambition for a party that was then still \u2013 as its leader cheerfully conceded \u2013 a ragbag of embarrassing \u201ceccentrics\u201d. I recall us perching on desks in a sliver of office staffed by a solitary aide who appeared to fit the description. The second time we met, in 2014, Farage was thronged by a great crowd of supporters, flanked by security, and clearly on course to win the Euro elections. The swivel-eyed faithful were still very much in evidence, though, and following his seventh consecutive failure to win a Westminster seat last year, the pantomime of Farage\u2019s resignation and shambolic reinstatement three days later suggested a political force that had peaked and imploded into farce. Some maverick signifiers still endure. Our latest interview is punctuated by regular fag breaks, Farage looks forward wistfully to a post-referendum PFL (\u201cProper Farage Lunch,\u201d of the strictly liquid variety), and he shudders about the ghastliness of political types (\u201cso dishonest\u201d). But this time we meet in a busy Westminster office charged with purposeful intent, where a boardroom meeting is underway, attended by the party\u2019s first newly elected GLA members, one of whom is mixed race, and the other gay. Keyboards thrum, telephones buzz, everyone is in suits. All eyes are now on a prize Ukip could once only dream of. To feel affection for Farage is an increasingly confronting experience. He tells me he would rather vote for Donald Trump than Hillary Clinton, had no problem with the Tories\u2019 smear campaign against Sadiq Khan save for Zac Goldsmith\u2019s squeamish failure to see the strategy through, and thinks Marine Le Pen is \u201cdoing a very good job\u201d. Friends tend to be appalled when I confess to liking him, and I can see why. But it is very difficult to dislike any politician who is well into his third lengthy interview before he tells a lie.           Nigel Farage: \u2018You wanted to rub our noses in diversity\u2019    I\u2019m certain it\u2019s his first, because he executes the untruth so amateurishly that had he ever tried before I don\u2019t think I could have failed to notice. It comes when I ask if he spoke to Boris Johnson while the former mayor was making up his mind which side to take. \u201cNo, no.\u201d Why won\u2019t he look at me? \u201cI\u2019d never lie to you,\u201d he protests. He is blushing. \u201cNo I\u2019m not!\u201d He did encourage Johnson, didn\u2019t he? \u201cI\u2019m encouraging them all.\u201d I tell him he is a terrible liar and he reddens even deeper and laughs guiltily. \u201cWell, yes, a lot of people have said that.\u201d Whatever one\u2019s opinion of Farage, the indisputable if extraordinary fact is that he has single-handedly forced a referendum that has brought this country to the brink of Brexit. When he claims that, whichever way we vote on 23 June, he will have fulfilled his promise to change the face of British politics, he may well be right. The funny thing is that, with only 33 days to go, he is both thrilled to bits and thoroughly fed up.   Related: They wanted to gag Nigel Farage. Now Tory Outers sound like him | Andrew Rawnsley    The principal source of his misery is his own side. For six months now, he says, the \u201ccretins\u201d in charge of operations at Vote Leave have been bad-mouthing him. \u201cThey brief every day that I\u2019m toxic, I put voters off, and there is absolutely no statistical evidence to back that up at all. Quite the opposite, in fact. It\u2019s crackers to think that you can win a referendum campaign with Boris and the likes of the cabinet. You can\u2019t. North of Coventry I would have more impact at getting people out to vote than they would, simple as that. You know, 37% of those who voted last year voted Tory, but a couple of million of them didn\u2019t do so with any love, did they? They did so just to stop that woman north of the border. That\u2019s what it was all about. So, do I have an important role to play in terms of getting voters out? Yes, I do, of course I do.\u201d ITV\u2019s choice of Farage to debate with the prime minister has enraged Vote Leave, so I ask if he regards himself as the best candidate. \u201cI\u2019m not going to compare myself to any of the others,\u201d he says, sounding provocatively lofty. \u201cBut I do know the subject well. I\u2019ve been doing this for a long time.\u201d Party morale \u201cout in the country is very, very good. Within the party itself, not. In the upper echelons it\u2019s, well, difficult, you know. We have ex-Conservatives who look at the world differently to me.\u201d He is furious with Douglas Carswell, the party\u2019s only MP, who chose to join Vote Leave rather than the Grassroots Out campaign Ukip belongs to, and has called for his own leader to be sacked. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why he would join a party like ours, with me as leader, and then disagree with the way I do things, and want to sack not just me, but every party officer, everybody in this office.\u201d I wonder if he now feels that what had looked like a daring defection to Ukip was in fact Carswell\u2019s ruse to exploit a winnable seat. \u201cYou could argue that. I mean, Clacton was the No 1 seat in Britain for Ukip.\u201d     Ukip party morale \u2018out in the country is very, very good. Within the party itself, not. In the upper echelons it\u2019s, well, difficult\u2019 \u2026 Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    To make matters worse, \u201cwhy would he want to become the champion of Neil Hamilton? And say what a great man he is? Bizarre.\u201d To Farage\u2019s horror, the disgraced former Tory MP was elected to the Welsh Assembly earlier this month, and promptly usurped the party\u2019s Welsh group leader. \u201cDouglas has always advocated new politics, probity, transparency \u2013 this is his public image. And then he\u2019s chosen to be the champion of someone like Neil Hamilton! I really don\u2019t understand that.\u201d He consoles himself with the prediction that Hamilton\u2019s political resurrection won\u2019t last long before he disgraces himself again. \u201cHe\u2019ll do it to himself, it\u2019s alright.\u201d Worst of all, as Farage sees it, are the \u201capparatchiks\u201d at Vote Leave. He has no problem with the rival group\u2019s four senior Tory politicians. \u201cBut you\u2019ve got this weird setup where the tail is wagging the dog, where the apparatchiks at the centre are dictating the campaign. I don\u2019t think Mr Elliott and Mr Cummings [Matthew and Dominic, founder of the Taxpayers\u2019 Alliance and former special adviser to Michael Gove respectively] think I should exist. I find it very hard.\u201d If there is no evidence that Farage is toxic, why would they want to exclude him, when surely they all want the same outcome?   Related: Neil Hamilton: disgraced MP to Z-list celebrity to political comeback    \u201cOr do they? Do they? I think they\u2019re a bit more worried about who succeeds Cameron in No 10.\u201d I ask how much political positioning he detects in the Vote Leave campaign. \u201cI think there\u2019s quite a lot of it going on. Yes, I genuinely do. To a lot of political operators, this is just another campaign. To people like me, this is the campaign. So it\u2019s a different motivation. And I think there\u2019s a bit of hedging going on. \u201cThey\u2019re very scared of Ukip, you see. Because what happens if Farage is seen to play a big role in the referendum? And we win \u2013 or even worse, if we lose? What happens then? The doomsday scenario for these guys is that we lose the referendum 52/48, that I\u2019m seen to have played a big role in the referendum, that a third of the Tory party are irreconcilable with dodgy Dave, because they think he\u2019s pulled every trick in the book, he hasn\u2019t played with a straight bat, and a third of the Conservative party come and join me and Ukip. That is their doomsday scenario. Anything is better than that.\u201d Is he suggesting they would rather lose the referendum resoundingly, and see Farage\u2019s political capital and potential appeal discredited, than fight and risk a narrow defeat? \u201cYes.\u201d     \u2018I think there is a chance that this referendum could change British politics fundamentally\u2019 \u2026 Farage with fellow Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg. Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images    Despite all these frustrations, Farage brims with optimism. He believes anything is possible after 23 June. \u201cI think this referendum is something that could realign politics. Think back to 1975. That personal bitterness that came out between [Roy] Jenkins and [Tony] Benn never went away. It led to the SDP. I think there is a chance that this referendum could change British politics fundamentally.\u201d He is a huge Boris fan (\u201cOh God yes, God yes\u201d), Michael Gove is \u201cterrific\u201d and all four senior Tory leave campaigners \u201care using exactly the same words and phrases that I\u2019ve been using for decades. Listen to Chris Grayling saying, \u2018Will the French stop selling us wine and cheese?\u2019 All the sort of things I\u2019ve been coming out with for years!\u201d His big worry had been that they would make a \u201ctechnical argument\u201d to leave. \u201cBut now I think they\u2019re all singing the right tune.\u201d By which he means that they have started to talk about immigration. \u201cThey are beginning to realise that they\u2019ll lose this referendum otherwise. They\u2019re beginning to understand that it is the No 1 issue in British politics, and crucially amongst the undecided voters it is the issue.\u201d It is the single issue with which Farage says he has changed most voters\u2019 minds, and \u201cwhat has fuelled the growth of Ukip\u201d. He thinks the leave side\u2019s greatest asset is \u201cpassion\u201d \u2013 whereas the remain campaign\u2019s biggest weakness is \u201cno positivity. I mean literally none at all. There is nobody saying: \u2018The EU\u2019s fantastic, we love this flag, moving towards a full political union is fantastic.\u2019 Because they know the British public just don\u2019t want to hear it. So they can\u2019t say anything good about Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU. It\u2019s just the argument that if we left, the sky would fall in.\u201d The danger for the Remain camp is what Project Fear will do to turnout.

Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    \u201cPeople who\u2019ve made up their minds on our side of the argument, it\u2019s almost like a conversion. Once you\u2019ve decided, you believe in it strongly, you tell your friends and family, and you\u2019re more likely to go out and vote.\u201d By contrast, the remain line he hears from \u201cblokes in the bar \u2013 local businessmen, geezers running building companies, doing quite well\u201d is: \u201c\u2018Nigel, we kind of get the stuff about sovereignty and controlling our borders. But do you know what, business is good, got a nice house, lovely car.\u2019 And I think to myself: if they\u2019ve had a busy day at work they just might not be bothered to go down to the polling station and vote, because there\u2019s no passion. This is the effect of what Cameron\u2019s doing.\u201d Even more ominously compelling than his analysis is Farage\u2019s prediction that the referendum\u2019s result is becoming largely immaterial. Any realistic margin of victory the remain camp can hope for will still amount to a defeat, because \u201cthe EU is now doomed. It\u2019s doomed. It literally can\u2019t work.\u201d The tepidity of British support this campaign has confirmed will only hasten its demise. It has already triggered demand for referenda in other EU member states (\u201cFrance will have no choice but to hold one, to try and stop Le Pen\u201d) and whichever way we vote on 23 June, \u201cwithin a few years\u201d the European project will be finished. If Farage is right, he has already won. Victory has not come without its price. Security has become a necessary reality for himself and his family, and he looks miserable about it. \u201cI can\u2019t even discuss it, can I? Because whatever I say about security or my family brings them more problems in their lives.\u201d Are they under immense strain? \u201cIt\u2019s not good. Not good at all. And don\u2019t forget, we have a very unusual surname. There aren\u2019t many of us, so there isn\u2019t much of a hiding place for them, is there?\u201d I ask if his wife has resorted to using her maiden name. \u201cProbably.\u201d It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen him inhibited from being his usual exuberantly cavalier self, and he agrees that the campaign\u2019s pressures make it \u201cvery difficult to carry on being Nigel\u201d. How does that sit with him? \u201cNot very well. No, it\u2019s very tough.\u201d         Click to watch the video posted on Facebook by Leave.EU    I think the leave campaign must be making life very tough for Britain\u2019s immigrants too. The day before we met last week, Leave.eu released a video soundtracked by Donald Trump reading the lyrics of a song called The Snake, about a woman who takes in an injured snake which then fatally bites her, over footage of migrants scrambling into Europe. The video provoked widespread outrage \u2013 but when I ask Farage to comment, he says he hasn\u2019t seen it. \u201cNot interested.\u201d He must have read the coverage? \u201cHaven\u2019t read it. Too busy.\u201d In the face of some protest, I make him watch it on my phone, then invite him to comment. \u201cNo strong feeling.\u201d What does he think of it? \u201cNothing.\u201d It is clear from his demeanour that this is not true, but what he is feeling or thinking I cannot discern. Isn\u2019t this precisely the argument Farage has been urging fellow leave campaigners to make? \u201cWell, it depends how you put it, doesn\u2019t it? Are we at threat? Do we have an open door to terrorism in southern Europe? Yes we do. Is it madness, what the Germans have done? Yes.\u201d So he approves of the film? \u201cNo comment. I\u2019m fighting a Ukip campaign.\u201d   Related: Vote Leave may sideline Nigel Farage, but it can\u2019t live without him | Rafael Behr    All week I cannot get the video out of my mind. It is the most horrifying campaign material I have ever seen in this country; a longer version online builds to a chilling crescendo of clips of Isis jihadis, the Paris attacks, the crumbling twin towers and blood-stained rivers. It looks like a piece of 1930s Nazi propaganda. I no longer know how to feel about Farage, so I phone him and ask again, how did it make him feel? \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t feel very easy watching it,\u201d he admits, to my relief. \u201cIt all depends on what our intention is, doesn\u2019t it? Is our longterm intention a slightly more settled society that is integrated and at ease with itself? Or do we want race war? What is our intention? Mine is not to perpetuate division.\u201d Farage has come closer to leading Britain out of Europe than I suspect even he ever dreamed. I fear he does not know what he has done.",
