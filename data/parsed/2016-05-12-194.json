  "body": "\u201cFor me, everything came together at the right time,\u201d says Mark Burton, the head brewer at the Cambridge Brew House. \u201cThe company I was working for went into administration, I needed to make money immediately, so I turned my garage into a brewery and started selling to Cambridge free houses. I did that for a couple of years and then this job came up.\u201d Late last year, the government declared that Britain was a \u201cbrewing powerhouse\u201d, with three breweries opening a week. The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA) estimates that by the end of 2015, there were about 1,800 breweries in the UK.  The number of pubs in Britain is in decline, but a particular type of pub \u2013 the brewpub \u2013 seems to be bucking the trend. Any pub that brews its own beer on the premises is classed as a brewpub, and there are thought to be about 300 in the UK, according to Quaffale, a website tracking new openings.  Rick Pickup, who runs the site, says brewpubs are doing well for several reasons. \u201cFirstly, some people are taking over failed or failing pubs owned by big companies and adding a brewery to give the pub a unique selling point,\u201d he says. \u201cSecondly, particularly in bigger cities, people are taking over former industrial premises in regenerated areas and creating brewpubs there.\u201d For Burton, a career in brewing followed a degree in biochemistry at Birmingham University, where he took several brewing modules, many years of working in early stage investment, and redundancy.  \u201cWhen the research company went into administration, I was left with nothing to do,\u201d he says. \u201cThere were only two breweries in Cambridge, so I thought I\u2019d set up my own. There are relatively low barrier costs \u2013 you can start up a small plant for around \u00a340,000-\u00a350,000.\u201d He converted his garage into a brewery to keep overheads low. \u201cI had to go through all the regulatory hoops: HMRC, trading standards, environmental health. You can buy an off-the-shelf brewery, but because of my background, it was easier doing it myself. I sourced everything online,\u201d Burton says. When he opened, there hadn\u2019t been a new brewery in Cambridge for 67 years. \u201cThis was at the touch point where microbreweries were launching. I ran the brewery until 2014 and by then, there were another four or five breweries in the area, so the market was becoming much more competitive. In 2014, I took a job at the brew house: it was a totally different experience with lots of interaction \u2013 I love seeing people drinking my beer.\u201d     When I started my training my grandfather was happy \u2013 I\u2019d get 70 litres of beer every month to take home  Anna Schwaeble, head brewer at the Bath Brew House     But not everyone studies brewing at university. Anna Schwaeble, the head brewer at the Bath Brew House, is from Germany and took a different route into the industry. \u201cAfter I did my A-levels, I went fruit picking in Australia. After three months the money was gone, so I went to Sydney, where I got hired by a brewpub. I knew I wanted to go back to Australia and needed a career. My grandfather suggested brewing as it\u2019s a worldwide profession. When I started my training he was happy \u2013 I\u2019d get 70 litres of beer every month to take home.\u201d Schwaeble started working in a 6,000-litre brewery in Germany. \u201cI worked in the cellar for half the year. When they realised I was staying, they let me brew beer.\u201d     Anna Schwaeble started out working at a brewpub in Sydney, before going on to a 6,000-litre brewery in Germany.

Then when I\u2019d finished, I asked the teacher for jobs. I went to work at Zerodegrees in Bristol \u2013 I was there just over two years. Then I applied for this job in Bath.\u201d Schwaeble and Burton work upstairs in their pubs behind glass windows so customers can watch them brewing. Both say it\u2019s important to have an organised mind to work out quantities and keep track of the different timings. In Cambridge, each of Burton\u2019s brews makes 1,726 pints, as the pub has three tanks. \u201cIt takes three weeks from the brew date until it\u2019s ready in cask.\u201d The initial mixing is only part of the story. \u201cIt takes seven hours to do a brew, then there\u2019s a week of fermentation while the yeast is doing the work,\u201d says Schwaeble. \u201cThen we put it into casks and kegs. After that we need to clean the tank and the room.\u201d So what\u2019s the attraction of a job in brewing? Schwaeble says she enjoys the creativity. \u201cYou have to know about chemistry, about percolating and the different kinds of hops. There\u2019s lots of calculation and theory. There are thousands of strains of hops. New Zealand ones are very popular because they have pine and honey aromas.\u201d The fun part, of course, is creating beers that customers come back for time and again. \u201cWe have seven taps: three are ours, four are for local ales,\u201d she says. \u201cThen we\u2019ll have a seasonal beer. For St Patrick\u2019s Day, we do a green beer with green food colouring; at Halloween, we do blood beers, which is a cherry beer. We like to have fun with beers.\u201d Guardian members are invited to try locally brewed beers at the Cambridge Brew House on 18 May.
