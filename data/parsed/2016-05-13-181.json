  "body": "Up for critical consideration this week: Feelings       The first emotion I feel when looking at this photo is shock. I don\u2019t like feeling shocked \u2013 it\u2019s the emotion that can lead to a bit of accidental wee coming out \u2013 so this particular emotion only gets 3/10  Once the shock has worn off, I begin to feel bafflement. What is this, this plastic baby in a bag? And why? I don\u2019t like being baffled either \u2013 it makes me feel inadequate and stupid \u2013 so this emotion also only gets 3/10 Next comes curiosity. The need to fill in the gaps, to understand. Who is the person who carries a plastic baby in a bag? Are those the shelves of a Co-op or a Waitrose? What else is in the bag? I like curiosity. Yes, it kills cats, but its also led to every significant scientific breakthrough in the history of humanity, including the lint roller. So this emotion can have a cool 9/10 Then, once curiosity has led to the envisagement of a scenario \u2013 one in which a lady in red shoes browses the microwave meals-for-one section of a mid-to-upper range supermarket with an ersatz baby in a bag \u2013 I feel sad. Read that scenario again. It\u2019s the saddest scenario that\u2019s ever been scenarioed. And sadness can only ever really get 1/10 Finally comes excitement, because I now know either the Co-op or Waitrose is selling hefty portions of microwave chilli for \u00a33.29, and I\u2019m definitely getting one on the way home. Chilli is great. So is excitement. So it can have 9/10 And that is all the emotions I felt. LH A lovely bus stop            Waiting at the bus stop isn\u2019t fun. Not in the middle of the city, at least. There are swarms of schoolkids playing Kiss out of their phones, there are pensioners side-eyeing them, there are City workers sighing loudly because the stock market will crash unless the 77 turns up pronto. The air feels dirty and making direct eye contact with anyone else is asking for trouble. A few miles out of the metropolis, however, it\u2019s an altogether different experience. The bus stop we\u2019ve been asked to review this week is in Worcester Park, a town in Kingston, south-west London, that\u2019s around half an hour to Waterloo on the train. It\u2019s one of those sought-after areas of Zone 4 of the London transport network that are the stuff of estate agents\u2019 dreams; all green spaces, Ofsted-approved schools and easy commuter links. The bus stop in question is sheltered by towering trees on Cheam Common Road close to an outlet called Worcester Park Charcoal Grill, which \u2013 according to the internet\u2019s amateur Jay Rayners \u2013 serves the best kebabs in London. This looks like a wonderful corner of suburbia with great doners to boot, and the kind of place where you could truly have a thoroughly enjoyable bus-waiting experience. Top notch. 10/10  HJD A machine that puts plastic on things          A home laminating machine? It\u2019s an oddly exciting thought, isn\u2019t it? But why? Why would anyone possibly need one? Surely the functional business of the laminating machine is innately professional? Any list of things that might actually need laminating would be dominated by items related to the professional sphere. The lanyard. The workplace lunch menu. The over-demanding, slightly sinister list of company targets. In short, precisely the kind of stuff that no sane person really wants to be reminded of in their leisure time. And yet the idea of the home laminator still tantalises. To the extent that one might be tempted to consider a range of domestic clutter that might be improved by a good, hard lamination. A child\u2019s painting of a tiger, perhaps, or a weekly copy of the Guardian Guide? That way, a person might be able to justify bringing a laminator into the home. Could it be that any item, divorced from its primary intention, has a capacity to promise fun? Probably. There\u2019s an undeniable sensuality to the smooth yet invisible plasticating functionality. But these items also feel like forbidden fruit. They\u2019re singular and mysterious and yet alluring in their own right. Who hasn\u2019t marvelled at the play potential of work-related hardware in other people\u2019s professional spheres? Who hasn\u2019t walked past a building site and found themselves gawping at a cement mixer in full cry or an expertly wielded blow torch? The laminator is a post-industrial version of this fetish; the Gareth Keenan to the industrial forge\u2019s Yosser Hughes. These items are portals into alternative realities. With that in mind, the question is surely not \u201cwhy would anyone want a home laminating machine?\u201d but \u201cwhy would anyone not want one?\u201d 10/10 PH A creepy shower curtain       Yup, great, thanks, that\u2019s exactly what I want to see when I wash my hair. A shower curtain from the murder scene in Psycho. As a fair and balanced and only 99% cynical reviewer, I can see some plus sides: it\u2019s scary enough to blow your sleep-crusted eyes open in the morning, possibly even a way to save water as you limit your shower time to 0.02 minutes (because any longer is just freaky and weird and a strange man will almost certainly come through the door with a knife). Maybe, it would be handy for if you\u2019re the dramatic sort who likes to practise your \u201cscream face\u201d as a way to warm up for the day job.  But let\u2019s be real here. If you went home with a Tinder date and you saw that hanging in their loo, you wouldn\u2019t think: \u201cOoh, savvy, they\u2019re so into films\u201d, or: \u201cWow, they know their Hitchcock\u201d, you\u2019d think: \u201cHow quickly can I climb out of the bathroom window and jump over the garden fence without them noticing?\u201d This shower curtain is basically a way of saying: \u201cHi, my name\u2019s Norman, and I live with my mum.\u201d And remember: his mum was dead all along. You are right, dear tweeter, it is needlessly horrifying and no one needs a reminder of a fatal stabbing as they wash. Get out. Get out while you still can.-0.5/10 KH  Got a suggestion for next week\u2019s Review Anything? Leave it in the comments or tweet it to @guideguardian",
