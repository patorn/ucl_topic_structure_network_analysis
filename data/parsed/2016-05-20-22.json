  "body": "For 50 years, Chicago documentary production company Kartemquin has been making thought-provoking documentaries that have had an international impact. Now 74, artistic director Gordon Quinn, burns with the same passion that saw him establish the collective. Sitting in his Chicago office, awards piled up on the shelves through the French doors, he sets out his original manifesto.  \u201cWe wanted to make films to make social change, to give people information, and to change the world for the better. We were very taken with telling people\u2019s stories who don\u2019t usually get told. We felt that that kind of storytelling had an important role to play in the democratic process. That\u2019s what we were very committed to and passionate about; and we still are today.\u201d    Related: Life Itself review \u2013 documentary tribute to film critic Roger Ebert    Kartemquin\u2019s oeuvre is varied. Over 51 films and four series, Quinn and his colleagues have plumbed enduring themes such as race, education and fairness and surely have indeed contributed to social change. The group\u2019s most famous documentaries include The Interrupters, about a group of activists trying to stop violence in Chicago; Life Itself, which takes as its subject the late Chicago film critic Roger Ebert; and Hoop Dreams, a three-hour classic, currently streaming for free on Kartemquin\u2019s website, which follows two talented high school basketball players from poor backgrounds trying to make it to the NBA.             The company sees itself as very much part of Chicago\u2019s vibrant, interdisciplinary creative communities. \u201cKartemquin still has this midwestern flavour,\u201d Quinn says. Currently, the company has one series and 12 films in progress. One of them, \u201963 Boycott, \u201cblew up over the internet\u201d, when Kartemquin\u2019s website published a 1962 photo of Bernie Sanders being arrested; Sanders, who was in the same year as Quinn at the University of Chicago, was challenging the university\u2019s racist housing policy. Quinn says that the protest of the title was a precursor to further struggles to come. \u201cIt\u2019s about people demanding to have an equal shot at education and not have their kids put into trailers or put into these inferior educational situations. That huge demonstration in 1963 where 200,000 kids walked out of school in Chicago. People that were involved in it say, \u2018We\u2019re still fighting the same battles today, it\u2019s frustrating that we\u2019re not farther\u2019.\u201d The artistic director passionately believes in education rather than incarceration. Margaret Byrne\u2019s beautifully filmed Raising Bertie, which premiered at Full Frame Film Festival in the UK earlier this year, follows the education of three young black teenagers over six years. Their alternative North Carolina school the Hive is a quarter of a mile from Bertie-Martin regional jail; the documentary laments that there are 27 prisons within a 100-mile radius, while the schools are chronically underfunded.            Raising Bertie records the closure of the Hive. Quinn gestures dramatically, explaining why the cash-strapped Board of Education\u2019s decision was unfair for both students and teachers. \u201cSchool is not an education factory. The Hive didn\u2019t have the test results? Give me a break. It was only open for three years! That was clearly an institution that was making a difference in these kids\u2019 lives. You have to give it a chance to play out.  \u201cThe same thing is true with many of the 50 schools they closed here in Chicago recently. They want these quick fixes, we have all these \u2018entrepreneurial\u2019 approaches to education \u2026 you have to understand the larger context in which a neighbourhood school plays a role. They are humanistic institutions.\u201d   Related: My favourite film: Hoop Dreams    Raising Bertie raises scientific evidence around youth incarceration. \u201cTheir brains aren\u2019t fully formed, they still have impulse issues, they\u2019re still growing up and yet the criminal justice system treats so many of them as adults,\u201d says Quinn. \u201cI think there are a lot of aspects to Raising Bertie that are important \u2026 Our problems with inequality date back to slavery, you just can\u2019t get away from that, and that\u2019s what we need to be dealing with.\u201d            The company\u2019s films frequently tackle America\u2019s relationship with race. Quinn\u2019s A Good Man follows legendary African American choreographer Bill T Jones as he struggles to create a dance work about Abraham Lincoln for the president\u2019s bicentenary, while The Trials of Muhammad Ali explores the boxer\u2019s political and religious awakening, which put him on a collision course with the white American establishment.  The Interrupters, meanwhile, looks at reformed criminals intervening to reduce Chicago\u2019s lethal violence. \u201cThe quick fix \u2013 \u2018Oh well, if we just make longer prison sentences that\u2019ll stop all this violence\u2019 \u2013 none of it works,\u201d says Quinn. \u201cNone of these crime bills have done anything to reduce crime. But there in The Interrupters, you\u2019re seeing people actually having an effect with that intense human interaction and really listening to people about who they are and what their problems are. It\u2019s an incredibly powerful film.\u201d Later I speak to one of the film\u2019s main subjects, Cobe Williams, Ceasefire/CureViolence\u2019s director of training, who Skypes me from a New York taxi. In one of the film\u2019s most moving scenes, Williams takes Lil\u2019 Mikey, recently released from incarceration, to a barbershop. In a model act of restorative justice, Mikey sincerely apologises to his victims for robbing them at gunpoint at age 15, and listens to the anguish he caused.             Beaming with pleasure, Williams tells me that Lil\u2019 Mikey \u2013 and the film\u2019s other memorable former criminals like Flamo, Bud and Ameena \u2013 are doing well. \u201cI talk to Lil\u2019 Mikey every day. He work in schools. It\u2019s a programme they call Bam, Becoming a Man. Lil\u2019 Mikey\u2019s doing great there. He got Bud in school right now for criminal justice. It\u2019s great stuff came out of this.\u201d Charismatic and persuasive, Williams himself has come a long way from serving 13 years for attempted murder and drug trafficking. \u201cYes man! I\u2019ve been blessed and I\u2019ma keep doing what I\u2019m doing to keep making a difference in these communities across the world. I\u2019m gonna keep interrupting violence.\u201d The Interrupters got the message out about their work, Williams testifies. \u201cThe film really put the programme out there. We [are now] working in 60 sites. We got 20 sites in New York, five in Baltimore, two in Philly. We\u2019re in Trinidad, we\u2019re in Africa. We everywhere now, man. Yes!\u201d Joakim Noah, the Chicago Bulls center, saw The Interrupters and tweeted: \u201cthis a must-see documentary \u2026 Cobe, if I can do anything to help let me know.\u201d Williams and Noah have been organising regular basketball peace tournaments. \u201cWe been in jam ever since, that\u2019s my brother now, for real.\u201d His message for audiences today is young people in blighted communities just need someone who really cares. \u201cWe need more people to get out there on the frontline and help out.\u201d  The touching Life Itself highlighted Ebert\u2019s insight: \u201cThe movies are like a machine that generates empathy.\u201d Quinn agrees. \u201cRight! Hoop Dreams was such a success because many people watched it who would never watch a film about an inner-city family. But because it was about sports, they spent almost three hours with people that they never would have encountered. You have to engage people on an emotional level. We are trying to make films that get people to see and listen to and care about; and understand somebody who\u2019s not them.\u201d  He warms to his theme. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the problems that I see in America with this incredible polarisation, that people already know how they\u2019re going to respond to something so they\u2019re not even listening to it.\u201d Instead, Kartemquin\u2019s films stand for empathy and complexity in a world that trades increasingly in decontextualised, cold, knee-jerk opinions.
