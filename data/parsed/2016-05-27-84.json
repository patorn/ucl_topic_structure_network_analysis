  "body": "Danny Willett had spent so long on Cloud Nine that a bump back down to earth was inevitable. It duly arrived, without notice, at Wentworth on Friday. The Masters champion reached the turn in only 29 strokes on day two of the BMW PGA Championship. By the time Willett headed for the scorers\u2019 hut, he was calling himself all manner of names which probably should not be repeated. A second round of 68, added to Thursday\u2019s 66, is hardly cause for distress but Willett has afforded himself lofty standards; that inward half of 39 clearly infuriated the Yorkshireman.

Two tales. \u201cIt obviously wasn\u2019t the back nine I was hoping for but I would have taken 10 under par at the beginning of the day. It was nice to make a birdie at the last, hitting two really good golf shots in there. I composed myself quite nicely. I could have just chucked it and finished really poorly, but to make a birdie there was good. It shows a little bit of mental strength.\u201d Willett\u2019s rhythm earlier seemed to be disrupted by his group being put on the clock along with his playing partners Soomin Lee and Victor Dubuisson by the European Tour\u2019s chief referee John Paramor. This year, the Tour has sought to crack down on serial pace-of-play offenders of whom, it is fair to point out, Willett is not one. The 28-year-old was pragmatic about his brush with officialdom. \u201cIt\u2019s tough to obviously double check yardage and stuff with blustery winds and a few tight flags out there,\u201d Willett said. \u201cThis place plays hard when the wind is swirling around. You\u2019d like as much time as possible to double check your numbers and make sure you\u2019re happy with what you\u2019ve got in your hand. \u201cOn a couple of shots out there, we hit a little bit too quickly and got the wind a little bit wrong. There were just a couple in there that [being timed] probably didn\u2019t help but you can\u2019t blame anything when you hit bad shots.\u201d Thereafter, Willett offered a concession in respect of what he has found the most difficult to handle since winning the Green Jacket at Augusta National. \u201cEverything you do is being watched,\u201d he explained. \u201cOn the range on a Monday or a Tuesday when you\u2019re struggling with things, you\u2019ve got someone behind you. You\u2019ve got to watch your P\u2019s and Q\u2019s, which obviously I\u2019m not the best at in the best of times. \u201cI used to be able to have nice, quiet practice sessions on my own and just do my own thing. You feel like you\u2019re being watched all the time in what you\u2019re doing, which is fine, kind of part and parcel and that\u2019s what you should expect. But it\u2019s just getting used to having someone around constantly.\u201d Darren Clarke, meanwhile, has confirmed Padraig Harrington, Paul Lawrie and Thomas Bjorn as his first three of what will be five vice-captains for the European Ryder Cup team. Clarke and his team head to Hazeltine in late September seeking what would be a fourth victory for Europe in a row.",
