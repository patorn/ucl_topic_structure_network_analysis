  "body": "A poster at an Arizona school that compared girls to meat and boys to wolves has been taken down after a picture of it taken by a student was widely shared on social media. The poster, which has the caption \u201cSo you think you come to school looking pretty cute\u201d under a picture of what appear to be scantily clad anime characters, then the caption \u201cbut what boys see is meat\u201d under a picture of a wolf, was spotted in the library of Desert Ridge high school in Mesa, Arizona, by senior Alissa Adams during a class on 27 April. It goes on to say that \u201cit is distracting \u2026 so they go on to get lousy grades \u2026 but then you end up with one of them anyway because he thought you looked HOT.\u201d  \u201cAs we started reading it, we all just started looking at each other like, \u2018is this serious?\u2019\u201d Adams said. \u201cIt says that because girls dress revealingly, then boys will then fail because of us.\u201d \u201c[The class is] boys and girls, and everyone was offended by it,\u201d Adams said. \u201cI was so mad that I had to say something.\u201d She said that she asked the librarian to take it down, but the librarian refused. Under the final caption, which reads \u201cBut it\u2019s okay \u2013 because you looked cute today!\u201d \u2013 the word \u201ctoday\u201d is underlined \u2013 Adams, who said that she was \u201cso mad\u201d, took out her pen and wrote \u201cso it\u2019s the girls\u2019 fault, right?\u201d and appended the hashtag \u201c#feminism\u201d, then tweeted the photo. The following day, the poster was removed by school officials. \u201cThat was nice,\u201d Adams said. \u201cNice little win for us.\u201d Adams said she had received \u201cthousands\u201d of supportive comments since sending the tweet, but also a number of negative ones. \u201cPeople have tweeted me saying \u2018you need to let this go\u2019 and \u2018go hide under your bed\u2019, or \u2018you don\u2019t understand this now, but the world isn\u2019t as good as you think it is\u2019, and \u2018you\u2019ll understand when you grow up\u2019, and I\u2019m like \u2013 I\u2019m pretty sure I can understand a sexist poster now.\u201d   Related: The year in sexism: how did women fare in 2015?    \u201cIt\u2019s just a lot of rude comments about how the post is fine, and I\u2019m just a liberal loudmouth \u2013 and I\u2019m not even liberal,\u201d she said. \u201cThe poster was offensive. It doesn\u2019t take a liberal to see that.\u201d Irene Mahoney-Paige, a spokeswoman for the Gilbert Schools system, said in a statement that the poster had been in the library \u201cfor some time\u201d and it was not clear when it was made or by whom. \u201cThe librarian hung it up last week and as soon as it was brought to the attention of the Principal, it was promptly removed,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cThe Principal has spoken to the librarian and has also met with students and student council. Hanging of the poster was inappropriate and very poor judgement on behalf of the librarian. It is not reflective of the spirit and community of Desert Ridge High School or the Gilbert Public Schools District.\u201d",
