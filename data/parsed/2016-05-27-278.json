The world\u2019s first humanoid robot has started taking tours at the Art Gallery of Western Australia (AGWA) \u2013 two a month, for now. It seems a cruel twist of fate to have art history graduates among the first to be made redundant by robots; they have a hard enough time finding work as it is. But when I travel to AGWA to meet the future of work, it is plugged into the wall, charging. The takeover seems less imminent. Aggie the engagement robot is 58 centimetres tall and made of the bright blue and white rounded plastic that\u2019s the go-to of appliance manufacturers. She is female, of course, as any technology that provides a servile function is bound by natural law to be. Her hardware is French, her software is Belgian, and she is programmed by Smartbots, a Perth-based company that developed her in partnership with AGWA (hence, \u201cAggie\u201d). Her aim, gallery director Stefano Carboni tells me, is to make art more accessible and to engage the public. It is not, he clarifies, the first step towards making AGWA\u2019s 80 human guides redundant. Anitra Robertson, chief operating officer of Smartbots, says Aggie is programmed to interact with those guides, to ask them questions and to answer some herself. She can talk about the artists, their inspiration, and how the artwork might be interpreted. \u201cShe adds her cheeky little ideas,\u201d says Robertson, throwing me for a second \u2013 what, like that the Mona Lisa is a man? The reality is that Aggie is not capable of all that much by herself. Not only must she be accompanied by a guide for her tours, she is also shadowed by a handler: a pleasant, sandy-haired man named Michael, who keeps a respectful distance like a dad chaperoning his daughter on a date, busying himself with a tablet.     \u2018She\u2019ll look at you\u2019: Aggie reclines at AGWA. Photograph: Supplied    Michael later shows me the operating system with which he can cue up preprogrammed spiels about individual artworks and direct Aggie\u2019s movements, even operating the camera within Aggie\u2019s stomach. \u201cSo she still needs the handler,\u201d I say, \u201cshe can\u2019t just \u2026\u201d As though sensitive to the slight dismissiveness of my tone, Aggie\u2019s head swivels round to fix me with a blank expression. \u201cOh, her head-tracking\u2019s on,\u201d says Robertson. Aggie has two cameras, Carboni explains. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have facial recognition so she doesn\u2019t already know that it\u2019s you. She won\u2019t say \u2018Hello, Elle\u2019\u201d \u2013 phew, I think \u2013 \u201cbut she detects faces and so she\u2019ll look at you.\u201d  She also turns to look at me when I say her name, I tell him.  \u201cNo, you\u2019re making that up,\u201d he says kindly. Aggie\u2019s range extends five kilometres; Michael says he could operate the whole tour from the office, pre-programming an entire sequence. But that would be dependant on timing, and could be thrown out by a guide\u2019s preamble or a question from a visitor. So Michael stays close to the tour instead, pushing the right button for each artwork\u2019s spiel. To tell the truth, the timing is not exactly fluid, even with Michael on the threshold. Ushered by a real-life guide, Laura Money, Aggie stamps into the semi-circle of bemused gallery-goers.  \u201cTHANK YOU FOR THE WELCOME,\u201d she says, in a mellifluous lady-robot voice, then beat: \u201cLAURA.\u201d My experience of \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d is more or less limited to the three Furbies I had as a child (yes, three; consider my privilege checked). You might think that the comparison is offensive to Aggie\u2019s makers and the wider \u201chumanoid robot\u201d industry. It probably is. But observing the stop-start interaction between Laura and Aggie, I was reminded of how a Furby delivered on its promise only by technicalities and in comparison to the bad tech of the time. Aggie\u2019s description of Triptych Alice, Charles Blackman\u2019s 1957 work, is functional. She asks the members of the tour if they can name the work of classic literature it\u2019s based on. The experience of a robot describing Alice\u2019s trip down the rabbit hole is somewhat surreal. She asks if we can spot another character from the story, but Laura has to point out the Cheshire cat. \u201cTHANK YOU, LAURA, MY ARMS CANNOT REACH THAT FAR.\u201d Aggie\u2019s head rotates 90 degrees, then her body turns to follow, and she shuffles along towards Sunbathers by Albert Tucker, another from the state\u2019s collection. (For distances of any significance, she must be picked up and carried, like that viral video of the man helping the sloth across the road.) \u201cWHEN I GO TO THE BEACH, I LIKE TO LIE DOWN, CLOSE MY EYES AND LISTEN TO THE WAVES.\u201d Like every good art gallery guide, the sounds of the ocean starts emitting from the sides of her head. She bends at the waist, kneels, leans back. It becomes clear that she is in the process of lying down.    Down the rabbit hole with Aggie the engagement robot pic.twitter.com/sGudNs0D8V\u2014 Elle Hunt (@mlle_elle) May 27, 2016    As Aggie lies on her back, listening to the ocean, Laura discusses Tucker\u2019s treatment of the body. It\u2019s hard to know what\u2019s the focal point: the art, the guide, the robot imagining its seaside holiday, your smartphone because you\u2019re going to want to add the robot to your story on Snapchat. Aggie snaps out of her reverie, takes 30 seconds to stand up, and interrupts Laura mid-sentence to demand we press on to a sculpture of a reclining woman.  \u201cI LIKE HOW THIS FIGURE IS LYING,\u201d says Aggie. \u201cIT SEEMS TO BE MUCH MORE FEMININE THAN THE SUNBATHERS.\u201d Their haphazard back-and-forth asks far more of Laura than it does of Aggie, demanding more or less an improv comedy routine to account for the changes in pace. \u201cI had more to say about the other one,\u201d Laura grumbles when Aggie, after having rushed her along, stands silently in front of a painting. \u201cYou definitely have to be able to fill in the gaps,\u201d Laura tells me after the tour, the second she\u2019s taken with Aggie. \u201cIf she cuts you off, she cuts you off, that\u2019s that \u2013 you just have to keep going.\u201d Aggie is not a replacement for the trained gallery guides, says their team leader, Stephanie Watson. \u201cShe has a tendency to get distracted. She doesn\u2019t think as well as art guides do.\u201d The group of us look on at Aggie, standing motionless a few metres away, alone under an oil painting of colonial times. Michael wants to show me her dance. Carboni has seen this one before. \u201cYou\u2019ll be impressed.\u201d Aggie stomps over towards us, her eyes flashing red and green and blue as she rotates her joints and flexes her three-fingered hands. A vaguely African-sounding song starts playing from her head: the self-contained soundtrack to her own show. \u201cI think, from a smartbot standpoint, we\u2019re at a very early stage in the introduction of humanoid robots into society,\u201d says Robertson, above the noise of Aggie\u2019s tribal orchestra and whirring joints. The gallery\u2019s new tagline is \u201cseeing things differently,\u201d she continues, and it is breaking ground in that space. The robot continues to dance to its own tune. \u201cFrom a personal experience standpoint, what a robot can do is evoke certain emotions. You can find her funny, you can find her charming, you can be educated by her. \u201cIf you reflect on the fact that you can be moved by something like that, which is in its very essence cords and cables and plastic, that in itself is seeing things differently.\u201d \u2022 From 28 May, Aggie will be leading a monthly, hour-long tour as well a Robot art class for children at the Art Gallery of Western Australia, Perth \u2022 Guardian Australia travelled to Perth courtesy of AGWA",
