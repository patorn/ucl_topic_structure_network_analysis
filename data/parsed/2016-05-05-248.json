  "body": "\u201cI gained a stone in weight and regularly binged and comfort ate, finding there was no time to exercise as I used to. Many members of the team had similar experiences. In the end, it all became so overwhelming that I saw a psychotherapist for a couple of months prior to resigning. This helped crystallise why I was finding it so unbearable: my body was in physical revolt against an unrealistic to-do list that I could never catch up on, no matter how hard I tried.\u201d   Related: I was so overwhelmed by work as a social worker, I was physically sick    This is one social worker\u2019s description of how working in child protection affected their mental and physical health. It is a familiar tale: in the Guardian\u2019s Social Lives research, 67% of social workers said they had been affected by stress and depression. To help social workers deal with the stress and trauma of their job, building resilience is key. This can help ensure that social workers don\u2019t burn out at an early stage of their career, and are able to continue working without suffering from work-related stress or mental health problems.  And there is value for this in employers, too; at a time when experienced social workers are in short supply, anything that helps people stay in the profession has to be considered. To discuss some of these issues, we\u2019ve put together a panel of experts from the social work sector. We\u2019ll be talking about:  Strategies social workers can use to build resilience \u2013 from time management to mindfulness. The role employers have to play: what they can do to reduce workloads and improve morale. How healthy, resilient, supportive teams of social workers can be built. The role of managers and supervision.    Related: Building resilient social workers is everybody\u2019s business    The discussion will take place on Monday 9 May between 12pm and 2pm in the comments section below this article.
