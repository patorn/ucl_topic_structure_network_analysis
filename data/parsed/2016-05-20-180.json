Vote Leave released a campaign video that shows the prime minister saying Turkish membership of the EU is not on the cards before switching to previous footage of him saying he wanted a road to be paved from Brussels to Ankara. Starting with the statement \u201cDavid Cameron cannot be trusted on Turkey\u201d, the film goes on to juxtapose the prime minister with scenes of brawling in the Turkish parliament in a significant escalation of Vote Leave\u2019s war on Downing Street.            The video was released to back up a speech on Friday in which the justice secretary, Michael Gove, argued that Turkey and four other countries could join the EU as soon as 2020 and lead to 5.2 million extra people moving to the UK, a population the size of Scotland or four cities the size of Birmingham.    Asking the NHS to look after a new group of patients equivalent in size to four Birminghams is clearly unsustainable  Michael Gove     A senior source in the remain camp responded furiously by claiming Vote Leave and Gove were resorting to Ukip-style rhetoric in stoking fears about the potential for immigration from Turkey if the country were to join the EU. \u201cMichael Gove may be mouthing the words but Nigel Farage is writing the tune. They orginally had lofty ambitions of talking about the economy but since they have lost that argument so catastrophically, they have reached for the Ukip playbook to create fictitious stories to scare people about immigrants and release video nasties about Turkish people\u201d. Britain Stronger in Europe also pointed out that Boris Johnson had said as recently as March that Turkey joining the EU was \u201cnot going to happen\u201d. Gove\u2019s speech coincided with official figures showing the NHS in England has run up a record deficit of \u00a32.45bn \u2013 the biggest overspend in its history \u2013 as it struggles to cope with a surge in demand for care while suffering a major budget squeeze.   Related: Will staying in EU really lead to an influx equal to Scottish population?    Speaking in Westminster, Gove said: \u201cBoris Johnson and I will use all our influence with government to give the NHS additional support when we wake up on 24 June. But if we vote to remain, I fear the NHS will only face additional pressures. Even without the accession of any new countries, we can expect a continuing net flow of 172,000 new individuals from the EU to the UK every year. \u201cThat adds up to 2.58 million new people arriving here from the EU over the next 15 years. Population growth at that rate could reasonably be expected to increase the pressure on A&E by 28%.\u201d He said it was right to assume that there would be even more pressure from the accession of five new countries \u2013 Turkey, Albania, Montenegro, Macedonia, and Serbia \u2013 which have a combined population of 88 million.  If those countries were to join, Vote Leave campaign\u2019s modelling predicts that there could be a cumulative net migration inflow by 2030 of between 3.1 million and 5.2 million. With transitional controls for seven years, the campaign claims net migration would have hit 2.7 million in 2030. \u201cThe idea of asking the NHS to look after a new group of patients equivalent in size to four Birminghams is clearly unsustainable. Free movement on that scale will have huge consequences for the NHS,\u201d he said. \u201cTo maintain current levels of funding per person, the NHS will need further investment of \u00a34bn-9bn per year by 2030. It will also need tens of thousands of new doctors and nurses.\u201d The Vote Leave immigration forecasts were strongly challenged by the in camp as they presume that five new countries will join the EU within four years. Cameron has said Turkey is unlikely to join the EU in his lifetime. Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader, said Gove\u2019s claims were \u201cabsurd\u201d.  \u201cThese figures are nonsense because accession of these countries is not remotely on the cards. But what is certain is that leaving the EU\u2019s single market of 500 million people would devastate our economy and cut people\u2019s wages. Analysis by the Treasury shows it will create a \u00a336bn black hole in the public finances. This would leave less money available for our health service,\u201d he said. \u201cMichael Gove\u2019s hypocrisy is staggering. Just a year ago, he admitted that our NHS relies on over 100,000 workers from the EU, and supported the living wage that benefits low-paid British workers. Now he\u2019s turned his back on both. \u201cPatients, doctors and nurses are stronger thanks to our membership of the EU. Leaving would be a leap in the dark that would put our NHS at risk.\u201d However, the justice secretary denied the claims were scaremongering, saying they were based on \u201crigorous\u201d calculations. He also supports the living wage. On Friday night, remain campaigners also seized on an admission by Frank Field, one of the few Labour MPs campaigning for Brexit, that leaving the EU brought unknown dangers. He said there was a danger in remaining with \u201cunlimited immigration\u201d but added there was also danger in leaving. \u201cNo honest person knows. I guesstimate that there is little danger here, but I may be wrong. The danger is of a totally unknown proportion. There is danger associated our withdrawal. The EU is deeply, deeply unpopular with voters across Europe. So the main danger is that our vote to leave will begin a fast unravelling of the European community. Most governments are frightened to give what David Cameron was forced to give us \u2013 a vote to you to decide the destiny of your nation.\u201d   Related: Nigel Farage: \u2018Vote Leave brief every day that I\u2019m toxic. Quite the opposite\u2019    He said the immediate aftermath of the poll on 23 June would be the \u201cpoint of maximum danger\u201d if there is a vote to leave. Field also predicted that Cameron would have to resign soon regardless of the result \u201cgiven his mishandling of this whole event\u201d. Gove\u2019s public claim that the NHS is at risk on its current course is likely to infuriate Cameron and George Osborne. The government insists the health service is under control. Cameron has suspended collective responsibility over the EU referendum but a number of ministers have strayed beyond the issue of Europe to make related attacks on wider government policy. The strength of Gove\u2019s warning about the NHS is likely to make it even more difficult for Cameron to go back to a unified cabinet after the vote. The prime minister is likely to have to resign if he loses the poll, but could still be in danger if there is a narrow vote to remain ; senior Tories could decide they want to replace him with a more Eurosceptic leader who would push for a second referendum. The Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, has already suggested there could be a second poll, while Johnson has suggested the question of the EU may not be permanently settled by the result. However, Gove said he hoped all sides would accept the result of the referendum: \u201cI do hope that we vote to leave. I also believe that whatever the decision the British people take it should be respected.\u201d",
