  "body": "Paris Clark-Roden, KEEN affiliate and manager at Matrix Capital Limited, explains why he should win the Rising Star category of the Guardian Small Business Showcase competition:  I was appointed on a part ERDF-funded graduate programme, The Knowledge Exchange and Enterprise Network (KEEN), with the aim of helping Matrix Capital achieve its visions of growth. Over the last 12 months, I led the team that won a prestigious contract with National Savings & Investments in 2014. Our small Shropshire firm took over the job of advising monthly \u00a31m Premium Bond Jackpot Winners from a FTSE 250 company.  I also redesigned our outdated business and marketing plan, introduced new best practices and improved internal operations, client service and bottom line performance. We subsequently ended 2015 with a 35% increase in gross profit.  I have been involved in an impressive array of volunteering and community work, including as a digital champion of the local Superfast Broadband initiative, and discussed small business entrepreneurship with international MSc students at the University of Wolverhampton.  I completed the Effective Board Member programme for Young Leaders, led by Karl George MBE, and became a member of the Institute for Turnaround Next Generation Group. I was delighted to win the Telford Young Professionals (TYP) Professional Achievement of the Year Award in 2015.  Managing Director of Matrix Capital Limited Robin Melley, says I have \u201cdemonstrated a rare blend of intellect, wisdom, creativity and a strong work ethic focussed on results\u201d.  All entries which meet the competition criteria are published and our judging panel select a shortlist of the top three for each category. Winners are announced at an awards ceremony in summer 2016.",
