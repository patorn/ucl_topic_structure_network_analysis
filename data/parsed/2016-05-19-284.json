  "body": "It has been the most talked-about Archers plot in years but the long-running domestic abuse storyline which culminated with Helen Titchener stabbing her abusive husband Rob could not halt a dip in listeners to the Ambridge soap. The \u201ceveryday story of countryfolk\u201d attracted an average weekly reach of 4.7 million listeners in the first three months of this year, down 3% on the final three months of 2015. It reflected a similar decline in the station\u2019s overall audience, which was also down 3% on the previous quarter, to 10.6 million. Its flagship breakfast programme Today lost 4% of its audience, down to 6.8 million.

The Archers audience typically hovers just under the 5 million mark, although five years ago it topped 5 million during its 60th anniversary quarter in which Nigel Pargetter memorably fell to his death from the roof of Lower Loxley. The Archers is proving a digital hit, however, with a record 3.6 million requests via the BBC\u2019s iPlayer to listen to the programme in March 2016. A Radio 4 spokesperson said: \u201cRadio 4 audiences remain strong and loyal with the station continuing to reach one in five adults in the UK every week.  \u201cIt is not unusual for live listening figures to fluctuate slightly and it is natural we would see this reflected in individual programmes.  \u201cSeparate to live listening, audiences have been hitting record numbers for programme requests with 13 million Radio 4 programmes requested in April alone. There were 33.3m requests from BBC iPlayer Radio for Radio 4 programmes during this quarter, that\u2019s a 43% increase on last year.\u201d Earlier this month the BBC\u2019s director general Tony Hall said the Archers domestic violence story had propelled the soap to its highest ever audience appreciation figures.  But the plotline did not go down well with everyone, and one former editor warned against the soap becoming too sensational.   Related: Archers editor Sean O\u2019Connor: \u2018Helen is the victim. But she shouldn\u2019t have stabbed him\u2019    Archers editor Sean O\u2019Connor hailed the online listening figures after the latest official Rajar figures were published on Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing that a 65-year-old programme can find itself the smash hit of the digital age,\u201d he said. \u201cThese extraordinary figures are an endorsement of the enduring pleasures of the programme and the unique power of radio drama to engage the audience. The story of Helen and Rob has gripped the nation and perhaps it\u2019s only The Archers that could tell this story in this slow-burn, incremental way.  \u201cIn the 1950s, the programme\u2019s original editor observed that the success of the programme lay in the fact that they\u2019d made The Archers addictive; it\u2019s gratifying to feel that we\u2019re still achieving the same compulsive, addictive effect in the competitive world of new media.\u201d",
