This year\u2019s Summer Reading Challenge by The Reading Agency (the Tesco Bank Summer Reading Challenge, as it is known in Scotland) joins forces with the global Roald Dahl 100 celebrations for The Big Friendly Read, and will focus on the Dahl-est themes - invention, mischief and good old friendship..   Related: Roald Dahl's greatest philosophical quotes ever    How does it work?  If you\u2019re between 4 and 11, register with your local library (it\u2019s free!).  Then all you have to do is read 6 or more books that you\u2019re interested in, and that includes EVERYTHING: picture books, fact books and even audio books, as long as you borrow them from the library. Or you can have a browse through the list of 72 big hits carefully selected for your excitement by the Big Friendly Read team. A highlight of the list is Roald Dahl\u2019s The BFG, as Disney\u2019s film version, directed by Spielberg and starring Mark Rylance, is being released in cinemas on 22 July \u2013 but there are loads of new and exciting authors to choose from! When you complete the challenge, you get stickers, a certificate and other rewards. If the books get you thinking, you can chat to your fellow readers about them and Guardian children\u2019s books site members can send their reviews to be published on our site by joining here.   Related: How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?    And because good news has to be shared, why don\u2019t you invite your local librarian to talk about the Challenge in class? If you don\u2019t already have a library contact, you can get your Summer Reading Challenge Coordinator\u2019s contact details by emailing summerreadingchallenge@readingagency.org.uk.  What else can I get up to? The RNIB National Library Service selects the Summer Reading Challenge book titles available in accessible formats (braille, audio and giant print) for children who are visually impaired, or have visually impaired parents or carers. These books can also help children with learning disabilities and dyslexia.  If you are between 13 and 24, you can become a Reading Hack, helping those who struggle with reading or simply dislike it to discover the pleasures of reading.
