Kostas Sismanidis said he was almost sure that a 2,400 year-old domed vault he unearthed in ancient Stagira was the burial place of the man credited with formalising logic.      Aristotle. Photograph: Alamy    \u201cI have no hard proof, but strong indications lead me to almost certainty,\u201d said Sismanidis.  Archaeologists have been working painstakingly at the site \u2013 the philosopher\u2019s birthplace in 384 BC in the Greek region of Macedonia \u2013 for 20 years.  Sismanidis was due to give further details at a world congress in northern Greece of scholars specialised in Aristotle\u2019s work. He said the architecture and location of the tomb, close to Stagira\u2019s ancient square and with panoramic views, supported the belief that it was the philosopher\u2019s final resting place.  Although little is known about Aristotle\u2019s life despite many of his works surviving, two literary sources \u2013 a mainstay for archaeological discovery \u2013 suggest that the people of Stagira may have transferred his ashes from Chalcis on the island of Euboea (Chalkida on Evia today) where he is known to have died in 322 BC. The vault, which has a square marble floor dating from Hellenistic times, appears to have been hurriedly constructed with an altar outside. Coins dated to Alexander the Great and ceramics from royal pottery were also found. The claim was welcomed by Greece\u2019s culture ministry; a senior aide to the minister, Aristides Baltas, said the academic community was awaiting further details. \u201cA team of independent archaeologists with no connection to a particular school or department have been working at the site,\u201d the official told the Guardian. \u201cWhat we know is that their excavation has been meticulous and we await further details with great anticipation.\u201d Plato\u2019s star pupil, Aristotle was enrolled at the court of ancient Macedonia as the tutor of Alexander the Great. He thereafter travelled around the Aegean and Asia Minor before returning to Athens where he founded his own school, the Lyceum, in 335 BC.      An aerial view of the dig site.

From under the unpaved parking lot the fabled Lyceum emerged, replete with a central courtyard and wrestling area, or palaestra. Northern Greece has been the scene of several discoveries, though not all of them have been well received. In 2014, amid great fanfare, a tomb initially believed to be the long-sought burial place of Alexander the Great was found in Amphipolis, also in central Macedonia.  Scholars subsequently agreed it was not related to the Macedonian warrior king, with many accusing authorities of deliberately overplaying the discovery to distract Greeks at a time of economic and social hardship.",
