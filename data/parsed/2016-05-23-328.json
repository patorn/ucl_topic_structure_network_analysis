  "body": "Children stood front and center on Fear the Walking Dead this week, as Celia mourned her sons and Travis and Madison tried to save their own. And there was a lot of saving to be done.  Oblivious Nick and Alicia are just sunning themselves on the hacienda lanai, as if Celia didn\u2019t just kick Strand and the crew out. Nick at least realizes he can use Celia\u2019s love for Luis to cut a deal: let the reanimated corpse return and the gang can stay in safety too. Nick is a good son. Chris remains the worst. He takes off in the middle of the night to wander the fields and pretend to be tough, annoying everyone else, who realizes he\u2019s a weak, whiny jerk. What\u2019s his plan? Where\u2019s he going? What\u2019s he going to eat? He\u2019s the stereotypical teen, giving up a posh room in a gorgeous house because nobody is paying attention to him or letting him have his way.   Related: Fear the Walking Dead recap: season two, episode six \u2013 Sicut Cervus    Is it good that Travis finally beats him up a little? He takes off without shoes after Chris in the middle of the night, and ends up in a village home near the Abigail compound. Just like Travis, this man wants help for his son, who Chris was holding hostage, because of course Chris was. Travis quickly disarms Chris, wrestles him to the ground and ends the standoff. Then he decides maybe it is his son\u2019s fault, after all, for being a maniac. When Nick arrives, Travis tells him to tell Madison he didn\u2019t find them. Chris needs his father to get better and they\u2019re going to wander about alone. Congrats, Travis, you\u2019ve let Chris drag you down to his level. Where are they going? What will they eat? These two deserve each other. \u2018Nothing can touch me\u2019 The most fascinating dynamic of the episode was between Nick, Madison and Celia: coming down to the debate of whether the survivors believe the zombies are monsters or something else. Sure, they\u2019re vicious flesh eaters, but can\u2019t people still have compassion for the dead? It\u2019s an interesting question, but it seems that Fear always comes down on the side that says the walkers are monsters. When Madison confronts Nick about his behavior \u2013 ruining every T-shirt he finds by smearing it with zombie guts and then going on crazy night missions to rescue more zombies \u2013 he says his mother is still treating him like an addict. He\u2019s right: they both need to realize that sobriety won\u2019t heal all the issues they have with each other after his years of drug abuse. Heck, he hasn\u2019t dealt with the reason he started using in the first place. Nick is what some AA circles would call a \u201cdry drunk\u201d, someone who acts like an addict even though they\u2019re on the wagon. Strand knows Nick is vulnerable to Celia\u2019s \u201cquasi-religious bullshit\u201d, but what Nick really likes about Celia is that she accepts him. She believes he\u2019s exceptional, something that his mother has a hard time believing after years of addiction. Madison thinks she\u2019s doing the right thing when she locks Celia in the zombie dungeon, but it\u2019s only the right thing for herself. She feels like she\u2019s protecting her son even though she may be harming him. \u2018It\u2019s my dead you fear\u2019 Daniel, meanwhile, is slowly going insane. He dreams of all the people he killed in El Salvador and is now seeing visions of his dead wife. If he\u2019s so burdened by past sins, why can\u2019t he confess them to Celia? Why can\u2019t he claim responsibility for them and at least try to rid himself of the torment? And while we\u2019re asking questions, why can\u2019t the writers find anything for Ofelia to do? Celia might have been framed as a villain last week, but she showed Daniel some compassion, keeping him captive to try to help him reconcile with his past. She may have been a bit nuts and imperious, but Celia was fine by me: she insisted on no weapons or violence, believed everyone should carry their own weight, and was a good leader for all those workers who had the run of the rich estates they used to tend. Donald Trump would\u2019ve hated her \u2013 how bad could she be? Blissfully ignorant of the Donald, Daniel doesn\u2019t see it that way. He\u2019s convinced the villa is evil, probably because he\u2019s convinced that he himself is evil. He gets free and sets the trapped zombies on fire \u2013 an incredibly irritating repetition of what happened on Herschel\u2019s farm during the second season of the original Walking Dead. Someone holds some zombies \u201calive\u201d because they can\u2019t accept the people are dead, and someone else with a philosophical difference kills the zombies. Even the end of the episode is like what happened at the end of Herschel\u2019s farm, with the group scattered to the winds and the audience unsure of who\u2019s alive and who\u2019s dead. \u2018We destroy everything\u2019 Strand was never one for sentimentality, and even when Madison tells him what\u2019s going to happen after Celia throws him out, he tells her not to consider him a friend just because they helped each other for a while. But after Daniel burns down the house, Strand seems different: he\u2019s back to rescue everyone. What changed his mind? Maybe the world\u2019s saddest goodbye wave from Alicia through that gate. It\u2019s easy to tell this is the \u201cmid-season finale\u201d because a main story arc \u2013 getting to Mexico \u2013 is over, and the episode had a classic zombie cliffhanger ending \u2013 total chaos. Chris and Travis are roaming the countryside in the dark, hopefully offscreen forever more. Strand is off with Alicia, Ofelia and Madison. Only Celia\u2019s owl-god-thing knows what\u2019s up with Nick. He dutifully returns to relay Travis\u2019 message and seems to blame the inferno he finds on his mother. Maddie won\u2019t tell him the truth about Celia, who continues to treat Nick like something fragile and doesn\u2019t see that Nick has proven himself incredibly capable, someone who can walk the line between life and death. Nick has emerged a product of the new world, even though he doesn\u2019t want to make the violent sacrifices it takes to survive. He\u2019s a dead man among the living \u2013 an addict before and after the end of the world. Before Madison can help him, he\u2019s got to decide to help himself.",
