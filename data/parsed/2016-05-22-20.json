  "body": "Cannes jury decisions often baffle both outsiders and the jury members themselves. They have had to argue, shout, horse-trade \u2014 and then, as the clock runs down, and with festival director Thierry Fr\u00e9maux frowningly entering the jury room pointing at his watch, finally come up with a compromise decision that satisfies no-one.   Related: Cannes 2016: Peter Bradshaw's festival verdict and award predictions    The prizes this year were a surprise and a mixed bag which somehow missed out many of the films which were generally found to be exciting and successful. Nothing for Maren Ade\u2019s brilliant comedy Toni Erdmann. Nothing for Jim Jarmusch\u2019s wonderful Paterson and nothing for Paul Verhoeven\u2019s outrageously enjoyable thriller Elle. And it was incidentally exasperating to see that film\u2019s star Isabelle Huppert overlooked for the best actress award \u2014 along with Kristen Stewart, Ruth Negga and Sonia Braga \u2014 in favour of Jaclyn Jose as the Manila drug-dealer in Brillante Mendoza\u2019s Ma\u2019Rosa. A good performance, but not exceptional.     Snubbed? ... Toni Erdmann Photograph: Handout    But, in my view, no bad films were given prizes and it was very satisfying to see Ken Loach pick up his second Palme d\u2019Or for I, Daniel Blake \u2014a coldly angry indictment of food bank Britain, scripted by his longtime screenwriter Paul Laverty. It was the only film of the festival which moved me to tears; the heart-wrenching and frightening scene in the food bank itself has enormous power. This was a film of almost radical plainness, with a great performance from Dave Johns (as so often in the past, Loach has got great serious work from a comic \u2014 he has cast John Bishop and George Lopez in the past). Loach is, as I have written before, the John Bunyan of contemporary cinema. Or to use another comparison, he has directed a film which repudiates frills and nuances as firmly as a medieval mystery play. It may well be that his heartfelt idealism and Amish simplicity became a sort of Esperanto for the international jury. It was something they could all understand and endorse in each other\u2019s company.

Yes!\u201d and then subside chuckling to my seat. The grand prix went to Xavier Dolan\u2019s It\u2019s Only the End of the World. Now, there were films I liked better at Cannes, sure, and films which I thought more deserving of this particular award. But it was really good, a provocation made with uncompromising attack and flair, a film driven with authorial personality and a film which has been mocked and misunderstood by the majority of critics. It is an absurdist drama of confrontation and hysteria, which conveys in stylised and dreamlike form the horror experienced by a young man who must return to his hometown and tell his family he is dying. (He is a successful dramatist: the movie is based on an autobiographical play by Jean-Luc Lagarce, who died of Aids in 1995.) The result is a non-stop screaming match: a cinematic death-metal opera. It\u2019s not for everyone, but it is fascinatingly created and intended. Perhaps this prize will persuade the detractors to give it another go.     Emo ... Xavier Dolan accepts his prize for It\u2019s Only the End of the World Photograph: Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images    Again, it is satisfying to see two really excellent films being distinguished. In my view, Cristian Mungui\u2019s Graduation and Olivier Assayas\u2019s Personal Shopper were the two best films in competition. Graduation was my (incorrect) tip for the Palme. As it turned out, Mungiu and Assayas shared the director\u2019s prize, and that will have to do. Graduation is an utterly absorbing film of masterly compositional flair which is a very persuasive character-study of a doctor whose muddy moral choices infect his daughter\u2019s worldview \u2014 and also a resoundingly authoritative picture of Romania and the Eastern Europe which now has a generational perspective on the escape from communism.   Related: Personal Shopper review: Kristen Stewart's psychic spooker is a must-have    Personal Shopper is a tremendously exciting and bizarre picture which mischievously messes with genre. Along with Paul Verhoeven\u2019s Elle and Nicolas Winding Refn\u2019s LA horror-shocker The Neon Demon (both ignored), it was a film which caused festival-goers to become slightly delirious and skittish. This was down partly to a really excellent, downbeat performance from Kristen Stewart whose contribution to this festival was very substantial. She plays a troubled young woman who has two things to do: she is a personal assistant to a demanding fashionista, but she is also a medium, trying to contact the spirit of her dead twin brother. It was utterly intriguing, with audacious flourishes of suspense. And it was very well directed. Asghar Farhadi\u2019s The Salesman was a serious and valuable movie, though its pattern of opaque implications were beginning to look like a mannerism for this director and not as subtle as his previous movies. But it was widely admired at the festival and now gets both the screenplay prize (a valid award, I concede, considering the subtle intricacy of its structure) but also the best actor prize for Shahab Hosseini, as a teacher and actor in a semi-professional theatre group, playing Willy Loman in a production of Death of a Salesman. As the run begins, his wife is attacked in mysterious circumstances. Hosseini does a perfectly good job in the role and his underplaying is exactly right. But to return to the scandalous neglect of Maren Ade\u2019s comedy Toni Erdmann, I would have much preferred to see the prize go its star, Peter Simonischek, or indeed to Adam Driver for his wonderfully sympathetic, humble performance in Jarmusch\u2019s Paterson as the poet who drives a bus.     Sweet ... Grand Prix-winner American Honey Photograph: PR Image    The jury prize for Andrea Arnold\u2019s American Honey is pleasing: an American-realist study in the style of Van Sant and Korine, with something of Malick\u2019s reverence for epiphanic detail, all about a bunch of kids on a bus touring around the US, selling magazine subscriptions door-to-door and living and partying in hotel rooms at night. It was a film which I felt did not have the brilliance and natural idiom of her other films, and I also felt that Shia LaBeouf could have been directed and controlled more. But it had Arnold\u2019s habitual, superb confidence in her own ability to create ambient cinema, to summon up the mood and moment. She just puts you on the tour bus, or in the hotels, or in the K-Marts, or the streets around which the kids were trudging, and lets you stay there. We talk about films being immersive. You were marinaded in this one. I was always keen to see this a second time, and the Jury Prize has only whetted my appetite more. Cannes 2016 was an exceptionally good year, and the competition list was a virtually uninterrupted hot streak of talent, only rarely interrupted by disappointments. The prize list being an anticlimax is becoming a bit of a tradition, but need not lessen any satisfaction at this festival. 2016 is a great vintage.",
