  "body": "IT\u2019S ONLY BIG VASE FINAL, BABY With Liverpool on the verge of winning their ninth European trophy, it\u2019s only right that we pay some respect to the man who\u2019s made it possible. So do join The Fiver in doffing your cap to motivational speaking\u2019s Brendan Rodgers, who got Liverpool\u2019s Big Vase campaign rolling by leading them to outstanding, character-building 1-1 draws with mighty Bordeaux and FC Sion that you\u2019ve definitely not scrubbed from memory. What\u2019s more, they wouldn\u2019t even have been in Big Vase in the first place without the foresight of Rodgers, who clearly knew what he was up to when he led Liverpool to sixth place last season. But no one apart from The Fiver seems to respect King Brenny\u2019s work, even though he astutely judged that qualifying for Big Cup again would have been a grotesque waste of time, which just goes to show that people are so ungrateful these days.   Related: J\u00fcrgen Klopp out to end his losing streak as Liverpool seek Europa League glory | Andy Hunter    He laid the foundations with those two draws against those French and Swiss powerhouses and now here\u2019s J\u00fcrgen Klopp taking all the credit for himself. Most experts make Liverpool favourites to triumph in Wednesday\u2019s final against Sevilla, whose hopes of winning the trophy for a record third consecutive year rest on the slim likelihood of them being able to outwit Simon Mignolet and Kolo Tour\u00e9. Pah! Good luck with that! \u201cWe are here because we beat Dortmund? Right,\u201d Klopp said to wild applause. \u201cWe beat Man United? Right. And Villarreal? Right. In my opinion we are really in a perfect moment to play a final.\u201d The Fiver waited. And waited. And waited. But Klopp, the arrogant so and so, simply refused to pay the slightest heed to the Bordeaux and Sion efforts, instead choosing to rattle on about the prospect of beating Sevilla in Basel/Basle/Baaarl/Barzuhl. \u201cHow it feels to be a Liverpool legend I have no idea but it must be one of the best things you can feel in football,\u201d Klopp said, before asking if anyone had a number for Djinkin\u2019 Djimi Traor\u00e9 or Igor Biscan. All this rousing talk from Klopp and not a garbled philosophical utterance in sight. It\u2019s true what they say, you only truly miss something when it\u2019s gone.

QUOTE OF THE DAY 18 January 2014: \u201cI\u2019m sure no Norwegian has more respect than I do for the Fifa president Sepp Blatter. He is actually my role model\u201d \u2013 Kjetil Siem, then head of Norway\u2019s FA and formerly involved in the South Africa World Cup. 17 May 2016: \u201cAfter what I\u2019ve been through, I will not say anything about [salaries]. I put together my expenses and said yes to everything but was hung out for two months on the gallows. The transparency \u2026 was used against me\u201d \u2013 Siem vows not to reveal his salary again after being involved in an expenses inquiry related to his role as head of Norway\u2019s FA. 18 May 2016: \u201cI\u2019m very happy to have Kjetil Siem aboard Fifa. He has \u2026 shown the kind of qualities I need around me\u201d \u2013 new Fifa head honcho Gianni Infantino hires Siem as director of strategy.     Kjetil Siem: latest member of the Fifa family. Photograph: Gallo Images/Getty Images    A FORCE FOR GOOD 6 November 2015: \u201cI truly believe that all football clubs have to give something back to their local communities: to be a force for good \u2026 it\u2019s a simple rule: as we flourish and grow, so must the communities we live in. That\u2019s an obligation that we\u2019ve taken extremely seriously at [Taxpayers FC]\u201d \u2013 vice-chairwoman Karren Brady highlights football clubs\u2019 responsibility to give something back to their communities. 18 May 2016: \u201cAll proceeds from this summer\u2019s Farewell Boleyn auctions will go directly to the club\u2019s world-renowned academy of football and be invested into the future success of the team\u201d \u2013 after demanding up to \u00a3120 for the signs to Upton Park\u2019s khazis and \u00a3225 for the corner flags, Taxpayers FC confirm they will be trousering any funds raised. FIVER LETTERS \u201cThe bit about the \u2018dog-handling display\u2019 in yesterday\u2019s Fiver, and the suggested alternatives, reminded me of a time when I was at a Colorado Rapids match and a dog agility display was on show at half-time. As dogs raced each other across a series of obstacles, the team\u2019s subs were doing a kickabout nearby. One particularly eager dog (a Yorkie, I believe) was being held by its owner. The moment came for the dog to start its race. It was placed on the ground, did a complete 180 and headed straight for the ankles of Facundo Erpen, who displayed some surprisingly nimble footwork to avoid a decent chewing. Now that\u2019s entertainment\u201d \u2013 Sarah Rothwell. \u201cCommenting on the quote by Sevilla\u2019s sporting director Monchi that \u2018no one takes a What a Great Economic Results banner to the stadium\u2019 (yesterday\u2019s Quote of the Day), he clearly has sympathy for the campaign of modern football fans to replace playing football in stadiums and play football on Twitter instead. No wonder everyone likes him\u201d \u2013 Sam Crocker. \u2022 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And if you\u2019ve nothing better to do you can also tweet The Fiver.

BITS AND BOBS Plain Old John Terry will be free to continue captaining, leading and legending at Chelsea after signing a new one-year deal at the club. \u201cEveryone knows I\u2019m Chelsea through and through,\u201d he parped, like a stick of Stamford Bridge rock.     POJT\u2019s campaigning efforts have finally paid off. Photograph: TGSPhoto/Rex/Shutterstock    Romelu Lukaku\u2019s da reckons his son will make like Freddie Flinstone and Yabba Dabba Do One from Everton in the summer, with Bayern Munich or Manchester United the unfortunate victims. Flirts from Taxpayers FC and Tottenham are both engaged in a furious game of kiss chase with Bournemouth\u2019s Callum Wilson. Aston Villa are so hot right now. Wayne Rooney has ensured his Manchester United team will head into the FA Cup final full of confidence. \u201cWe haven\u2019t scored enough goals this season \u2026 We weren\u2019t good enough \u2026 It is very disappointing,\u201d he roared. Mart\u00edn Demichelis\u2019s pockets have been lightened to the tune of \u00a322,000 after he accepted a charge of betting on football matches. Hatem Ben Arfa believes 18 clubs have lined up to chase him in the Benny Hill style. \u201cI will reflect and discuss it with my entourage,\u201d he sniffed. Paul Trollope has been appointed manager of Cardiff City, replacing Russell Slade who has become the club\u2019s head of football. \u201cWe hope that under Paul\u2019s leadership, Cardiff City will return to the Premier League,\u201d thundered Cardiff owner Vincent Tan from his hollowed out volcano. Neil Warnock won\u2019t be extending his stay in charge of Rotherham United. And the FA will launch an inquiry into the pitch invasion after Hull\u2019s play-off semi-final victory, in which a couple of the club\u2019s fans got all up in the grille of Derby County\u2019s Richard Keogh in order to cover themselves in glory. STILL WANT MORE? All that is missing from Kolo Tour\u00e9\u2019s career is the perfect ending, swoons Paul Doyle in his love letter to the Liverpool defender.     Kolo, Kolo Kolo, etc. Photograph: Peter Powell/EPA    From a former street cleaner to a man who gets penalised simply for being bigger than everyone else: Sid Lowe\u2019s rundown of the Sevilla XI. Marina Hyde takes aim at Manchester United\u2019s fake bomb scare: \u201cWe are effectively engaged in conflict and proxy conflict in any number of theatres, including the Afghan theatre, the Syrian theatre, and the Theatre of Dreams.\u201d Which footballer has been relegated the most with one club? Which players have won two titles with two clubs in the same season? The Fiver doesn\u2019t have a clue. But The Knowledge does. Mauricio Pochettino has pulled off the incredible coup of getting Paulinho, Lewis Holtby, Etienne Capoue, Roberto Soldado, Vlad Chiriches, Aaron Lennon and Benjamin Stambouli off the payroll and making a profit from them at the same time.
