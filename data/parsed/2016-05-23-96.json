At least one demonstrator was reported to have been killed in the clashes and several more seriously injured. There have been several similar protests in recent weeks by supporters of the opposition leader, Raila Odinga, who lost the general election in 2013 to Uhuru Kenyatta.  The latest violence will focus further attention on the harsh tactics used by authorities in Kenya against political demonstrations.

Police had banned the planned demonstration and scores of officers in riot gear guarded the building. A water cannon truck later forced the convoy of vehicles carrying opposition leaders and supporters accompanying it on foot out of the city centre, witnesses said.

Though Kenya\u2019s next presidential and parliamentary polls are not due until August 2017, politicians are already trying to mobilise their supporters.   Odinga says the polls will not be free and fair with the current election commission in office and wants at least half the board to be replaced.  Commission officials have dismissed the claims and say they will stay. The government has called on the opposition not to stage street protests against the commission.

If they insist on rioting, they will meet us there,\u201d Lucas Ogara, Mombasa\u2019s police chief, told Reuters.

The violence of the police response has prompted international concern. Images last week appeared to show officers chasing a man as he fled a building near the commission\u2019s headquarters in Nairobi. After he stumbled to the ground, they kicked him and beat him with truncheons.  One officer, apparently unaware that journalists were recording, attacked with such force that part of his body armour fell off. After a few seconds, the police were shown sprinting away, leaving the young man motionless on the ground.     A riot policeman throws a teargas grenade at protesters in Kibera.

Observers fear a repeat of the violence that erupted after the 2007 vote and after the opposition disputed the outcome in 2013. More than 1,200 people are thought to have died in violence following ing the disputed 2007 election.",
