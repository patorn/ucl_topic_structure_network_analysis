  "body": "Margherita Missoni is sitting on the couch in the upper mezzanine of her front room. Her baby son Agosto is draped leopard-like over her arm, restless, with an amber teething necklace around his neck. Otherwise, her modern villa in Varese, northern Italy, has a terrific sense of calm. It\u2019s silent, save for a territorial bird called Linus that noisily guards the conservatory. Missoni, 33, was born into the Italian dynasty but came late, even reluctantly, to design and fashion. Despite being the granddaughter of the founders, she doesn\u2019t seem obviously a Missoni, or even Italian. Both her outfit, a punch of colour and attitude (an Issey Miyake striped top, three piercings in one ear, a temporary tattoo on her left wrist), and her house itself, a hoarder\u2019s delight, are at odds with the minimal Milanese aesthetic.     Margherita Missoni at home. Photograph: Paola Pansini    Her home is a lesson in thrift and online shopping. Hemmed in by bougainvillea and a large gate, it\u2019s private but low-key, a gorgeous muddle of old and new thrown together in an open-plan space. There\u2019s a motorcycle engine in the fireplace; a stack of architecture magazines in a woven basket; several Le Petit Bateau baby coats hang from a spray of plant-like hooks; and a photograph of her mother, smoking. In the bathroom hangs a 1980s Missoni campaign starring the family. The effect is witty, dishevelled, but considered. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly eBay,\u201d she says. \u201cMy phone is all ping-ping, eBay alerts.\u201d The layout is a split-level bento box \u2013 one main room and a slightly raised mezzanine to the side \u2013 which both open on to a conservatory. The room has two crescent-shaped couches in purple and gold (very Missoni) that fence off the seating area. There\u2019s a cluster of religious imagery on the wall: \u201cPresents from my grandmothers before my wedding,\u201d Missoni explains. Her interest in interior design is the reason she\u2019s collaborated with House of Peroni in London, designing a showcase for Italian culture. The space is filled with native flowers and is inspired by family gatherings. This is Missoni country; the family have long lived in the area. The village is idyllic and tight-knit. As a child, Margherita would pick wild salad with her grandmother in the meadows nearby. \u201cShe is 300 metres away, my cousins the other side. The factory is close \u2013 we [her brothers] grew up there, playing in the car park.\u201d Family is paramount, but Margherita has never been one to expect a job just because of her name. As a teenager, she moved to New York to study. \u201cIt\u2019s not that I wasn\u2019t interested in fashion, but I wanted a change. I studied philosophy at Columbia, then dropped out to do drama at the Lee Strasberg Institute.\u201d Meanwhile, she wore Missoni \u201cand became sort of an ambassador, from a distance, without the commitment\u201d.     The sideboard came from eBay. Photograph: Paola Pansini    She appeared in a play, The Maids, and later travelled to Paris and Rome on various tours. Being back in Italy made her realise how much she missed it, and she returned to Milan full-time. \u201cI didn\u2019t have the mind to do acting, but I think I had to find my own way back [to Missoni]. So I started looking after licensing, overseeing the non-mainline parts \u2013 \u2018mare\u2019, children, accessories, running the creative teams,\u201d she says. \u201cIt gave me a sense of belonging and confidence.\u201d In 2013, Missoni\u2019s uncle Vittorio, the company\u2019s chief executive, disappeared, aged 58, with his wife and four others in a small plane while on holiday. In a shattering stroke of double tragedy, his father died before the plane was found. It\u2019s palpably raw still. \u201cOf course it affected all of us. It was terrible,\u201d she says, her eyes welling up. \u201cI was not the most broken \u2013 that was my cousins, my mother and grandmother. I was pregnant when it happened. And when my husband\u2019s father died, I was pregnant again. Two boys. It is a cycle, perhaps. Strange, yes, but beautiful.\u201d Later, Missoni steps into the conservatory to roll a cigarette and wax about the joys of Masha And The Bear and Peppa Pig. Her jewellery jangles loudly as she explains the reality of being a working mother. \u201cI had my first baby and was lucky to be able to step out of the office. But it doesn\u2019t always work like that, the balance. This is a hard time for working women. My focus was on my children, though.\u201d She soothes her son. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if the necklace works,\u201d she laughs, \u201cor maybe he just wants Mummy.\u201d \u2022 Margherita Missoni is creative director of The House of Peroni For The Love Of Italy residency at Proud East, London N1, from 19 May-1 July.
