  "body": "Robert Peston has criticised rivals who take a \u201cvicious and vindictive\u201d approach to grilling politicians and public figures, arguing that it doesn\u2019t make for the best interviews. Peston, whose new ITV show Peston on Sunday launches this week, said \u201cpouring shit\u201d on politicians and celebrities creates an atmosphere where it is too dangerous for them to say what they really think in an interview. \u201cWhen public figures don\u2019t play it safe... then they get this incredible bucket of shit poured on them,\u201d said Peston, in an interview with the Radio Times. \u201cI think if we want people to say what they think, we\u2019ve got to disagree with them in a less vicious and vindictive way. There\u2019s nothing wrong with being courteous.\u201d The BBC\u2019s former economics editor, who moved to ITV late last year, said he wanted his new Sunday morning politics show to provide an environment where politicians and public figures will feel they can go beyond stock PR-driven commentary and open up about themselves. \u201cI am trying to create a space in which people who got out of the habit of speaking the truth and speaking confidently, can do both,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to try to get away from the horrible world where politicians feel they have to pre-prepare everything and that it\u2019s too dangerous to actually say what they really think.\u201d He points to a recent interview with prime minister David Cameron, who admitted investing money in his father\u2019s offshore trust, as an example of what kind of interview he wants to deliver on his one-hour show. Despite making a thinly-veiled poke at the combative journalism style employed by people such as Jeremy Paxman, Peston said he wasn\u2019t in the habit of \u201cbadmouthing\u201d rivals. \u201cI\u2019m a very, very, very competitive journalist but I would never badmouth a colleague,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyway, I think they [rivals] are all great and I\u2019m not trying to be better than them. I\u2019m just trying to be completely different. I hope that difference appeals to the public.\u201d Peston said he was pleased with the way Cameron spoke candidly about his father \u201cwhich I felt was genuine from what he had said before\u201d. Peston also commented on his image overhaul reflecting that it was in part a response to the death of his wife, Sian Busby, in 2012. \u201cI\u2019ve wondered why I changed my look so much,\u201d he said. \u201cI think some of it was an inevitable new start kind of thing. You\u2019re feeling absolutely miserable, everything\u2019s horrible, and I think I sort of reclaimed a look I had \u2013 believe it or not \u2013 when I was a teenager. I suspect I was trying to reclaim happier times.\u201d",
