  "body": "A Japanese artist who made a kayak modelled on her vagina has been found guilty of breaking the country\u2019s obscenity laws, in a case that has invited widespread ridicule of attitudes towards images of female genitalia. Megumi Igarashi, who works under the pseudonym Rokudenashiko \u2013 or good-for-nothing girl \u2013 was arrested in July 2014 after she distributed data that enabled recipients to make 3D prints of her vagina. The 44-year-old was fined 400,000 yen (\u00a32,575), half the penalty demanded by prosecutors, at the Tokyo district court on Monday after she was convicted of distributing \u201cobscene\u201d images. She was cleared of another charge of displaying similar material.  Igarashi distributed the data to help raise funds to create a kayak inspired by her genitalia she called \u201cpussy boat\u201d. The judge, Mihoko Tanabe, said that the data, though \u201cflat and inorganic\u201d, realistically portrayed the shape of a vagina and could \u201csexually arouse viewers\u201d, according to Kyodo News.

Tanabe said the kayak did not obviously resemble female genitalia and could not be considered obscene. Igarashi was freed days after her arrest following a legal appeal and a public petition. But she was arrested again months later for displaying decorated plaster figures moulded in the shape of her genitals, and sending and selling CD-Roms containing computer code for the images.  In court appearances, Igarashi insisted her artworks were not obscene and challenged attitudes towards female genitalia in Japan. \u201cI am innocent because neither the data for female genitals nor my artworks shaped like female genitals are obscene,\u201d she told the court last year. In an online post, she said: \u201cBecause female genitalia were \u2018overly hidden\u2019 in Japanese society, I did not know what a pussy should look like. \u201cI thought it was just funny to decorate my [moulded] pussy and make it a diorama, but I was very surprised to see how people get upset to see my works or even to hear me say manko,\u201d she added, using the Japanese slang word for vagina. Commentators pointed out the hypocrisy of Igarashi\u2019s trial, which began after Japanese authorities resisted pressure to ban pornographic images of children in manga and animated films, citing concerns over restricting freedom of artistic expression. Her case drew criticism of the apparent double standards in how Japanese law treats sexual imagery. The country has a thriving pornography industry, but its obscenity laws ban the depiction of genitalia, which usually appear pixelated in images and videos. Japan\u2019s obscenity laws carry a maximum penalty of two years in prison or a fine of up to 2.5m yen, but prosecutors decided in February to seek only a fine.
