  "body": "We launched our technology podcast Tech Weekly the year the first iPhone was released. Think about that. Most of us were still making calls on flip phones, MySpace was still relevant, and people were still renting DVDs from Blockbuster. That was eight years ago, and needless to say, Tech Weekly has come a long way. We\u2019ve covered topics such as how social media is used in Middle-Eastern conflicts and President Obama\u2019s Reddit AMA session, and done deep dives into things like ISIS\u2019 use of tech and why your Uber rating is actually quite important. We\u2019re ecstatic that so many of you have joined us for the ride, but it\u2019s time for Tech Weekly to be cut loose to make way for something even bigger and better.  The new show We are making a new digital culture and technology podcast that explores how tech influences and impacts our lives on a day-to-day basis ... Coming this June! To help us shape it, we\u2019d love to hear the one thing about tech you\u2019d like explained.       You can also drop us an email at podcasts@theguardian.com with \u201cTech\u201d in the subject line, or tweet at us @guardianaudio. While we\u2019re working away on the new show, we\u2019ll be releasing the best of our archived Tech Weekly episodes. You can tune in here, on iTunes or on your podcasting app of choice.",
