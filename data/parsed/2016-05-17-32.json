Fakamalo Kihe Eiki from Carmichael, California, describes himself as a \u201cChristian comedian\u201d on his Facebook page. He posted the stream in the early hours of Monday morning, and it quickly gained upwards of 90,000 views. \u201cThanks guys for enjoying the gift of life with me \u2026 lol come celebrate next weekend bbq if in area,\u201d Eiki wrote in a comment under the stream. Eiki on Tuesday defended himself from internet backlash over posting to his page that \u201cThe gift of life \u2026 is so bad to share \u2026 wow \u2026 such a world we live in \u2026 shame. Why watch? lol it was for those that were family and if you do not like, tune out?\u201d A few hours later he posted again, with some of his reasoning for posting the stream: \u201cI like how people seem to judge before they know anything \u2026 I am blessed to have a baby \u2026 I aired it live because people would rather talk about Donald trumps hair than the blessings in life \u2026 get real people \u2026 lol.\u201d         The Facebook Live stream.    Facebook Live is the social media giant\u2019s first foray into live broadcasting \u2013 an already crowded field, with Google\u2019s YouTube and Twitter\u2019s Periscope offering live-streaming broadcasting, though Facebook\u2019s vast potential audience of 1.5 billion users, they hope, will give them an edge over their competitors. Facebook\u2019s CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, himself said in a town hall meeting \u2013 which was broadcast over Facebook Live \u2013 that streaming video was one of the things he was \u201cmost excited\u201d about. One early live stream using the service, of two BuzzFeed reporters exploding a watermelon using elastic bands, garnered more than 10m total views, 800,000 of which were live. However, when BuzzFeed tried to run an interview with Barack Obama using the service, a technical glitch forced them to move the interview to a YouTube stream. Actual live streams of births are rare, but they have happened. In 2009, singer Erykah Badu live-tweeted the birth of her child; also in 2009 a Minnesota woman who went by the name Lynsee live-streamed the birth of her child using a camera crew on the site MomsLikeMe.com. In a later blogpost about her experience, Lynsee said: \u201cDo I regret what I did? Absolutely not! Would I do it again? Probably not. I loved sharing my experience, but I don\u2019t think I would have time to do it next time around!\u201d \u201cI knew that there would be a lot of people that would not agree with what we did. But to each their own! Yes, some of the criticism hurt. But most of the criticism was from ill-informed people who only read the headlines of articles,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut I also had a lot of support from all over the world!\u201d",
