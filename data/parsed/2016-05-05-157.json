  "body": "Next Thursday, Prime Minister David Cameron will host a landmark international anti-corruption summit in London. There are high hopes for the conference, but after the Panama Papers revelations and the fact that only four countries are rated as \u2018active enforcers\u2019 of the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention, there\u2019s a lot of work to do. While the PM will focus on getting countries such as Brazil, South Africa and Russia (that are facing their own corruption allegations) to sign up to an international anti-corruption body, there\u2019s already a series of interesting technological initiatives tackling corruption at a grassroots level.  Over 81,000 reports have been made to I Paid a Bribe, a special website for whistleblowers in India. Not in My Country guides students in Uganda and Kenya through the complaint process for reporting lecturers for corruption, and \u20ac5m of corruption involving Greek civil servants has been uncovered through the website EdosaFakelaki. But how do we transform this body of stories into real change? How can initiatives like those above be scaled up? And how can technology be used at a national and international level to help governments track and act on corruption? Join an expert panel on Thursday 12 May, 1-3pm BST, to discuss these questions and more.
