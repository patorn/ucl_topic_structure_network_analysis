  "body": "A Silicon Valley tech CEO who sparked outrage for threatening to aggressively harass low-income fruit vendors and \u201cmake their life miserable\u201d now says he is \u201cterribly sorry\u201d \u2013 with an apology that continues to defend his position. Mark Woodward, CEO of software company Invoca, published \u2013 and eventually deleted \u2013 a post on a public Facebook page saying that if fruit sellers were stationed outside his home in a suburb of San Jose, he would \u201cdo whatever it took to make them leave\u201d even if \u201cthat meant destroying some of their produce, or standing out there with signs to chase everyone away\u201d. Asked on Monday for comment about his post \u2013 which made him only the latest wealthy California entrepreneur to rant about low-income people \u2013 Woodward refused to apologize, sending a short statement saying his comments were an \u201cemotional reaction\u201d. He said he deleted the post because he \u201crealized bringing a nuanced conversation to a social forum where it could be taken out of context was not the best way to bring resolution to a serious, multi-faceted issue\u201d.   Related: I'll 'make their life miserable': tech CEO bullies low-income vendors by his home    On Tuesday, in the face of significant backlash, he published a Medium post titled My Apology, saying he learned a \u201ctough lesson\u201d about \u201cthe power of my words\u201d. Woodward said he had posted on Facebook to share his \u201cfrustrations with a situation affecting my family and our neighborhood\u201d:  My comments were heated, but also insensitive and offensive to some people. For that I am terribly sorry. Shortly after realizing the gravity of my words taken out of context, I removed my comments.  But he also continued to defend the remarks, writing that they were a \u201cresponse to several incidents that have made me and my neighbors feel unsafe, including one that required me to call the police because individuals were physically threatening me at my home\u201d. Woodward did not respond to requests for comment about the alleged incident he referenced in his apology, and San Jose police did not immediately respond to an inquiry.  In Woodward\u2019s original Facebook posts, he described a situation in which he appeared to be the aggressor: \u201cI had a family, not from our neighborhood who was constantly digging through the recycle bins in our neighborhood illegally. I confronted them rather aggressively and they have never been back.\u201d    Invoca CEO Mark Woodward in hot water for insensitive comments https://t.co/odeg3POOwp pic.twitter.com/Zm7ALbE9PR\u2014 Ted (@Galaxy_19) April 29, 2016    His apology did little to appease angry residents in the Willow Glen neighborhood of San Jose, who had criticized him for railing against Latino residents who are less fortunate than him and often struggle to make ends meet. \u201cFor him to say his words were taken out of context is a lie,\u201d said Jillian Torrez, a 30-year-old resident who grew up in Willow Glen. \u201cThose words were taken for what they are. He\u2019s just upset because he\u2019s in the public eye. This is just some PR, trying to get back in the good graces of people. In this day and age, you have to be accountable for the things you say.\u201d  Torrez, who works for the government, said the fruit vendors in the neighborhood never cause problems. \u201cThey\u2019ve always been very friendly \u2026 This is a working-class area. Some people are fortunate enough to live in a nice home, but not everyone is blessed in that way.\u201d If neighbors have serious concerns about the fruit vendors, they should politely approach the merchants and have a civil discussion, she added. \u201cTo say you would destroy somebody\u2019s livelihood because you don\u2019t like them selling fruit? \u2026 People can see him for what he really is. He\u2019s not this nice person. He\u2019s an elitist snob.\u201d",
