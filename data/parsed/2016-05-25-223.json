Those who define themselves as Christian \u2013 Anglicans, Catholics and other denominations \u2013 made up 43.8% of the population. \u201cThe striking thing is the clear sense of the growth of \u2018no religion\u2019 as a proportion of the population,\u201d said Stephen Bullivant, senior lecturer in theology and ethics at St Mary\u2019s Catholic University in Twickenham, who analysed data collected through British Social Attitudes surveys over three decades.
