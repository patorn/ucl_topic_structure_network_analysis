Related: James Deen, the porn star who failed as a feminist fantasy | Eva Wiseman    Deen, who also recently faced numerous accusations of sexual assault, was issued California state citations and fines in March for his production company\u2019s alleged violations of condom and workplace regulations, with state officials claiming that his firm exposed performers to STIs. Deen denied the allegations of labor violations, arguing that his performers have tested negative for infections and have voluntarily chosen not to wear condoms. He further accused California regulators of enacting a \u201cpolitical and moral agenda\u201d against pornography and \u201csexual free-expression\u201d.           James Deen on porn industry: extract from Guardian interview in 2012    In an apparent attempt to highlight how regulators disproportionately target and scrutinize the adult entertainment industry, Deen filed a state complaint against Bellator MMA and its owner Viacom, alleging that the companies have violated the same HIV regulations for which James Deen Productions was cited.    Sex workers should not be held to different standards under the same regulations as their mainstream counterparts  James Deen     The complaint with California\u2019s division of occupational safety and health (Cal/OSHA) alleges that the mixed martial arts company has failed to comply with state policies aimed at preventing exposure to bloodborne pathogens, according to Deen\u2019s announcement. In other words, Deen, who has no connection to professional fighting, is arguing that if the state contends that his adult entertainment firm has failed to protect performers from STIs, officials should also go after Bellator MMA and other forms of entertainment. \u201cYou can\u2019t pick and choose how to enforce the law,\u201d Deen said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cSex workers should not be held to different standards under the same regulations as their mainstream counterparts.\u201d His company added in a press release: \u201cWhile both the adult film and professional fighting industries require their performers to undergo testing for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis, and the like, only the adult industry is being fined and reprimanded.\u201d     James Deen also faced a string of sexual assault accusations from fellow porn actors last year.

But the investigation into the condom practices of Deen\u2019s company stemmed from a complaint by the Aids Healthcare Foundation, a nonprofit that is critical of the porn industry and has advocated condom requirements. Asked about the complaint against MMA, Michael Weinstein, founder of the Aids Healthcare Foundation, said he had not heard about Deen\u2019s announcement but added: \u201cHow great is the credibility of a man who has been accused of rape by eight women?\u201d Deen faced a string of sexual assault accusations from fellow porn actors last year \u2013 allegations that led industry groups to sever ties with the actor, who described the claims as \u201cfalse and defamatory\u201d. Weinstein said his organization has targeted Deen because \u201che is the biggest star in the industry, and he\u2019s been the most outspoken in fighting against condoms. So he\u2019s put the spotlight on himself, and as citizens we\u2019re free to file complaints.\u201d Weinstein said the foundation\u2019s claims against Deen were substantiated when Cal/OSHA announced penalties of $77,875 to his film production company, also known as Third Rock Enterprises. \u201cHe\u2019s violated the law, and that\u2019s why they\u2019re going after them. He\u2019s just trying to change the subject,\u201d Weinstein said, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t know what the rules are as it relates to mixed martial arts. I think that Cal/OSHA should try to protect people in the sport as much as possible.\u201d Representatives for Cal/OSHA, Bellator and Viacom did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",
