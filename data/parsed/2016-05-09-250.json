  "body": "The mint juleps were flowing, and the music, supplied by a jazz trio tucked into the dining room, was southern and sweet. Women in elaborately designed hats and men in snappy fedoras selected from a menu in which bourbon played a featured role, their Derby-best attire not deterring them from digging into the ribs that streamed from the kitchen on trays held high about the servers\u2019 heads.  Louisville? Lexington?  Nope. Harlem. On the afternoon of 7 May, a multiracial crowd packed New Harlem Besame to watch the 142nd Kentucky Derby, to celebrate Harlem style, fashion, and food, and to honor the African Americans who played such a prominent role in the early history of the race, only to all but disappear from the sport at the start of the 20th century.    Related: Nyquist produces brilliant run to win Kentucky Derby    The Harlem Derby party was conceived by Rob Owens and Annette Harris to celebrate the heritage that saw African American jockeys ride 12 of the horses in the first Kentucky Derby and win 15 of the first 28 editions of America\u2019s best-known horse race.  \u201cWe think it\u2019s really important to get this history out,\u201d said Harris. \u201cWhenever we\u2019d tell people about the history of black jockeys in horse racing, they\u2019d say, \u2018What? We didn\u2019t know that,\u2019 and get really excited about it.\u201d  This year\u2019s party, the fourth, honored former jockey Ronnie Tanner, who rode in New York and New Jersey in the 1960s and 70s. He was among the top 10 jockeys at Aqueduct when racing ended there in the winter of 1967, his first season riding in New York, and the top apprentice. The following year, he was featured in an episode of PBS\u2019s Black Journal, and on Saturday, he was introduced to sustained applause by Gatha \u201cGate\u201d Artis, who\u2019s been clocking horses at New Jersey\u2019s Monmouth Park for 46 years. \u201cIt\u2019s been 50 years since I first came to New York and wanted to be a jockey,\u201d said Tanner, a Pittsburgh native. \u201cTo be here in New York and in Harlem, where things really got started for me \u2026 it feels great.\u201d  In a year in which a sorority at Dartmouth College cancelled its Kentucky Derby-themed party after some students protested that the run for the roses is rooted in a racist history, revelers in Harlem chose to focus not on the long era in which African Americans were excluded from horse racing, but on the important role that they played in it. Newton Hinds III, a principal in the Hinds Property Group in lower Manhattan, grew up in Elmont, New York, close enough to Belmont Park, he said, to smell the horses.  \u201cI think that a lot of legacies that have gone on to be great have come from some of the most horrifying chapters of our nation\u2019s history,\u201d he said, sipping a mint julep at the bar. \u201cBut carrying that legacy forward is what\u2019s important. It\u2019s important to recognize what went wrong, but it\u2019s also important not to dismiss the legacy of those pioneers that were there.\u201d  Though African American jockeys, grooms, and hotwalkers used to be ubiquitous, they have all largely disappeared, replaced by Latinos. There are few African American thoroughbred trainers and owners, and few in the offices of racetracks and industry organizations across the country.     The celebrations get into full swing. Photograph: Antoine DeBrill    \u201cAt Monmouth,\u201d said Artis, one of the few black clockers in the sport, \u201cwe have no African Americans in the offices. Not even one person in the racing office taking entries, and it\u2019s a shame.\u201d    Related: CJ McMahon and the rise and fall of the black jockey    No black jockeys rode in this year\u2019s 20-horse Kentucky Derby field, but that made little difference to the nearly 200 people crowded into Besame when the horses broke from the gate a little after 6:30 pm. Seated closest to the big screen, a woman in a white dress and hat hollered, \u201cThat\u2019s my horse!\u201d as longshot Danzing Candy set the early pace, leading through much of the first mile of the race. Nearby, a man in a black fedora confidently counseled a tablemate, apparently the backer of another runner, \u201cDon\u2019t you worry about number 20 \u2014 don\u2019t you worry.\u201d (He was right: Danzing Candy finished 15th.) Tanner never rode in the Kentucky Derby, or in any of the races that a casual fan might recognize. Despite his early success, he struggled in New York and rode for the rest of his relatively brief career in New Jersey, convinced that the sport\u2019s predominantly white owners wouldn\u2019t give him a shot. \u201cOne of the trainers I rode for told me one day, when I walked into the paddock, \u2018Ronnie, act like you don\u2019t speak English, because this owner doesn\u2019t like black people.\u2019 Except he didn\u2019t say \u2018black people\u2019; he used another word,\u201d Tanner recounted. \u201cSo I kept my mouth shut because that\u2019s the way it was. And when the owner found out I was black, he didn\u2019t ride me anymore.\u201d  Tanner now focuses on telling his story, and those of the black jockeys who came before him. He has represented Ken Browne\u2019s Black Turf Project at events in Kentucky and New York, appearing at last fall\u2019s Equus Film Festival in Manhattan\u2019s East Village, and it\u2019s through Browne that he met Owens, who made him the guest of honor this year. \u201cWe want to differentiate ourselves from other Derby parties,\u201d said Owens, who grew up in Kentucky. \u201cThis is Harlem, the mecca of black America, and our party is Derby-inspired and Harlem-created. It\u2019s about fashion and style, food and beverage and music, and the sport of horse racing.\u201d \u201cAnd it\u2019s also,\u201d he went on, \u201cabout African American history and achievement, and the contributions we\u2019ve made to the Kentucky Derby and Thoroughbred horse racing.\u201d",
