He did it in 58.36sec, which broke his own championship record, and was a tenth of a second faster than Cameron van der Burgh\u2019s old world record, which Peaty beat while swimming in the same lane of this same pool in April last year. It was the fastest anyone has gone this year, and means Peaty now has six of the 10 quickest times in history. Right now he ranks among Great Britain\u2019s very strongest contenders to win a gold medal at the Olympics this summer. If his year pans out as he hopes and plans, this performance will end up a footnote in his list of accomplishments. Eighty days out from the Olympics, these European championships seem to be serving as little more than a warm-up for the swimmers going to Rio. Peaty has described them as \u201ca stepping stone\u201d.   Related: Sport picture of the day: James Guy's freestyle bubble    He won here in a record time even though, like most of his team-mates, he had not bothered to taper, but was fitting the competition in between his training sessions. Before the championships started, Peaty\u2019s heavy schedule had left him so sore that, he said, he couldn\u2019t even get out of his car. He had not prepared for this event. In fact he did not even bother to shave down before his heat, reckoning, with good reason, that the few fractions of seconds he was giving up would not cost him any too much. Peaty\u2019s personal best, that world record of 57.92, was more than a second better than that of the next best man, Lithuania\u2019s Giedrius Titenis. In the end, it was Peaty\u2019s teammate Ross Murdoch who came closest to him in the final, in a repeat of their one-two at the last championships, in 2014. Murdoch finished in 59.73, a fine time in its own right but a long way back from Peaty\u2019s, who made winning look very easy indeed. Afterwards he summed up his performance in a single word: \u201cmint\u201d. He said that he had been training so hard that he was worried whether he would \u201ceven break a minute\u201d, let alone 59 seconds. \u201cI just don\u2019t get it, because I\u2019m still in a really hard training block,\u201d Peaty said. \u201cBut what can I say? I did it, did the process, and came out with a 58.3.\u201d Some of his speed, Peaty said, was down to the crowd, who were stirred into life by the sight of him. \u201cIt was amazing support,\u201d he said, \u201cthis is one of the best races I have ever had in terms of GB support.\u201d Loud as his fans are now, much as they love him, this is nothing compared to the reception he will get if he wins in the Olympics. He would be the first British man to win an Olympic gold medal in the swimming since Adrian Moorhouse back in 1988 and Peaty is feeling supremely confident about his chances of doing exactly that. \u201cThe top four times in the world are all mine now, so it is looking good going into Rio.\u201d If Peaty is this quick when he is out of racing shape, imagine how fast he will be when he is back in it. \u201cIt just feels like my stroke is in the best place ever,\u201d he said. He won a second gold medal later on, as part of the mixed 4x100m relay team, along with Fran Halsall, Chris Walker-Hebborn and Siobhan-Marie O\u2019Connor. There were bronze medals, too, for both Halsall and Ben Proud in the 50m butterfly. Peaty and his coach, Mel Marshall, will soon start thinking about his run-in to the Games. Before that, he will also swim in the 50m breaststroke later this week. But, as he says, \u201cit\u2019s not an Olympic event\u201d and so he is not too worried about how he goes \u2013 and besides he can afford to think that way, because in this form he will most likely win it anyway.",
