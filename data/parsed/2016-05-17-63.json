  "body": "Anthony Lester (Human rights must be protected against the abuse of power, 16 May) is right about human rights, but wrong on medieval kings: \u201ca government-controlled legislature that enjoys absolute power\u201d is not medieval but modern. Medieval kings were constrained by formal oaths and by the need to keep the consent of aristocrats and gentry, churchmen, city councils, and defenders of local customs \u2013 all with rights and privileges, which, over time and with multiple inputs including not least those of lawyers, grew into human\u00a0rights.Jinty NelsonKing\u2019s College London \u2022 Boris Johnson need not worry about air pollution outside schools (Johnson \u2018buried\u2019 study linking toxic air and deprived schools, 17 May). Young gentlemen going to Eton have benefited from clean air since 1970 when the bridge over the Thames between Eton and Windsor, a direct cause of traffic outside the school, was closed to motor traffic. It\u00a0remains the only major road bridge over the Thames ever to have been shut. But extending such benefits to the\u00a0plebs\u2026 cripes, how absurd!David CooperNewbury, Berkshire \u2022 Beware what you wish for, South African musicians and music fans (Quotas to end South Africa\u2019s radio \u2018imperialism\u2019, 13 May). You should listen to the vacuous and trite output of\u00a0French radio music stations to see what impact a cultural quota is likely to have. This notwithstanding the fact that the greatest 21st century pop song (so far) is by a French band from Versailles (One Time Too Many by Phoenix).Tom CarterLondon \u2022 The Ronald Searle/Geoffrey Willans cartoon, mentioned in Cherry Weston\u2019s letter (17 May), is one of four, entitled The Private Life of the Gerund, and actually reads: \u201cSocial snobery [sic]. A gerund \u2018cuts\u2019 a gerundive.\u201d Molesworth\u2019s Latin masters would have approved of such pedantry.Mark StoreyBirmingham \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
