MH17 was brought down by a missile as it flew over eastern Ukraine on its way to Kuala Lumpur from Amsterdam in July 2014, killing all 298 people on board. Twenty-seven Australians were among the victims, among them Mo, Otis and Evie Maslin and their grandfather Nick Norris of Perth. Their parents, Anthony Maslin and Marite Norris, said their family was \u201ctorn apart\u201d by the loss of their children, aged 13, 12, and 10.

Photograph: Maslin family/AAP    \u201cWe live in a hell beyond hell,\u201d said the couple a week after the crash. \u201cOur babies are not here with us \u2013 we need to live with this act of horror, every day and every moment for the rest of our lives.\u201d But they said the arrival of their baby daughter, nearly two years later, is testament to their belief that \u201clove is stronger than hate\u201d. Violet May Maslin was born on Tuesday. Maslin and Norris saidon Thursday that they believed their baby daughter was a \u201cgift\u201d sent by their lost family members. \u201cWe still live with pain, but Violet, and the knowledge that all four kids are with us always, brings light to our darkness ...

Violet brings some hope and joy for us.\u201d The Dutch safety board report into the crash released in October suggested that a Buk anti-aircraft missile was most likely to have brought down the plane, but questions remained about who was controlling it. Most evidence pointed to a missile launched from separatist-controlled territory. Paul Guard, a Queensland man whose parents both died when MH17 was brought down, said after the release of the report that Malaysia Airlines should have been told not to fly over the conflict zone in eastern Ukraine.",
