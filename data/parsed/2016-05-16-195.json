  "body": "Anne Widdop, director of Event Software, explains why Morag Webster should win the Rising Star category of the Guardian Small Business Showcase competition:   Morag has been on a steep learning curve to become the CTO, CFO and sales and marketing lead in three startup companies. What is remarkable is that she had no experience in these roles and did not benefit from higher education. She is wholly self taught, nothing is too much of a challenge and she is truly a star.  Morag has been key to the establishment of three companies, one of which turns over \u00a3250,000 after three years with only \u00a31000 of investment.  She has also developed an app that is set to revolutionise the wedding industry. Morag led the technological development \u2013 from concept through design, development and launch. She is constantly challenging the norm, and is a true innovator. The latest development from Event Software is an AI Big Data Project developing ground-breaking Sentic Analysis (emotional mining of data) which will enable machines to interpret human language better. Morag also helped establish The Fuze Foundation, a humanist organisation, which has raised thousands of pounds for charities. Winning this award would be an amazing boost to her.  All entries which meet the competition criteria are published and our judging panel select a shortlist of the top three for each category. Winners are announced at an awards ceremony in summer 2016.",
