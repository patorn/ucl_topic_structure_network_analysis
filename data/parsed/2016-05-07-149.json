  "body": "Jo Oakley bought her beach hut in Whitstable for \u00a3220 more than 20 years ago, when her daughters Hannah and Daisy were young. \u201cAs soon as they were home from school on a Friday, we\u2019d jump in the car and head out of London to the seaside,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen it was warm, we\u2019d all bed down on the deck and star-watch until we fell asleep.\u201d Oakley, an artist, has seen Whitstable evolve from a backwater fishing port on the Thames estuary into a thriving coastal town. Her hut would cost about \u00a325,000 today. \u201cOld-timers might complain that it\u2019s changed but I think most of those changes \u2013 being able to get a great cup of coffee, say \u2013 have been for the better. I\u2019ve been coming here for so long that I get treated like a local. When I\u2019m buying fish in the harbour, they\u2019ll often pop an extra one in the bag for nothing.\u201d    The beaded chandelier was a present from my nana ... the 50s curtain fabric came from a beach hut that was being updated    For Oakley, the idea of fitting out her hut with new furniture had no attraction. Everything in it has had a previous life. \u201cThe beaded chandelier was a present from my nana, and the 1950s curtain fabric came from a beach hut that was being updated,\u201d she says. She has collected vintage china with a passion since childhood; the family who owned the hut before her left behind a set of 1950s crockery.     The hut sleeps two comfortably on futon.

Communal loos for hut owners are a short walk away, and Oakley has a solar-heated shower on the side of the hut, useful for rinsing off after a swim. \u201cSwimming is one of my great pleasures,\u201d she says. She kayaks when her partner, Ed, comes for the weekend: they knew each other as teenagers and met again in Whitstable about 10 years ago \u2013 he had a hut along the beach. The hut sleeps two comfortably, on a futon, but her daughters have had half a dozen friends to stay by putting tents up in the garden. This simple lifestyle is conducive to creativity. \u201cBeach hut life is basic. You become much more aware of the elements: the weather, the light, the view, the sound of wind and waves, and the tide,\u201d she says.     A portable stove and a selection of lanterns add to the vintage feel. Photograph: Photograph by Andreas von Einsiedel    One of Oakley\u2019s favourite haunts in Whitstable is Wheelers Oyster Bar. \u201cIt\u2019s tiny and you have to bring your own wine, but the fish is delicious,\u201d she says. \u201cOn balmy evenings, they\u2019ll prepare a platter of shellfish for you, which we take back to the deck outside the hut. Then we\u2019ll curl up on the cushions and star-watch. That\u2019s one aspect of Whitstable that will never change.\u201d \u2022 Jo Oakley\u2019s work can be seen by arrangement at Jonathan Cooper Gallery, London SW10.
