Earlier this month, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), called Ethiopia\u2019s condition \u201ca deteriorated humanitarian situation\u201d.   Related: African forestry scheme aims to build prosperity by restoring landscape    Environmental degradation has played a big role. Ethiopia has long been a victim of land degradation, driven by increased human use of land and unsustainable agricultural practices. Grazing of animals and collection of firewood haven\u2019t helped \u2013 with less cover and protection against erosion, soil is more easily washed away. Now, Ethiopia is drawing on its business community and public sector to do something about it. Earlier this year, the country agreed to join the African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative (AFR100), a country-led effort to bring 100m hectares of land in Africa into restoration by 2030. The initiative was launched formally at COP21 in Paris. AFR100 will see governments working together with regional institutions, public and private sector partners and international development programs to restore productivity to deforested and degraded landscapes, mostly through restoring forests and planting trees on agricultural land. \u201cAFR100 seeks to realize the benefits that trees can provide in African landscapes, thereby contributing to improved soil fertility and food security, improved availability and quality of water resources, reduced desertification, increased biodiversity, the creation of green jobs, economic growth, and increased capacity for climate change resilience, adaptation and mitigation,\u201d the group\u2019s mission states.     Ethiopia has recently joined AFR100, a country-led effort to bring 100m hectares of land in Africa into restoration by 2030. Now, it is looking to the private sector for help to achieve its goal.

Africa is thought to be most severely impacted, with 65% of arable land, 30% of grazing land and 20% of forests already lost to land degradation. In Ethiopia alone, recent estimates put the size of degraded land at over one-quarter of the entire country, which affects nearly a third of the population \u2013 some 20 million people. At a minimum, this contributes to losses of 3% of agricultural GDP. Degraded lands are also less resilient to the periodic droughts that precipitate famines. \u201c[Ethiopia is] losing so much soil because of poor land management,\u201d said Florence Landsberg, a senior associate at the World Resources Institute (WRI), an NGO. \u201cIt is not sustainable and they know it very well.\u201d In response to this challenge, Ethiopia has begun implementing programs that have restored more than 1m hectares of degraded land through community reforestation programs, better irrigation and planting trees alongside river banks to reduce erosion. The regional government of Tigray managed a campaign to reduce grazing and firewood harvest on degraded lands and build terraces on hilly agricultural lands. Now, by joining the AFR100, Ethiopia is committing to scaling up its existing efforts in order to restore 15m hectares of degraded land \u2013 an area greater than the size of England. \u201cThe government and communities realize that land degradation is affecting the growth and development of Ethiopia,\u201d says Ashebir Wondimu Zeleke, senior forestry expert at the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change of Ethiopia. \u201cThat is why the government of Ethiopia is aggressively working on mass mobilization and Ethiopian farmers are investing their free labor to restore degraded lands through integrated watershed management efforts. We need to conserve and manage our natural resources, our land [and] our ecosystem services.\u201d     One-quarter of land in Ethiopia is degraded, affecting about 20 million people. Photograph: The Washington Post/Getty Images    The interpretation of forest and landscape restoration is broad. It can cover a range of activities, including agroforestry, timber plantations for the production of fuel wood and the restoration of degraded forests. As greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere continue to break records, restoration is one way to capture carbon dioxide in the soil, trees and other vegetation. For example, restoring 15m hectares in Ethiopia could capture as much as 1.42 gigatons of CO2 \u2013 the equivalent of removing almost 300m cars from the roads for one year. Other types of restoration, such as Farmer Managed Natural Regeneration, rely on trees and other plants still in the landscape. Farmers selectively prune tree stumps and protect land from grazing animals, resulting in surprising tree growth results. This type of restoration is less challenging from a biophysical perspective, but requires extensive outreach to farmers in order to achieve scale.

Like Ethiopia, Kenya has been consistently plagued by droughts, which have heavily impacted on surrounding landscape and livestock numbers. \u201cWhat used to be a sustainable ecosystem has been chopped down for charcoal and firewood, for building poles, a little for slash and burn agriculture, and then has been gobbled to bits by goats,\u201d Howard says. Komaza has already planted 2,000 hectares of trees, working with some 6,000 farmers. \u201cUntil [world] governments step up to say \u2018We value restoring land\u2019 and until there are mechanisms that [reward landowners for planting trees], the challenge is finding businesses that can get trees in the ground,\u201d Howard says. While Ethiopia and other AFR100 countries are devoting resources to the commitment, public funds are likely to be insufficient to meet the ambitious target. That\u2019s why many groups are focused on enticing the private sector to make restoration investments. \u201cWe have to develop a proof of concept for restoration models where people can earn money and it does something good for the environment,\u201d says Till Pistorius, deputy head of the climate division at international consulting firm Unique Forestry and Land Use, which provides advice on forest management and sustainable land use.     Moringa Partnership and other AFR100 impact investors will look to invest in Ethiopian farmers that can make money from restoration. Beef, dairy, coffee, timber and firewood producers will be the primary targets for investment. Photograph: Mulugeta Ayene/AP    In order to increase private sector financing, AFR100 has sought commitments from a number of impact investors, such as the Moringa Partnership, which invests in large-scale agroforestry projects that benefit the environment and local populations. Combined, these investors have earmarked $546m for AFR100 land restoration investments. Moringa has already put money into an agroforestry coffee project in Nicaragua, and is planning to invest tens of millions of dollars more by 2018. Moringa and others will look to invest in companies and farmers that can make money from restoration. In Ethiopia, beef, dairy, coffee, timber and firewood producers will be the primary targets for investment. Clement Chenost, investment director of Moringa Partnerships, says Moringa is looking to invest in companies that have a proven concept and an \u201cestablished a base of production\u201d. \u201cWe are not doing venture capital or pure startup. We bring capital to scale up companies and reach size and maturity.\u201d But many challenges still remain. Bureaucracy, for one. Environmental initiatives are often hampered by conflicting priorities between different ministries. The ministry of agriculture might have different plans for a piece of land than the ministry of environment, for example. \u201cWe need to work with different institutions, bilateral organizations, and restoration actors, including the private sector,\u201d Zeleke says. \u201cBringing this effort to the landscape with a common vision is not easy.\u201d  This article was amended on 4 May.
