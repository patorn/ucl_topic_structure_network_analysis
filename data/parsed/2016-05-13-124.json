  "body": "Twenty-four years ago, Vanessa Redgrave, Anthony Hopkins, Emma Thompson and Helena Bonham Carter strode up the red carpet in Cannes to present Howards End, the latest EM Forster adaptation by director/producer powerhouse James Ivory and Ismail Merchant. The film was ecstatically received and, despite losing out on the Palme d\u2019Or to The Best Intentions, the Bille August drama about Bergman\u2019s parents, it did go on to impress at the box office and win countless awards, including three Oscars. On Friday, Redgrave and Ivory were back on the Croisette (Merchant died in 2005) to present a restored print, reflect on how the film\u2019s message \u2013 about the necessity of bridging the English class divide \u2013 is less fashionable today and consider why the film\u2019s fortunes fell in favour of a millennial itch for grit. The success of Merchant Ivory\u2019s catalogue in the 1990s presaged a glut of upscale costume dramas, meaning the company name became a barbed byword for a particular type of prestige British film-making. \u201cIt was a political attitude that rose up against anything to do with old England,\u201d said Ivory. \u201cSuch political things lose their strength after a while and fall away and what you made doesn\u2019t lose its strength, hopefully.\u201d \u201cIt was a new kind of snobbery. We were showing examples of snobbery but their attitude was very snobbish.\u201d     Samuel West and Helena Bonham Carter in Howards End. Photograph: Moviestore/REX/Shutterstock    Such opinions, said Redgrave, were often the result \u201cof people who just like hearing the sound of their own voice and have usually not seen the film. Howards End is really, really deep.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve found throughout my life that people jump to assumptions without having any knowledge, really. But they like to make an opinion and if it\u2019s flashy or well-chosen or whatever then it becomes a catchphrase and becomes passed around. It\u2019s like catching a cold, it seems to me. I\u2019m stunned that anybody ever should have said a word [against it]. It\u2019s superb film-making. Some people won\u2019t go along with that. But who cares about those people?\u201d In the film, Redgrave plays Mrs Wilcox, the first wife of Hopkins\u2019 banker. She is highly-attached to their country home, Howards End, and leaves it in her will to her friend Margaret Schlegel (Thompson), who, with her siblings, is being evicted from their flat by developers.            Wilcox and his children burn the will, but Margaret and her family end up inheriting the property anyway after she and Wilcox marry; the fates of the two families become further entwined when Margaret and sister Helen (Bonham Carter) try to improve the lot of a sensitive bank clerk, Leonard Bast (Samuel West).  Redgrave rejects any suggestion the narrative reinforces predestination \u2013 \u201cI don\u2019t believe in fate for a second. Why should I?\u201d \u2013 but says that since the film was shot she has come increasingly to \u201cshare James\u2019s belief in humans and in extraordinary processes of nature. Even when the odds seem entirely against something good happening it happens. That\u2019s without a doubt. Sometimes one can get impatient with superficial reactions of media or a person or whatever. I sometimes get maddened by the Guardian but nevertheless. As the film shows, I think perfectly, there\u2019s more to life and human beings than the human beings themselves know.\u201d Forster\u2019s dream that the classes would manage to connect had been realised through social media, says Ivory. \u201cI think he would have liked anything which brought people together, where they would open their hearts and minds to each other. Social media does do that; in a very superficial way sometimes, but it has brought us closer.\u201d       Redgrave at the Howards End photocall. Photograph: Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images     Although Ivory said that rewatching the film had alerted him to one shot he would now shoot differently, Redgrave said there was nothing about her performance she would alter with hindsight. \u201cI have done work in films [where] I\u2019ve deeply regretted some of the choices that were made which I had to adapt to and which I made which were clearly not right. You see those moments in your work overall but not in this film.\u201d The critical and commercial success of Howards End should, said Redgrave, stand as an example to financiers wary of backing apparently non-commercial projects. Producers today, she said are forced \u201cto think what the financiers and distributors are wanting, not what ordinary people are wanting. Because the two have got nothing to do with each other.\u201d",
