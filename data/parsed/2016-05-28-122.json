  "body": "A Los Angeles judge has granted a restraining order against Johnny Depp from his estranged wife Amber Heard, who has accused him of domestic violence, court documents show. The documents, filed on Friday by lawyers representing Heard, state that Depp \u201cviolently attacked\u201d Heard on Saturday night in their penthouse apartment.  Photographs submitted to the court show Heard with a large bruise on her face, as well as broken bottles, picture frames and shattered glass on the floor. On Saturday evening, according to a statement from Heard filed on Friday in support of the restraining order, Depp \u201cbegan obsessing over something that wasn\u2019t true\u201d and \u201cbecame extremely angry\u201d, eventually throwing a cellphone at Heard, striking her cheek and eye \u201cwith extreme force\u201d. Heard said that Depp \u201ccontinued screaming at me, pulling my hair, striking me and violently grabbing my face\u201d. After Heard\u2019s friend Raquel Pennington entered the apartment, Depp \u201cpicked up the magnum size bottle of wine he had been drinking out of, and he started swinging it around, smashing everything he could\u201d, the statement continues. A separate statement from Pennington, also submitted to the court, supports Heard\u2019s description of events, alleging that Depp swung the magnum of wine \u201clike a baseball bat\u201d. An opposing document filed by Depp\u2019s lawyers claims that \u201cAmber is attempting to secure a premature financial resolution by alleging abuse\u201d and states that Depp is \u201cunable to attend the hearing on this matter and has not heard Amber\u2019s specific allegations against him\u201d. Lawyers for Depp did not immediately respond to requests from the Guardian for comment. On Monday, Heard filed for divorce from Depp and is seeking spousal support from the Oscar-nominated actor, to whom she was married for just over a year.

In her statement, Heard said that \u201cduring the entirety of our relationship, Johnny has been verbally and physically abusive to me. I endured excessive emotional, verbal and physical abuse from Johnny, which has included angry, hostile, humiliating and threatening assaults to me whenever I questioned his authority or disagreed with him.\u201d Documents also showed that the couple split a day before the divorce filing, and soon after the death on 20 May of Depp\u2019s mother, Betty Sue Palmer, after a long illness. Depp and Heard recently made headlines for a dispute with Australian authorities, including the deputy prime minister and minister for agriculture, Barnaby Joyce, after Heard brought the pair\u2019s dogs into the country without first quarantining them, breaking the country\u2019s strict biosecurity laws. Heard admitted making a false customs declaration, in exchange for the charges against her of illegally importing animals \u2013 which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison \u2013 being dropped. As part of the case, Depp and Heard were forced to make an apology video. The filing was first reported by the website TMZ, who also first reported the pair\u2019s split.",
