Carwyn Jones, the leader of Welsh Labour, is confident that he will remain first minister but he may need support from the nationalists, Plaid Cymru, or the Lib Dems. That does not mean, necessarily, that a coalition will be formed but deals may have to be made to get Labour\u2019s budget and programme passed.  Jones said: \u201cWe are confident we will be by far the largest party so it will be up to us to look to form a government.\u201d He ruled out a deal with Ukip or the Tories who \u201care far too much to the right of where we stand\u201d but added: \u201cWe have worked with Plaid and the Lib Dems before ... but let\u2019s wait and see what the final figures show.\u201d Jones was frustrated that the anti-Semitism row impinged on the final days of campaigning and has sought to keep the problems of the national party at a distance, though he welcomed the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, to Wales earlier this week.  Forty Welsh Assembly members are being elected for constituencies and the other 20 via another vote to represent five larger regions. Labour has governed since the first assembly in 1999 and went into the election holding 30 of the assembly\u2019s 60 seats. An ITV poll of people who had voted predicted that Labour would end up with 27 seats this time, Plaid Cymru, 12, the Tories 11, the Lib Dems two and Ukip eight.  Ukip national leader Nigel Farage said Ukip would have a \u201cbreakthrough night\u201d and joked that the money spent on the Severn Bridge tolls had paid off. \u201cI\u2019ve been going back and forth to Wales paying those ridiculous tolls, looks like it\u2019ll be worth it,\u201d he said. Ukip used to call for the abolition of the assembly but it appears to have become the party of protest. Former Tory MPs Neil Hamilton and Mark Reckless are standing. Reckless called it an \u201cextraordinary breakthrough.\u201d  The Labour MP for Aberavon, Stephen Kinnock, believes Ukip would unravel in front of the public if it won seats in the Senedd.  Kinnock, son of former Labour leader Neil Kinnock, said: \u201cThey would come under the microscope and people would see them for what they really are: a rag-tag bunch with dubious histories.\u201d  Carwyn Jones signalled last week in an interview with the Guardian that he was prepared to think about working with others. \u201cFrom my perspective we couldn\u2019t work with the Tories or Ukip, they are too far to the right of us,\u201d he said.  But he added: \u201cWhen it comes to Plaid and the Lib Dems, of course we can work with them. We\u2019ve done it in the past. We will look at the situation after Thursday. Our objective is to be in a position where we can govern alone. But if we need to discuss issues with other parties, of course we will.\u201d  The campaign has been overshadowed by events \u2013 including the steel crisis centred on Port Talbot, the Panama Papers, and the anti-semitism row.",
