  "body": "I\u2019d seen smatterings of publicity for this over last summer, but I only managed to get round to reading it for the CILIP Carnegie Medal shadowing. From the irritating blurb and tag line, I wasn\u2019t expecting it to be great. Bu grudgingly I do admit that this book was better than I had initially anticipated. I suppose it did well to crack through the negative first impression it gave me.The element that lifted the premise for me was the art. It differentiated Fire Colour One from what could have been your typical sad-yet-uplifting-story of grief, and I loved it. I\u2019ll keep no secrets when I say I love books about the world of art (especially its underworld).  Iris\u2019 fires were the other element that I enjoyed. I particularly didn\u2019t like her, per se. She was trying very hard to be \u2018not like other girls\u2019 and hanging out with boys and dangerous. But such people in real life are irritating, and I thought she was a very well-crafted character. I\u2019ve never seen anything like her addiction to fires. I loved it.         Things go downhill when we reach the rest of the cast. Firstly, I was confused as to the lack of any other characters than the core people. It gave the whole book a surreal sense. I felt everyone other than Iris was reduced and simplified to archetypes: the father with whom she has an immediate connection, the greedy step-parents, the quirky best friend. Oh, Thurston. It seemed as though his only purpose was to provide meaning and danger to Iris\u2019 story. He seemed very Manic Pixie Dream Boy to me. Perhaps it was Iris\u2019 first person viewpoint \u2013 I can\u2019t be sure \u2013 but I didn\u2019t care about any of the characters and I think that was why I could never quite lose myself enough to enjoy this. \u00a0The writing style also frustrated me. This might not be so for everyone, but for me the incredibly purple prose was stretched too thin. Everything is like something else or even is something else. Although, there were certainly some excellent lines in there, mostly I was just rolling my eyes at the out-of-character narration for such a blunt and cynical character as Iris. \u00a0The ending certainly surprised me, and although it was perhaps a bit gimmicky it did lift the book in my opinion. Overall, though, I couldn\u2019t connect to this book and I spent most of my reading time complaining. I\u2019d recommend it for fans of more slow-moving, lyrical contemporary books, but it wasn\u2019t for me.   Related: How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?
