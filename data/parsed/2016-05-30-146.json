  "body": "Daylen Head\u2019s older sister found a sawn-off shotgun in a bedroom closet. While mimicking a video game, prosecutors say, she shot her nine-year-old brother dead. Frankie Navarrette, 11, discovered his father\u2019s loaded shotgun and shot himself in the buttocks. He survived.  Mariah Davis, five, discovered a handgun under a pillow in her grandparents\u2019 room. She died. According to the Wayne County prosecutor\u2019s office, these children were among eight to kill or seriously injure themselves with firearms in the county, in the last 17 months alone. \u201cI hope this is going to be a wake up call,\u201d said county prosecutor Kym Worthy, announcing charges in two such cases and calling for a broader public awareness of gun safety.  Worthy also urged pediatricians to discuss gun safety with parents.  \u201cI\u2019d like pediatricians to be able to take much more action,\u201d she said, \u201cand notify, even just for a few minutes, whether it\u2019s passing out a pamphlet or whatever \u2026 parents on the dangers of guns being at home.\u201d In the case of Mariah, Worthy\u2019s office filed involuntary manslaughter charges against the girl\u2019s grandparents, Frederick Davis and Patricia McNeal.  In the case of an unnamed four-year-old boy who shot himself in the hand last November, second-degree child abuse charges were filed against his mother and great-grandfather. Filing charges in child-involved shootings, experts and the prosecutor said, is difficult, as families are already grieving a loved one. But, they added, such shootings are \u201centirely\u201d preventable. On Thursday, family and friends packed a courtroom in downtown Detroit for the arraignment of Davis, 65, and McNeal, 64, just two weeks after Mariah was killed. Prosecutors said the couple were babysitting Mariah on 11 May when, just after midnight, she went into her grandparents\u2019 bedroom, found the handgun under a pillow, took it into another room and shot herself in the neck.  The couple\u2019s attorney asked 36th district court magistrate judge Bari Blake Wood to reduce their bond, saying McNeal had no criminal history and suffered memory problems arising from a brain tumor, having recently spent two months in a coma.     The victims in these cases \u2013 those who did not have the good luck to survive \u2013 won\u2019t reach their fifth grade  Kym Worthy     \u201cTo hold a sickly woman in jail for a crime she didn\u2019t really do \u2026 judge, it\u2019ll be a devastating effect that\u2019ll effect this woman for the rest of her life,\u201d said Randall Upshaw. As family members wept, the judge said: \u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy, what has occurred.\u201d  Nonetheless, she said, the circumstances of case merited a significant bond for each defendant. McNeal was released on a $50,000 bond she will not have to pay unless she does not return to court. The bond for Davis, who was absconding from parole on a drug-related charge when the shooting occurred, remained at $100,000. \u201cWe also have to remember a child is dead,\u201d Wood said. Also on Thursday Joseph Williams, 80, and Andrea Drewery, 30, were arraigned in connection with the non-fatal shooting of Drewery\u2019s four-year-old son, who has not been named. Prosecutors said both Drewery and Williams knew the handgun in the case was unsecured and easily accessible to the four-year-old. The suspects in both cases are due back in court for probable cause hearings on 3 June.  Worthy, herself the mother of two seven-year-olds, said the cases were \u201cvery troubling\u201d, adding: \u201cSome people may say \u2026 \u2018Why are we charging someone who is 80 years old? Why are we charging grandparents who are 65 years old? \u201cWell, first of all, the victims in these cases \u2013 those who did not have the good luck, for the lack of the better word, to survive \u2013 won\u2019t reach their fifth grade. They won\u2019t reach their 10th birthday, let alone their 80th birthday. We have to be responsible.\u201d  \u2018There are adults involved who are culpable\u2019   Related: Smart guns: how Obama hopes to create a market for personalized weapons    Chelsea Parsons, vice-president of guns and crime policy at the Washington-based liberal think tank Center for American Progress, said she understood the \u201cinstinct to say, \u2018Well, that person is being punished enough.\u2019 \u201cBut, at the same time,\u201d she said \u201c\u2026 these are entirely preventable deaths and there are adults involved who are culpable for these deaths. And that\u2019s exactly the kind of case where the criminal justice system should kick in.\u201d According to Everytown For Gun Safety, a nonprofit funded by former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, in 2016 at least 96 children across the US have been involved in unintentional shootings.  Though Worthy said her office has been able to craft charges using existing laws, she called on Michigan lawmakers to pass legislation that includes \u201ccriminal penalties for people who negligently secure their guns\u201d.  Michigan is one of 23 states that does not have a so-called Child Access Prevention [CAP] law on the books.  \u201cThat\u2019s not an original idea,\u201d Worthy said, \u201cbut it\u2019s certainly an idea I think we should look at, the Michigan legislature should look at.\u201d Worthy also said gun owners should be required to take mandatory classes, and said the US should \u201ctake a serious look\u201d at \u201csmart gun\u201d technology that gun manufacturers have so far rebuffed.  Experts said the most significant message in Worthy\u2019s remarks on Wednesday was her push for pediatricians to discuss gun safety with parents. \u201cPediatricians have been promoting this for a very long time: decades, 25 years at least,\u201d said Dr Garen Wintemute, director of the Violence Prevention Research Program at the University of California-Davis\u2019 School of Medicine.  \u201cSo the [prosecutor] is not breaking new ground in suggesting doctors do this. She may very well be breaking new ground in being a district attorney who is suggesting that.\u201d  In Florida, the issue of doctors discussing gun safety with patients has become a flashpoint. In 2011, the state passed a law that said physicians \u201cshould refrain\u201d from asking about firearms. The constitutionality of the law was challenged, and the 11th circuit court of appeals is expected to hear the case next month. As a result, Wintemute said, physicians in the state been unsure of the legality of discussing firearms with patients. In a paper released this month in Annals of Medicine, he and several colleagues said it was not illegal to do so.  \u201cParents bring their kids into a regular pediatrician \u2026 and all of those provide opportunities for physicians to raise the issue,\u201d said Wintemute, a practicing emergency room doctor, adding that to do so is one of several ways to prevent unintentional shootings. \u201cIdeally, what you want is not to punish somebody after a shooting has occurred, but prevent the shooting in the first place. Which is why what [Worthy] is proposing to do is really smart, particularly when there\u2019s been a cluster of cases in the community.  \u201cThat\u2019s a great motivator and I think, probably, her desired outcome is for pediatricians and family doctors who see kids \u2026 to make this, as often as possible, part of what they talk about with patients.\u201d    I would hope that we would all agree that there should be gun safety, especially when it comes to children  Kym Worthy     Parsons, of the Center for American Progress, said Worthy\u2019s announcement was \u201csignificant\u201d because it dealt with \u201centirely preventable deaths that are the result of negligence on the behalf of gun owners\u201d. The question of whether physicians can discuss gun safety with patients, she said, is not a \u201clegislative issue\u201d. \u201cThis is not a question of, \u2018Do we need more laws?\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about safe storage of firearms and using the opportunity of an annual checkup for your kids as a place to have a conversation about guns in the home, that is certainly something that physicians can do and is well within the scope of those kinds of conversations.\u201d  In Detroit, Worthy was asked about potential political pushback from gun-rights advocates. \u201cI would hope that we would all agree that there should be gun safety, especially when it comes to children,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s going to disagree with that.  \u201cWe may disagree with how we get there, we may disagree with what we do about it, but I\u2019m hoping we can all start from that same place.\u201d",
