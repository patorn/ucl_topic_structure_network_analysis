  "body": "PICK OF THE WEEK  Alicia Keys  In Common             Alicia Keys\u2019s first song in four years sees her ditch her standard formula of \u201csit at a piano and belt out mid-tempo ballads\u201d and try something new. And In Common is incredible \u2013 a bit Latin-influenced, a bit Afrobeat, a bit housey and surprisingly restrained for Alicia \u2013 possibly because it\u2019s produced by the Weeknd\u2019s mate Illangelo. With lyrics like \u201cIf you could love somebody like me/ You must be messed up too\u201d, it\u2019s either a raw, honest exploration of insecurity in relationships, or a song about those pissed-up 1am toilet chats you have with total strangers. We\u2019ll take the latter.  Plaitum  Jagwa             Twenty-year-olds, eh? Explaining how to work the complicated coffee machine at work, knowing what a bae is (it\u2019s a sex thing, right? All these new words are sex things), asking questions like, \u201cThe Rachel is a haircut? Why\u2019s it called that?\u201d and now, making great music like Plaitum, AKA Abi Dersiley and Matt Canham. Jagwa sounds a bit like Chvrches, and is probably great to listen to when you\u2019re doing 20-year-old things like M-Cat at a squat rave. Or, if you\u2019re over 20, on the drive to B&Q.   Pink  Just Like Fire            Oh, Pink. After years in the pop game kicking out against sexism, objectification and slamming your estranged husband through your music, you deserve to sit back, chuck out a song so bland that, several listens later, it\u2019s still unclear what it\u2019s actually about, and collect that Alice Through The Looking Glass soundtrack cash. That\u2019s fine, you\u2019ve put in the hours. Have this one on us. You\u2019ve earned it.   Westerman  Harvard            There are two types of British people today: those who can use the word \u201cvibes\u201d and not sound like a bell, and those that can\u2019t. Most of the first category are the nice men who work in your local climbing centre, and they\u2019d love Westerman\u2019s vibes: chill, cool, Jos\u00e9 Gonz\u00e1lez-inspired. But if you\u2019re the kind of person who\u2019ll punch anyone who pulls out an acoustic guitar at a house party, it\u2019s probably best to give these vibes a swerve. They are too chill for you.   Reggie \u2019N\u2019 Bollie  New Girl            Reggie \u2019N\u2019 Bollie, you remember them! The two enthusiastic blokes on last year\u2019s X Factor, whose main selling points were \u201clooking like they were pleased to be there\u201d and chanting \u201cazonto, azonto, azonto\u201d over every single song they performed (in talent show terms: \u201cmaking the song your own\u201d). Debut single New Girl is a nuanced acoustic cover of Eric Clapton\u2019s Tears In Heaven with beautiful vocals \u2026 No, joking, obviously. It\u2019s just a load of steel drums with 2016\u2019s obligatory Netflix-and-chill reference shouted over the top.",
