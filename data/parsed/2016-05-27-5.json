  "body": "Roy Hodgson acknowledged that Marcus Rashford had done his hopes of being a member of England\u2019s squad for the European Championship in France a power of good after the 18-year-old Manchester United striker scored on his international debut on Friday night. \u201cI am pleased with him,\u201d said England\u2019s coach, who saw Rashford\u2019s third-minute volley set England on the way to a 2-1 win against Australia in Sunderland. \u201cHe\u2019s done his chances of coming in the final 23 no harm. But he wouldn\u2019t have been in the 26 if I didn\u2019t think he had a chance. I guess it [the debut goal] will chop a few trees down tomorrow. I thought Marcus did well \u2013 but I wasn\u2019t nervous about him or surprised how well he played.\u201d Hodgson was enthused not only with Rashford\u2019s ability to switch to a wide role after Wayne Rooney came on in the second half but his evident chemistry with Manchester City\u2019s Raheem Sterling. \u201cThere was good link-up play between him and Raheem,\u201d he said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have an awful lot of experience playing in that system but they were both very lively. \u201cWe saw the best of them together and we knew that, with those two together, we would be very dangerous on the counter because of their pace. When Wayne came on, Marcus played on the flank and showed what he could do there. He tired late \u2013 but that\u2019s understandable.\u201d England\u2019s coach admitted he had some vexing decisions to make as he whittles his squad down to 23 before Tuesday\u2019s midnight deadline. \u201cThere\u2019ll be two or three more sleepless nights before I submit my list,\u201d he said. Although Daniel Sturridge \u2013 who was not involved due to a calf strain \u2013 later told reporters he was fit to return to training, the Liverpool forward is likely to endure some anxious moments before Tuesday. The good news for Sturridge is that, despite Rashford\u2019s emergence, Hodgson seems minded possibly to take both forwards. \u201cDaniel\u2019s a quality player,\u201d the coach said. \u201cI know Daniel Sturridge. If it turns out the injury would mean he was unfit to play Russia in Marseille [in England\u2019s first match of Euro 2016], that might make a difference \u2013 but I have no indication it is serious enough to keep him out.\u201d There were times when Australia dominated the game and Hodgson conceded it had been a \u201cstern test\u201d against the Asian Champions. \u201cIt was a tough game, Australia are good, they\u2019re European standard,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I was pleased with aspects of our play. We were dangerous on the break and I was pleased so many players who didn\u2019t start against Turkey (in the previous friendly) showed what they could do.\u201d",
