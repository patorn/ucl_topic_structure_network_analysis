  "body": "To the Torquay hotel that is Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z\u2019s marriage, with news that Jay might be planning an album response to his wife\u2019s Lemonade. In truth, Lost in Showbiz hadn\u2019t foreseen the couple\u2019s emergence as the Sybil and Basil Fawlty of pop, but it is now staring us so hard in the face that to deny the overwhelming parallels would be nothing short of absurd. So many of the best sitcom characters are trapped, of course, and although the Carters\u2019 situation appears marginally more lucrative than offering full board on the English Riviera, there is at least potential financial parity in the summer months, when you factor in moneyspinning ideas such as gourmet night. I know Sybil never produced a stunning visual album \u2013 in many ways her telephone manner was her art \u2013 but, other than that, the marriages are entirely analogous. Ever since said visual album dropped less than two weeks ago, many have been wondering feverishly what Jay thought of Lemonade. So, allow me to clear that up for you without delay. He watched a playback of it with exaggerated politeness before inquiring nonchalantly: \u201cDo I detect the smell of burning martyr?\u201d With his eye on an artistic retort, Jay Z has spent the days since torn between his perennial fear of incurring his wife\u2019s wrath again, and amusing himself trying to think of rhymes for \u201cmy little piranha fish\u201d. Jay didn\u2019t accompany the missus to Sunday\u2019s Met Gala, although I\u2019m sure that, once she\u2019d finished upholstering herself, he checked his wife had everything with her \u2013 \u201chandbag, knuckledusters, flick knife?\u201d\u2013 and wished Beyonc\u00e9 a good evening at the event. \u201cDon\u2019t drive over any mines or anything!\u201d As for Beyonce, her long-suffering feels easily as long and insufferable as Sybil\u2019s. Though it must be said she\u2019s the clear winner on the good hair front, Basil having once dismissed Sybil\u2019s as \u201cthat rat\u2019s maze of yours.\u201d Even so, none of the above is intended to paint either marriage as one-dimensional. The Fawltys\u2019 situation wouldn\u2019t be so mesmerising if there weren\u2019t some residual something there, however deep down. I still find The Anniversary episode the hardest watch, because Basil really does try. No, despite what the cynics say, neither the Fawltys\u2019 nor the Knowles-Zs\u2019 marriages can be entirely performative, although it must be said that both seem creatively assisted by the presence of an audience. \u201cYou must excuse my wife,\u201d Basil confides stagily to a guest, \u201cI\u2019m afraid her local finishing school got bombed.\u201d We could continue, but let\u2019s play out with the observation that neither of our unions is a stranger to vehicular damage. One of the most eye-catching sequences in Lemonade involves Beyonc\u00e9 stalking down a street smashing in car windows with a baseball bat, and it\u2019s certainly one that will demand a formal visual retort from Jay Z. It\u2019s not for me to try to influence his process, but I very much hope that we\u2019ll see him taking a branch to an Austin 1100 Countryman.",
