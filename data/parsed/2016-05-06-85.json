Share your thoughts about these city stories \u2013 and any others you\u2019ve seen \u2013 in the comments below. The Skyline cable car Urban cable cars can be found in La Paz, Barcelona, Ankara, London and Cape Town, among other places \u2013 and have become not just popular tourist attractions but transport solutions (with varying success). Two years ago, a proposal was unveiled for the \u201cEast River Skyway\u201d cable car network in New York, and now Chicago wants in on the game.  According to ArchDaily, London Eye designers Marks Barfield Architects and Davis Brody Bond have announced plans for the \u201cSkyline\u201d, an aerial cable car attraction spanning Chicago city centre, including along the recently revitalised Riverwalk. \u201cThe Chicago Skyline could do for Chicago what the London Eye has done for London, and become a very identifiable landmark within the city, driving tourism and prosperity,\u201d says David Marks, director at Marks Barfield Architects. As well as being a tourist attraction, it is hoped the Skyline will be a practical solution to link Navy Pier to the public transport network within the Chicago Loop. Chicago once in fact had a cable car system, which operated from 1882 to 1906 \u2013 though these were ground-level, tram-like cable cars as opposed to the suspended aerial pods that are now planned. The Skyline project is still seeking permission. Chernobyl\u2019s mural   Related: Chernobyl 30 years on: former residents remember life in the ghost city of Pripyat    The Russian photojournalist Igor Kostin took some of the first images of the ruined Chernobyl nuclear plant 30 years ago, and returned to the site periodically to document the impacts of the disaster. He died in an accident in 2006 but this month, to mark a decade since his death and three since the disaster, an Australian artist has painted a poignant black-and-white mural referencing Kostin\u2019s work within Chernobyl\u2019s huge, abandoned Reactor 5. As CityLab explains, artist Guido van Helten travelled to the site with filmmaker Geo Leros at the behest of international antiwar group ArtUnitedUs. Crosswalks for all  A few years ago, Berlin politicans tried to bring gender equality to the city\u2019s pedestrian crossing lights by introducing \u201cAmpelfrau\u201d, or \u201ctraffic light woman\u201d, a female version of the iconic \u201cAmpelmann\u201d invented in East Germany in the 1960s. As Jackie Strawbridge in Next City explains, Social Democrat district leader Martina Matischok-Yesilcimen specified that the figure should represent a modern-day woman without any \u201csexist stereotypes\u201d such as ponytails, high heels or skirts.  But this design apparently turned out to be too difficult to achieve. Although other European cities, like Dortmund, Amersfoort and Valencia, implemented the \u201ctraffic light woman\u201d, she was rejected in Berlin because the pigtails and dress in the design were seen as \u201coutdated and cliched\u201d. There has been a mixed reception even in places where the lights have been installed, with some in Valencia calling the lights sexist. For Lisa Wade, a sociology professor at Occidental College and founder of the sociology site Sociological Images, creating these female crosswalk icons \u2013 even with outdated markers of femininity \u2013 is highly valuable because it challenges the male-centeredness of our public spaces. Crosswalks certainly seem to be one part of city infrastructure where this desire for inclusive design is playing out. As Jackie Strawbridge writes:  Before hosting the Eurovision Song Contest last year, Vienna introduced gay- and lesbian-themed crosswalk signals to demonstrate open-mindedness. Wellington, New Zealand, has commemorated suffragette Kate Sheppard and transgender icon Carmen Rupe on crossing lights, in part to promote the city as \u201ctruly progressive\u201d on the 150th anniversary of it becoming the capital, the mayor\u2019s office says.  The HIV capital of small-town America In December 2014, the single largest HIV outbreak in US history took place in Austin, Indiana \u2013 a town plagued by widespread drug use. Writing in Mosaic Science, in a piece accompanied by haunting photographs from Lauren Lancaster, Jessica Wapner traces the town\u2019s decline, meets its residents and explores whether a new approach to public health can rescue the town. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of the epitome of years of neglect, poverty, lack of education and lack of opportunity, or people\u2019s perception of lack of opportunity,\u201d Jerome Adams, Indiana\u2019s state health commissioner, says of Austin. Residents speak of growing up in a place where drugs are sold on every corner and parents deal narcotics in front of their young children.    Related: Anti-homeless spikes are just the latest in 'defensive urban architecture'    After the 2014 HIV outbreak, however, a new health strategy known as \u201csyndemics\u201d has been proposed as an answer to the town\u2019s problems, which tackles physical illnesses as connected to wider social, economic and political factors known to accompany poor health such as poverty and drug abuse. By addressing the full context of problems, it is hoped that the syndemics approach can improve health among the town\u2019s population.  Hostile cities Writing in Atlas Obscura, Ella Morton takes an in-depth look at \u201chostile\u201d or \u201cdefensive\u201d architecture \u2013 those design features in cities, from \u201canti-homeless spikes\u201d to barbed wire \u2013 that seek to limit public access or curb unwanted behaviour. Even potted plants and timed sprinklers, Morton says, can be designed to disperse homeless people from public space. Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and join the discussion",
