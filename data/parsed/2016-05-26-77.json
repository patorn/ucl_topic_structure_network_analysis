  "body": "If the absence of Rory McIlroy, Justin Rose and other golfing luminaries from the BMW PGA Championship intensifies focus on Danny Willett, the good news is the apparent willingness of the Masters champion to embrace the limelight. It would have been daft to presume any alternative scenario. On this, his first appearance on English soil since an historic triumph at Augusta National, Willett stepped from the 18th green of Wentworth\u2019s west course at six under par. Day one\u2019s deepest galleries from a total attendance of 20,000 flocked to see Willett and were not disappointed, the Yorkshireman sitting just a stroke from the first-round lead held by YE Yang, Scott Hend and Joost Luiten. \u201cTo be home is brilliant, just as that reception was on the 1st tee,\u201d Willett acknowledged. \u201cLast week in Ireland was fantastic but I\u2019ve got a little bit more support out there, being a home boy in England. I had a great reception all the way around.

You\u2019ve got to appreciate that and enjoy it, and hopefully, touch wood, I\u2019ll give them some good golf to watch over the next few days.\u201d Willett produced back-to-back nines of 33 in the Surrey sunshine, without recording a single bogey. When speaking of a desire to kick on from Masters success rather than rest on laurels, the 28-year-old was not indulging in hollow sentiment. \u201cIt\u2019s always nice when you come off bogey-free,\u201d Willett said. \u201cIt means you\u2019ve played some real good golf and you\u2019ve not given any stupid shots away to the golf course. \u201cThe course is in great condition. The greens are in a little better than I think they were over the last couple of years and I think everyone would agree with that.\u201d That final sentiment is noteworthy. Wentworth and this event haven\u2019t been without their critics, after all.   Related: Danny Willett: who is the vicar\u2019s son who won the 2016 Masters?    Willett formed a part of Thursday\u2019s afternoon wave, with arguably the most striking score of the morning coming from Luke Donald. The 38-year-old, a former world No1 of 40 weeks, now sits 76th on the same ranking list but has offered hints at a return to prominence in recent times. Wentworth witnessed another one, as Donald signed for a 68. \u201cCertainly the last year or two have been tough, with tough times where I struggled,\u201d Donald said. \u201cI struggled to gain confidence and feel comfortable. It seems like over the last couple months, I\u2019m getting more and more comfortable, the better I play. It\u2019s nice to see some good results go with that. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to get off to a solid start. If you look at history, I tend to do well during a week if I can get off to a good start on Thursday. I think it just makes everything feel a little bit more settled and I feel in a good place. I was really happy with that round.\u201d On Friday afternoon at Wentworth, Darren Clarke will name his first three vice-captains for Europe\u2019s Ryder Cup defence at Hazeltine from 30 September. Padraig Harrington, Paul Lawrie and Thomas Bjorn are expected to be selected by Clarke, who will add another two assistants closer to the meeting with the United States. Bjorn and Lawrie are long-time and close friends of Clarke, with the choice of Harrington perhaps the most intriguing. The Irishman was a vice-captain under Paul McGinley at Gleneagles in 2014 and should, as a three-times major champion, head the team in his own right at some point in the future.",
