  "body": "Good morning. We\u2019re 38 days from poll day, but with this long to go, who\u2019s really counting?  If you\u2019re in Melbourne or Sydney and can\u2019t get enough of Guardian Australia\u2019s live political coverage, you can join our political editor Lenore Taylor and deputy political editor/ politics live blog guru Katharine Murphy in Sydney and Melbourne next month for a panel discussion about policies, candidates and key battlegrounds being fought during this never-ending election campaign. Details here \u2013 book early, book often.   Related: Australian election 2016: Barnaby Joyce causes a stir as John Howard vents fears \u2013 politics live    The big picture Oh yes he did. The deputy PM, Barnaby Joyce, has drawn a link between the Gillard government\u2019s live export ban and the increase of asylum seeker boats, effectively accusing the Indonesian government of allowing people smuggling, writes Guardian Australia\u2019s Gabrielle Chan. Joyce made the comments during a debate on regional issues last night with the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, and Labor\u2019s agriculture spokesman, Joel Fitzgibbon. He said the ban had created immense bad will. Chan writes:   In the regional leaders\u2019 debate in Goulburn, the deputy prime minister suggested Labor and the Greens were \u201ccrabwalking\u201d to another live cattle export ban and then suggested the previous ban led to the flow of asylum seekers to Australia. \u201cMight I remind you when we closed down the live animal export industry, it was around about the same time that we started seeing a lot of people arriving in boats in Australia,\u201d Joyce said. The ABC compere Chris Uhlmann replied: \u201cDo you realise you are suggesting the Indonesian government then unleashed the boats in response?\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s absolutely the case that we created extreme bad will with Indonesia when we closed down the live animal exports,\u201d Joyce said. Uhlmann again asked, \u201cAre you suggesting the Indonesian government is sending refugees here?\u201d \u201cI suggest the Greens and Labor party created immense bad will and it was affected,\u201d Joyce responded.  When asked on Thursday morning whether he stood by the suggestion, Joyce said he didn\u2019t claim the suspension caused Indonesia to send people to Australia. But rather it made it difficult to negotiate with the country on the issue.\u201cI\u2019m just stating the bleeding obvious,\u201d he told the Seven Network. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to basically, what they would determine, insult another country by overnight ceasing the supply of a major requirement of their dietary intake which is meat.\u201d Joyce\u2019s original comment was immediately dismissed by the Indonesian embassy in Canberra. \u201cThere is no link between the policy of live export ban and the increased numbers of boats into Australia,\u201d a spokesman said. Dams, and more damned \u2018jobs and growth\u2019\u00a0 Today, the Coalition will roll out a $2.5bn dams policy in Queensland which is says will strengthen the agricultural sector and drive regional \u201cjobs and growth\u201d. A re-elected Coalition will invest $150m to fast-track the feasibility assessment and construction of water infrastructure across the state. In a statement issued overnight, Turnbull said:  As the economy transitions and diversifies, agricultural exports are playing a more important role than ever before. The Coalition is taking action by carrying out the most significant investment in infrastructure in Australian history, including an ambitious water reform agenda, so we can continue to build a strong national economy and create more jobs.\u201d  Dutton tells New York Times reporter to mind his own business\u00a0 To the immigration minister,\u00a0Peter Dutton, now. A couple of days ago, international affairs and diplomacy reporter Roger Cohen\u00a0wrote a piece\u00a0for the New York Times titled: Australia\u2019s Offshore Cruelty. Australia\u2019s asylum seeker policy dehumanised people and left them languishing, he wrote.  Australia\u2019s \u201coffshore processing\u201d is falling apart and must end. The supreme court of Papua New Guinea ruled in April that the Australian-funded detention centre on Manus Island was illegal.\u00a0  Last night, Dutton responded to the piece. Cohen should \u201cstick to US immigration matters\u201d he\u00a0told the Australian, adding that Cohen \u201cdoesn\u2019t have a clue about the success we have had in Australia of actually securing our borders\u201d.  People like this who tolerate a policy which results in children drowning at sea should hang their heads in shame. Even the Labor party has had the decency to say their border policies were a complete failure.  The campaign you should be watching   Related: Guardian Live election special event with Lenore Taylor and Katharine Murphy    We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on the Labor safe seat of Whitlam in NSW, after Liberal candidate\u00a0Carolyn Currie, resigned\u00a0yesterday. She told ABC Illawarra she had decided to withdraw because she was \u201clike a general with no troops\u201d.  It is very difficult for me to mount any sort of reasonable campaign with no troops, as any general would know. This is a remarkable area; it needs quite a unique person to represent the disparate groups. It needs a very, very strong person who can unite a number of people to preserve it \u2013 possibly an independent, possibly a Green. But somebody with a lot of leverage, in what looks like being a very divided government on a knife edge,\u00a0to be able to instrumentalise the best outcomes for this area.   I cannot offer that and meanwhile I don\u2019t believe that I need to be a sacrificial lamb, travelling a number of steep inclines that have yet to be fixed.  Currie said she was told by Liberal party members they did not want a candidate in the seat. And another thing(s) The former prime minister\u00a0John Howard\u00a0has told Sky News that he fears for the Australian middle-class, saying: \u201cThe great Australian middle class, which has held this country together for generations, will over time be eroded.\u201d  One of the reasons for the Trump phenomenon in the United States is because the middle class is becoming markedly poorer. I think he\u2019s too unstable to hold that high office. I\u2019m disappointed that the Republicans, who I feel an affinity for, haven\u2019t been able to find somebody different.  He said that he \u201cnever lost the thirst for a political contest\u201d.  But others are now in charge. I\u2019m just a supporting act, nothing more.\u201d  He spent yesterday in western Sydney helping with Liberal MP for Lindsay\u00a0Fiona Scott\u2019s\u00a0campaign. And the agriculture minister, Barnaby Joyce, has warned the big supermarkets that unless they axe their $1-a-litre home-brand milk, a re-elected Coalition government will force a price rise, the Australian reports.  Mr Joyce stopped short of backing a compulsory 50c levy on fresh milk called for by dairy farmer groups, but said he would not put up with the two dominant retailers causing a \u201crolling crisis\u201d. Mr Joyce\u2019s price threat came as hundreds of dairy farmers rallied in cities, demanding a fairer milk price and an end to their exploitation by big dairy companies and Coles and Woolworths.  I\u2019ll wrap this up with a\u00a0comment piece\u00a0from Fairfax, which asks: \u201cWhat if\u00a0Malcolm Turnbull\u00a0trips and\u00a0Bill Shorten\u00a0vaults to victory?\u201d  For commentators it would mean throwing a lot of conventional wisdom about the impossible task of first-term opposition leaders out the window. It would also mean a much quicker return to government than most Labor MPs, after being tossed out of office in September 2013, ever thought would happen. Until recently they didn\u2019t really think they had a chance to win. Some of the senior members of the shadow ministry probably thought it was unlikely they would ever become ministers again. Their careers in government were probably over. Labor was looking to the next generation. For the Liberals, it goes without saying that a Turnbull defeat would be an absolute disaster for the party. That is always the case when a first-term government loses as happened with the Coalition state governments in Victoria (2014) and Queensland (2015). Particularly in Queensland, the state of bewilderment was overwhelming.
