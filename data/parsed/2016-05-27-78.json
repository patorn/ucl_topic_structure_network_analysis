  "body": "Hometown: Los Angeles. The lineup: Tucker Tota and Patrick Hart.  The background: There was a year in the 1990s when indie band The Wedding Present released a single every month, a business model/gimmick adopted most recently by indie duo Oh Wonder. But 10K Islands, who describe themselves as an LA/Miami label-cum-writing house, with shades of a latter-day Brill Building, make them seem meagre and unambitious by comparison. Their scheme for 2016? A new release from the collective\u2019s artists every Friday. We\u2019re not sure when the project started \u2013 let\u2019s assume they began the year with a bang, or pop, on 1 January \u2013 but if they are as good as this week\u2019s Extraordinary by Bad Wave, then we\u2019ll to want to catch up on the previous releases.  Bad Wave, which comes from a Chilean phrase meaning \u201cbad vibes\u201d, are a duo who surf the interface between bubbly indiepop and sumptuously sad synthpop. They offer something for fans of both Foster the People and New Order and display the cleverness and craftsmanship of Phoenix. The pair used to be in LA surf-rock outfit Nicky Blitz and share a love of Weezer and other 90s nerd-pop bands. The gadget fiends, who describe their relationship as \u201ca tech-inspired bromance\u201d, are prone to mooning over analog synths and their favourite plug-ins. Despite being neighbours in the same apartment block, they are rarely together when they write and apparently collaborate via email: they were in their own bedrooms when they knocked out these wan, wonderful songs.      The set-up seems to be working, if the five tracks I\u2019ve heard are anything to go by. Their first release, Look Out, on Crazy Heart Records, was DIY synthpop with a melody so simple it could have been written using the Human League\u2019s tried and tested method: placing Post-It notes on the keyboard to remind you which keys to press. Good Girls proved it was no fluke, with its lovely descending verse-melody and upwards-ascending chorus and a virtuoso synth/guitar solo with echoes of Jeff Beck. She featured a bassy synth pattern, what sounded suspiciously like Synare drums borrowed from Anita (Ring My Bell) Ward, and a supremely catchy disco-pop chorus. Runaway, their single from earlier this year, kept up Bad Wave\u2019s immaculate run, with its ELO harmonies, Pat Benatar bassline and tunefulness worthy of Flaming Lips, only without Wayne Coyne\u2019s whine.  Funnily, or scarily, enough, Tucker Tota and Patrick Hart don\u2019t just sound like the fictional creations of Bret Easton Ellis. For Extraordinary, they ask the listener \u201cto imagine a scene in a parking lot where a serial killer makes off with his victim\u201d. You wouldn\u2019t know what it was about from its radiant upbeat melody, although the bit where they sing \u201clock you in\u201d and \u201cstretch you apart\u201d offer sinister clues. The song features bright electronics and an arena-ambitious chorus, hooks and heavenly chord changes, but the point of it all is to side with the oppressed. \u201cExtraordinary is a song about extreme empathy,\u201d Tota told Billboard. \u201cSpecifically empathy with the darkest forms of human experience. We like to leave some room to let the imagination run wild.\u201d  The buzz: \u201cA bit like ELO chained under a disco ball.\u201d The truth: They feel so Extraordinary.  Most likely to: Use Post-It notes.  Least likely to: Go postal.  What to buy: Extraordinary is out now on 10K Islands. File next to: Phoenix, MGMT, New Order, Foster the People.
