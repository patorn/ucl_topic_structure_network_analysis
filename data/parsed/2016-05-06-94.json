  "body": "After months of claiming that Donald Trump doesn\u2019t have a hope in hell of winning the Republican nomination (facepalm), several sources are now predicting that his hopes of winning the national election are slim. Is this more of the same short-sightedness or is the electoral math really stacked against the New York businessman?  Based on the results of the past six US presidential elections, it\u2019s true that Trump has an uphill climb to get to the White House. But those results should be treated with caution \u2013 not least because an assumption that the past can help to accurately predict the future is one reason why Trump\u2019s success has been continually underestimated (and speaking of historical precedents, if Hillary Clinton does secure the Democratic nomination \u2013 which now looks very likely \u2013 it will be the first time a woman has done so, which might also complicate predictions of voter behavior). It\u2019s a simple fact of political reality that some states are less competitive battlegrounds than others. In 31 states, the same political party has won the last six presidential elections. Since 18 of those stronghold states are places that Democrats have consistently had victories (19 if you include Washington DC), Trump\u2019s party has a tougher starting point. To make matters worse for Trump, those \u201csafe\u201d Democratic states together wield much more power \u2013 having a combined total of 242 electoral votes. By contrast, the 13 states that have always voted Republican over the past two decades only have 102 electoral votes. Remember, 270 electoral votes is enough to win the White House. It\u2019s unlikely that either party will spend large amounts of time or resources in states they consider safe. But understanding the battleground in this election requires a little more nuance: of the states that have recently flipped between parties, some will be more competitive than others.   Battleground states   Take Kentucky, for example. Even though the state was won over from the Democrats in 2000, since then, the Republicans have easily won every election by a margin of over 15 percentage points. So, although Kentucky is historically a swing state it probably won\u2019t be part of the 2016 battleground. It\u2019s an entirely different story in states like Ohio and Florida. Not only has party control changed hands multiple times in those states over the past 20 years, but often victories have been hard fought. In 2004, the Republicans won Ohio by just 2 percentage points. The following election, the Democrats won the state back but by a margin of only 5 percentage points.

After all, it was as recently as 2011 that Donald Trump announced that he was switching his affiliation from the Republican to the Independent Party and Hillary Clinton was saying \u201cno, no\u201d when asked if she would run in the 2016 election. Back then, 43% of Americans said they had a favorable opinion of Donald Trump while 66% said the same of Hillary Clinton (an all-time high for the former secretary of state). Polling today shows that neither candidate is popular. The question, though, is which candidate will be the least unpopular in November 2016, and crucially whether they can be so in the battleground states.   Unpopularity   Nationally, Clinton has held an edge on Trump when Americans have been asked the (decreasingly) hypothetical question of who they would vote for in a match-up between the two candidates. However, Clinton\u2019s lead has shrunk from 11 percentage points in late March to just 6.5 percentage points this week.   Trump vs Clinton nationally   Few polls have been conducted that look underneath these national averages. That\u2019s partly because state-level polling is very expensive but it\u2019s also because regional analysis six months before a national election is not very accurate. Unsurprisingly, where polling companies have recently invested their time and resources \u2013 Arizona, Florida, Indiana, North Carolina, Ohio and West Virginia \u2013 are parts of the country that also appear in the table above as \u201cplaces to watch\u201d. With the exception of West Virginia (where a poll from May last year suggested Trump would win by 27 percentage points) all of those historic battleground states look like they\u2019ll be closely fought this election too, with neither candidate leading by more than 10 percentage points. Trump and Clinton can now feel confident about securing their parties\u2019 nominations but they can\u2019t feel so sure about getting the support of these battleground states. The candidates will no doubt seek to understand the demographic makeup of places like Florida and Ohio, asking questions like \u201chave jobs been lost here?\u201d, \u201cwhat are Medicare enrollment rates?\u201d or \u201cis religion important?\u201d \u2013 and tailor their rhetoric in the next six months accordingly. Because without those voters, neither candidate has an easy path to the presidency.",
