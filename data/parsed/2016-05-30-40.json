The Duke of Edinburgh, a serving naval officer in the second world war, had planned to attend the ceremony but cancelled on medical advice. A palace spokesman said he had agreed reluctantly not to travel. However, his daughter, the Princess Royal, will be there to represent the royal family, and at a later ceremony at Lyness Royal Naval cemetery, where 14 German sailors are among the hundreds buried. The main national ceremony of remembrance, for almost 9,000 dead from the two fleets, will be at St Magnus Cathedral in Kirkwall. The Weeping Window, part of the scarlet poppies artwork originally seen by huge crowds at the Tower of London in 2014, has been installed at the cathedral to mark the centenary. The site of the first world war battle will be marked at Jutland Bank, where representatives of the British and German navies will throw wreaths of poppies and forget-me-nots into the North Sea.

On the day after, Germany\u2019s Kaiser Wilhelm II said: \u201cThe spell of Trafalgar has been broken.\u201d However, although the British lost more men and more ships, including in morale-sapping huge explosions that destroyed HMS Invincible and two other battlecruisers, when the German admiral Reinhard Scheer finally saw the full extent of the British fleet bearing down on him, he turned his ships around and sailed away. The German navy played no significant role in the rest of the war.   Related: The Battle of Jutland: the Chilcot shambles of its day    There will also be ceremonies at Rosyth naval dockyard in Scotland, where many of the British ships were built, and at the memorials at Chatham in Kent, and Portsmouth and Plymouth on the south coast, where the names of most of the dead are listed. The only surviving ship from the fleet, HMS Caroline, will open as a museum in Belfast docks, largely restored to her 1916 condition. The battle was fought on 31 May off the coast of Denmark. The encounter between the German High Seas Fleet and the far larger British Grand Fleet, the two largest navies in the world, began in late afternoon and continued with minimal visibility in heavy sea mist and darkness into the small hours of the following morning. At the height of the battle 250 ships were engaged.      The Weeping Window sculpture installed at St Magnus Cathedral.

Rear Admiral David Beatty famously remarked that \u201cthere seems to be something wrong with our bloody ships today\u201d after two battlecruisers exploded within half an hour. The shattered wreck of Invincible still lies where it sank, and Royal Navy divers plan to place a white ensign on what became a war grave, in memory of those who went down with their ship.   Related: Grave of the 'boy hero' of Battle of Jutland given new protected status to mark centenary     The future George VI, who was on board HMS Collingwood, wrote \u2013 in a letter going on display for the first time at the major centenary exhibition at the Museum of the Royal Navy in Portsmouth \u2013 that \u201cit seems to have resulted in victory for us\u201d. The museum curator, Nick Hewitt, said such confusion was common at the time: \u201cThe British won the battle but lost the propaganda war, they stuffed that up royally. All they had to do was put out a solid statement claiming the victory, but they failed completely to do that.\u201d The exhibition, 36 Hours: Jutland 1916, the Battle That Won the War, is the largest ever held on the encounter, bringing together national museum and private loans from Britain and Germany.     The silver box that was originally in Nelson\u2019s cabin. Photograph: National Museum of the Royal Navy    A unique silver box, believed to be the only surviving object that was at both the battles of Trafalgar and Jutland, has gone on display at the Portsmouth exhibition, on loan from Rear Admiral Beatty\u2019s family. The inscription on the box records that it was in Nelson\u2019s cabin on HMS Victory at Trafalgar in 1805, then passed through various hands until it was given to Beatty in 1914. He took it to sea with him, and it was in his cabin on HMS Lion throughout the battle of Jutland. \u2022 This article was amended on 31 May 2016 because HMS Caroline will be largely, not fully, restored to her 1916 condition. In addition, David Beatty\u2019s remark was made after two battlecruisers exploded within half an hour, not after two more battlecruisers exploded.",
