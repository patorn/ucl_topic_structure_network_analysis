  "body": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp vowed Liverpool would learn the lessons of a painful defeat in the Europa League final as he blamed their \u201cshocked\u201d second-half display, plus the referee, for a comprehensive loss to Sevilla. Liverpool held a deserved half-time lead in Basel thanks to Daniel Sturridge\u2019s exquisite finish only to collapse against a rejuvenated Sevilla side who scored three times in 25 second-half minutes. The captain, Coke, scored twice before lifting the team\u2019s third consecutive Europa League trophy but it was K\u00e9vin Gameiro\u2019s equaliser, 20 seconds after the restart, following poor defending by the Liverpool left-back and former Sevilla player Alberto Moreno, that Klopp identified as the turning point.

It was not compact any more. I\u2019ve had this problem one or two times with this situation. The first half was ok, we deserved the 1-0, Sevilla played a lot of long balls to avoid our pressing game. We were not as good as we can be but everyone told me there were two handballs in the first half. There were some obvious decisions which went against us. In a final when it is close you need a bit of luck even when we hadn\u2019t had any. \u201cWe are disappointed and frustrated 100% but tomorrow or later in the week we will see it a little bit more clearly and we will use this experience, that is what we have to do. It is clear we are not in a European tournament next year so we don\u2019t have football on Wednesday or Thursday, so we will have time to train and we will, for sure, come back stronger. \u201cWe had a few moments where we have performed but then to have this consistency you need a bit more time. They are still young, the players\u2019 first big final, but unfortunately it is the second time this season. We will use this experience together and then some day everyone will say Basel was a very decisive moment in the future of Liverpool.\u201d Liverpool had several chances to extend their lead before the break but were powerless to prevent Sevilla becoming the first team since Bayern Munich in the mid-1970s to win three consecutive Uefa titles. \u201cI tried to change it but you could see the team was shocked, maybe the crowd was shocked too,\u201d said Klopp. \u201cEverything changed in this moment as we had a wonderful atmosphere until we conceded to make it 1-1. Sevilla took the game and we defended not good. It is not good to concede a goal straight after half-time but you have 44 minutes to strike back. The reaction was the problem. We have to learn to react better in situations like this.\u201d   Related: Coke double shakes Liverpool as Sevilla hit back to win Europa League final    Liverpool had two penalty appeals for handball dismissed by the Swedish referee Jonas Eriksson in the first half. The official also correctly disallowed a Dejan Lovren header for offside against Daniel Sturridge, and allowed Coke\u2019s third to stand after spotting that, although offside, the Sevilla captain had received the ball via two Liverpool players. An assistant raised his flag before being overruled by the referee, and Klopp said: \u201cI have been around the block and this is not a situation I have seen many times for the ref to overrule the assistant. There are a number of people who will say it was perfectly accurate, but I have lost a couple of finals and never have I had a bad decision made in my favour. I would hope for that to change. \u201cThere were two decisions against us when there was handball and a goal which was disallowed and one allowed against us. All these situations don\u2019t lead to me saying we had a great match. The first thing you have to do when you look at the man in the mirror is criticise yourself.\u201d The Sevilla coach, Unai Emery, maintained his record of never having lost a Europa League tie and attempted to absolve Moreno of blame for his team\u2019s crucial equaliser. \u201cAlberto Moreno is playing a great season for Liverpool and, from what I have seen, he is playing at a level that he can go back to the Spanish national team,\u201d Emery said. \u201cI always see the glass half-full because Mariano has a great offensive ability and I see him as a great offensive player rather than it being poor defending.\u201d He added: \u201cWe have the Copa del Rey on Sunday against Barcelona and we have to prepare thoroughly for the challenge. We will celebrate this tonight but we will be careful.\u201d",
