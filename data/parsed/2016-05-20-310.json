The television drama, written by Jeremy Sandford and directed by Ken Loach, shocked viewers by discussing issues hidden from view - homelessness, poverty and, in the final scene, children being taken away from their parents by social services.  Homelessness and poor housing was a huge issue back in 1966, but arguably Cathy Come Home, a hard-hitting, social realist drama, forced the public to face the reality of what was happening in towns and cities across the country. Shelter was founded in the same year, the play prompted a parliamentary debate and many people decided Something Must Be Done \u2013 namely, the development of more social housing. Culture is a window into the past, both in terms of trends in public concerns, but also in depictions of social issues: the BBC series, The Wednesday Play, which ran from 1964 to 1970, highlighted concerns about homelessness, women\u2019s rights and access to abortion. At the time, Loach commented: \u201cWe were very anxious for our plays not to be considered dramas but as continuations of the news.\u201d Has much changed since Cathy and her fictional children were evicted by bailiffs before being separated by the state?  Hardly. Only last year, my colleague Amelia Gentleman wrote of Titina Nzolameso\u2019s case, a woman who, after being made homeless, had to fight to get her five children back. Determined to fight for her children\u2019s right to stay in their local area, near their friends, family and support networks, government policy forced them apart. And in a cruel twist, last year the actress who played Cathy\u2019s sister-in-law in the drama told the Evening Standard she was homeless. If Cathy Come Home shocked people to their core, the fact that it is played out in real people\u2019s lives in 2015 and 2016 should spark outrage. But the housing crisis is imbuing modern culture wherever you look. A few nights ago at the Soho Theatre, I watched Philip Ridley\u2019s new play, Radiant Vermin: a darkly hilarious but unsettling play about a couple who slowly abandon all codes of morality in their pursuit of a \u201cdream home\u201d in the face of house prices way beyond their means. While Loach\u2019s drama looks at the denigration of a young woman and her children, Radiant Vermin explores precisely how the housing crisis encourages rampant individualism, and the mindset that homeless people are \u201cvermin\u201d and \u201cscroungers\u201d, while people at the very bottom of the property ladder are \u201cstrivers\u201d.  Radiant Vermin is not even rare now: in July, a second play about the housing crisis, Fury, will open at the same theatre. It\u2019s rare that a week goes by without an invitation to another play, documentary or art exhibition about the crisis: Daisy May Hudson\u2019s Halfway, Verity Jane Keefe\u2019s Mobile Museum and Andrea Luka Zimmerman\u2019s Estate: A Reverie have all been made in response to the crisis, in temporary accommodation and the loss of social housing, and are inspired by personal experiences.  The housing crisis is so far-reaching, and the attack on social housing so personally felt, that it\u2019s not surprising it features so prominently in cultural work.  Rather than move on from Cathy Come Home, we\u2019ve come full circle: as Loach\u2019s film stands as testament to the social horrors of the mid-60s, so too will the documentaries, films and plays on today\u2019s crisis.  As the anniversary of Cathy Comes Home approaches, politicians should note that we did not learn from the play, but rather buried our heads in the sand, focused only on the economically idiotic belief that home ownership and high house prices were a social good. Fifty years on, the government has pushed through a Housing Act that seems destined to create thousands more Cathys across the country.",
