  "body": "The major parties clashed on manufacturing jobs on the election trail on Monday, as Labor unveiled a $59m advanced manufacturing package and Malcolm Turnbull travelled to Western Australia to trumpet the defence industry plan. On Monday in Geelong Bill Shorten announced Labor would commit $59m to the \u201cmanufacturing transition boost\u201d jobs package to encourage new manufacturing jobs in regions, including Geelong and northern Adelaide. Shorten and the opposition industry spokesman, Kim Carr, said in a statement: \u201cThese regions face the prospect of high unemployment and social dislocation after the Liberals goaded the car industry into closing down and leaving Australia.   Related: Penalty rates: Labor refuses to say if it would prevent Fair Work reducing them    \u201cThis jobs package will provide pathways to new jobs for skilled workers by attracting new business investment in advanced manufacturing. Firms will be given new incentives to diversify into new products and markets and employ automotive workers who have lost their jobs.\u201d Shorten claimed the government had \u201cno plans for advanced manufacturing ... [instead] leaving it to the market and leaving the blue-collar workers on the scrapheap\u201d. In its statement, Labor said 200,000 people would lose their jobs as a result of closures in motor vehicle production between now and 2017. When asked if Labor would reinstate the car industry, Shorten said he was \u201cnot in the business of making promises we can\u2019t keep\u201d. The package consists of $10.5m for existing automotive businesses and $48.1m to stimulate investment in new opportunities in advanced manufacturing. It will be provided through existing Victorian and South Australian industry transition assistance schemes. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, \u00a0lauded Labor\u2019s plan and said Shorten had put \u201cforward positive plans, a positive alternative\u201d.  \u201cThe contrast is very clear,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a transition fund out of Canberra. It\u2019s frozen, it\u2019s effectively been cut. We\u2019ve got a federal Liberal government and a prime minister in Malcolm Turnbull out of touch.\u201d Speaking on Radio National on Monday, the industry minister, Christopher Pyne, welcomed the $59m program. He noted the government had already spent more than $200m on the next generation manufacturing investment program and automotive diversification program, which he said were working in Geelong and Northern Adelaide.   Related: Coalition's company tax cuts would hand $1bn a year to US \u2013 thinktank    \u201cIt\u2019s welcome but it\u2019s very much a Johnny come lately approach,\u201d Pyne said. \u201cShorten has a plan for $100bn of new taxes so this is all rather hollow and rather late in the piece. \u201cThe government is already getting on with the job and we have a jobs plan built around defence industry jobs, innovation jobs, using our free-trade agreements overseas to get into new markets and taking the tax burden off businesses. \u201cWe are transitioning all of those businesses that want to stay in the automotive sector into ways they can stay in business, doing automotive and diversified range of goods, employing the same people, or more people because they\u2019re exporting.\u201d The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said: \u201cWe are making a much more substantial investment in supporting the economic transition, in particular in the manufacturing space.\u201d Cormann said Turnbull would \u201chave some more to say in relation to the benefits of our defence industry plan for Western Australia\u201d in his campaigning on Monday. The Turnbull government has promised to bring forward the multibillion-dollar construction of navy frigates and offshore patrol vessels in Australia. Construction will begin in 2018 on 12 offshore patrol vessels in Adelaide before that work is transferred to Perth in 2020 to make room for the future frigate program, due to start in Adelaide in 2020. Up to 21 Pacific patrol boats would also be built and maintained in Perth, at the Henderson shipbuilding site.",
