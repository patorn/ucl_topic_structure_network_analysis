  "body": "A man accused of murdering his six-year-old daughter has stormed out of the dock at his trial, claiming evidence was hidden by a doctor. Ben Butler, 36, who was sitting in the glass-walled dock at the Old Bailey in London, lost his temper while a consultant paediatric pathologist from St Thomas\u2019 hospital gave evidence about Ellie\u2019s postmortem. Andreas Marnerides was being asked by the defence about the cremation of Ellie after her death in October 2013.  When barrister Di Middleton asked whether the cremation was carried out in consultation with the defendant\u2019s solicitors, Butler began screaming: \u201cNo, no, no, no, it wasn\u2019t.\u201d Through the glass he shouted at the doctor: \u201cHow dare you. You took samples and cremated her behind our back.\u201d Ellie\u2019s mother, Jennifer Gray, who has been charged with a separate offence relating to treatment of the child, joined in on the attack on the doctor shouting: \u201cHow dare you.\u201d Butler then stormed out of the dock shouting: \u201cYou hid evidence ... yeah, yeah, yeah, you hid evidence.\u201d Ellie was found dead after being left alone at home with Butler in Sutton, south-west London, while her mother was at work. Butler is charged with murder and child cruelty, while Grayis charged with child cruelty. They both deny the charges.  Middleton immediately intervened, telling Mr Justice Wilkie: \u201cI apologise on Mr Butler\u2019s behalf, it\u2019s a particularly sensitive subject.\u201d The judge replied: \u201cHe lost it for a reason you have explained and absented himself.\u201d Butler returned to the dock within two minutes and was told by Wilkie: \u201cI understand that some issues may be very sensitive for you, but you must try to restrain yourself.\u201d The judge told Butler that if he wanted to communicate with the defence team he needed to do so by writing a note to his barrister. Ellie suffered catastrophic head injuries similar to those caused by a high-speed car crash on 28 October 2013, the trial has heard. Butler, who had been convicted of injuring Ellie when she was seven weeks old, had been reunited with his daughter after his conviction was quashed on appeal and a high court judge ruled the child should be returned to his care.  The trial continues.",
