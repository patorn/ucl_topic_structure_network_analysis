  "body": "Even if Tyler Hoechlin didn\u2019t play the ultra-competitive McReynolds in Richard Linklater\u2019s college baseball bro-opic Everybody Wants Some!!, it wouldn\u2019t be hard to spot his own emulous zeal. We\u2019re at Bounce, a London table tennis bar (yes, these things exist), in honour of one of the movie\u2019s most memorable scenes, and he is playing ping pong like he wants to put a ball-shaped hole in me. I bat it back just as hard. Hoechlin smashes it again. I return it. Dumpf. He clearly wasn\u2019t prepared for such a steadfast opponent. In the film, McReynolds unable to lose at anything (pool, beer pong, picking up girls), well, loses. And then loses it. Things end up broken. In the bar, I\u2019m worried our game will end similarly. Hoechlin beats me \u2013 only just beats me \u2013 11-9. I try to contain my fury. Really this is just a foil for me to get closer to bro culture: how it is now, betwixt a group of testosteronery young lad-actors who are kicking back during a probably laborious press tour; and how it was then, in the 80s when the film is set, among the group of far more mustachioed college athletes they play.            Linklater has called the film a \u201cspiritual sequel\u201d to both his most recent film, Boyhood, the coming-of-age epic that ended with its lead character slinging down his backpack in his new college dorm, and to cult classic Dazed And Confused, his 1976-set suburban high school portrait. For Everybody Wants Some!! \u2013 the title is a Van Halen song but those exclamation marks could pass for baseball bats \u2013 we fast-forward to the fictional Southeast Texas University, 1980.    Related: Everybody Wants Some!! review \u2013 Richard Linklater's sports jock comedy is a winner    Our first introduction to the gang is Jake (Glee\u2019s Blake Jenner), a freshman with a Mount Rushmore chin, a crate of Devo records and a T-shirt that looks as if it has been applied by aerosol can. Jake rooms with the rest of his team-mates, who represent every type of man marrow. There\u2019s McReynolds \u2013 special talent: striking a ball with an axe so cleanly it slices in two \u2013 and Finnegan (played by Glen Powell) who reads Kerouac, smokes a pipe and flirts using a line about his \u201caverage-sized penis\u201d. Also on the team are hothead pitcher Jay, who can throw a ball at 95mph but whose social skills remain elusive, the discerning Dale (the only significant person of colour in the film), Nesbit (handlebar moustache, John Lennon shades), country bumpkin Beuter and hippy manchild Willoughby. Add to this machismo mix an opening 10 minutes dedicated to our heroes cruising campus in a Pontiac trying to pick up girls and it\u2019s all starting to sound a bit American Pie. But EWS!! is far from that. Usually in high school or college films the frat-boy bros (Sean William-Scott 90% of the time) are sidelined as dumb but pretty. EWS!!, however, is shot through with warmth, humour and sensitivity. It depicts athleticism and Whip It-fast wit but also \u2013 for once \u2013 analyses how it feels to be expected to play a game of knuckle flicking, and to enjoy it. Linklater nails the pressure that guys come under to act cocksure when they aren\u2019t really that sure at all.     Blake Jenner and Temple Baker. Photograph: Rex    \u201cJocks get such a bad rap,\u201d says Hoechlin, once we\u2019re ensconced in a booth, of how the film aims to counter their image. He\u2019s so adamant about this throughout the interview that I expect him to start handing out flyers and buttons. \u201cUsually you see jocks sprinkled into a film. They are an easy antagonist. Jocks are made to seem like they exclude a lot of people. But my character McReynolds and Nesbit are two guys who would never be friends in real life if they weren\u2019t on a baseball team. So, actually, jocks are incredibly inclusive.\u201d The dynamic between teammates is like that of \u201cintimate relationships\u201d, they argue. \u201cThere\u2019s a familiarity and you start to understand them to a level where you start knowing their moves on the field in a better way. It\u2019s a really weird shorthand that you develop\u201d, says Glen Powell, who seamlessly hands the verbal baton to Hoechlin. His memories of college with buddies were that \u201cyou sit down, eat, put something on to watch, and no one said anything. You didn\u2019t have to. You could make a joke, but you could also just sit there for hours and not say anything and it didn\u2019t matter. The point was hanging out not \u2018is everyone having a good time? Is everyone entertained?\u2019 You\u2019re just being in the same space.\u201d I suggest the film even has homoerotic undertones, and that the butt-patting and chest-bumping is Linklater\u2019s own visual shorthand for what the boys describe. Powell agrees, telling me that one critic called the film \u201cthe gayest of 2016\u201d, not least because, in one scene, McReynolds sprawls across a couch in a crop-top looking for all the world like a Greek Olympian.    Related: Richard Linklater: \u2018Someone\u2019s living back there, and he\u2019s murdered somebody\u2019    It is a refreshing change from other frat-pack films and their backs-to-the-walls-lads #banter. (That there is not one \u201cThat\u2019s so gay\u201d in its two-hour running time seems extraordinary.) The film has been criticised for being sexist (it fails the Bechdel test, and there is only one named main female character, Beverly). But I don\u2019t agree with some of the male-gaze criticism. Of course, the film is phallocentric and there is a lot of waving around of priapic bats. But then, take a film like Bridesmaids and the opposite is true. In EWS!!, there is one nude shot of a woman whereas the guys spend around 80% of the film semi-naked. There is mud wrestling, but it ends with a woman victor astride a flattened man.     Photograph: Van Redin    Perhaps this turn of events shouldn\u2019t be surprising, considering that Linklater is responsible for the sentimental Before trilogy and the intelligent, self-reflective Slacker. Wrestling defeat aside, he portrays the baseball team at the peak of their sporting prowess (their naked ambition reminds me of Miles Teller\u2019s Andrew in Whiplash). But, this also being Linklater, there\u2019s an underlying bittersweetness: the fact that many won\u2019t make it pro. EWS!! draws on the director\u2019s own experiences of being a young man playing ball at university, his sporting career cut short when he developed a heart problem. For a lot of these guys, their college years are as good as it gets.    Back in the day...it was a bit more man\u2019s man, more Burt Reynolds  Tyler Hoechlin     \u201cYou have to learn to be a healthy competitor, winning or losing,\u201d says Powell. \u201cBecause there can be a lot more losses than there are wins.\u201d Like all of the best films involving sport (This Sporting Life, Gregory\u2019s Girl, even Space Jam) identity is a key player, and EWS!! has pitched up into a maelstrom of Man Identity Debate. In the same month that David Baddiel penned an article for the Times entitled \u201cWhere have all the great men gone?\u201d, Grayson Perry debuted a TV series that explored the complexities and contradictions of the modern man. The overriding conclusion? The male identity is, apparently, in crisis. Powell and Hoechlin are just as intrigued by the current state of affairs. Powell observes that the 90s and early 00s \u201cmetrosexual\u201d (see: David Beckham, sarong, David Beckham and sarong together) is making a comeback. \u201cSkinny jeans. A lot of accessories. Shaving chest hair. Like, sexuality wasn\u2019t sexual identity so much then.\u201d Hoechlin, meanwhile, sees a positive progression in man behaviour. \u201cBack in the day, and us in this film, it was a little different,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so politically correct. It was a bit more man\u2019s man, more Burt Reynolds. Now there\u2019s a lot more sensitivity and open discussion of things. More open-minded.\u201d     Photograph: Smallz & Raskind/Getty    Is that true, though? We are living in an age when multinationals think men will only buy diet drinks if the word \u201cdiet\u201d isn\u2019t used and moisturisers if they\u2019re in navy blue packaging. Suicide is a leading cause of death for men. Do they \u2013 these handsome guys with biceps that resemble well-fed anacondas \u2013 really talk about their feelings?   Related: Everybody Wants Some: can Richard Linklater's latest help heal America?    Yes, in fact. The EWS!! lot aren\u2019t afraid to show their softer sides. Both mention friends who lost parents in tragic circumstances and how their college bros pulled together. \u201cIt\u2019s about moments where you\u2019re like: dude, we love you. We\u2019re here for you,\u201d says Hoechlin. Family is important, too. Hoechlin\u2019s dad (\u201cbad-ass\u201d) raised his half-siblings alone for a time. I\u2019m wearing an Elvis shirt, and Powell tells me that every time his sister used to sell a Girl Scout cookie he would sing her an Elvis song. \u201cBut I was really shy. So I would do it behind a honeysuckle bush. A singing honeysuckle bush.\u201d The \u201cmodern man\u201d they conclude, is just posturing. \u201cThe theatrics of hanging out\u201d, they call it. At this point, they both play out a riff on the Dorsia restaurant reservation scene in American Psycho.  What\u2019s also interesting is that, while EWS!! is a film that\u2019s big on bros, baseball and babes, it will be seen by an audience immersed in the political discourse of \u201csafe spaces\u201d and SlutWalks. Linklater appears conscious of this. The EWS!! era has the advantage of being pre-Aids, pre-\u201dwar on terror\u201d, pre-Facebook and likewise the film is devoid of, say, the horrific frat gang rapes heard about so often in 2016, filmed and uploaded to social media. It celebrates a more idyllic college experience, one without extreme hazing, stories of which make your entire body wince. \u201cBut that isn\u2019t hazing,\u201d says Powell emphatically, \u201cit\u2019s abuse. Those assholes, they are not good people.\u201d Could it be that we\u2019ve got jocks wrong? That, no matter whether they play sports or silly games, they have grown to be emotionally astute and non-judgmental? When it comes down to it, the guys in EWS!! write poetry, deliver flowers and talk about their hopes and dreams when the sun comes up \u2013 and it\u2019s the same IRL. \u201cEveryone in this film is unashamedly themselves,\u201d says Hoechlin. I mumble something about losing the game, and Powell isn\u2019t having any of it. \u201cBut you were awesome!\u201d he says, and I\u2019m enveloped into a bear hug. For once, I feel proud to be one of the guys. Everybody Wants Some!! is in cinemas now",
