  "body": "It is a year since revenge porn became a crime. Last week a father was arrested after posting pictures of women online (including one who was pregnant, and doctored photos of a 15-year-old girl), commenting underneath one that he would \u201cpay \u00a3100 to rape her\u201d. Despite Women\u2019s Aid\u2019s research revealing that, for a third of women surveyed, threats made online were later carried out in real life, he was let off with a caution. Which leads one to ask, if one is the curious type, if the law is working. While only around 9% of online hate crimes are investigated nationwide, a Freedom of Information Act request by the BBC showed there had been 1,160 reported incidents of revenge porn in the first year of the new law coming into effect, including three involving children. Of these, 11% resulted in a charge. The law was imposed in order to recognise the impact revenge porn has on its victims, positioning it as an example of domestic violence, and as a crime that is gendered \u2013 90% of victims are women. But as we see the problems with fighting revenge porn (a name that feels less satisfactory the more I write it, a drop-down option for a Wednesday night alone rather than a life ruiner, a crime) it\u2019s worth stepping away from the legalities, and returning to the women. It\u2019s worth, I think, exploring just why revenge porn is such a sinister crime.    You walk through the world as one person, then, unclothed you are someone else    One of my favourite moments in the Alan Partridge oeuvre is when he denies his body exists. \u201cUnderneath our clothes we\u2019re, all of us, naked. Even you, Alan,\u201d remarks a fashion designer he is interviewing on air. \u201cNo I\u2019m not,\u201d he replies. A small pause. \u201cAll we are saying,\u201d his co-host adds, \u201cis that underneath your clothes you are naked.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d says Alan, moving to the next link. \u201cNo I\u2019m not.\u201d Without wanting to dilute the magic of Partridge by breaking apart a joke into its constituent parts, the humour lies in his insistence that, as Alan Partridge, TV host, broadcaster, maverick, he is above such things as nudity; while he is working his nakedness does not exist. Since this was first aired I have grown to feel as if Alan had a point. In this cold country it is a choice to be naked. To be naked is to be vulnerable, to be seen as something other than professional, than proper. In Alan\u2019s case it is to be seen as unmanly. In the case of a woman, though, it is to be seen as sexual. You walk through the world as one person, then, unclothed, you are someone else. There\u2019s a reason that arriving at school naked is a recurring nightmare for so many. Revenge porn victims say they\u2019ve suffered \u201csignificant emotional distress\u201d after an ex posted their nude photos online. When we all carry broadcast-quality cameras in our pockets, they inevitably feature in many relationships, but in moments of trust, when candles are lit in your head and you feel good, in control. When you feel as if the person kneeling in front of you is your friend. Later, when you enter a job interview and wonder whether the interviewers were there, too, that control is lost. When you have lunch with your mother, or order a coffee, or teach algebra to your GCSE class and wonder whether they have seen you in the bra he bought you, in those shoes. Once seen like this, can they ever see you clothed? Revenge porn is so insidious and so pernicious because even as we creep towards equality, this is one of the places where men still maintain power. Women\u2019s bodies have currency. It\u2019s this commodification that leads to the most crushing detail of revenge porn: that so many women don\u2019t realise that they are victims \u2013 either they are unaware that the pictures are public or they don\u2019t know that this is a crime. Already so many women feel their bodies are objects, seen through a lens; to have to fight for your photo to be removed from porn sites when, because it\u2019s from your husband\u2019s phone, you don\u2019t own the copyright, leaves a person feeling powerless. Online abuse is threatening to overwhelm the police, and it\u2019s taking too long for the law to creak up to date. While new legislation should help in time, a more effective way of eliminating revenge porn is to work to prevent it \u2013 to educate children about how to value intimacy, to respect a person\u2019s privacy and, crucially, that a woman\u2019s body is her own.
