  "body": "Joe Marler says the heavy criticism of England\u2019s failed World Cup campaign as well as personal issues led him to seek professional help to address his on-field behaviour. The Harlequins prop, who has served two bans recently, admits he had little option but to change and is now making a concerted effort to reboot his attitude and career. Marler could hardly have been more searingly honest before Harlequins\u2019 European Challenge Cup final against Montpellier on Friday.   Related: Which European club rugby final was the greatest of them all? | Robert Kitson    Before heading off for his latest face-to-face session with the sports psychologist Jeremy Snape, Marler acknowledged he had been driven to seek help following his latest suspension for kicking a French opponent in the head, and admitted he felt lucky still to be in contention for a place on England\u2019s summer tour to Australia. England\u2019s premature World Cup exit, it now emerges, also added significantly to his inner frustration. \u201cFor a while now I\u2019ve been wanting to see someone \u2026 to say: \u2018Actually, stop pretending I can keep dealing with it on my own,\u2019\u201d said Marler, who has served his two-match ban for kicking Grenoble\u2019s Arnaud H\u00e9guy last month. \u201cMy issues are off the field but they have spilled on to the field. I\u2019m not sitting here saying I have a lot of problems or I\u2019m a complete nutjob; I\u2019m saying there\u2019s stuff that needs addressing in and out of rugby that I\u2019m now getting hold of. \u201cIt is making me feel better and hopefully I can continue with that. There is plenty of help out there; it is just about whether you are willing to accept you are the horse and someone is bringing you to the water.\u201d The negative focus on England\u2019s scrummaging following their World Cup exit, according to Marler, also contributed to his ban for abusing Wales\u2019s Samson Lee during the Six Nations Championship. \u201cThe World Cup was meant to be the biggest experience of our lives, the highest point of our careers \u2013 and we blew it. We won\u2019t have a home World Cup again as a group. It was that lack of an admission that it was actually our fault: let\u2019s blame something else, let\u2019s not look within ourselves. I suppose that\u2019s what caused the mind frame. \u201cFrom a personal point of view, I took a bit of a bashing during that World Cup and as a team we were complete flops. Mentally, I just went inside myself and was like: \u2018Sod this.\u2019 That was my mindset. There wasn\u2019t really any sense to what I was thinking, it was just easier to crawl under a shell and tell everyone to piss off than to actually confront people or talk reasonably. I look back on it now and my mind frame was the cause of things that didn\u2019t even exist.\u201d Marler\u2019s priority is to help Quins conclude the season with a trophy and, if selected, renew an acquaintance with Australia\u2019s front row this summer. \u201cI\u2019m chomping at the bit to get out there and prove, more to myself than anything, that I am capable of playing a game of rugby on the edge without being a dick. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d be playing again this season, I thought I\u2019d be having the summer off as well. So I feel very lucky to be in a position to pull on the shirt for Quins again and even luckier that it\u2019s a final. \u201cEddie Jones has been in touch. He has been supportive but more in a \u2018Come on, mate, it is time to wind your neck in\u2019 sort of way. You can only be supportive so many times, can\u2019t you? If I go out on Friday night and kick someone else in the head I don\u2019t think he is going to be supportive any more.\u201d The 25-year-old is not about to turn completely soft overnight. \u201cIf I\u2019m going to avoid any form of physicality I might as well not be on the pitch. It is about knowing I can still put in a physical hit without actually going over the top. That will be the toughest challenge.\u201d All connected with Quins and England will be desperately hoping the new, improved Marler is true to his word.",
