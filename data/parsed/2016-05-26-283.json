  "body": "The Mill, as you know, is about hearsay, suggestions and possibilities, half-formed notions muttered into the ears of the gullible for the sake of a temporary release from the tyranny of news. But now and again the Mill delivers cold hard facts and today we feel obliged to open with one. Behold a truth: any club that is contemplating spending something in the region of \u00a376m on Javier Mascherano is trying too hard to seem clever and not hard enough to scout properly. The Argentinian scurrier is a marvellous player \u2013 whole-hearted and inspirational and shrewd and nifty \u2013 but those attributes are not unique and he\u2019s 31. It must be possible to find at least a dozen younger and much cheaper players who, with some good coaching and timely waving of a big stick, could learn to do what Mascherano does. And yet here we are, readers, having to discuss reports that Juventus are poised to activate Mascherano\u2019s release clause from Barcelona and, what is more, buy Dani Alves too! Frankly that\u2019s jut lazy thinking from the Old Lady.   Related: Zlatan Ibrahimovic wants \u00a3220,000-a-week to join Manchester United    N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 \u2013 now see, there\u2019s an example of someone who could perhaps do a lot of what Mascherano does \u2013 is still being stalked by Paris Saint-Germain, who are prepared to trigger the player\u2019s release clause of around \u00a318m while playing the Home, Sweet Home card. But Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is plotting to lure the Frenchman to Manchester United instead, just as soon as the Portuguese has finished explaining to Ed Woodward exactly what wallpaper he wants in his new office and how many sugars he takes in his tea. Leicester are considering replacing Kant\u00e9 with Nice\u2019s Nampalys Mendy \u2013 because Claudio Ranieri loves the smell of Nampalys in the morning \u2013 but Chelsea and Arsenal are eyeing up the same player.   Related: Mario Balotelli unwanted by Milan and on his way back to Liverpool    Mourinho, meanwhile, wants Roma\u2019s defender Kostas Manolas and will return to Chelsea with a \u00a360m offer for Willian and will then bop across London to try to beat Manchester City and Liverpool to the service of West Ham\u2019s 17-year-old potential Mascherano-in-the-making, Reece Oxford. West Ham will use some of the money generated from that transfer and not having to buy a stadium to purchase the Portuguese forward Domingos Quina. Suggestions that Ars\u00e8ne Wenger has now completed his summer recruitment may in fact be wide of the mark. Because reports continue to mutter about the possibility of Arsenal adding a striker, with \u00c1lvaro Morata still their top target even though Juventus are asking for silly money, presumably because they want to go and do something even sillier, as previously discussed.",
