Related: Trump's presumptive nomination divides Republicans \u2013 campaign live    When the tow truck driver saw the stranded motorist\u2019s Bernie Sanders sticker, Fox Carolina reported, he aborted the pick-up and left her on the side of the highway. According to Fox Carolina: \u201cKenneth Shupe said he was called to pick up a woman stranded on I-26 in Asheville on Monday. \u201cWhen he saw \u2018a bunch of Bernie Sanders stuff\u2019, he said he told the woman \u2018very politely\u2019 that he couldn\u2019t tow her car because she was \u2018obviously a socialist\u2019. Shupe \u201cadvised her to \u2018call the government\u2019 for a tow\u201d, the report said, adding: \u201cEvery business dealing in recent history with a socialist-minded person I have not gotten paid \u2026 every time I deal with these people I get \u2018Berned\u2019 with an \u2018e\u2019 not a \u2018u\u2019.\u2019\u201d Shupe, who runs Shupee Max Towing in Travelers Rest, said he is a conservative Christian who supports Trump. The Huffington Post reported that the driver, Cassandra McWade, \u201ccollects disability payments and has psoriatic arthritis, impaired mobility, early stage Crohn\u2019s disease, severe fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome\u201d. McWade\u2019s mother wrote about the incident on Facebook: \u201cHeads up, friends \u2026 Cass had a wreck in Asheville yesterday. She is fine, but the car was not driveable. We called our mechanic who was tied up in Easley at the time, so he sent Shupee Max Towing to get her.  \u201cKenneth Shupe drove from Travelers Rest to Asheville, hooked up her car, and when he went around to the back, he came back and told her that he wouldn\u2019t tow her because she had a Bernie sticker on the back of the car.  \u201cHE LEFT HER ON THE SIDE OF THE INTERSTATE IN NC, and DROVE AWAY. \u201cSpread this bigot\u2019s story far & wide. Btw, I\u2019m guessing he\u2019s a Trump supporter. The only difference is that the Don would have taken the money, because he at least realizes that liberals\u2019 money spends just the same as anyone else\u2019s.  \u201cDumb [expletive] cost himself money driving all the way to Asheville & back for nothing.
