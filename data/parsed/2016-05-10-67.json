  "body": "Tony Adams is in negotiations with Brondby about becoming their manager. The former Arsenal centre-half, who is the director of football at Gabala in Azerbaijan, is the favourite to take over from the interim coach, Aurelijus Skarbalius, at the end of the season. Adams has a connection to the Brondby owner, Jan Bech Andersen, through John Terry, the Chelsea captain, who is a mutual friend, and the 49-year-old is ready to leave Gabala to pursue a fresh challenge. \u201cI can confirm I am talking to Brondby regarding the coach\u2019s position,\u201d Adams said. \u201cI will leave Gabala later in May and I am looking to return to a manager\u2019s job. Nothing has been decided yet and I am sure Brondby will chose the right person for the job.\u201d Adams has been in talks with the Danish club for a number of weeks and, if appointed, he would consider naming John Jensen, his former Arsenal team-mate, as his assistant. Brondby\u2019s other options for the manager\u2019s post are Morten Wieghorst, formerly a Celtic player and Swansea City assistant manager, and the Faroe Islands coach, Lars Olsen. After a playing career with Arsenal and England, Adams has struggled to make the transition into management. He had a year at Wycombe Wanderers that began in November 2003, during which time the club was relegated into League Two, and he had an angst-ridden three and a half months in charge of Portsmouth in 2008-09, when he won only two Premier League games. Adams\u2019 other managerial post was at Gabala. He took over in May 2010 and lasted 18 months, before he resigned for family reasons. He returned to the club as the director of football in October 2012. Andersen has advised Terry over financial investments and the Chelsea player went to Denmark on Monday to visit him and watch the club\u2019s game against Nordsjaelland. Brondby\u2019s previous manager, Thomas Frank, resigned in March under bizarre circumstances after he found out Andersen had been critical of him on a fans\u2019 web forum. Andersen had logged in under a pseudonym.",
