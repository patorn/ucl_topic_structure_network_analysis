With fast-growing megacities such as Lagos, Jakarta, Seoul and Nairobi among the 37 revealed today in a joint launch in the Kenyan capital and Washington DC, the multimillion dollar programme looks to be tackling the most ambitious and difficult aspects of \u201cbuilding resilience\u201d (a phrase describing the process of discovering how multiple shocks and stresses are interlinked and related).  \u201cIncorporating resilience planning and principles not only prepares cities for disasters and long-term threats,\u201d says Judith Rodin, president of the Rockefeller Foundation, which also supports Guardian Cities. \u201cIt also improves everyday living standards for all members of an urban community.\u201d   A further eight American cities have joined the list today, including Washington DC, Seattle, Atlanta and Honolulu, meaning that, in all, one quarter of the 100 Resilient Cities are from the US. Three more Canadian cities \u2013 Vancouver, Toronto and Calgary \u2013 join Montreal in what has been a deliberate attempt to create mutually beneficial \u201chubs of experience\u201d in certain countries around the world.    The moment just before cities are selected is probably the time you have most attention from a governor or mayor  Michael Berkowitz      \u201cIn this third cohort, we largely went deeper in existing places rather than to new places,\u201d explains Michael Berkowitz, the president of the 100RC programme. \u201cIn the United Kingdom, we have Manchester and Belfast joining Glasgow, Bristol, London \u2013 now that\u2019s a real cohort. And now we\u2019re talking to the prime minister\u2019s office about how we might use the momentum that\u2019s created to spread the programme further [within the UK].  Similarly, two more cities in Mexico \u2013 Colima and Guadalajara (Metro) \u2013 take its total quota to four (after Mexico City and Ju\u00e1rez), while Africa now boasts 10 cities in all, with Addis Ababa, Cape Town, Luxor and Paynesville in Liberia also being named today.  Speaking at a launch event in Nairobi, Cyvette Gibson, the mayor of Paynesville, described her city\u2019s \u201csignificant challenges\u201d. \u201cLike many cities in Liberia that experienced rapid urbanisation after the civil conflict in the country, we grapple with issues such as high unemployment and scarcity of opportunity,\u201d she said. \u201cWe also struggle to provide key services such as healthcare and education. This partnership will help us build resiliency and learn from other cities in the network to offer better services to our people.\u201d A different way  What comes over strongly from talking to Berkowitz is just how seriously the process is taken on all sides. He describes what he calls \u201cwhites-of-the-eyes\u201d meetings, when the 100RC team have one final, cards-on-the-table discussion with a city\u2019s governor or mayor before the decision to include, or not, is made.  \u201cThe moment just before cities are selected is probably the time you have most attention from a governor or mayor,\u201d Berkowitz says, \u201cso using that moment to have a frank, honest discussion of what this process really entails is crucial. Being able to poke your finger in the chest of a mayor or chief executive and say, \u2018You\u2019re thinking about this in the wrong way, why not look at it a different way?\u2019 has proved very useful \u2026\u201d     Roadworks on a flyover in Pune, India, another of the final tranche of resilient cities. Photograph: Look Die Bildagentur/Alamy     For every city that has made it on to the final list, many more have been rejected during the assessment process. Since 2013, 100RC says it has received more than 1,000 applications to join the network, including 325 during this third round of appraisals.  For those cities now on board, the first key target is to identify and appoint a \u201cchief resilience officer\u201d (CRO) from within the city, whose salary will typically then be funded by the programme for two years. Thus far, more than 50 CROs have been appointed \u2013 but what\u2019s their role in a nutshell?  \u201cCities, particularly the larger megacities, spend their whole day fighting fire,\u201d Berkowitz says. \u201cThe idea of the CRO is to be the one person or office who has the luxury to think a little bit more strategically. We see the CRO as an integrator, that\u2019s their explicit role.\u201d  The next step is to create a \u201cresilience strategy\u201d; a blueprint for how the city plans to move to a more integrated, coherent way of tackling both sudden shocks and long-term urban pressures. To date, a dozen of the first two tranches of member cities have published theirs, from New York and New Orleans to the small Danish port city of Vejle.  \u201cWhat the CRO and the resilience strategy both try to do is say: \u2018Here\u2019s the things that are priorities to us, and here\u2019s how we can integrate this stuff,\u2019\u201d Berkowitz explains. \u201cAnd in the process, we\u2019re also seeing our CROs becoming magnets for other work that\u2019s going on in their city.\u201d  Berkowitz, who has previously worked in New York City\u2019s Office of Emergency Management, is disarmingly realistic about what the 100RC programme has achieved to date, saying that today\u2019s announcement \u201cfeels like the work is only just beginning\u201d. (He\u2019s certainly kept busy by it: after our meeting in London, he was straight off to Rotterdam for the launch of its resilience strategy, then on to Lagos, and then to Nairobi for one half of today\u2019s launch.)   Related: More than just a flood defence: how Vejle built a blueprint for resilience     \u201cThe ultimate change we\u2019re trying to see in cities \u2013 more cohesive communities, better infrastructure, more integrated planning, better mobility \u2013 these are things that happen over a generation, not just a couple of years. So one of the questions we\u2019re asking now is how do you keep partnering with cities over an entire generation? Not just to 2020 but 2030, because that\u2019s when we\u2019ll see the kinds of change we\u2019re really looking for.\u201d  But three years and countless airmiles on from 100RC\u2019s inception, Berkowitz says he is more convinced than ever that the programme can have a profound effect on its own \u2013 and other \u2013 cities, over the longer term at least.   \u201cThis agenda is blowing up all the time. Cities are the most important thing of our generation \u2013 they\u2019re both our biggest risk and our greatest hope for solving all the big challenges of the world: sectarian conflict, climate threats, migration, cyber-security and so on.  \u201cWe are trying to ignite a revolution in the way cities view their risks and opportunities \u2013 but not only in the 100 member cities. By some accounts there are 10,000 cities in the world, and if cities are going to save the world, we can\u2019t have 10,000 bespoke solutions. We\u2019re using our 100 member cities as a first step \u2013 but ultimately we need to get all cities to understand that their differences are not that different. They need to come together.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and join the discussion",
