His first venture into the genre, Black Panther, has sold more than 250,000 copies in a month, making it the bestselling comic in the US so far this year. The first issue in Coates\u2019s Black Panther series, which follows the adventures of T\u2019Challa, the head of the fictional African nation of Wakanda, was published in the US on 6 April by Marvel Comics. Comic Book Resources reported this week that it sold an estimated 253,258 copies in April, putting it well ahead of the second-placed title, Star Wars: Poe Dameron, which sold 175,322 copies. The strong performance, according to the Hollywood Reporter, amounts to \u201can outstanding debut for a character often considered in the second tier of Marvel superheroes\u201d.   Related: Ta-Nehisi Coates's Black Panther review \u2013 a promising, subversive start    The comic sees T\u2019Challa, the first mainstream black superhero to grace the pages of a graphic novel when he first appeared in 1966, facing \u201cdramatic upheaval\u201d in Wakanda, as a \u201csuperhuman terrorist group\u201d known as The People causes a violent uprising. It is illustrated by Brian Stelfreeze.  Coates is also the author of the award-winning book of polemical memoir and politics, Between the World and Me. In the Atlantic, he has written that his version of the Black Panther \u201cpulls from the archives of Marvel and the character\u2019s own long history. But it also pulls from the very real history of society \u2013 from the pre-colonial era of Africa, the peasant rebellions that wracked Europe toward the end of the middle ages, the American civil war, the Arab spring, and the rise of Isis.\u201d Isaac Butler said in his Guardian review that \u201cCoates may be a first-time comics writer whose entire published catalogue thus far is nonfiction, but he attacks the material with aplomb\u201d, the debut issue moving \u201cfluidly, lighting the fuses of several plots that will clearly intersect before detonating in the finale\u201d. Played by Chadwick Boseman, the Black Panther character appeared in the latest Marvel film Captain America: Civil War and is also set to appear in a solo Black Panther film in 2018.

Photograph: Allstar/MARVEL STUDIOS    Forbidden Planet\u2019s Danie Ware expressed the hope that the comic would be as big in the UK as it has been in the US; the UK first printing recently sold out and the comic has gone to a second and third printing. \u201cIt reflects not only the colossal success of the Civil War movie, but also a move towards a much more diverse cast of characters \u2013 welcoming more female characters and more characters of colour. This is something that the fans and readers want and welcome,\u201d said Ware. Kate McHale, comics buyer at Waterstones, said the UK\u2019s largest book chain was expecting the series \u201cto do really well\u201d.

While people probably feel they know the story of Captain America or Spider-Man, there\u2019s perhaps more excitement about a character who could be relatively unknown to a lot of fans.  \u201cMore than that, however, is the anticipation about what new angles a brilliant writer like Ta-Nehisi Coates could bring to the character,\u201d said McHale. \u201cI think we\u2019re expecting a level of depth and insight that could make this one of Marvel\u2019s most interesting and compelling titles, and one of the must-reads of the year. After a great first issue that looks likely.\u201d",
