  "body": "Less than two weeks after the release of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade, the new visual album has already inspired its own sold-out Manhattan dance class \u2013 complete with fans in themed costumes from the film. Inspired by Serena Williams\u2019 twerking next to Beyonc\u00e9 in the Sorry video, Ranese Southerland, 28, dressed like a ballerina warrior in an all-black tutu, bodysuit and combat boots to the Monday night Beyonc\u00e9 class at Broadway Bodies, a dance studio in Chelsea. Southerland said it took an email chain with 23 replies to work out what she and her other \u201cBeyonc\u00e9 Bodies\u201d class friends were going to wear. \u201cI don\u2019t put that much effort into what I wear to work,\u201d said Southerland, a sales associate for a New York venue.       But Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 and the Beyonc\u00e9 classes, which have been running at Broadway Bodies for four years \u2013 inspires this kind of devotion. One attendee wore a black top with \u201cI ain\u2019t sorry\u201d marked in white around the neckline, while another painted her face with white dots, like the dancers in the video. Kate Goldwater, 32, wore a mustard yellow tiered ruffle dress, inspired by Hold Up, the video where Beyonce saunters around smashing cars with a baseball bat while wearing a similar gown. \u201cThis is my favorite look from the video so I recreated it out of a tablecloth and old T-shirts,\u201d said Goldwater, a fashion designer who owns a vintage clothing store in Manhattan\u2019s East Village.  Goldwater says as soon as the album dropped, social media started buzzing with class regulars like herself discussing the album, declaring: \u201cOh my God, it\u2019s an emergency, we have to call an emergency class. So we all registered right away.\u201d  Sorry, the fourth track on the album, was voted on by class regulars as the first song from Lemonade to be used. Sorry is flicking-the-bird-furious Beyonc\u00e9. It\u2019s a song about getting drunk with your girlfriends (on your cheating husband\u2019s Cognac brand, natch) and declaring \u201cI ain\u2019t thinking \u2019bout you\u201d and \u201cboy, bye\u201d.       Dance teacher Alistair Williams, 30, the executive director of Broadway Bodies, declares the room a \u201cshame-free\u201d zone. The crowd was mostly in their twenties and thirties and the majority were women, but a few Beyonc\u00e9-loving fellas also participated. Enrollment has spiked since the release of Lemonade, said Williams, with this first Sorry class selling out in three days. Next week is sold out, with only a few tickets available for the following week\u2019s new Hold Up class. The new album is a boon for business. Choreography is modeled on the video and adapted by Williams and his team. For this Beyonc\u00e9 song in particular he\u2019s allowing \u201ccommunity choreography\u201d, asking students to help come up with the best moves to rejig the dance each week.       \u201cOf course I cheated, I looked at the Formation tour videos that are on Facebook and stole some of those moves,\u201d said Williams. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Formation tour launched in Miami last week. The Sorry dance itself involves enough body rolls to get you sweaty but is bearable for a beginner to learn in 45 minutes. There\u2019s a lot of laughing and clapping, a high-energy class that doesn\u2019t take itself too seriously. When Beyonc\u00e9 screams \u201cSuck on my balls, pause, I\u2019ve had enough\u201d, we cross one arm in front of the other and thrust our hips forward. \u201cI want everyone to unleash their inner \u2018fuck you\u2019,\u201d declared Williams. When Beyonc\u00e9 declares \u201cmiddle fingers up\u201d, we do it. It\u2019s fun playing the character of Beyonc\u00e9, luxuriating in the spurned woman turned girl power moves.",
