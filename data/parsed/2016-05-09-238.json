  "body": "The phony campaign is over. The true believers are heading for the barricades. It\u2019s time for the watchers to hurry up and wait.   Related: Turnbull reminisces about banana packing as 'real world' campaign foray bears fruit    While Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s campaign day resembled something like fruit ninja, Bill Shorten\u2019s troupe took off for northern Australia, landing at the Cairns West state school in the seat of Leichhardt held by Liberal MP Warren Entsch. \u201cWe are the underdogs,\u201d Shorten said, framing his first full day. \u201cYou have to be when you\u2019ve got to win back 20 seats, don\u2019t you, but I think what the government\u2019s done is underestimated the Australian people. \u201cThe Australian people are sick of three-word slogans. Mr Turnbull simply saying \u2018plan\u2019 any number of times does not somehow magically create a plan.\u201d This was about scene setting, revealing a Labor campaign plan designed to build slowly in a marathon race. It was the only media event of the day for Shorten, who was looking relaxed for the short time he appeared. He posed happily in front of a bus-sized picture of himself. It was not surprising that Labor began with the Gonski education funding issue \u2013 a strength for Labor. The announcement was bolstered by the gravitas of Indigenous leader and now senator Patrick Dodson, not your average three-word-slogan merchant.     The Labor leader, Bill Shorten (right), campaigns in Cairns with senator Pat Dodson on Monday. Photograph: Mick Tsikas/EPA    Also present was the Labor candidate for Leichhardt, Sharryn Howes, a former Canberra public servant, who is hoping to win the enormous electorate held by Entsch on 5.7%. The seat takes in Cairns and stretches up through Cape York, just shy of 150,000 sq km. Shorten was announcing new Indigenous teachers scholarships as part of the $100m in funding under Gonski targeting Indigenous education. The Gonski model starts with an equal funding for each student and loads on for known disadvantage such as remoteness and Indigenous background. But of the $100m Labor pledge on Monday, only $4.8m was new money, to be put towards 400 Indigenous teachers scholarships. Labor is planning to campaign from a Townsville base for the better part of the week and Shorten\u2019s reception \u2013 particularly on Gonski \u2013 will shed light on just how education is playing out in regional areas. (Independent Tony Windsor is promising to support the Gonski model in the deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce\u2019s seat of New England.) Over the next few days, no doubt Labor will visit the seats of Dawson (LNP George Christensen 7.6%) and Capricornia (LNP Michelle Landry 0.8%) with Bob Katter\u2019s humongous seat of Kennedy \u2013 one third of Queensland \u2013 probably thrown in for good measure. In rejecting the Gonski model, the Coalition has done its best to try to neutralise education with a $1.2bn funding offer to the states \u2013 if they agree to certain conditions. It follows Tony Abbott\u2019s previous attempt to neutralise the Gonski policy in the 2013 election, only to break a promise after coming to government.   Related: Labor's Patrick Dodson says Indigenous treaty should be an option    Dodson said he hoped the scholarships could provide more support from Indigenous teachers to children in remote areas. But it was a question from an Indigenous reporter which underlined how Dodson could change debates around constitutional recognition and even a treaty from within the parliament. Asked if he had discussed a treaty with Shorten, Dodson acknowledged it was a \u201cbig discussion\u201d in the Indigenous community, the tension being over whether constitutional recognition should come before a treaty. Dodson said the constitutional referendum and a treaty were \u201cnot mutually exclusive matters\u201d and he would be consulting with communities about whether they wanted a treaty. Dodson has written before that a treaty could still occur between the \u201cAustralian nation state\u201d and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples if constitutional referendum occurred. \u201cWhat is required here is the political will to do so.\u201d It showed how a election can run down many different paths. You only have to hurry up and wait.",
