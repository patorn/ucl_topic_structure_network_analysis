  "body": "Perched on the pews of a church in Koreatown, Los Angeles, a smartly dressed congregation is watching an unusual marriage ceremony unfold. Natasha Khan is gliding up the aisle, red gown trailing behind her, alone. There\u2019s a black lace veil covering her eyes and her head is lowered, as the music that signals The Wizard Of Oz\u2019s Glinda the Good Witch floats out of the speakers. But there\u2019s no groom, only a small cluster of instruments and a candlelit pulpit. \u201cWelcome to my wedding,\u201d she says, almost wryly. But when she lifts her veil and swipes her Omnichord, her diamond-sharp falsetto cutting through stark new song I Do, tears are visible in her eyes. Khan is better known as the musician Bat For Lashes but tonight her guise is the titular leading lady of her next album, The Bride. Her alter ego isn\u2019t exactly living the fairytale. The album\u2019s elaborate narrative details how the bride is abandoned at the altar, her fiance killed on his way there. Devastated, she speeds off in the honeymoon car and embarks on a dusty road trip of self-discovery. As album concepts go, it\u2019s bold, even batshit; another new song, Close Encounters, she confides, is about \u201cmaking love to someone from the other side\u201d.         See the video for Bat For Lashes\u2019 I Do.    A day earlier, as we walk around the shrines that line Hollywood Forever cemetery, Khan couldn\u2019t be any further from doom and gloom. She stops to admire couples buried side by side, and then cheerfully announces that she needs somewhere to relieve herself. \u201cI might have to piss on a grave!\u201d she exclaims, before cantering into the distance where some bushes offer more discreet cover. She returns, bounding across the lawn, her silver heart pendant engraved with \u201cThe Bride\u201d glinting in the sunshine: \u201cI wiped my vagina on a leaf!\u201d   Related: Joanna Newsom, Animal Collective and Bat for Lashes to headline End of the Road 2016    Conventional has never really been Khan\u2019s style. When she first appeared in the mid 2000s, she was the kook in the feather headdress with songs about eagles and crystals. She\u2019s made soundtrack songs with Beck (for Twilight) and Jon Hopkins (How I Live Now) and toured with Radiohead and Coldplay, but she\u2019s never had success in the mainstream sense. Nor does it seem as if she wants to. Despite attempts by her label to encourage her to write a followup to her indie disco hit Daniel, she resisted: sent to work with Lana Del Rey collaborator Justin Parker, she came back with anti-pop piano ballad Laura (it still ended up being Ivor Novello-nominated \u2013 touch\u00e9). Rather, Khan is more of a storyteller than a pop star, one who embraces theatricalism like a freshly flung bouquet. After her 2006 harp-streaked debut Fur And Gold came 2009\u2019s Two Suns and Pearl, the trashy blonde party girl character who helped convey Khan\u2019s transatlantic breakup. Then, in 2012, she ditched the festival hippy accoutrements and appeared naked and defiant, carrying a nude man on her shoulders on the cover of her album The Haunted Man like a dead animal. The last time we saw her, for 2015\u2019s psych-rock Sexwitch project with the producer Dan Carey and the band Toy, she was banshee wailing and releasing her inner, well, sexwitch. Her new album, however, seems like her bravest statement yet. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not a bride?\u201d she laughs, noting the oddness of putting herself in a white dress on the cover in our age of serial dating and fear of commitment. This being Khan, though, the theme runs deep. \u201cTo me, this is the hero\u2019s journey of realising that you have to love yourself before you love someone else. We\u2019ve got to a place where everyone is just waiting for the [next] best thing to come along. I\u2019m guilty of that, too, but is that \u2018best thing\u2019 just an illusion?\u201d The album\u2019s Wizard Of Oz connection comes into focus. \u201cIs it just something behind a curtain and you\u2019re like: \u2018What the fuck? It was there all along?\u2019\u201d she continues. \u201cNow I\u2019m like: \u2018What am I waiting for? What\u2019s this elusive thing that\u2019s going to complete me? Maybe it just doesn\u2019t exist.\u2019 And then you\u2019re like: \u2018Oh, it\u2019s me, ha!\u2019 I need to romance myself, and be excited to be in my body, but sometimes that isn\u2019t enough.\u201d     Bat For Lashes: \u2018I can be simultaneously sexy and a little bit scary\u2019. Photograph: Catie Laffoon     Related: Bat for Lashes - in pictures    Typically, Khan roots her flights of fancy in these relatable contradictions. The Bride may come across like a drive-in B-movie set to a pared-back soundtrack of cupid krautrock, Suicide-style electronic fuzz (on the track Sunday Love), warped 1930s strings, piano laments, desert blues and spectral shoegaze. Lost Highway and This Mortal Coil, faded American sweethearts, the Carpenters, Fleetwood Mac\u2019s Fender Rhodes sound and 90s roadtrip film The Doom Generation are all references, too, in its potent slowburning mix. But the album also wrestles with the complexities of womanhood with an honesty that it feels like few others dare to confront. In particular, Khan scrutinises her contrary attitude towards wedlock. A close encounter with it, aged 18, was dodging an arranged marriage put forward by her father, and she is annoyed by prescribed notions of happy ever after. \u201cWe\u2019re taught about that blissful feeling from a young age, of \u2018I\u2019ve found him, I\u2019ve found the answer to my happiness and I\u2019ll be accepted,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cEven in Sex And The City, the single girls end up with someone.\u201d She\u2019s now 36, and resents how society implies that \u201cyou can\u2019t just be friends with your girlfriends for ever because you\u2019ll be a fucking loser. All that stuff is so anxiety-inducing and so scary as a woman in her 30s.\u201d         See the vieo for Bat For Lashes\u2019 In God\u2019s House.    While we may have to make the most of singledom, though, most of us secretly want the happy ending. Khan sings from that perspective on the candidly sentimental I Do. \u201cWhen I first sang it, I almost couldn\u2019t get through it because I felt so vulnerable,\u201d she admits. \u201cEven though it\u2019s not feminist, I want that feeling of being complete because I\u2019m with someone. It\u2019s such an uncool but desperate longing in all of us.\u201d In fact, she sees marriage as a \u201cheroic decision\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s committing to going through the cycles of life and death, with someone. A lot of people I know seem to want to be staying in that first cycle.\u201d The beginning of a relationship, where it\u2019s all date nights and bonking? \u201cYeah, and that\u2019s just so superficial and sad.\u201d  But Khan says The Bride represents the death of other expectations, too. \u201cIt\u2019s the sad realisation that by the time you get to 35 you can\u2019t have done everything, and that grieving process [for] the woman you thought you might be in a certain area. No matter how badass we want to be there are aspects of our conditioning from generations that have gone before, which are about validating your existence. Whether it be \u2018I\u2019m an amazing career woman\u2019, or \u2018I\u2019m a brilliant mother\u2019, or \u2018I\u2019m married\u2019, whatever. You can only fail because you can\u2019t be everything.\u201d   Related: SEXWITCH \u2013 SEXWITCH: Exclusive album stream    Khan certainly gives the impression of someone who has lots more to do. As well as a piece of music, The Bride is intended to be a book and a film, written and directed by Khan \u2013 a spinoff from a short that she\u2019s already directed called I Do. The album sleeve, meanwhile, confirms in blood red type that she is not only behind the creative concept and art direction but that she wrote and produced it all (with help from Simone Felice of folk-rockers the Felice Brothers and a cast of collaborators).  She has always guided all things Bat For Lashes but, at times, she is \u201cembarrassed\u201d about being seen as strong minded and \u201cbeing big boots\u201d. Yet she sympathises with the sentiments of Bj\u00f6rk, who spoke out last year about the assumption that her male collaborators produce her music (she has just as much input and co-produces it). \u201cIt is annoying when people presume that the guy that you\u2019re working with has done everything,\u201d she says. \u201cI know exactly where I want something panned, I know how much reverb I want on it, or if I want space echo,\u201d she says. \u201cNaively, I think everyone knows how much I do. This time I want to fucking say it.\u201d     Kiss with a fist: Bat For Lashes. Photograph: Neil Krug    Reading over past interviews with Khan, I\u2019ve lost count of the number of times that writers don\u2019t say it. Often her image is the focus: in 2009, the defunct London Paper went right ahead and called her \u201cjust plain hot\u201d. Khan doesn\u2019t see it as a negative. \u201cThis is going to be shocking to you, but I feel so strong about what I\u2019m saying musically, that I don\u2019t mind whatever people want to take from it,\u201d she says. \u201cI know that I cover every angle. And so if on top of that someone says: \u2018Natasha looks sexy\u2019, I\u2019m like, \u2018I\u2019m 36, thank you; it\u2019s hard to be a woman and have your photograph taken at this age.\u2019 You can\u2019t deny that your ego likes that.\u201d  At a time when sexism is on the frontline, few would admit to the undeniable desire we have to be objectified and be in control. But Khan sees no reason why she can\u2019t have both. \u201cI objectify Ryan Gosling and think he\u2019s sexy as hell, but it doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a great actor. If you\u2019re seeing someone\u2019s power sexually, professionally, spiritually, surely that\u2019s a great place for us to be in?\u201d It\u2019s one reason why she wears a slick of Liz-Taylor-in-an-Andy-Warhol-painting blue makeup across her eyelids for The Bride\u2019s album cover and performances. \u201cTo me, it\u2019s the rebel woman\u2019s eye makeup, it\u2019s garish, [it speaks to] the virgin/whore interplay. It\u2019s like: \u2018My makeup\u2019s strippery, but I\u2019m in control.\u2019\u201d   Related: Sexwitch review \u2013 Natasha Khan gives her inner pagan free rein    On the way out of the cemetery we pass the tiny grave of Terry, the dog who played Toto in The Wizard Of Oz, and I remember that Good Witch theme music. What was its significance? There\u2019s something very powerful about the witchy side of women,\u201d Khan says, \u201cand [their] sexual power, and darkness and death and destruction and rebirth \u2013 all these aspects of being a woman. The witch in me doesn\u2019t take any shit.\u201d She\u2019s interested in the ambiguity of femininity (many ideas about which appear in a book that\u2019s inspired her since she was 23, called The Women Who Run With Wolves), where she\u2019s not just the light of the Good Witch, nor the Wicked Witch\u2019s wickedness, but the Technicolor grey area in between. She\u2019s vulnerable and forceful, both on The Bride and in real life. \u201cI can be simultaneously sexy and a little bit scary. That makes me happy because I\u2019m living and breathing in all my 360-degree glory.\u201d She pauses: \u201cBring on 360-degree womanhood!\u201d  The Bride is out on 1 July via Parlophone.
