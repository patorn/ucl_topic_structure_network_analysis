Related: Europe's liberal illusions shatter as Greek tragedy plays on    In a letter - leaked three days before eurozone finance ministers are scheduled to discuss how best to put the crisis-plagued country back on its feet \u2013 IMF chief Christine Lagarde issued her most explicit warning yet: either foreign lenders agree to restructure Greece\u2019s runaway debt or the Washington-based organisation will pull out of rescue plans altogether.  \u201cFor us to support Greece with a new IMF arrangement, it is essential that the financing and debt relief from Greece\u2019s European partners are based on fiscal targets that are realistic because they are supported by credible measures to reachthem,\u201d she wrote, lamenting the lack of structural reforms underlying Athens\u2019 abortive adjustment programme so far. Six years have elapsed since Greece, revealing a deficit that was four times higher than previously thought, received its first loans from a bailout programme that has since exceeded more than \u20ac240bn (\u00a3190bn) in emergency funding. Since a third \u20ac86bn bailout last summer, talks have been largely deadlocked.  Laying bare the differences of view prevailing among those consigned to keep the insolvent nation afloat, Lagarde said it was imperative that a lower primary surplus goal was achieved. \u201cWe do not believe it will be possible to reach a 3.5% of GDP primary surplus [in 2018] by relying on hiking already high taxes levied on a narrow base, cutting excessively discretionary spending and counting on one-off measures as has been proposed in recent weeks.\u201d  The IMF managing director\u2019s intervention came after the surprise decision of the leftist-led government in Athens to put unpopular pension and tax changes to a vote on Sunday. The prospect of such controversial measures being passed so urgently unleashed a wave of civil unrest with a 48-hour general strike by private and public sector unions bringing Greece to a standstill. Unionists said the measures were a \u201cbarbaric\u201d eradication of hard-won rights and would be \u201cthe last nail in the coffin\u201d for workers whose salaries have already been savaged by relentless rounds of gruelling austerity. \u201cThey are the worst so far,\u201d said Odysseus Trivalas, president of the public sector union ADEDY. \u201cAt some point, Greeks won\u2019t be able to take anymore and there will be a social explosion.\u201d Rallies are planned to protest against measures that include instituting a national pension of \u20ac384 a month, raising social security contributions and increasing income tax for high earners. The overhaul of the pension system is among the most contentious reforms to date. In a repeat of the drama that dominated the eurozone last year, Athens faces the spectre of default if its fails to honour maturing European Central Bank bonds and IMF loans in July.  Long overdue rescue loans worth \u20ac5bn are at stake. Receipt of the funds depends on completion of a first progress report, or evaluation, of the economy that has been drawn out for the past nine months and has stalled over lender disagreement. With discord over Athens\u2019 ability to achieve fiscal targets, creditors recently upped the ante, demanding an additional contingency package of \u20ac3.6bn, the equivalent of 2% of GDP.  \u201cWhile creditors fight this out, the political and social situation in Athens will deteriorate,\u201d said Mujtaba Rahman, head of European analysis at risk consultancy Eurasia Group. \u201cTime is running out for creditors to come to an agreement.\u201d The Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, unexpectedly called Sunday\u2019s vote before the conclusion of the negotiations in order to placate creditors and increase his bargaining power at Monday\u2019s meeting of eurozone finance ministers. In a first, the ministers are to discuss Greece\u2019s debt load \u2013 which at more than 180% of GDP by far the highest in Europe \u2013 in addition to fiscal adjustment measures that could amount to 5% of GDP if contingency reforms are taken. The extra policies, as yet unspecified, will only be enacted if targets are not reached but, with its narrow three-seat majority, the Greek government has argued they will never get through parliament.  \u201cTsipras is looking to demonstrate to Greek voters that he and his government have done their part, and that the ball, namely that of debt relief, now lies squarely with the Europeans,\u201d said Rahman.  \u201cThe subliminal message to creditors [in Sunday\u2019s ballot] is therefore this: if you insist on contingency measures, you will end up with the collapse of my government and early elections.\u201d Along with Britain\u2019s 23 June referendum on EU membership, that could end up being a \u201cbig headache\u201d for Europe, he added.",
