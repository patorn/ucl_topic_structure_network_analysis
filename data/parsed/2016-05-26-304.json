  "body": "Both parties spent the morning shovelling their respective elephant poos. Labor\u2019s had been flung around by David Feeney who stumbled through an interview on Sky last night, was caught in a \u201cgotcha\u201d moment when he was not across Labor\u2019s policy on the schoolkids\u2019 bonus and \u2013 the cherry on the cake \u2013 left his talking points behind. Now, he didn\u2019t leave behind classified information or as the Daily Telegraph gleefully put it \u201ca policy blueprint\u201d, we can all tell what the talking points of the day are by listening to the politicians. But, the vultures are circling the \u201c$2.3m investment property\u201d man. Chris Bowen was out of the blocks early to clarify Labor\u2019s position:   We will not be able to afford to bring back the Schoolkids bonus.  The conundrum provided by Barnaby Joyce for his party is a tad more complicated. In the rural debate he linked Australia\u2019s live export ban to an increase in asylum seekers arriving by boat. Coalition figures spent the morning hosing down the implication the Indonesian government was complicit in people smuggling.    Dep PM @Barnaby_Joyce has linked 2011 decision to suspend live exports with more asylum seekers @abcnews #ausvoteshttps://t.co/fmy3IG2oR0\u2014 Matthew Doran (@MattDoran91) May 25, 2016    According to Fairfax Media, Indonesia\u2019s former foreign minister Marty Natalegawa said any suggestion of a link between the ban and people smuggling was \u201cpatently false\u201d. \u201cAt best, it represents an over-analysis of the subject,\u201d said Natalegawa, who was foreign affairs minister at the time. Tony Windsor, who is running against Joyce in the seat of New England, used the statement to warn that Joyce is \u201cunfit to be a leader\u201d.   He has insulted Indonesia, our nearest neighbour.  Malcolm Turnbull barely batted an eyelid, standing metaphorically firmly by the deputy prime minister while physically standing next to him.  You\u2019re being unfair to my good friend, the deputy PM here. Let me be quite clear about this. There is no link between the Indonesian government and people smuggling.    That [banning live exports] did enormous damage to the cattle industry across Australia, but it was an incredible affront to Indonesia. Now, the only point that I want to stress is that our cooperation with Indonesia, in terms of stopping people smuggling, is very, very strong.  It was Joyce\u2019s second day in the headlines after Johnny Depp suggested he was \u201cinbred with a tomato\u201d on Jimmy Kimmel Live! yesterday. News of Depp\u2019s marriage breakdown with Amber Heard broke today but Joyce knows when to hold back the boot.  All seriousness, the one thing I will never revel in is any relationship breakdown, no matter what animosity that might be seen on the airwaves between Mr Depp and myself.  \u2018Until you are an Aboriginal person, don\u2019t criticise me\u2019 Nova Peris abruptly announced her decision not to recontest her Senate seat on Wednesday, and on Thursday, Sorry Day, she delivered an at-times tearful speech on the reasons for the decision. It had been reported she was offered a job with the AFL but Peris said she wanted to spend more time with her children.  Three years ago, I walked into parliament as a first Aboriginal woman and until you are an Aboriginal person do not criticise me for the decisions I have made. This isn\u2019t easy. It\u2019s hard.      Senator Nova Peris breaks down at a press conference at a sorry day event in Darwin @murpharoo @GuardianAus pic.twitter.com/lpJakEI1tp\u2014 Mikearoo (@mpbowers) May 26, 2016    Andrew Bolt suggested in a column Peris could be described as going \u201cwalkabout\u201d \u2013 a racist stereotype \u2013 and Guardian Australia understands there has been anger from some of Peris\u2019s colleagues about her silence on the decision. Peris dismantled any criticism:  I may be leaving but I am leaving on my terms and I want to make this clear \u2013 no one should judge me. I am an inherited Aboriginal women with strengths and resilience that I have had to endure for 45 years. And it\u2019s not easy to wake up every morning and bounce out of bed and pretend that life is fantastic. Because it isn\u2019t. Aboriginal people have no inherited wealth. They have inherited pain.            Nova Peris says \u2018no one should judge me\u2019 as she explains Senate exit    \u2018You know what eating that is called?\u2019 Shorten was in Darwin with Peris when she spoke to media and will be campaigning there for a couple of days while Turnbull was in Rockhampton with none other than Barnaby Joyce.     My current view. Press pack slightly bigger than normal for Darwin @murpharoo pic.twitter.com/XoDKDd4EcV\u2014 Helen Davidson (@heldavidson) May 26, 2016      God has sense of irony. Mal and Barney together on this day!\u2014 Michelle Grattan (@michellegrattan) May 26, 2016    But it was a mutual rescue mission day as Joyce made sure there was not another incarnation of the infamous Tony Abbott onion-eating fiasco. Turnbull was inspecting sweet potatoes when a crowd member asked him if he would like a bite, Joyce heroically intervened.  You know what eating that is called? A possible end to your political career.  The pair had a photo opp with some children and farm animals, forced as politicians are into ignoring the old adage. Four-year-old twins Orlando and Presley Acton were on hand to look cute and comfortable next to Turnbull but were unimpressed, according to AAP. Presley:  This is so silly.  Orlando:  I was scared because those lights were getting in my eyes.  Was the resulting photo worth the pain?     Malcolm Turnbull with Orlando and Presley Acton.

Kyle Sandilands is really taking it to the next level after endorsing Bill Shorten. #auspol pic.twitter.com/WfL0Q89F8k\u2014 Evan Williams (@evanwilliamsss) May 26, 2016    Best of Bowers     Mike Bowers captures a poignant moment between Bill Shorten and Nova Peris, who broke down at a Sorry Day event in Darwin while explaining her decision to leave the Senate. Photograph: Mike Bowers for the Guardian    Further reading  There are lots of ways to say sorry, but Indigenous Australians need a treaty now, Paul Daley reflects on Sorry Day and what Indigenous people really need from whitefellas  Millennials don\u2019t want selfies and emojis, they want change (Fairfax Media) \u201cThe usual approach to millennials rankles this (relatively) youthful voter because too often it is the only attention we get. The cutesy sops are sprinkled within a mainstream political culture that largely ignores young voters and their aspirations, then is surprised when they don\u2019t register to vote, don\u2019t engage or drift away from the major parties and vote for the Greens or someone else entirely.\u201d How I (almost) got the scoop on Turnbull that would have destroyed his career (news.com.au), Charles Firth writes about his encounter with Turnbull when Firth was an aspiring young journo.  And also ... An astrophysicist who has seized every opportunity his parents did not get has given the University of Tasmania its largest ever private donation \u2013 $2.6m. The Examiner has the wonderful story about Dr David Warren.  My dad was a tradesman who spent 30 years painting the white lines on the roads.  He was pulled out of high school at the age of 12 to work in his parent\u2019s guest house, and always resented not having any further education.  Meanwhile, in the rest of the world ... Barack Obama on Friday becomes the first US president to visit Hiroshima \u2013 but he ain\u2019t sorry. Obama will lay flowers at a cenotaph to the 140,000 people who died after the US dropped an atomic bomb on the city in August 1945 but will not apologise for America\u2019s actions during the second world war. Obama is in the area for the G7 and is meeting the Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe, German chancellor Angela Merkel, UK prime minister David Cameron, French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, Canadian prime minister Justin Trudeau and Italian prime minister Matteo Renzi for talks which will cover:  the global economy and trade international terrorism the refugee crisis climate change North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons programme Chinese claims in the South China Sea  And if today was a pop song ... David Feeney and Barnaby Joyce could probably use some cheer right now so here\u2019s the Flaming Lips\u2019 Bad Days dedicated to them. Remember boys, all your bad days will eventually end.
