  "body": "Hands up who knows what a subordinating conjunction is? I\u2019m a journalist and I had no idea what one was, nor have I ever needed to. My seven-year-old son and daughter, however, were expected to explain what one is as part of their homework recently. This is where education is, these days \u2013 by my reckoning, pretty much where it was in the 1950s \u2013 and I\u2019m not alone in fearing it\u2019s going to get even worse. That is why I am taking my children out of school on Tuesday, along with many others. It\u2019s not a decision any parent would take lightly, especially one who strongly believes in the importance of learning (and spends five mornings a week hurrying their children into school). But it\u2019s an act of protest against a government agenda that\u2019s putting undue pressure on children, subjecting them to a narrow, joyless curriculum, shutting out parents\u2019 democratic rights and, ultimately, forcing every school to become an academy, effectively putting all of state education into private, democratically unaccountable hands \u2013 or rather, pockets. If Nicky Morgan\u2019s white paper goes through, all this will come to pass, with no democratic mandate to speak of \u2013 it wasn\u2019t in the Conservative election manifesto.    Parents are the largest contingent in the entire education system, and yet we\u2019ve felt powerless to do anything    \u201cI\u2019ve never yet been on a doorstep where education has come up as an issue,\u201d Morgan said last month. If nothing else, she\u2019s succeeded in making it one. Teachers are already horrified at what\u2019s happening, and are fighting their own battle, when they\u2019re not too exhausted from jumping through the government\u2019s bureaucratic hoops. Most of them are doing their best to shoehorn in the stuff that actually interests and engages children, around the subordinating conjunctions and the rest of the crashingly dull curriculum. Kids are stressed out by the amount of hoop-jumping they\u2019ve got to do too. In a fortnight, like every year 2 pupil in England, my seven-year-olds will do their standard assessment tests, or Sats \u2013 a week of exams prioritising things like grammar, spelling, punctuation and handwriting. Which means matters as trivial as the size of a letter s could define them as academic successes or failures at an age when children in more enlightened countries have barely started school.   Related: Parents to keep children out of school in key stage exam boycott    On top of that, my 11-year-old daughter will be sitting her year 6 Sats, which have been made more difficult this year (you thought subordinating conjunctions were bad, try \u201cfronted adverbials\u201d). She\u2019s coming off the other end of the testing treadmill that primary education has become. Literacy and numeracy are all that counts. If your child excels at art or music or dance or science or poetry or geography or history or critiquing retrograde educational dogma \u2013 tough. Doesn\u2019t count. If there\u2019s any evidence that any of this is a sound approach to education, I\u2019ve yet to see it. Why shouldn\u2019t parents make themselves heard too? We\u2019re the ones whose children are being affected. We\u2019re also the ones compliantly subjecting them to it. We\u2019re also the ones paying for a significant proportion of the education system that we\u2019re against. We\u2019re the largest contingent in the entire education system, and yet we\u2019ve felt powerless to do anything. We will not be subordinated, like conjunctions! Last Saturday, I went to the launch of Parents Defending Education in London \u2013 the name speaks for itself. \u201cOur schools don\u2019t belong to the government,\u201d their launch statement reads. \u201cThey belong to our children, to the community, to the parents, to the teachers and support staff and to future generations.\u201d Michael Rosen persuasively joined the dots of the government\u2019s broad agenda, and others who\u2019d been through forced academisation shared their horror stories.   Related: I\u2019d rather have a Margaret Thatcher state school than a Michael Gove one | John Harris    That was the first time I heard about the proposed \u201cboycott\u201d or \u201cpupils\u2019 strike\u201d on Tuesday, inaugurated by the equally self-explanatory parent group, Let Our Kids Be Kids. Few Londoners seem to be aware of the campaign (though I\u2019m told it has more support in the north and west of England). Nobody in my school was. When I met the headteacher to discuss it, I was expecting a frosty response. It was more a gasp of relief. Teachers and schools need parents to stand alongside them. Parents can say and do things they can\u2019t. At a school parents\u2019 meeting the following night, the response was overwhelmingly positive. Dozens of us are taking our children out of school. We\u2019re planning on getting together in the park for a day of \u201cfun learning\u201d \u2013 painting, bug hunting, that sort of thing. Understandably, many parents are unable to do so as they\u2019re working. Others, ironically, felt that taking their children out of school would detract from their preparations for their Sats. A few felt it would be \u201cpoliticising\u201d their kids. But virtually all parents not taking part in the boycott still pledged to sign letters of support for the action. We\u2019re all in this together. Incidentally, the definition of a \u201csubordinating conjunction\u201d, if you\u2019re wondering, is a conjunction (that is \u201ca part of speech that connects words, sentences, phrases, or clauses\u201d) that \u201cconnects an independent clause and a dependent clause, and also introduces adverb clauses.\u201d Any seven-year-old could tell you that. For example: I\u2019m taking my children out of school for one day so that they get a better academic future than the one Nicky Morgan is mapping out for them.",
