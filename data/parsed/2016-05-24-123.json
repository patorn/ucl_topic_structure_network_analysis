  "body": "Dave Mirra, the BMX icon who killed himself in February aged 41, had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, the chronic brain disease that has been found in dozens of former NFL players, a University of Toronto doctor has concluded. Several other neuropathologists confirmed the diagnosis, according to ESPN. Mirra is the first BMX rider to be diagnosed with CTE, a disease tied to repeated brain trauma and associated with symptoms such as memory loss, depression and progressive dementia. Mirra was found dead in Greenville, South Carolina on 4 February from a self-inflicted gunshot wound.   Related: Concussion questions haunt BMX after Dave Mirra's death    The tau protein deposits found in Mirra\u2019s brain were indistinguishable from the kind that have been found in the brains of former football and hockey players with CTE, Dr Lili-Naz Hazrati, the Toronto neuropathologist, told ESPN The Magazine. \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell the difference,\u201d she said. \u201cThe trauma itself defines the disease, not how you got the trauma. It\u2019s assumed it is related to multiple concussions that happened years before.\u201d Mirra, a BMX legend who won numerous X Games gold medals, fractured his skull when a car hit him at age 19, and he tried boxing after his retirement from BMX. But he also endured countless concussions during a glittering career. Many in BMX have shared their concerns over the effects of the concussions most riders have sustained at some point in their career. Hazrati shared her findings on Mirra\u2019s brain with additional US and Canadian neuropathologists. Each confirmed Hazrati\u2019s diagnosis of CTE. \u201cIt validates what we have been thinking about brain injuries in boxers and football players,\u201d Hazrati said. \u201cThe key is brain injury. Regardless of how you get it, through BMX or hockey, you are at risk for this.\u201d Mirra\u2019s wife Lauren was told of Mirra\u2019s CTE in March. She told ESPN how she noticed his personality change in the last year of his life. \u201cI started to notice changes in his mood. And then it quickly started to get worse,\u201d she said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t able to be present in any situation or conversation, so it was hard to be in a relationship with him to any degree. He was lost. I looked straight through him on a few occasions. And I was like, \u2018Where are you? Where are you? What is wrong?\u2019 \u201cThis is the beginning of bringing awareness. It would be amazing if this is something we can detect in life one day. If we can detect it, prevent it, stop it, let\u2019s do all of the above.\u201d Mirra will be inducted into the National BMX Hall of Fame in Chula Vista, California, on 11 June. He will also be honored during this June\u2019s X Games in Austin, Texas, with a new event named for him, the Dave Mirra BMX Park Best Trick competition. The winner will be awarded the Mirra Golden Pedal and prize money. ESPN owns and produces the X Games, which had no comment on Mirra\u2019s diagnosis.  In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.",
