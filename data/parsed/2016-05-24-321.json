  "body": "Flume is holding the vinyl copy of his new album, Skin, for the very first time. \u201cIt arrived today,\u201d he says down the line from New York, where the Australian producer \u2013 aka 24-year-old Harley Streten \u2013 is based while speaking to global press. \u201cIt\u2019s very satisfying that it\u2019s tangible. It\u2019s all the last few years\u2019 work in a nice, slick-looking package.\u201d   Related: Moby: \u2018There were bags of drugs, I was having sex with a stranger\u2019    Creating the contents of that package proved a maddeningly difficult task for Streten. His self-titled debut album of lush, mid-tempo electronica, initially conceived as \u201cheadphone music\u201d, was released in 2012 and became a critical and commercial smash. Flume sold loads and won eight Aria awards, making him an international draw and anointing Streten as a totem of his generation. So when he returned home to Sydney\u2019s northern beaches after years of touring, he decompressed the way any early 20-something might: he partied. \u201cIt was the first time in my life I had money and status and independence,\u201d he says. \u201cI moved out of home, got my own place, and just had a mad time.\u201d  He played the odd show, and delivered remixes for the likes of Lorde, Arcade Fire and Sam Smith. But when it came time to work on new tunes, Streten couldn\u2019t make anything he liked. \u201cIt was incredibly stressful,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I made it stressful. I\u2019m a perfectionist. I put a lot of pressure on myself to have my music at a certain quality, and that wasn\u2019t a positive thing. Skin was a totally different experience than the first record. It didn\u2019t just come.\u201d    As soon as I got away from it all I was able to write again  Harley Streten     Streten decamped to Los Angeles for three months to shake out ideas. At one point the pressure got so intense he blew off his own birthday and fled to Mexico. \u201cI was frustrated,\u201d he recalls. \u201cSo I got up super early and flew to Mexico on my own. Hired a car and went to the beach. Had tequilas with this old couple at the hotel and didn\u2019t even tell them it was my birthday. And as soon as I got away from it all I was able to write again.\u201d The new album is easily traced to Streten\u2019s sharp ascent \u2013 it sounds like all emotions at once. Where his first album sustained a mood, Skin violently generates then slashes through them with the sonic grandeur of a producer discovering new powers. 3 surrounds an escalating siren with crushed drums and disorientating samples; the metallic clang of Numb & Getting Colder suggests a dying Transformer trying to fit through a car wash. But there\u2019s beauty, too. Children\u2019s chatter and forlorn piano wash through, When Everything Was New, and affecting album closer, Tiny Cities, has guest vocalist Beck pining: \u201cCan I, should I, find my way home?\u201d               Flume\u2019s second album, Skin. Photograph: Bossy Music    \u201cIt\u2019s been a crazy couple of years of learning life,\u201d says Streten. \u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s reflected in the music \u2013 a million per cent. It makes sense. But if it wasn\u2019t such an intense time the music would have turned out different. And I wouldn\u2019t have pushed myself anywhere near as hard.\u201d He does think the difficult birth bodes well. \u201cWhen this album cycle comes to an end, I\u2019m going to have a lot of music already done,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m treating it like a proper job. Now I\u2019m a little more: \u2018Nah I\u2019m not going to the afterparty. I\u2019m going to do yoga in the morning and write some beats.\u2019\u201d Streten nearly sounds relaxed \u2013 he has just sold 144,000 tickets on the first day of the Skin world tour going on sale. But only nearly. \u201cI want to feel like this for the rest of my career,\u201d he says. \u201cEnjoy it. But always keep working.\u201d  \u2022 Skin is out 27 May",
