  "body": "In Oscar Wilde\u2019s final years, did life imitate art? Several plays might have predicted a jollier, tidier end to the man\u2019s life. But his fairy tales and novel suggest a darker finish, in which beauty and pleasure yield to fates far crueler. That\u2019s the concern of David Hare\u2019s 1998 play, The Judas Kiss, now revived at the Brooklyn Academy of Music after stops in London and Toronto. A play set in two acts, the first occurs in a London hotel room after the first of three trials that would lead to Wilde\u2019s imprisonment on charges of \u201cgross indecency\u201d and the second following his release from two years of hard labor and his reunion with his lover, Lord Alfred Douglas or Bosie, in a village near Naples.  The play faltered in its first New York outing, a feat of miscasting (with the imposing Liam Neeson as the famed aesthete) and its appearance alongside two somewhat more experimental approaches to the material, Tom Stoppard\u2019s melancholy and fanciful The Invention of Love and Mois\u00e9s Kaufman\u2019s documentary drama Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde. But now the play has returned with Rupert Everett in the lead role and a somewhat less literal-minded production from the Australian director Neil Armfield.  Everett is of course the chief attraction, both because of his obvious sympathy for Wilde and the physical transformation he has enacted to play him. Here, his lithe figure has been bloated into stoutness, his handsome face powdered and swollen until it resembles a pale side of beef. In the second act, it comes to look like a death\u2019s head, with dark eyes shining out of the otherwise stolid features. His is an absorbing portrayal, compelling in its immobility.     The Judas Kiss explores Wilde\u2019s penchant for Christian self-sacrifice. Photograph: Richard Termine/Photo by Richard Termine     Some of the problems that plagued the initial run are still present. Wilde\u2019s passivity has a way of dulling dramatic tension. In the first half, the likelihood that he will flee from prosecution, as advised by his friend and former lover Robert Ross (Cal MacAninch), seems slim, particularly as Wilde\u2019s \u201cseminal decision\u201d in the scene is to eat his lunch. In the second, he leaves any decisions up to others. And while Bosie, as played by the often nude Charlie Rowe, is undeniably attractive, his callow narcissism diminishes the poignancy of Wilde\u2019s relationship with him. Obviously, this is part of Hare\u2019s point, that a man so sharp of mind could be so foolish of heart and it emphasizes, in Hare\u2019s reading, Wilde\u2019s penchant for Christian self-sacrifice. Still, a few redeeming qualities for Bosie, pulchritude aside, would not have gone amiss.   But there\u2019s pleasure and substance to be found here, too. Many of the quips sound a lot like Wilde \u2014 in part, because many are from Wilde. Others don\u2019t, as when he describes his appearance as \u201cthat of a senior pederastic Anglican bishop who has been locked all night in a distillery,\u201d yet they\u2019re amusing all the same. And for all Wilde\u2019s inactivity, the play does ultimately present his downfall as a kind of tragic inevitability. As Hare\u2019s Wilde explains in the first act, the hamartia of hopeless love has already doomed him. \u201cI am cast in a role,\u201d he says. \u201cMy story has already been written. How I choose to play it is a mere matter of taste.\u201d",
