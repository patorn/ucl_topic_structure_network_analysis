  "body": "Lindy West (G2, 10 May) is right that there is no \u201cperfect body\u201d and that the search for it may warp some women\u2019s lives. But it is equally true that many, many women\u2019s (and men\u2019s) lives are warped and shortened by morbid obesity and its respiratory, cardiac, muscular and skeletal consequences, its impact on babies, born and unborn, and loved ones. Some of us, like Ms West perhaps, may be built bigger than average. None of us needs to be morbidly obese and there are no excuses for being so.Dr Rachel EsterWootton Bassett, Wiltshire \u2022 There\u2019s no need for Jeremy Hayes (Letters, 10 May) to leave the EU. A European commission press release of 10 November 2015 tells us: \u201cThe European court of auditors has today given the EU accounts a clean bill of health for the eighth year in a row. Both the revenue side and administrative expenditure are free from significant errors.\u201d It would appear that his information is somewhat out of date.Malcolm HolmesBirmingham \u2022 Considering that David Cameron dodged a one-to-one TV debate during the 2015 general election campaign (an overlooked factor in his success), it would be pretty surprising if he agreed to one now (Polly Toynbee, 10 May).Stephen BaileyWest Mansfield, Nottinghamshire \u2022 Ian Rankin says: \u201cI can\u2019t do anything until I have a title\u201d (Review, 7 May). Might I suggest, at the very least, Sir Ian Rankin. Or why not Viscount Rankin of Cardenden. That would get ink on his page, I\u2019m sure.Barney MacFarlaneEastbourne, East Sussex \u2022 I cheered when I read of Graham Vick\u2019s speech at the Royal Philharmonic Society awards (Report, 11 May). Opera\u00a0belongs to us all, enriches our lives in countless different ways and as such should not just be available to a wealthy elite.Meirion BowenLondon \u2022 Re Ottolenghi\u2019s aubergine recipe, pasta alla norma, on Saturday (Weekend, 7 May), amazingly we had all the ingredients in our cupboard. Made and served to friends Sunday. Fabulous, thank you. Deborah Saville Swineshead, Bedford \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
