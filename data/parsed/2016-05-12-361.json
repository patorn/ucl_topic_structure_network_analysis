  "body": "The Communist party\u2019s best-selling tabloid has accused the British media of \u201chyping up\u201d the Queen\u2019s comments about \u201crude\u201d Chinese officials and spreading malicious \u201cgossip\u201d in order to hurt ties between Beijing and London.  Beijing would not confirm whether its \u201cgolden\u201d friendship with Britain was still alive on Wednesday after the Queen was caught on camera lamenting the behaviour of Chinese officials involved in President Xi Jinping\u2019s state visit to Britain in 2015.    Related: When it comes to China, the Queen\u2019s gaffe reveals some inconvenient truths | Mary Dejevsky    \u201cThey were very rude to the ambassador,\u201d the Queen complained to the senior police chief responsible for policing the event, describing the Chinese conduct as \u201cextraordinary\u201d.  A spokesperson for China\u2019s foreign ministry declined to say whether the special relationship \u2013 supposedly cemented when Xi visited Britain in October \u2013 was still intact in the wake of the Queen\u2019s criticism.  In a prominent editorial on Thursday, the Chinese language Global Times newspaper hit back at criticism of its country\u2019s officials, blaming the controversy on the British press. \u201cThe western media loves gossip more than anything else,\u201d the editorial claimed.  The editorial \u2013 which was headlined, \u2018British media hypes up the Queen\u2019s private conversation, the whole world lauds the UK\u2019s gossiping skills\u2019 \u2013 claimed Fleet Street had reacted to the Queen\u2019s comments as if it had discovered \u201ctreasure\u201d. But such \u201chyped up\u201d coverage would not affect the \u201cgolden\u201d relationship between Britain and China, the Global Times argued. \u201cThe \u2018golden era\u2019 of China-UK relations is built on profound bilateral interests. Rationality has a unique place in the long-histories of these two nations.\u201d \u201cIt is perfectly normal that the closer the relationship, the more friction there will be,\u201d the editorial continued. \u201cIt isn\u2019t a big deal for your friend to complain a little bit in private. I presume Chinese officials make jokes about British officials in private too.\u201d The editorial added: \u201cThe West in modern times has risen to the top and created a brilliant civilisation, but their media is full of reckless \u2018gossip fiends\u2019 who bare their fangs and brandish their claws and are very narcissistic, retaining the bad manners of \u2018barbarians\u2019. \u201cAs they experience constant exposure to the 5,000 years of continuous Eastern civilisation, we believe they will make progress\u201d in terms of their manners, it said.  The Global Times was one of the only party-controlled newspapers not to completely ignore the episode on Thursday, suggesting Beijing, which has also blocked BBC World reports on the subject in China, hoped to downplay the potentially embarrassing episode. The Beijing Youth Daily broadsheet ran a prominent front page story about a mass brawl between Chinese football players but there was no room anywhere for a report on the spat between Buckingham Palace and Beijing. The editorial pages of the Global Times\u2019 English language edition were also bereft of any mention of Her Majesty\u2019s dim view of Chinese officialdom. In a brief news story the tabloid described Xi\u2019s state visit as a \u201cgreat success\u201d and noted that investment deals worth $61.6bn were signed.  One of the few mainland news outlets to cover the Queen\u2019s comments was Toutiao, a popular news website and app. In an online article it attributed the Queen\u2019s anger to \u201ccultural and political differences\u201d between China and Britain. \u201cChina\u2019s state visit appeared to have been very successful,\u201d it reported. \u201cBut it has taken us some time to understand the discomfort between the two sides. Overall, Britain\u2019s discomfort can be mainly attributed to differences of culture and political views.\u201d Unlike China\u2019s heavily controlled media, US news groups offered their readers extensive coverage of the Queen\u2019s thoughts on Chinese diplomacy.  Royal expert Ingrid Seward told the Los Angeles Times she suspected the footage had been deliberately leaked by an enraged royal family.  \u201cShe must have known what was going on,\u201d said Seward, the author of a biography about the Queen. \u201cI can\u2019t think it was a mistake ... I assume that she felt extremely strongly that the Chinese treated her ambassador badly,\u201d she added. \u201cI know she hates rudeness.\u201d Asked if China believed the leak had been deliberate, foreign ministry spokesperson Lu Kang said: \u201cI think you should refer your questions to those who put the footage on the website.\u201d Additional reporting by Christy Yao",
