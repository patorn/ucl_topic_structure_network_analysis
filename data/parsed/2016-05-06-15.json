  "body": "The town once famed for \u201cbuilding the world\u201d has fallen on hard times and often feels a forgotten place these days but, on Saturday lunchtime, Middlesbrough will be right back in the international spotlight. \u201cWe\u2019ll be watched everywhere on the planet,\u201d Aitor Karanka says. \u201cThe whole world wants to see our game.\u201d Considering that Boro\u2019s Basque manager is not given to hyperbole, his words serve as a reminder that Brighton & Hove Albion\u2019s visit to Teesside represents the highest of high-stakes fixtures.   Related: Middlesbrough v Brighton: Championship promotion decider \u2013 live!    It will determine not only the identity of the Championship\u2019s second automatic promotion slot but has been dubbed a competition for \u201cthe biggest ever prize in world football\u201d by the accountancy giant Deloitte. The tension threatens to be almost unbearable. Next season\u2019s gargantuan Premier League television deal means promoted teams stand to benefit by a minimum of \u00a3170m \u2013 even the bottom club will receive just under \u00a3100m in broadcast and merit money followed by about \u00a375m in parachute payments. Whereas a point would guarantee Boro promotion, for Chris Hughton\u2019s Brighton to avoid the dreaded play-offs and join Burnley in the top tier a win is required at a packed, raucous Riverside Stadium where locals are desperate for a reason to celebrate at the end of an awful few months. The loss of 2,200 jobs at nearby Redcar as the coke ovens and furnaces went cold and 170 years of steelmaking came to an end last autumn has proved a dreadful blow to an area in urgent need of the economic boost invariably provided by the presence of a top-flight football team. As local poet Ian Horn so evocatively wrote: \u201cWe built the world. Every Metropolis came from Ironopolis.\u201d But nowadays few people outside the north-east remember that Ironopolis was Middlesbrough\u2019s nickname during those heady days when the town set the international price of iron and steel and the architects of Australia\u2019s Sydney Harbour Bridge demanded that its components be designed and manufactured on Teesside. Now, though, Karanka\u2019s players are on a mission to restore Middlesbrough to prominence. \u201cIt\u2019s not a normal game,\u201d Grant Leadbitter, the captain and key central midfielder, says. \u201cThere\u2019ll be that little bit of fear but it\u2019s also an exciting game. We have to stay calm. You have to play with the right intensity but also with your head. I\u2019m looking forward to it.\u201d Thanks to satellite television so, too, are football fans across the globe, with particular interest centred in Kiryat Tiv\u2019on. Situated on the road to Nazareth amid the beguiling beauty of the hills of northern Israel, the town is home to the family of Tomer Hemed, Brighton\u2019s principal striker and a big threat to Boro\u2019s dreams. While Hemed \u2013 whose likely battle with Dani Ayala promises to prove an intriguing subplot \u2013 has scored 17 goals in 43 league appearances for Hughton\u2019s side this season, Boro have been galvanised by the January arrival of the Southampton loanee Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez. His creative impact is likely to be closely monitored in Fray Bentos, the Uruguayan\u2019s birthplace. Sitting close to the border with Argentina and 192 miles north of Montevideo, the city\u2019s residents will welcome a chance to remind everyone that they should be known for more than a brand of corned beef. \u201cIt\u2019s probably as big a game as you\u2019re going to get,\u201d the Sunderland-born Leadbitter says. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those games that, when you\u2019re growing up, you want to be involved in. When I lead the team out it\u2019ll be special. Our fans have been through a lot but, hopefully, it will be a special day for them.\u201d Back in December, down on the south coast, Boro ended Brighton\u2019s unbeaten beginning to the season with an emphatic 3-0 victory and looked set to canter away with the title. Instead Karanka and his players suffered a winter wobble culminating in March with an extraordinarily acrimonious dressing-room altercation between manager and first-teamers. It left Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s former assistant at Real Madrid temporarily on gardening leave and he missed a defeat at Charlton. Steve Gibson, Boro\u2019s owner, is believed to have come close to sacking Karanka but reprieved a coach whose future remains uncertain. That decision has been vindicated by Boro\u2019s subsequent nine-game unbeaten run but the precise nature of the truce is opaque. \u201cSame as it\u2019s always been,\u201d Leadbitter says, straight-batting a question about the squad\u2019s relationship with Karanka, who remains strangely noncommittal about the future. \u201cIf one day I\u2019m a Premier League coach, I\u2019ll see how that feels,\u201d the 42-year-old manager says. \u201cI don\u2019t like to say what will happen if this or that occurs \u2013 but I have three more years on my contract.\u201d Hughton, 15 years Karanka\u2019s senior, is still adored by the Newcastle United players he led to promotion in 2010 and Boro cannot afford to underestimate the former Tottenham full-back\u2019s nous. \u201cBrighton\u2019s progress has been amazing,\u201d says Karanka, whose side lost last season\u2019s play-off final to Norwich. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect Brighton to be challenging for promotion so, for me, Chris Hughton\u2019s been the best manager in the league this season. He arrived there [in December 2014] when they were in a difficult position and he\u2019s done an amazing job.\u201d Hughton has made some astute signings, including not only Hemed and his fellow Israel international Beram Kayal but the Frenchman Anthony Knockaert. The former Leicester winger\u2019s arrival from Standard Li\u00e8ge in January has imbued the promotion push with fresh impetus and Karanka is anxious that George Friend, his influential left-back, passes a fitness test on a suspect hamstring. If Friend\u2019s absence would hurt Boro, Brighton must make do without their suspended centre-half, Lewis Dunk, against Ram\u00edrez, Jordan Rhodes, Stewart Downing et al. \u201cMiddlesbrough are the best side who\u2019ve come down to the Amex Stadium this season,\u201d Hughton says. \u201cTheir investment and recruitment have been very big and very good and they\u2019ve got the quality to show for it. We have to win there and we know how big a task it is but it certainly doesn\u2019t frighten us.\u201d   Related: Where did the season go wrong for your club?    Whereas it is only 10 years since Boro faced Sevilla in the Uefa Cup final and seven since they were relegated from the Premier League, Brighton\u2019s last spell in the top division ended in 1983. Since then the economic power of southern England has begun to be reflected by improving fortunes among several of its clubs and the crumbling Goldstone Ground has been replaced by the 30,000-plus capacity Amex \u2013 along with a training ground the envy of many leading European coaches. Yet if Hughton feels his side are more than ready to \u201ctake that one final step\u201d into the big time he will meet implacable opposition on Teesside. \u201cThis club\u2019s in the wrong division,\u201d Leadbitter says. \u201cWe want to put it back on the map.\u201d Significantly, reproductions of Stanford\u2019s General Map of the World (published 1920) reveal Middlesbrough to be one of only a handful of British towns and cities deemed worthy of naming by the cartographer. Ironopolis\u2019s star may have subsequently waned to the point where some Brighton residents might struggle to place Teesside inside a blank outline of England but, for 90 minutes on Saturday, football followers from Kiryat Tiv\u2019on to Fray Bentos will regard it as the epicentre of the world game.",
