  "body": "The TV series based on cult comic book Preacher is to launch in the UK on Amazon\u2019s Prime streaming service from Monday. The episodes will be released by Amazon in the UK, Austria, Germany and Japan the day after they air in the US on AMC, with the pilot available from Monday and the next episode two weeks later, and then each Monday thereafter. The Sony Pictures Television series is co-produced by avid comic book fan and Knocked Up actor Seth Rogen, and the showrunner is Breaking Bad\u2019s Sam Catlin.    Related: Jeremy Clarkson's Amazon show to be called The Grand Tour    Two of the leads, Agent Carter\u2019s Dominic Cooper and Joseph Gilgun of This is England, are from the UK. The other main character is played by Ruth Negga, who also starred in Channel 4\u2019s offbeat superhero series Misfits with Gilgun.  The original comic series is part of DC\u2019s adult comic book stable Vertigo. The adaptation stars Cooper as a preacher from Texas called Jesse who gains the power to command people to do whatever he tells them. He teams up with Gilgun\u2019s Cassidy, an Irish vampire, and Negga as Tulip, Jesse\u2019s assassin ex-girlfriend. \u201cPreacher is one of the most ambitious and highly anticipated new series of the year, and exactly the kind of show we want to bring our Prime members around the world,\u201d said Amazon worldwide television acquisition vice-president Brad Beale. The show joins Amazon\u2019s growing list of exclusive shows in the UK, many of which have been acquired from US cable networks, including Mr Robot, which originally aired on the USA Network and returns for a second series later this year, and Outlander, which was first shown on Starz.",
