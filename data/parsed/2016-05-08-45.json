As it turns out, the new mood in the Premier League \u2013 with emboldened outsiders hellbent on breaking the status quo \u2013 visibly loaded the pressure on both Manchester City and Arsenal. Missing out is not easily tolerated. When this harum-scarum duel was poised at 2-2 with 10 minutes left to swing it, both Manuel Pellegrini and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger stood upright and anxious at the edge of their technical areas. They crossed and uncrossed their arms, then paced in small circles. It was like a weird form of synchronised managerial stress dancing. Both were swimming in the Champions League qualification deep end and at the end of it all Wenger emerged the stronger. Arsenal will avoid the awkwardness of a qualification match during a truncated tournament summer as long as they avoid defeat when they host Aston Villa next Sunday. That would tie up a top-three position. Of course such are the confounding oddities of this season that Wenger would not take that for granted. He spoke afterwards of the unpredictability of it all. \u201cLook at the results,\u201d he pointed out, eyebrow arched. \u201cWe need to keep the focus.\u201d   Related: Ars\u00e8ne Wenger: Arsenal playing in a \u2018very difficult climate\u2019 at Emirates    As for City, matters are more perilous. Manchester United can bypass City at the last hurdle if Louis van Gaal\u2019s team are able to profit in their final two games. That realisation darkened the mood at a sun-drenched Etihad. Some cursory boos at the final whistle were mixed with tepid applause from the City fans as the majority streamed away. It was a downbeat farewell to Pellegrini from the crowd here as they prepare for Pep Guardiola. By the time the team and their soon-to-be-former manager returned to the pitch for an awkward bow and a farewell wave, there were only a few thousand fans left. The fondness for Pellegrini was there \u2013 the message \u201cGracias Manuel\u201d was unfurled on a sizeable pale blue flag \u2013 but it had the feel of a club needing a fresh chapter. The lap of appreciation was like a flat, lukewarm glass of beer that had been forgotten in the sun for too long. Some wag described it perfectly as \u201clapathy\u201d. City did show flashes of the kind of intensity that will be expected next season but nowhere near enough and not of the sufficiently concentrated variety. Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Kevin De\u00a0Bruyne showed the fleet-footedness and drive to slash low strikes beyond the reach of Petr Cech. But Arsenal responded each time. Some of Wenger\u2019s attacking players who have been on the struggling side of erratic over the second half of this season found a moment to lift their team. Olivier Giroud broke his goal drought, Alexis S\u00e1nchez raised his game for one critical attack and briefly summoned his most dynamic style to equalise. Even Theo Walcott came on and looked bright on the right-hand side. Meanwhile Danny Welbeck waits anxiously for news on the state of his knee. The tone of Manchester City is expected to feel distinctly sharpened by the time they return at the start of next season for life under Se\u00f1or Guardiola. But in which European tournament? City sat second in the table when the club made the announcement in early February that the coveted Catalan would canter into town. Since then they have drifted domestically to the extent they are scrabbling for fourth place, having handed the initiative to the neighbours. To borrow a phrase once made famous down the road, it is squeaky-bum time. Sooner or later the penny has to drop that the general obsession with Champions League qualification as a minimum requirement is not a realistic one for too many clubs to hold dear. Irrespective of financial investment or status of personnel, it is not practical.   Related: Ars\u00e8ne Wenger reveals he rejected Real, Barcelona and Manchester City    Given the magnificent Leicester example, the statements of intent made by Tottenham under Mauricio Pochettino and more recently Liverpool under J\u00fcrgen Klopp, and the number of clubs who will be expecting a considerable improvement on their Premier League campaigns next season (the managers who will pick up at Chelsea, Manchester City and whoever is in charge at Manchester United know that all too well) it does not require a mathematical genius to work out that there is basically not enough success to go around. Champions League qualification, and titles, cannot possibly be bestowed on everyone who aims for the big prizes. The broader question as to what in English football qualifies as success does seem to be changing by necessity. Pellegrini would not throw in the towel in terms of a top-four finish at this point. He remains proud of taking City to the Champions League semi-finals and regards that as an achievement. Meanwhile, over in Germany, the current Bayern Munich manager won a farewell Bundesliga this weekend (his third in succession) after enduring the apparent ignominy of departing without ever winning the Champions League during his stay in Germany. It seems bizarre to think Wenger\u2019s first qualification for the Champions League with Arsenal, during his first full campaign in England in 1997-98, coincided with Manchester City\u2019s relegation to English football\u2019s third tier. Wenger is closing in on his 19th consecutive ticket to Europe\u2019s elite party. It may not be enough for some of his detractors but maybe it is not to be sniffed at after all.",
