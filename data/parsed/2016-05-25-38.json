This happened on Monday when X-Files star Gillian Anderson retweeted a poster made by a fan, imagining her as the new 007: the actor photoshopped in front of that big iconic whirly gun barrel and the official logo pasted at the bottom. Anderson added a caption: \u201cIt\u2019s Bond. Jane Bond.\u201d The web went wild. Already stirred by the smackdown between Tom Hiddleston and Idris Elba \u2013 the chief contenders to inherit Daniel Craig\u2019s tux \u2013 the sudden arrival of a new hat in the ring proved to be the touchpaper. Anderson\u2019s tweet was liked 30,000 times.   Related: As Cannes closes, a new breed of female lead emerges: empowered, careerist\u00a0\u2013and 'gender-neutral'    Yet not only do I find myself stubbornly unshaken by the whole Bond casting hoo-hah, I am also baffled by this kneejerk cheerleading for the prospect of a woman taking on a role that involves murdering your way round the globe, bashing and backstabbing, boozy and ruthless. Equality is obviously marvellous; gender-blind casting, where appropriate, also. But simply transferring unreconstructed attributes from one sex to another seems retrograde. Surely many classic Bond character traits are what we\u2019re trying to move away from? Not just the violence and shades of sadism. Puns too, especially lecherous ones, aren\u2019t necessarily a skill women should seek to appropriate. The campaign to make Bond female sits oddly with the vision of a world in which women leaders effect progress by adopting an approach not previously applied. Shouldn\u2019t we be cooking up new heroines, rather than just sticking old ones in a frock? At Cannes this year, there was much evidence of the former. More than half the films in competition had female leads, most of them not defined chiefly by their love lives but by their \u2013 admittedly often wacky \u2013 professions. Kristen Stewart was a psychic personal shopper seeking a sign from her dead twin; Jena Malone a makeup artist who moonlights at the morgue to get her necrophiliac kicks; Charlize Theron a fragrant doctor eager to eliminate inequality in Africa; and Isabelle Huppert the chief executive of a video games company.     Isabelle Huppert on the gun range in Elle. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo    Huppert was starring in Elle, an audacious masterpiece whose hot-potato plot (woman is relatively blase about sexual assault) masks an empowering and radical core. Huppert\u2019s character operates in cool defiance of what other people perceive her to be. She has nerve, courage and as much agency over her own fate as possible. She is extraordinary, exhilarating and endlessly aspirational: Huppert blithely shopping for pepper spray; at the gun range; parking badly and laughing; masturbating while watching her neighbour construct a nativity scene in the garden with his wife; delivering brutal home truths to her son as she chucks her own mother\u2019s ashes over a bridge. Elle is based on Oh\u2026, Philippe Djian\u2019s novel. All attempts to make it in the US failed because, said its director, Paul Verhoeven, \u201cno American actress would take on such an amoral movie\u201d. This is exactly the sort of person who ought to be held up as a role model. Strong women, like strong men, aren\u2019t necessarily nice or kind. What makes them effective assassins or even good leaders may not be admirable human qualities. Sentimentality isn\u2019t always to be sneered at. In the context of transatlantic cinema Huppert\u2019s character is a complete anomaly. In most movies, if a woman is in a position of professional power, her veneer must at some point crack, leaving tears and oestrogen to leak freely. Curiously, it is in comedies that female bosses are both most present \u2013 it is an inherently funny set-up, after all \u2013 and shown to be most vulnerable. So, in The Devil Wears Prada, the ferocious magazine chief played by Meryl Streep is beset by secret misery: unfaithful husband, tricky kids, wig issues. Once she\u2019s wept this out to her beleaguered assistant, she\u2019s free to be less of a bitch. In The Intern, made only last year, the actor who played Streep\u2019s assistant, Anne Hathaway, is the chief executive of an online start-up who cannot cope\u00a0without being able to mine the wisdom and emulate the authority of a kindly older executive (Robert De Niro). In The Proposal, Sandra Bullock\u2019s inhuman editor leaves female employees shaking, and so emasculates her male\u00a0secretary she actually asks him to marry her. I was born just after the Tories returned to power in 1979, so I grew up in a country dominated by one very strong woman. \u201cYou had your ideal girl, I couldn\u2019t match her / I didn\u2019t want to: it was Mrs Thatcher,\u201d sang Victoria Wood \u2013 something of a motto for a lot of people my age. Wood was much more my kind of pin-up. A strong woman defined by moxie, not her machismo. The future of Britain\u2019s most enduring film franchise does not lie in its hero having a gender reassignment, 64 years after Ian Fleming first dreamed him up. Nor ought it to. Action films \u2013 and the people who take their cues from the movies \u2013 deserve more than second-hand stories and belated sex changes. Even fantasy needs some measure of credibility in a contemporary world. That\u2019s why, at this stage, James Bond could do with Elba. And if women want something similar \u2013 well, Elle is a great place to start.",
