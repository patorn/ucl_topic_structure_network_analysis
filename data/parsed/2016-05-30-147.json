  "body": "The long-awaited return of Top Gear was watched by an average of just 4.4 million viewers as many critics lamented the decision of the new cast and producers to stick to the motoring show\u2019s tried and tested format.  Even the peak audience of 4.7 million figure came in well below the 5 million Evans said would stop him being \u201cdisappointed\u201d. He said at a press launch last week: \u201cFive million-plus would be great, after that it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d The figures are more than 2 million down on the average of the last series starring Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond, who have signed a deal to make a new show for Amazon\u2019s video service called The Grand Tour that will debut this autumn.

However, the show did manage to win its 8pm slot with a 23% share, ahead of the Antiques Roadshow on BBC1 and the Soap Awards on ITV, both of which attracted just under 4 million viewers. The BBC said on Monday morning it was also the most watched programme on iPlayer. Reviewers zeroed in on the BBC\u2019s decision not to introduce major changes to the show format. The Mail was scathing, describing the revamp as \u201cat best like watching a Top Gear tribute band performing one of those unfunny celebrity sketches on Comic Relief\u201d.  \u201cIt was so bad you could practically hear the champagne corks popping at Amazon HQ.\u201d  Andrew Billen in the Times was not convinced by the rapport between Evans and LeBlanc: \u201cChemistry was what we were looking for here, but their badinage was no more than passable offcuts from an unmade transatlantic buddy movie.\u201d           Top Gear\u2019s The Stig: the Guardian\u2019s hard-hitting interview     Related: New Top Gear review: lots of polish but it's still a secondhand car show    His two-star review concluded: \u201cWould we buy a used car show from this man? On this debut, only after some serious tweaking.\u201d However, a bright spot for most was the performance of racing driver Sabine Schmitz, and Evans\u2019 decision to drop some of Clarkson\u2019s blokeish demeanour.  The Mirror also said that even Clarkson\u2019s \u201cmost sulky fans\u201d should find a lot to like about the show after his departure and the Telegraph welcomed Evans and co\u2019s conservative approach. Its four-star review said: \u201cGiven time to bed in, there\u2019s little doubt that we will warm to the new regime. This time next year, most people \u2013 especially those who don\u2019t subscribe to Amazon \u2013 will probably have forgotten what all the fuss was about.\u201d The real test for Top Gear and the BBC however may come over the next 72 hours as it airs in 80 countries worldwide. Top Gear is one of the biggest earners for the corporation\u2019s commercial arm BBC Worldwide, worth in the region of \u00a350m a year.",
