  "body": "Confusion abounds from the moment I meet Geri Horner, the artist formerly known as Geri Halliwell, or Ginger Spice, or the one who invented Girl Power and pinched Prince Charles\u2019s bum. We are introduced, and she says my name is lovely, \u201clike Sophie\u2019s Choice!\u201d. I laugh and mutter about it not being all that lovely really, the film where Sophie\u2019s choice is which of her two children will be gassed at Auschwitz. \u201cMmmm, but Robert de Niro,\u201d says Horner cheerily, while having her lip gloss applied by a makeup artist, even though De Niro isn\u2019t in it. Thus we enter an interesting conversation about two entirely different films. Anyway, we\u2019re not here to talk about fascist death cults \u2013 well, not exactly. We\u2019re here to talk about Barbie. Horner used to be a Spice Girl, but now, in her early 40s, her latest reinvention sees her married to the Formula 1 racing boss Christian Horner, being a mother to eight-year-old Bluebell and perfecting the art of domestic bliss in the countryside. She was a single mum, but now wants to be referred to by her married name; her Instagram feed is all wellies and waxed jackets and baking cakes in Buckinghamshire. She even won the Great Sport Relief Bake Off they did in February \u2013 she says she got asked on the Monday. \u201cAnd I went \u2018Yes! My daughter loves this show, I\u2019ve got to do it!\u2019 Then I went white and realised I was going to humiliate myself on national television.\u201d The Mirror reported that her new \u201cfrightfully posh accent\u201d confused the viewers \u2013 today it\u2019s not quite as plummy. She does not want to talk about the endless speculation of Spice Girls reunions. \u201cBor-ing,\u201d says her publicist on our way into the meeting room. But, to Barbie: having already written a series of children\u2019s stories, Horner is now the spokeswoman for a Mattel and Netmums competition in which mothers can write their own Barbie story and win a holiday. And Barbie now comes in various body shapes and colours, as an extensive marketing campaign will tell you. Barbie, like Geri Halliwell, has changed. \u201cShe\u2019s got hips. She\u2019s got caramel skin. She\u2019s got clever, she says you can be a lawyer or a teacher or the president,\u201d says Horner, who adds that she loved the doll as a kid and that she and Bluebell now play with Barbie together, making up a game on a white duvet at home that turns into icy mountain peaks. Which sounds as though they actually play at Elsa from Frozen, more popular nowadays than the flagging Barbie, but still. \u201cAnd I thought, GOOD on YOU for having an evolution,\u201d says Horner. \u201cWe all change. Barbie has had the humility to try to catch up!\u201d It sounds as if Barbie is quite real to her, so I ask if it\u2019s true that she and Ken have split up. \u201cThey did at one point,\u201d comes the dour voice of the Mattel rep, who is lurking in the background. \u201cThey\u2019re back together now. She went off with a surfer dude from Australia.\u201d     The new Barbie, with varied body types, hair, outfits and skin tones. Photograph: Mattel    So why, I ask, did it take Mattel so long to stop promoting the monoculture of a skinny white blonde with big boobs? \u201cThe society we live in, for us as a brand we probably couldn\u2019t have done it 10 years ago. Because it was a different ... zeitgeist. People wouldn\u2019t have been ready for it,\u201d says the rep. \u201cBut children are in a much more multicultural environment, that\u2019s what they see and what they expect to see around them now. So we\u2019re only reflecting on what is around.\u201d Who knew that immigration and thighs were such recent inventions? Horner struggled with bulimia for years; I ask her how she thinks we should make sure we don\u2019t pass on body anxiety to our daughters. \u201cMy experience is that kids don\u2019t learn, they copy. So, yes, it starts with me, I think. I\u2019ve tried my best to be a healthy role model, but I\u2019m not perfect,\u201d she says, thoughtfully. It is clearly something she cares about. \u201cI walk the middle line. It is what it is.\u201d   Related: Barbie finally becomes a real woman \u2013 with a more realistic figure    She cares about younger women, too, \u201cwith this peer pressure of airbrush \u2013 it\u2019s an airbrushed world, where we\u2019ve all taken 20 selfies before it\u2019s been uploaded, and it\u2019s all been filtered, or all this,\u201d she does a funny American accent: \u201c\u2018You gotta have the perfect body! The perfect life!\u2019 Actually, no,\u201d she adds quietly. \u201cWe\u2019re all spinning plates and dropping plates. Otherwise it\u2019s terrifying. I really feel for that generation of, let\u2019s say, 28 to 35-year-olds. The message I try to give to anyone in my life is that you\u2019re enough. It\u2019s OK. You\u2019re enough.\u201d But I have to point out that all this image stuff made the former Geri Halliwell hugely famous and wealthy, too. Don\u2019t all pop stars sell a dream? She repeatedly says she \u201cdoesn\u2019t understand\u201d what I mean, finally declaring: \u201cMy experience is that we live in a material world. Also, it\u2019s inside and out, it\u2019s the polarity of both, aesthetics is the shop window, ultimately, if there\u2019s nothing in that shop, it has no longevity, do you know what I mean?\u201d Horner says she has always loved words. When she was a little girl, growing up in Watford, her father was a broadsheet reader, and introduced her \u201cto all these different books. We had an outside loo, and I remember waiting outside for my turn to go, and I was staring at an apple tree. I remember writing my first story about this apple tree. And after that I was always reading and writing.\u201d Her parents were divorced, her Spanish mother had little money, and so \u201creading was escapism when everybody else went on holiday. My parents didn\u2019t go away, so I got CS Lewis, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. Other children went somewhere else \u2013 I just went to Narnia. And songwriting \u2013 throughout my years with the band, and as a solo artist, it\u2019s so important to me. With the Spice Girls, I LOVED that part \u2013 the creating bit. The power of words.\u201d She has, arguably, more songwriting co-credits than any other Spice Girl; then there are her solo records \u2013 who could forget Mi Chico Latino? Has she taught her daughter Spanish? \u201cMy mother has taught her some, but I haven\u2019t used my Spanish in a long time and I\u2019m absolutely not fluent. But I could have a conversation if we were lost and you needed a beer.\u201d I feel a surge of love at the thought of being stranded in Spain with Ginger Spice trying to find me a cerveza. She has spent the past year working on a novel for pre-teens, and has befriended the master of such literature, Jacqueline Wilson. \u201cShe\u2019s read it! She gave me tips. Oh my God, I was so scared, giving it to her, but she said she really liked the character. She gave me constructive criticism and said to keep going. So I\u2019m keeping going.\u201d And now for some even more surprising news: \u201cI also wrote a screenplay that got picked up by Playtone \u2013 that\u2019s Tom Hanks\u2019s production company \u2013 and then dropped when the recession hit. So I\u2019ve got the rights back.\u201d She doesn\u2019t want to tell me what it\u2019s about, but then reveals it\u2019s a musical, complete with songs, about a teenager. Blimey.     The Spice Girls perform on stage at the Brit Awards ceremony in 1997. Photograph: Fiona Hanson/PA Archive/Press Association Ima    She has just finished reading A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara, one of the six novels shortlisted for the 2015 Man Booker. \u201cOh my God, it is the most \u2013 I picked this book up by accident. I\u2019m old-school, I like going into Waterstones and browsing, what\u2019s the No 1 bestseller, what\u2019s been picked up for the Man Booker prize, tell me. I love being recommended all sorts. Anyway this book \u2013 I was actually on the way to the grand prix in Bahrain. I was accompanying my husband ... I don\u2019t want to spoil it, but it\u2019s reeeeally dark, and the description of some things are so unsettling that I had to skim-read. Awful. I think she could have done with more of an editor on some of it, actually. It\u2019s about 700 pages!\u201d She didn\u2019t enjoy it, she says, but felt compelled to finish it. \u201cI\u2019d be reading it at dinner, my husband would say: \u2018Would you just put that DOWN,\u2019 and I just couldn\u2019t. If he suddenly had to take a phone call, I\u2019d pick the book up again, just to get another page in.\u201d The couple met in 2014 and married in 2015, when she was 42 and he was 41. \u201cI\u2019ve always been a bit of a late developer. I have! 100%.\u201d But you achieved a lot very young. \u201cYeah, in certain areas, but my emotional life was probably a little bit stunted. My emotional development didn\u2019t start happening until my 30s, I think. I used to say that I didn\u2019t want a relationship because it steals your energy. I actually said that. At the beginning, you\u2019re punching through with bravado, but at about 29, I suddenly realised that the bravado had completely kicked out. The humility to go: actually, I don\u2019t know the answers. I think I definitely am in a phase where I like myself a bit better now.\u201d Her grandmother used to say that everything would turn out all right in the end, \u201cand I used to think, well, how does she KNOW that? But I can say with sincerity, it does. If you fall over enough times, you think, well, OK.\u201d I ask if Geri Halliwell is someone she has left behind, or if it\u2019s just a name change. \u201cDo you know what, I\u2019m a curious being ... I\u2019ve read the storybooks about finding Prince Charming, but I come from divorced parents so I was always a little bit more sceptical and I wanted to marry for love. But I thought, if you\u2019re going to marry someone and become a unit of a family together, then whether he takes my name or I take his, that to me is not the point. The point is that you are becoming a tribe together. It was almost like, let go of your importance, because that doesn\u2019t matter. Don\u2019t lose your identity though, because that does.\u201d Lily Allen, after marriage, wanted to release her new album as Lily Cooper, but her label wouldn\u2019t accept it. \u201cI am releasing new music, and that is a conversation,\u201d she nods. \u201cI just cross that bridge ... I just think about Liz Taylor.\u201d She stops and actually thinks about Liz Taylor. \u201cWell, she remained Liz Taylor and got married many times ... Well, I think we\u2019re on first-name terms, anyway.\u201d Geri means her and the general public. \u201cYou know my real name\u2019s Geraldine, which my husband and my mother both call me.\u201d She laughs. \u201cWe all materialise at different ages. That\u2019s who I am, deep down I am Geraldine Horner.\u201d As for the style of her new songs, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to move it on. I\u2019m not going to be in my hotpants going: \u2018Still got it!\u2019\u201d Which reminds me of something I\u2019ve always wanted to know \u2013 is it true she made that union jack dress out of a tea towel? \u201cYes. I stitched it on to a black Gucci dress with a needle and thread. My sister helped me. Quite funny.\u201d Time\u2019s up, I have to leave. \u201cNice to meet you Sophie, Sophie\u2019s Choice!\u201d she says as I leave. \u201cGod,\u201d she adds, \u201cI\u2019m going to have to watch it now, aren\u2019t I?\u201d  This article was corrected on 16 May 2016. A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara was one of the six novels shortlisted for the 2015 Man Booker prize, but it did not win it, as originally stated.",
