  "body": "Anti-slavery campaigners in Mauritania say two court victories last week could be significant in the fight against the practice.  In only the country\u2019s second prosecution for slavery \u2013 and the first by a new court established alongside an anti-slavery law passed last year \u2013 two slave-owners were sentenced to five years in prison, with one year to be served and four years suspended.  In another boost for campaigners, two prominent anti-slavery activists, Biram Ould Abeid and Brahim Bilal \u2013 who had been in jail for 20 months after taking part in a demonstration against slavery \u2013 have been freed.   Related: Anti-slavery activists in Mauritania face violent clampdown, rights groups warn    \u201cThe problem for us in the past has not been bringing the complaint to court, it has been that our previous attempts have never resulted in a conviction. This is the first time that a trial has gone from start to finish and it really gives us hope in the months to come that we can make progress on other cases,\u201d said Salimata Lam, national coordinator for local NGO SOS Esclaves.  The two slave-owners \u2013 Sidi Mohamed Ould Hanana and Khalihina Ould Heymad \u2013 were also ordered to pay compensation to the two female slaves who had brought the case with the support of SOS Esclaves and Anti-Slavery International (ASI). The presiding judge of the Nema special court, which was set up in December, also imposed a fine of 100,000 ouguiya (about $285) and ordered 1m ouguiya in restitution to each of the women. The women \u2013 Fatimetou Mint Hamdi and Fatimata Mint Zaydih, aged between 35 and 40 \u2013 had lived with the Ould Daoud family since birth. They escaped with their children with the help of SOS Esclaves last year. The NGO has been looking after them since. Speaking after the trial, Zaydih said: \u201cI never received any money or anything for the work I did. I was only ever allowed to eat the leftovers from the masters\u2019 meals. My 10-year-old son became the slave of one of the masters, and was under his control all the time. I never knew what my boy was eating or if he was eating at all.\u201d   Related: Slavery still shackles Mauritania, 31 years after its abolition    Mauritania is one of three countries \u2013 along with Niger and Mali \u2013 where slavery by inheritance is proving hard to eradicate. Some people from the Haratin group are born into slavery; their masters own them from birth and buy and sell them. Haratins work for no pay and receive little education. The women face rape, with any children also becoming the property of the slave owner. The presiding judge, Aliou Ba, said the sentences were intended to send a message to Mauritanians that slavery will be taken seriously, and added that he has eight other slavery cases on his books.  \u201cThis judgment will likely have an enormously empowering effect on people in slavery and will act as a strong deterrent on other slave-owners,\u201d said Sarah Mathewson, Africa programme director at ASI. Abeid and Bilal are president and vice-president of the Initiative for the Resurgence of the Abolitionist Movement respectively. Abeid, a winner of the 2013 UN human rights prize, stood as a candidate in Mauritania\u2019s 2014 presidential election and came second behind Mohamed Ould Abdel Aziz. The campaigners were sentenced to two years in jail in January 2015 for \u201cinciting trouble\u201d and belonging to an unrecognised organisation but the supreme court modified their convictions. Speaking after his release, Abeid said: \u201cThe injustice and persecution we have been through have only strengthened our convictions.\u201d International rights groups and the UN have long been pressuring the government to outlaw slavery. The law passed in August made slavery a crime against humanity, increased the penalty to 20 years\u2019 imprisonment and included provisions to make it possible for civil society organisations to bring cases on behalf of slaves.  Nevertheless, there remains a long way to go to improve human rights in Mauritania. The country has been criticised for cracking down on civil society and journalists. A death sentence was upheld last month for a blogger convicted of apostasy. Although slavery was officially abolished in 1981, it is deeply ingrained in Mauritania\u2019s history and pressure groups have struggled to get the authorities to acknowledge that it exists. Although the prosecutions are ground-breaking, the claimants\u2019 lawyer, Maitre Mohameden Elid, said the sentence was too lenient. \u201cThis is just the start. We\u2019ll do everything we can to get the next cases out of the drawers in the justice department,\u201d said SOS Esclaves\u2019s Lam. \u201cWe want to see fixed dates for the next cases.\u201d",
