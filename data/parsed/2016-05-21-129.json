  "body": "The Citro\u00ebn Grand C4 is certainly large \u2013 the dash was so wide and deep that I couldn\u2019t reach the front of it; and the windscreen is gigantic, which, along with the glass roof, made the roads feel American. Don\u2019t ask me how that works, I just felt several times as if I were in Wyoming. The driver\u2019s seat is wide enough for two, though it\u2019s arguable how useful that is, and three stone-cold enemies could sit in the middle row without compromising their implacable distance. The third row is a bit more intimate, and luggage would have to get on extremely well. But you wouldn\u2019t want this car to be any larger, particularly if you park like an idiot at the best of times, which by the ancient laws of the universe of cars, people who need seven seats always do. It isn\u2019t a thrilling thing to drive: changing gears is a bit like shouting at cows. They acknowledge your existence, but at their own pace and without much promise. But the steering is solid, even if it isn\u2019t grippy, and the diesel engine has a dogged spirit, so that, once it\u2019s moving, it never complains. It\u2019s mainly impressive for the many places you\u2019d expect a trade-off where a trade hasn\u2019t been made.   Related: On the road: \u2018It sends off mixed messages\u2019 \u2013 Ssangyong Korando car review    Most obviously, a car this size should have mediocre emissions ratings, but it doesn\u2019t: at its most eco, it comes in below 100g/km, and even in the Exclusive + that I had, it\u2019s only 105g/km. Obviously, alongside that comes astonishing fuel economy. It might not be the cheapest people carrier, but it\u2019s not bogglingly pricey, and I\u2019d expect certain pay-offs and cheap bits, even small things like unappealing satnav or second-rate-citizen aircon. All that stuff belonged to a dearer car. There were tinny touches and plasticky bits in areas that don\u2019t matter \u2013 oddment stowage \u2013 and if you want to turn your parking brake into a button, you have to make damned sure it works every time. The steering wheel was a bit busy. But overall it\u2019s a quality cabin, an acreage you can survey and feel fortunate, particularly since it is large enough to live in. Front passengers like it for the posture, which you can recline like one of those stressed-traveller seats in airports from the 90s (it\u2019s called the RELAX function, in Exclusive + models only). Those are their caps; it\u2019s not me, yelling, \u201cRelax!\u201d at you). Rear passengers found it insufficiently exciting, but luckily they\u2019re so far away, you can\u2019t really hear them.
