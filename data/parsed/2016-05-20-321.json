  "body": "Dear student, I have just read your essay, and I must apologise \u2013 I have absolutely no idea what it said.  When you hold this essay in your hands in a few weeks\u2019 time, I know that you will look immediately at the mark I\u2019ve written at the top of the first page. You will make assumptions about yourself, your work \u2013 perhaps even your worth \u2013 based on this number. I want to tell you not to worry about it.   Related: How to survive marking dissertations    When I was a student, I assumed \u2013 as you probably do now \u2013 that my work was meticulously checked and appraised, with the due consideration it deserved, by erudite scholars who perhaps wore tweed.  I wonder now if it was actually marked by someone like me: a semi-employed thirtysomething on a zero-hours contract, sitting at home in pyjamas, staring at a hopeless pile of marking, as hopes of making it to the shops for a pint of milk today fade. Your essay is one of 20 or so I\u2019ve tackled in one sitting this afternoon. They are beginning to blur into one; a profusion of themes and things \u201cto be noted\u201d and endless variations on the phrase \u201cIt is interesting that...\u201d.  I\u2019m reading something you wrote on page two and I\u2019m wondering if I just read an explanation of this concept on page one, or if that was in someone else\u2019s essay. I have to go back a page, eyes swimming, and check.  Your essay does not stand alone, but becomes amalgamated with the others I\u2019ve read so far today, all talking about the same things, with varying degrees of clarity. Your words are diluted by the ones that came before, they are lost on me even before I begin. It should not be like this. In an ideal world, I would spend my morning carefully marking three essays at most, giving them the thought they deserve. I would spend the early afternoon wandering around a meadow picking flowers \u2013 something, anything, to clear my head so I can approach the next batch with a fresh outlook and enthusiasm.    Related: Academic workload: a model approach    But I do not have that kind of time. I have academic work of my own; I have a job interview to prepare for; at various points of the year, I have additional employment to help tide me over. (And I\u2019m only a part-time lecturer, I\u2019m aware that my colleagues in full-time jobs have a lot more of this to do.)  I have cleared this bit of space in my schedule to read your essays, and I have come at them genuinely excited to see what you have found out this term, and to tell you how you can improve. I try to be thorough and write actual comments on your essay, even though I\u2019m aware that I could probably get away with a few ticks, question marks and a cryptic \u201cneeds improvement\u201d. I\u2019ve been at it all day and it is 6.20 pm. There are 11 unmarked essays. I could carry on, but I can\u2019t make sense of anything you say any more. I have to force myself to understand anything other than the clearest, nicest writing; the kind of writing that takes me by the hand and shows me round all your ideas. (Dear student, please note: I am not so exhausted that I can\u2019t spot nice writing. Do us both a favour and spend time on your essay. Make it good. Edit, polish, relieve my boredom and let me award you a first.)  I know that I should go back and reread a few essays to compare the marks I\u2019ve given, but there isn\u2019t time. I would like to look up the references you cite, to tell you if there are other gems in those books you may have missed, or suggest other interpretations, but there\u2019s no chance. I also have a life \u2013 washing to do, family to spend time with, that sort of thing. In this letter (which I\u2019ve written with an aching hand) I ask three things of you:  Work hard on your essays. Help people like me. It\u2019ll open your mind, and it\u2019ll make me happy. And I really, really want to give you a first. Don\u2019t think that if you just waffle on for three pages to bring your essay up to the required word count, I won\u2019t notice. I will.  Do not get too upset \u2013 or complacent \u2013 because of whatever mark you\u2019ve got. Don\u2019t take it too personally. I\u2019ve tried my best to be consistent and fair, and other lecturers will moderate my marking, but really, by a certain stage, I\u2019m just pulling numbers out of the air. (55? 58? I don\u2019t know)    Related: Teaching at a university means constant pressure - for about \u00a35 an hour    Your essay does not stand alone; it\u2019s either going to impress me or sap my energy, and if it does the latter, it affects how I read the ones which come afterwards. Too many awful essays and I can\u2019t concentrate anymore.  The books on your reading list will tell you everything about the subject that you need to know; read them. There are also books in the library with titles like How to Write an Essay; make use of them. If you don\u2019t understand something, come along to my office hour. I\u2019ve gone on about it all term, and you know where that is. All the best, Your lecturer Join the higher education network for more comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.
