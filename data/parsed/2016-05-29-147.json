The book town kicks off the festival season in the British Isles this weekend with not one but two separate galas tempting tens of thousands of literary pilgrims deep into the Welsh countryside. There can\u2019t be many groups of nations less climatically suited to outdoor festival life, but we don\u2019t seem to care. Ancient Celts used to love an outdoor gathering and Britons have fully re-embraced the tradition with almost 1,000 festivals due to take place across the country this summer \u2013 adding up to around 75 officially registered festivals going on over any one week. Many of us are now taking festival breaks instead of a summer holiday, and last year the amount spent by British residents on domestic tourism \u2013 holiday trips within the UK \u2013 reached an all-time high of \u00a319.6bn. There\u2019s long been an interest in the staycation \u2013 even before foreign holidays in places such as Turkey, Tunisia and Egypt began to lose their popularity thanks to a perceived terror threat. The extra experience offered by a well-run festival \u2013 be it a tiny oyster celebration in Cornwall or a full-on music festival on the Isle of Wight \u2013 means that local authorities are finally beginning to appreciate the huge economic and social value of events which might once have seen residents recoiling in horror.

On the tiny Hebridean island of Eigg, bought out in 1997 and run as a co-operative by islanders, the limited numbers of tickets to its three day semi-regular Howlin\u2019 Fling beach music festival are hot properties and include a ferry ticket and an optional hike up the Sgurr, the island\u2019s unique lava mountain.

Photograph: Blair Young    At the other end of the scale are the giants: T in the Park, Reading and, of course, Glastonbury, beginning on 22 June this year \u2013 a phenomenon that started as a countercultural hippyfest 40 years ago but which has now become the world\u2019s biggest music festival with some 175,000 people in its Somerset fields each summer. Although music is an integral part of any festival, the perceived formula of \u201ca band playing in a field\u201d is no longer important, according to Paul Reed of the Association of Independent Festivals (AIF). \u201cThe entire landscape has shifted,\u201d he said. While small, venue-based jazz and poetry festivals have been around since the 1970s and even earlier \u2013 the Edinburgh Festival was founded in 1947 to \u201cprovide a platform for the flowering of the human spirit\u201d in the aftermath of the second world war \u2013 the new festival has to offer far more than a few headline acts. \u201cAudience experience is the trend we\u2019re seeing,\u201d said Reed. \u201cLast year more than half of festival-goers said they\u2019d gone for the whole experience, so the numbers of people who turn up just to see a headline band is dropping away.\u201d The AIF\u2019s 2015 audience survey asked: \u201cWhen buying a ticket for a festival, what is the single most important factor when deciding which one to attend?\u201d More than half of respondents cited \u201cthe general atmosphere and overall vibe, character and quality of the event\u201d; 7.7% replied \u201cheadline acts\u201d while 26% said their priority was \u201cthe music generally\u201d. \u201cIncreasingly more festivals have found their niche, although I don\u2019t believe that every format has been done just yet,\u201d added Reed. \u201cA major newbie on the scene is a big one: the Bluedot festival in Cheshire, centred around the world\u2019s second largest telescope. It\u2019ll be all science and technology and astrophysics, as well as electronic music from Jean-Michel Jarre.\u201d Food and family entertainment are increasingly important, whatever the theme of the festival, says Reed. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough any more to say \u2018oh, there\u2019s a kids\u2019 tent and there\u2019s a juggler\u2019. You need more. People who went to a festival as teenagers want to take their own kids.\u201d Festivals also provide a vital showcase for emerging bands and an income for established artists struggling to survive financially in the industry\u2019s streaming era.     One of the newer events, the Blue Dot festival in Cheshire is centred around the world\u2019s second largest telescope. Photograph: discoverthebluedot.com    UK Music\u2019s \u2018Wish you were here\u2019 report in 2015 revealed that 9.5 million incoming \u201cmusic tourists\u201d to an area generated a spend of \u00a33.1bn. And research commissioned by Live Nation from Optimy concluded that a 5,000-capacity festival can generate approximately \u00a3800,000 in net gain to the local area and its supply chains, while a 110,000-capacity festival can generate \u00a318m for the local area \u2013 but grumbles remain that even the most eco-friendly of festivals can bring in traffic, rubbish, noise pollution and can upset some local residents who prefer their fields undisturbed by fun. But who needs a tent to be a festival-goer? Liz Vater is director of the Stoke Newington Literary Festival in north London. \u201cI\u2019d been to a few literary events in London, but they felt quite self-reverential and cliquey,\u201d she said. \u201cI realised that I could create something I\u2019d really love to go to, which was accessible, eclectic and fun. Stoke Newington\u2019s history as a place where dissenters, artists and writers gathered informs the programming. \u201cWe\u2019ve done events on the Angry Brigade who lived here, our feminist strand is in homage to Mary Wollstonecraft, who lived and taught here, we\u2019re introducing a Gothic strand inspired by Edgar Allan Poe, who studied here, and we\u2019re constantly trying to better reflect our multicultural community. Our outreach work is growing exponentially \u2013 this year we\u2019ll do author events for about 2,500 schoolkids and a mini-feminism festival for Hackney sixth-formers. \u201cResearch we\u2019ve carried out shows that for up to 70% of our visitors we\u2019re the first literary event they\u2019ve been to. Of all the feedback we get it\u2019s that the programme is so eclectic \u2013 David Mitchell to a Game of Thrones pub quiz, Thomas Keneally to an event up a tree. Making it work has been a mix of incredibly hard work and sheer bloody-mindedness. We\u2019re incredibly entrepreneurial and have become a real focal point for the community. We\u2019ve got a network of volunteers who\u2019ve been with us for years and genuinely feel like family.\u201d Vater faces constant pressure to grow, something Hilary Lawson recognises. As founder of Hay\u2019s HowtheLightGetsIn festival of philosophy and ideas which began its seventh year this weekend, he has expanded from one site to two. \u201cIt gets a bit bigger each year but that is incremental, it\u2019s important not to be too big. We have to be loyal to the initial idea and concept. I didn\u2019t set out to run a festival. We set out to have some open debates about the way we think about ideas and it turned out to be more popular than I ever imagined.     Now in its seventh year, HowTheLightGetsIn is a philosophy and music festival based in Hay-on-Wye in Wales. Photograph: Jeff Morgan/Alamy    \u201cWe have a very mixed group \u2013 95% of our audience say they will come back and I think that\u2019s because of the whole experience. You can go to a public lecture in a lecture hall, and the place cements the authority of the person speaking. Here you can stand in the coffee queue next to a Nobel prize-winning scientist. We don\u2019t let people come here to sell a book. They have to come here with something to say. \u201cI remember going to Glastonbury one year and getting there and realising it isn\u2019t a band in a field \u2013 it\u2019s a whole town in a field. There\u2019s a tradition in that sense, which is why Britain has become such a centre for festivals. Atmosphere and experience. They\u2019re the keys.\u201d And never mind the weather.",
