The serious aspect is simple \u2013 the record is ludicrous for a club of Hibs\u2019 standing. Even terrific Hibs teams have fallen short, which makes the prominence of the class of 2016 somewhat strange when placed in context. Saturday\u2019s cup final against Rangers arrives only days after Hibs\u2019 latest failure to win promotion to the top flight. They will therefore spend a third season in succession playing lower league football. Financially, and in terms of reputation, this is seriously damaging. Whether the pain would be offset by the claiming of the one trophy to elude them for so long is open to debate. The winners at Hampden will earn a place in the Europa League\u2019s qualifying stage. Uncertainty relating to the future of Alan Stubbs has been apparent for months. The Hibs manager has been linked with the vacant position at Bolton Wanderers, one of his former clubs. Given unsatisfactory climaxes to promotion bids, it is debatable whether Stubbs has earned the right to continue at Easter Road in any case.   Related: Rangers secure promotion to Scottish Premiership with win over Dumbarton    \u201cThe big negative is we didn\u2019t achieve our main goal and we\u2019re disappointed from that,\u201d Stubbs said. \u201cBut after this final, we\u2019re already focusing on next season. We are planning towards making the team even stronger. I don\u2019t think you need a carrot dangling in terms of what\u2019s at stake. They may never have another opportunity to play in a Scottish Cup final. I certainly would love them to play in two, three, four cup finals but the likelihood is that they may not.\u201d Rangers lie between Hibs and the Scottish Cup in what represents the first time this final has featured two teams from outside Scotland\u2019s top division. Rangers\u2019 canter to the Championship title means they will play Premiership football next season. The key danger lies in the three weeks that have passed since their last competitive outing. \u201cIt\u2019s always a risk having a break, you can look at it both ways,\u201d Mark Warburton said. \u201cYou can say it\u2019s hard on Rangers having a break or tough on Hibs having four games in a fortnight. They can run the risk of fatigue or injury. We have done the best we can and we know we\u2019ll need to replicate this again in January when there is a winter break.\u201d The Rangers manager added: \u201cFrom where Rangers have been, the prize is now European football if we beat a very good opponent. And it\u2019s also for the Rangers fans with the history and experiences of European football. They will be desperate to get those nights back again at Ibrox and if we can beat Hibs and give them that, fantastic.\u201d Warburton remains hopeful of coaxing Joey Barton from Burnley but there is a fear the midfielder may opt to remain in England, with Burnley having been promoted to the Premier League. European football, surely, would help Rangers\u2019 cause. Rangers welcome back their most prolific striker, Martyn Waghorn, for the final. Warburton, however, is without the suspended Tottenham loanee Dominic Ball.",
