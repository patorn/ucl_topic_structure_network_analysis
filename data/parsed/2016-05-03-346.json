But what emerged from the ashes of the promenade, jutting 277 metres (910ft) into the grey-blue of the Channel, is a tale of determination, persistence and one of the most successful community buyouts in Britain. This month, after a year\u2019s delay, the Hastings Pier Charity will celebrate its official reopening with an open air cinema festival and concert, headlined by Madness, a nod to its heyday when the lineup at the end-of-pier ballroom provided a history of British pop music in the 60s , 70s and 80s with acts such as the Rolling Stones, the Who, Jimi Hendrix and later the Sex Pistols. Immediately after the fire in October 2010, the pier\u2019s resurrection looked improbable. Over coffee at Source skateboard park on the town\u2019s breezy seafront, Archie Lauchlan, an award-winning film-maker, recalls people \u201ccrying and collecting bits of pier\u201d on the beach the morning after the fire.

Photograph: Alamy    Among them were Hasting Pier and White Rock trust members, who had submitted a funding proposal based on the newly destroyed art deco buildings. They had six weeks, the deadline for Heritage Lottery funding, to scrap their plans and start again. \u201cNo one thought they had a cat in hell\u2019s chance,\u201d said Lauchlan, who moved to Hastings from London in 2006, attracted by its thriving artistic community. \u201cWhat happened highlights what this town is all about\u201d he said. \u201cYou discover how ingrained the independent spirit is.\u201d Lauchlan, who made a documentary about the pier\u2019s 144-year history that focussed on the ballroom\u2019s best years, said: \u201cIt\u2019s incredible that we\u2019re here. Brighton\u2019s [derelict] West pier is falling into the sea.\u201d Campaigners, who have battled for a decade to resurrect the pier, were faced with years of neglect, political insouciance and an unaccountable, owner-come pantomime villain in the shape of Ravenclaw, the Panamanian-registered firm that refused to carry out repairs.  Jess Steele, a community activist, began highlighting the plight of the badly neglected building in 2006, when Hastings council partially closed it. She credits local residents, who united behind the real threat that their pier might lie derelict forever, as the catalyst that drove the project forward.  \u201cYou can\u2019t walk away from a dead pier,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was causing damage to the economy. If you are a seaside town with a dead pier, it\u2019s like having a fish up a chimney in a house you\u2019re trying to sell.\u201d \u201cIf there are six of you doing it you might give up, but when there\u2019s 6,000 other people supporting you, you keep going.\u201d     The pier in the 1950s. Photograph: PR    After the fire, the trust members won a \u00a311.4m lottery grant and raised a further \u00a3600,000 in a community share scheme that 3,000 people participated in. Steele, who will be awarded an OBE next month for services to community groups who take on difficult buildings, said one of the most frustrating aspects of the 10-year battle was wrestling the pier from the hands of its offshore owners. \u201cThere was a complete lack of transparency to Ravenclaw\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a mess. The company was opaque, it was impossible to use laws against it, but yet it was leaving it to rot.\u201d After the 2010 election, when Hastings council switched from Tory to Labour, council leaders tried unsuccessfully to persuade Ravenclaw to carry out repair work. When it failed to respond, they sought a compulsory purchase order and in 2013, it was sold to the Hastings Pier Charity for a pound. According to Peter Walker, the project engineer and one of the charity\u2019s 11 staff, one of the pier\u2019s chief weaknesses stemmed from an unlikely culprit - the threat posed by Adolf Hitler during the second world war. \u201cWhen England was under threat from Hitler during the war, they chopped a bit out of the middle so it couldn\u2019t be used as a landing stage. You could have Nazis goose-stepping up the middle otherwise,\u201d said Walker, in the pier\u2019s soon-to-be-opened visitors centre, which will eventually contain a digital archive of memorabilia. The gap was bridged in 1946, but until recently the structure had remained weak.  \u201cIf we were sitting here two years ago, every so often the waves would hit the beach and the whole thing would go dub, dub, dub,\u201d said Walker swaying theatrically from side to side. Thanks to 20-metre steel beams driven into the sea bed, the former gap, where the visitors now centre sits, is now the strongest part. \u201cIt\u2019s been quite a phenomenal project,\u201d Walker said.     The pier in 1872, the year of its opening Photograph: PR    Not everyone among the seaside town\u2019s 90,000 population is happy, however. Some locals have compared the promenade \u2013 which has just two main buildings, the visitors centre and a restaurant \u2013 unfavourably with an aircraft hanger, and nicknamed it \u201cthe plank\u201d.  They say the end result does not measure up to the original plans, which included more buildings. Others have said they would have liked to have seen more traditional funfare attractions. There is criticism too of limiting fishing to certain times of the day. Simon Opie, the CEO of the Hastings Pier Charity and who previously worked at Disneyland Paris, said most of the grant was spent on the demolition and restoration of the substructure, which had suffered since the decline of seaside towns in the 70s and 80s. \u201cWe did have to make a decision on where to spent the money\u201d he said. \u201cThe fundamentals are to keep operating costs as low as possible and to be as flexible as possible. We didn\u2019t want to build things that would lie empty six months of the year.\u201d The main source of income is expected to be the family restaurant, at the road end of the pier, while a section of the visitors centre will be hired out for events. The charity is planning 10 events a year, and has booked Zippo\u2019s circus for the month of August. It is a work in progress, Opie said, which could potentially attract further investment. \u201cIt\u2019s not all about money, there is a social value of the space we have created,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t need to spend money. It\u2019s like an urban park that stretches into the water.\u201d Back on the seafront, new mother Inga Soldatkinal, 29, on maternity leave from her work in a Sussex hospital, was out for a stroll with her baby. \u201cI know people say it\u2019s not what they expected,\u201d she said as seagulls wheeled in the blue sky above her. \u201cIt\u2019s modern. But I really like it. I love the idea of open space. I love to sit on a bench and look at the sea.\u201d",
