  "body": "The Obama administration has quietly seeded the diplomatic bed for its next push to transfer detainees out of Guant\u00e1namo Bay, the Guardian has learned, as Barack Obama aims to reduce the prison\u2019s population before leaving office.   Related: Secret area of Guant\u00e1namo could be opened to UN watchdog for first time    According to US officials, the administration has deals in place to send approximately two dozen longtime Guant\u00e1namo detainees to about half a dozen countries.  While it is unclear if the transfers will occur in one wave, as with the April transfer of nine detainees to Saudi Arabia, there is an expectation that the departure of 22 or 23 men will occur by the end of July. There are currently 80 men detained at Guant\u00e1namo, the lowest number since the US opened the wartime prison in 2002.  All the detainees for whom US diplomats have secured arrangements to leave Guant\u00e1namo have been officially approved for transfer, either by a 2010 internal review process or through quasi-parole hearings known as Periodic Review Boards.  The US holds 28 detainees approved for transfer, so the men\u2019s departure would nearly empty Guant\u00e1namo of such designated detainees, substantially clearing a backlog that has lasted years.  Officials spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity, as not all of the foreign destination countries are ready to be identified. Furthermore, some of the transfer approvals have yet to receive certification by Ashton Carter, the defense secretary, as required by law, ahead of a notification to Congress.  The State Department\u2019s envoy for closing Guant\u00e1namo, Lee Wolosky, pledged in January after a transfer of 10 detainees to Oman that the US would finish emptying Guant\u00e1namo of transfer-eligible detainees \u201cby this summer\u201d. If the current deals go through, the US would be left with 57 or 58 Guant\u00e1namo detainees, the vast majority of whom are either involved in the military tribunals process or subject to insufficient untainted evidence to charge, while thought too dangerous to release.  The quasi-parole process may soon refill the transfer-eligible category with additional detainees.  All of the 42 detainees not currently before the military commissions or approved for transfer are eligible for hearings before the Periodic Review Board, a panel of US security-related agencies that decides by consensus to transfer or recommend continued detention. Ten of those detainees are awaiting rulings from the board.  Long criticized for its lethargy, the Periodic Review Board process has picked up its pace, holding hearings for 18 detainees since January. Four are scheduled over the next two weeks, including a 2 June hearing for Mohamedou Ould Slahi, whose abuse at Guant\u00e1namo is the centerpiece of an internationally bestselling memoir.   Related: Guant\u00e1namo Diary exposes brutality of US rendition and torture    Persistent congressional opposition to permitting Guant\u00e1namo detainees to be tried or imprisoned on US soil has made the parole-and-transfer process the likeliest mechanism through which Obama can come close to accomplishing his long-thwarted goal of closing down Guant\u00e1namo.  That opposition comes annually through the defense authorization bill, which since 2011 has included a ban on transfers to the US. This year\u2019s bill, which passed the House on 18 May, also restricts the transfers process by preventing the administration from transferring any detainee to a country subject to a state department travel warning \u2013 based on a standard far lower than a risk of terrorism or insurgency. It currently includes all of Europe. The White House has threatened to veto the defense bill, citing the Guant\u00e1namo provisions, among other reasons. Yet such veto threats have become an annual ritual. Every defense bill since 2011 that Obama ultimately signed included Guant\u00e1namo detainee restrictions.  Transferring those detainees cleared by either the 2010 internal review or by the parole board will not close the Guant\u00e1namo detention center.  Instead, it will bring the prison\u2019s population down to what administration officials tend to call an \u201cirreducible minimum\u201d by the time Obama leaves office in January. That number is likely to include people whom the US continues to hold indefinitely without charge \u2013 one of the main practices that has reaped international infamy for Guant\u00e1namo, motivating Obama\u2019s initial pledge to close it.",
