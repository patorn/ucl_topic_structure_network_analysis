  "body": "Name: Peter Alliss. Age: 85. Location: The doghouse. What a wonderful voice that man has. I could listen to him say anything. Anything? Are you sure about that? This is your last chance to back out. No. He\u2019s the voice of golf. I\u2019d listen to him say anything. Oh, really? Would you listen to his views on women joining prestigious golf clubs?   Related: Peter Alliss: women who want to play at Muirfield should marry a member    Pardon? Peter Alliss has said that if women want to play at Muirfield \u2013 which has had an unsuccessful ballot to allow women to join \u2013 then they should marry an existing member. Are you paraphrasing? \u201cThe women who are there as wives of husbands, they get all the facilities. If somebody wants to join, well, you\u2019d better get married to somebody who\u2019s a member.\u201d Oh. \u201cAll of the wives of members at these clubs could have used the facilities for free. When I was at Muirfield a couple of years ago, talking to a few of the lady members, I said: \u2018What about this equality? You must be happy about that?\u2019 \u2018God no,\u2019 they said.\u201d Oh God. Last year, the BBC had to apologise because, as Zach Johnson was about to win the Open, Alliss said of his wife: \u201cShe is probably thinking, \u2018If this goes in, I get a new kitchen.\u2019\u201d OK, he\u2019s a man out of time. Once he said, apropos of nothing: \u201cCarol Vorderman. I like her. I was watching her the other day and I got aroused.\u201d   Related: I love golf, Muirfield, but I don\u2019t want to join your snotty club | Alice Arnold    He\u2019s 85, for crying out loud. He\u2019s lived through so many different eras. He lived through the war. Can you blame him for not keeping up with the political zeitgeist? \u201cI want to join the WVS [Women\u2019s Voluntary Service] but unless I have a few bits and pieces nipped away on my body, I\u2019m not going to be able to get in.\u201d Oh dear. Are you sure you\u2019d still listen to him say anything? Maybe not. Alliss should learn the importance of equality. He really should. After all, if men are allowed to act like ridiculous, silly-trousered idiots, chasing their precious balls around their expensive private parks in their dumb little clown cars, then women have every right to act like that too. I\u2019m not sure who I feel most sorry for right now. Me neither. Do say: \u201cWhat about this equality?\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cWhatever next? Lady doctors?\u201d",
