  "body": "Dong Energy, the Danish company that has invested \u00a36bn in UK offshore wind power, is planning to float in what would be one of Europe\u2019s biggest listings this year. Dong is already the single largest investor in UK offshore wind projects and plans a further \u00a35bn of spending over the next five years. The state-owned utility said it intended to launch an initial public offering (IPO) on Nasdaq Copenhagen, but would not comment on the potential valuation of the company. However, analysts estimated it could be valued at about 80bn Danish kroner (\u00a38.5bn), making it Denmark\u2019s largest ever flotation. \u201cBarring unforeseen circumstances and subject to prevailing market conditions, the IPO could be launched for a listing in summer 2016,\u201d the company said in a statement on Thursday. Dong employs 700 people in Britain, where its assets include the 175-turbine London Array windfarm off the Kent coast, which was the world\u2019s biggest windfarm when it was built in 2012.   Related: World's largest offshore windfarm to be built off Yorkshire coast    The company has also committed to the Hornsea One facility, off the east Yorkshire coast, which will be the largest offshore windfarm when it is completed in 2020. Some analysts have put the cost at up to \u00a33bn. Dong said its UK windfarms meet the electricity needs of 2m homes, which will rise to 3.3m when projects under construction are operational. It is in the process of transforming itself from a high- to low-carbon power producer, and its chief executive, Henrik Poulsen, said the flotation was a \u201cstepping stone\u201d in that process. He said: \u201cWe have a robust and highly visible build-out plan for offshore wind, which will deliver strong and profitable growth in the coming years. \u201cThe planned IPO will create a strong platform for Dong Energy as we continue to lead the transformation of the energy system.\u201d If the IPO goes ahead as planned, Dong said shareholders would sell about 15% of the existing shares. The Danish government \u2013 a majority shareholder with almost 59% \u2013 will sell part of its stake but maintain a 50.1% share of the business. Poulsen said: \u201cThe IPO will raise the profile of the company, not only locally but globally. We\u2019ll have a much more diverse global investor base.\u201d  The company will not issue any new share capital as part of the IPO.  Claus Hjort Frederiksen, Denmark\u2019s finance minister, said: \u201cWe are proud of Dong Energy\u2019s development in renewable energy and its contribution to a sustainable future. \u201cThe IPO has the support of a broad majority in parliament, and we look forward to following the company\u2019s continued journey as a listed company.\u201d",
