  "body": "I treat some of the sickest patients admitted to hospital and making decisions about resuscitation is a routine part of my job. In addition to being a doctor, I am also younger brother to Neil, who has severe learning disabilities. Communication is key in all aspects of healthcare, but particularly in end-of-life decisions. As doctors we are encouraged and obliged to discuss resuscitation with patients and, if appropriate, their families. In the vast majority of cases, a simple, honest conversation ensures that all parties are in agreement. As a more junior doctor, I shied away from bringing up what I considered a morbid subject. Why upset the jovial 85 year-old I\u2019ve just admitted with talk of death? But now I realise that explaining the best and worse case scenarios is the right approach. Cardiac arrest is an incredibly vast and complex topic. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is equally complicated. Yet unfortunately many people have an inaccurate perception of what resuscitation can achieve. Perhaps this is perpetuated by television and film, but the responsibility to educate lies with the medical profession. We teach CPR to the public, which has been shown to lead to a huge improvement in recovery from out-of-hospital cardiac arrests. These are patients that are well, but suddenly collapse due to their heart going into a dangerous rhythm. Most of these cases are due to heart problems such as a heart attack. In these patients CPR is vital and helpful in many cases. Nevertheless, many patients will not survive even with effective CPR. Hospitalised patients are a very different population. If the primary problem is something like a severe infection that has overwhelmed the patient\u2019s body, their heart might stop even if there is no intrinsic cardiac problem. Therefore CPR has an incredibly low success rate. CPR is an aggressive, invasive procedure which one should not be subjected to unless there is a reasonable chance of success. Even if we successfully restart the heart, patients often remain on a breathing machine for days to weeks as we wait to see if brain damage has occurred. It frequently has. Patients with learning disabilities present an additional layer of complexity. If they are able to make decisions about their care, of course they should be involved. My brother Neil has an accelerated form of dementia which is also commonly seen in Down\u2019s syndrome. He has challenging medical needs including epilepsy and diabetes. He also has absolutely no ability to make decisions about his treatment. My mother and I are his guardians and are involved in all aspects of his care. If Neil was admitted to hospital in future and he had a Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) completed, I would want to be involved in this decision. This does not mean my permission needs to be sought; resuscitation is a medical treatment and ultimately the decision to withhold it is one that rests with the responsible physician. Forcing family members into deciding on a complex medical intervention is unfair.  If Neil lived away from his family, was bed bound and could only be fed via a tube, a DNR order would be appropriate. I speak only for my brother, but if someone currently so full of energy became bed bound and unable to eat due to his dementia progressing, he would not have any reasonable quality of life and I would not want to prolong his suffering. People with even profound learning disabilities can lead full and active lives. Treating them can be challenging but immensely rewarding. Including their family and carers is imperative, as no one can advise medical professionals better about a patient\u2019s quality of life than those who know them best. The charity Mencap has highlighted what they see as failings within the NHS leading to premature deaths of people with learning disabilities. This is a worrying finding and one I hope leads to additional training for healthcare professionals, to avoid upsetting patients and family members by not communicating properly. We all want the best for our loved ones. As a doctor and as a brother, my priorities are the same. It is important to consider the future and realise that, especially in learning-disabled patients, end of life decisions are multi-faceted. If a doctor broaches the topic of resuscitation, they are doing it in the best interests of their patient. Resuscitation is not a panacea and a DNR does not mean withdrawal of treatment. Our objective is to heal the sick, but when we are unable, to prevent suffering. Conversations about death are not as frequent as they should be in the UK. With appropriate preparation, hopefully we can all achieve a good death. All that remains should be fond memories, rather than unpleasant disputes with hospitals or care homes.
