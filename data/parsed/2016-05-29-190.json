  "body": "We\u2019ve walked the mean streets of Hebden Bridge in Happy Valley and been gripped by Red Riding, David Peace\u2019s hallucinatory take on the Yorkshire Ripper. Now a new crime series is set to put Bradford\u2019s satanic mills in the spotlight. Streets of Darkness, by AA Dhand, follows suspended police detective Harry Virdee as he tries to solve a murder within 24 hours in a city riven with tensions and on the verge of a race riot as bad as those that took place there in 2001. The result is a tense slice of neo-noir that has won Dhand comparisons to both BBC drama Luther and HBO\u2019s The Wire. Television rights were sold before the book\u2019s publication in June, with FilmWave, the producer behind the recent adaptation of JK Rowling\u2019s The Casual Vacancy, working with Dhand on a series. \u201cI\u2019d been writing for a while before I came up with the idea for this story,\u201d says Dhand, who continues to work as a pharmacist in Bradford. \u201cI kept trying things that didn\u2019t work because they drew on the detective fiction I\u2019d already read \u2013 so heavy-drinking white detectives with family problems. That\u2019s great but it wasn\u2019t credible when I wrote it.\u201d He continues: \u201cI wanted to create characters who hadn\u2019t been seen before, yet at the same time I didn\u2019t want Harry to just be intensely Asian for the sake of it because that also wasn\u2019t credible. It was important that the character and setting both felt right.\u201d     Idris Elba in Luther. Streets of Darkness has been compared to the acclaimed BBC drama. Photograph: Steffan Hill/AP    The central storyline about the murder of a prominent Bradford businessman, which initially appears to have a BNP connection, came together when Dhand realised it was coming up to the 15-year anniversary of the Bradford riots. \u201cThere\u2019s a darkness to every city and I do think Bradford gets a negative press,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to take that conception and somehow subvert it. There\u2019s this idea that the story of the Bradford riots is a story of Asians going crazy \u2013 we lost control of the message in that way \u2013 and I wanted to write a book where it seems like a similar thing is about to unfold, but instead the real story is something very different.\u201d Key to that story is his charismatic lead character, a Sikh police officer with a very clear sense both of his identity and his position within the world. \u201cHarry would describe himself as British English,\u201d says Dhand. \u201cHis identity is British and that was important to me because I really wanted a character of Indian parentage and heritage who was also living in the here and now. \u201cI think it can be very easy to take identity for granted, yet at the same time people seem not to know what it is to be British these days. To me it\u2019s about acceptance, tolerance and patriotism about your city and country. And that\u2019s true of everyone. \u201cYou can have a character like Luther who is played by Idris Elba and is black, but if he were played by a white actor he would still be totally compelling, in the same way James Bond doesn\u2019t have to be played by a white man, it\u2019s the character that works. \u201cAlthough Harry is Asian, that\u2019s not what defines him and that\u2019s not how he would define himself.\u201d That\u2019s not to say that Harry\u2019s background and heritage is ignored. A key plot strand regards his wife, Saima, who is Muslim, a relationship that has caused difficulties with both sets of parents. \u201cThat was really important to me because the pharmacy I work at is connected to a women\u2019s refuge centre and I\u2019d had so many conversations with young Asian women about how lost and marginalised and judged they felt for marrying outside their religion,\u201d says Dhand, the son of Punjabi Hindus who describes himself as agnostic. \u201cAt the same time, a lot of what you read about the Asian community is all about shame and dishonour and I wanted instead to present a relationship where they bounce off each other and understand each other. Saima is a fierce woman. She\u2019s formidable.\u201d     John Henshaw, David Morrissey and Andrew Garfield in Channel 4\u2019s Red Riding. Photograph: c.IFC Films/Everett / Rex Features    Until recently, Dhand continued to put in shifts at the family corner shop \u2013 \u201calthough that\u2019s now sold, thankfully\u201d \u2013 as well as working at the pharmacy. He credits both jobs with giving him the insights needed to portray every aspect of Bradfordian life, from the wheelers and dealers in the mayor\u2019s office to the heroin addicts on the fringes. \u201cYou\u2019re dealing with people all day and you learn so much about them,\u201d he says. \u201cI probably serve about 300 people a day \u2026 It\u2019s a constant conversation. You learn what people are scared about. You learn what their habits are, what they buy, how they talk. I\u2019ll sell nicotine patches to someone one day and the next day they\u2019re back buying 20 cigarettes.\u201d For FilmWave, the book\u2019s appeal lies in that air of verisimilitude. The company\u2019s founder, Paul Trijbits, has described it as intense and timely, but Dhand says he just hopes that people find his home city a fascinating place to hang out. \u201cI love it that people have made comparisons to The Wire and I would love it if people read the books \u2013 or later saw the TV series \u2013 and got a feel for Bradford in the same way,\u201d he says. \u201cI walk around this city and it feels like nothing else, with the old world represented by the mills and then the new world of Bradford City Park and the waterfall and fountains. It\u2019s a calmer city since the days of the riots in 2001 but still its own place. Walking around in it does sometimes feel like being in a film and I hope that sense of atmosphere comes across.\u201d Streets of Darkness by AA Dhand is published by Transworld on 16 June.
