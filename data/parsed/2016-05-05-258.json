  "body": "In a period of rapid expansion and change in higher education, university boards are increasingly tasked with the future-proofing of their institutions.  Last week it was reported that the sector is set to borrow \u00a33bn to fund major new building projects. These include plans for a new campus for University College London at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in east London and a second \u00a31bn research-focused campus in White City for Imperial College London. The University of Glasgow has also acquired a 14-acre site for another campus. As well as this building boom, universities are anticipating legislative change, with higher education reforms expected to be announced as part of the Queen\u2019s speech on 18 May. The reforms are expected to make it easier for private providers to enter the market to compete with established providers. There is a greater focus on attracting students after the lifting of the numbers cap last year, and competition from global universities for the international student market. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of change to deal with, both legislative change and in terms of capital projects,\u201d says Martin Conway, the deputy secretary of the University of Manchester, who also has a role in the organisation of the university\u2019s board. \u201cOne of the ways we have approached this is to try to recruit more broadly \u2013 instead of doing our usual advert in the Sunday Times, we\u2019ve done a recruitment drive to look for more diverse people from different backgrounds, and from further afield.\u201d Critical friend Conway says one of the most significant activities that the university has overseen in recent years has been a bond proposal and a new master plan, but that the main role of the board is to be a critical friend in these situations.  \u201cIt\u2019s oversight rather than leadership, but it is still helpful to have people with the right expertise in these areas to give the right advice. \u201cNext we may look internationally for lay board members as the university has an international role, and also for people with specific experience in the oversight of capital projects,\u201d he says. Alison Cressey is an independent board member of Falmouth University who was selected specifically for her commercial background in the creative industries and experience as CEO of Women in Games. The small creative arts university in Cornwall almost doubled in size between 2006 and 2015, and has ambitious plans for the future.  Cressey says Falmouth was especially interested in her expertise because it was starting Launchpad, a business entrepreneurship graduate programme designed to help students start new games companies. She says she has been able to ask searching questions and support the course director as a board member. Nimble and vocal Her main advice for modern university boards is to make them nimble, vocal and challenging, as well as diverse in terms of skills and background: \u201cI would also add, they could do with being smaller \u2013 many universities have up to 30 people on board, but that\u2019s too large.\u201d \u201cYou need to all be able to speak and to hear each other. You need to have trust and good relationships between everyone to do the task well. And that task is to have candid, robust conversations with senior leadership.\u201d Similar advice is given by Stephen Parker, chair of the board of governors at Coventry University. He agrees that it is important to be able to have robust conversations with the university, a diverse skillset on the board and good relationships that are \u201cboth thoughtful and action-based\u201d, but says that accountability and evidence-based decisions are also crucial in the whirlwind of change. \u201cAll of our decision-making processes are very traceable \u2013 you can track each suggestion back to the person who made it. We also use data. If a new idea, a new strategy, was suggested we would evaluate, in a data-driven way, where it should be put in the pecking order of our priorities.\u201d Strategic plan The Coventry board uses what it calls a \u201cstrategic roadmap\u201d to guide decision-making, but Parker adds that decisions can still be made expediently where necessary.  \u201cThe university wanted a way of providing flexible learning opportunities for people in work, of the same academic standard as the main university, and so we set up the Coventry University College in 12 months. We can be quick \u2013 we have to be quite efficient with our time.\u201d Universities are very complex, says Parker, and consequently university boards can feel like a mixture of a charitable trust and a commercial board. Board members have to keep in mind the purpose of a higher education institution: \u201cIf you lose sight of what a university is about \u2013 learning, teaching, expanding knowledge \u2013 then you\u2019ll get lost.\u201d Join the higher education network for more comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.
