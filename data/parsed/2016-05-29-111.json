  "body": "This time last year, BJ Novak was already an acclaimed actor, stand-up comedian and author. He had starred in Hollywood movies (Inglourious Basterds, Saving Mr Banks) and popular sitcoms (the American version of The Office, The Mindy Project). His children\u2019s book had been a New York Times bestseller for several months. His collection of short stories had been garlanded with praise. He was the worst kind of high-achiever, in that his achievements were myriad and in different fields. People were calling him a polymath and they weren\u2019t even being sarcastic. Unlike James Franco, another actor who tried his hand at creative writing only to be roundly derided by the critics, Novak actually seemed to be good at the many things he was doing. Was he ever worried about being called pretentious? \u201cNot pretentious,\u201d says Novak when we meet on a sunny afternoon at Soho House, West Hollywood. \u201cFor me, it was more [the worry of] seeming distracted from my main work by a side project I was oddly passionate about. And side projects \u2013 especially from celebrities \u2013 don\u2019t tend to be successful either, they tend to be distractions.\u201d Still, even all those side projects (and it\u2019s worth pointing out that he also served as a writer on The Office and executive produced The Mindy Project) weren\u2019t quite enough to sate Novak\u2019s ambitions. He wanted to be a millionaire tech entrepreneur, too. As a little kid growing up in Boston, his earliest ambition was \u201cto be a real-estate developer. I think I had some vague awareness of Donald Trump. Like, \u2018I want to put my name on buildings, I want to be rich and important and a businessman!\u2019\u201d You don\u2019t get many Hollywood liberals admitting that Trump used to be their hero, I tell him. \u201cBut culturally, he\u2019s an icon,\u201d counters Novak. \u201cI think a secret aspect of [his popularity] is how familiar he is. He\u2019s not a crazy man on the street, he\u2019s the crazy uncle that\u2019s been at your Thanksgiving for 30 fucking years! He\u2019s been there for ever. So I think people feel safe with him considering how outrageous he is as a candidate. There is some subliminal comfort with him.\u201d     \u2018I am proud of being associated with quality things\u2019: as Ryan Howard in the US version of The Office. Photograph: UPPA/Photoshot    In pursuit of his Trumpian dream to become a multi- millionaire businessman, Novak came up with an idea for an app. His idea was deceptively simple: lists. Lists of things people wanted to share, such as recommendations of the best places to eat in Paris or five of their all-time favourite ice-cream flavours or three pieces of advice for a first date. Novak got backing from private investors, hired some of the best people (his co-founder Dev Flaherty is a tech developer and Stanford graduate), set up an office in Venice Beach and launched the Li.st app for iPhone last October. In its first four months, it has amassed more than 250,000 lists, many of them compiled by celebrity users such as Lena Dunham, who admitted to lusting after a small marsupial sugar glider in \u201cExotic Pets I Want\u201d or Snoop Dogg who puts \u201cthyme\u201d at number one of his \u201cTop Five Essential Herbs\u201d. You can make anything into a list, says Novak. Although he conceived the app as a sort of advice-sharing mechanism, it\u2019s actually turned into a medium for \u201cstructured self-expression\u2026 If I asked you: \u2018Hey, would you write me an essay about your father?\u2019 it\u2019s such an enormous ask. If I send you a list request for \u2018memories of your dad from childhood\u2019 \u2013 any of us can come up with seven, random, funny memories. And before you know it it\u2019s very involving.\u201d    One night I was lying awake in bed and my mum came in and asked: \u2018Can\u2019t you ever just think stupid thoughts?\u2019    So, in the spirit of the Li.st, the top five things I learn about BJ Novak in the first 10 minutes of meeting him are: 1. He is wearing a lot of clothes. Despite the Californian heat, Novak is dressed in dark jeans, a black T-shirt, a navy-blue blouson jacket and a baseball cap emblazoned with the single letter \u201cB\u201d. When he takes off this cap at several points during the interview, his hair is slick with sweat. He then puts it back on again. 2. He orders green tea and, when it arrives, studiously ignores the biscuit on the side of the saucer. 3. He wants to run for mayor of Los Angeles. One of his flagship policies would be that everyone would have to refer to the city by its full name and not as \u201cLA\u201d because it\u2019s \u201cbad branding\u201d. Another would be founding a museum of hip-hop in the suburb of Compton. 4. He\u2019s smart. Very smart. He speaks rapidly, almost nervously, and he throws out ideas at a median rate of 35 a minute (approximate guess). 5. He doesn\u2019t smile that much. When he does, you feel like you\u2019ve done something unexpectedly brilliant.     \u2018We\u2019re very close in sort of a natural, eternal way,\u2019: with co-star Mindy Kaling. The pair have been offered a rumoured $7.5m to write about their friendship. Photograph: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images    Of course, it\u2019s unfair to expect someone to be constantly cracking jokes and gurning with hilarity simply because they are known for their comedic presence on-screen. And Novak clearly has a lot going on inside that sweaty head of his. His father was a writer who ghosted Nancy Reagan\u2019s memoirs and Novak, the eldest of three boys, describes himself as a \u201cthoughtful\u201d child. \u201cI remember my mum coming into my bedroom when I was lying awake one night and she asked what I was thinking of\u2026 And I was telling her about the inventions I would invent and she said, \u2018Can\u2019t you ever just think stupid thoughts?\u2019\u201d Novak went on to Harvard and did his thesis on the film adaptations of Shakespeare\u2019s plays (his favourite is Kenneth Branagh\u2019s Hamlet because \u201cit was not obsessed with novelty and it was not obsessed with fidelity\u201d.) He moved to LA\u2026 sorry, Los Angeles, after graduating and started out on the stand-up circuit as a way of testing his writing on a wider audience. Then he fell into acting and found he enjoyed it. His parents are said to have set up a Jewish matchmaking service. Is that true? \u201cYeah, that\u2019s one of those questions that comes up every time.\u201d That\u2019s because it\u2019s in your Wikipedia entry. \u201cWell I\u2019m not going to take it off. It\u2019s not not-true, but it\u2019s not like a big aspect of my life. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s interesting.\u201d Don\u2019t you? I think it\u2019s completely fascinating. Were they always trying to matchmake you? \u201cNo.\u201d     Spoonfuls of sugar: with Jason Schwartzman in Saving Mr Banks. Photograph: Photoshot    At 36, Novak is single, but has been engaged in a highly public on-off flirtation with his co-star from The Office, Mindy Kaling, for years. They used to date, but then realised they spent most of their time arguing, so broke up. They still have an intensely close friendship. In the past, Kaling has described Novak as \u201cintoxicating\u201d and referred to the two of them as \u201csoup snakes\u201d \u2013 a reference to a scene in The Office where a character writes a romantic note to his girlfriend only to misread \u201csoul-mates\u201d as \u201csoup-snakes\u201d. They signed a rumoured $7.5m joint book deal last year to write about their long friendship. \u201cWe\u2019re very close in sort of a natural, eternal way,\u201d says Novak, before getting his phone and reading out a series of recent texts from Kaling. \u201cShe texted me: \u2018Remake I Dream of Jeannie with me. You be Larry Hagman.\u2019 This was on Saturday. Then I texted her: \u2018I\u2019m writing a list: Eight Times Mindy Kaling Bullied Me on the Set of The Office.\u2019 So I was asking her details for that.\u201d    His book has sold more than 1m copies. When he tours primary schools, he is greeted like a hero    She used to bully you? He cracks a smile. A huge grin that seems to take over the entire lower half of his face. \u201cShe would lie to me. She would make up these \u2013 just out of nowhere \u2013 purposeless lies that I believed. Like saying that Allison Jones, the casting director of The Office, was also an actress who had been the third lead in Cold Mountain. And so I just thought that. \u201cAnd there was this director, this older woman who directed a couple of episodes, and Mindy told me I couldn\u2019t tell anyone, but Greg Daniels, the show runner, used to date this woman in college. And then Greg asked me what I thought of her cut and I lied to Greg and said I thought it was great, because I was nervous to insult his ex-girlfriend, so he didn\u2019t make the edits that I wanted. \u201cAnd later I asked him about it and he was like, \u2018What are you talking about? She\u2019s 20 years older than I am, we didn\u2019t go to college together!\u2019 I realised that Mindy just made it up and\u201d \u2013 he breaks off, laughing \u2013 \u201cit actually affected my work life!\u201d     \u2018Kids care whether or not you have the book on you, they don\u2019t care whether you wrote it\u2019: reading from his latest book in New York. Photograph: Unique Nicole/FilmMagic    Even though romance hasn\u2019t blossomed with Mindy or through his parents\u2019 Jewish matchmaking service, Novak is open about the fact that he wants to meet someone and be a father someday. \u201cYeah. I just need more of a test audience.\u201d Still, the fact that he has no kids hasn\u2019t stopped him becoming a hugely successful children\u2019s author. Novak wrote The Book With No Pictures after testing it out on his best friend\u2019s two-year-old, Bruce. Again, the idea is winningly simple: the book consists entirely of funny things the person reading it must say out loud (\u201cMy head is made of blueberry pizza\u201d). It has sold more than 1m copies in the US and has been translated into 26 languages. When Novak tours primary schools, he is greeted like a hero. The people who stop him in the street now fall into two distinct categories. The first are those who say: \u201cLove your work\u201d (\u201cI think you say it to everyone,\u201d says Novak. \u201cI think you say that to Russell Crowe, I think you say that to George Saunders, I think it could mean absolutely anything. \u2018Love your work!\u2019 As though they\u2019ve been poring over my \u2018work\u2019.\u201d) The other half are excitable parents who come up to him with their children in tow. \u201cGenerally, kids care whether or not you have the book on you, they don\u2019t care whether you wrote it.\u201d Novak thinks of himself as a writer first and foremost. He has always struck me as someone who has chosen not to be as famous as he could have been, I tell him. \u201cI think I am very proud of being associated with quality things. So if I were massively famous for doing massively beloved things, yeah, that sounds great. I think the pickiness is really just about\u2026 I want to be in cool things.\u201d He removes his baseball cap, then smoothes back his hair. His eyes dart left and right, like a magpie looking for shiny things to steal. I can sense his attention wandering on to the next thought, the next big idea. So, I say: \u201cAt 36 you\u2019re more than halfway through your allotted biblical time\u2026\u201d \u201cBiblical time?\u201d he jokes, \u201cIn biblical time, I could live to 860.\u201d But is that something you are aware of? That there are only a finite number of years left in which to achieve the things you want to achieve? \u201cSure. But why do you ask?\u201d Because it\u2019s an interview and it\u2019s my job to come up with the questions. \u201cSo, are you asking: is mortality behind my drive?\u201d Yes. There is a long pause, emphasised by the fact that Novak actually says: \u201cHe takes a long pause, pondering the universe and its destiny\u2026\u201d Eventually, he concludes: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I mean, I don\u2019t think so more than anyone else.\u201d Three Things I Notice About BJ Novak As He Leaves The Interview: 1. The biscuit is still untouched. 2. He walks rapidly, as though fuelled by his own nervous energy. 3. He is probably going to take over the world.",
