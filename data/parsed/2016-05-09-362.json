  "body": "Komal never told her friends where she really went for six months last year. The 24-year-old, from the town of Kota, in western India, went to see Dr Amar Sarin, an orthopaedic surgeon in Delhi, who made her eight centimetres (3in) taller, a procedure which involved breaking the bones in her legs and wearing a brace until she could walk again.   Related: India's long wait for justice: 27m court cases trapped in legal logjam    Her parents had to sell the family\u2019s ancestral lands so she could get the surgery, but for Komal, the extra height is worth it. \u201cI have so much confidence now,\u201d she says. \u201cI was just 4\u2019 6\u201d [137cm]. People used to make fun of me and I couldn\u2019t get a job. Now my younger sister is doing it, too.\u201d In a country where height is considered attractive, Komal is one of a growing number of young Indians using their increasing prosperity to improve their marriage and career prospects, and fuelling a cosmetic surgery boom. However, limb lengthening surgery is completely unregulated in India and many of the surgeons performing it lack experience. As it also carries a certain stigma, the Guardian has chosen not to reveal Komal\u2019s real name.  Dr Sarin says: \u201cThis is one of the most difficult cosmetic surgeries to perform, and people are doing it after just one or two months\u2019 fellowship, following a doctor who is probably experimenting himself. There are no colleges, no proper training, nothing.\u201d     Patients recover after undergoing limb lengthening surgery. Photograph: Amara Sarin    Prospective patients appear undaunted, including those from abroad. India\u2019s reputation for cheap and well-trained doctors attracts people from around the world, in a medical tourism industry worth an estimated $3bn. Cosmetic surgeries make up a large slice of that figure, drawing increasing numbers from countries in Europe, America and elsewhere where procedures can cost four or five times as much. Dr Sarin, who started offering the surgery five years ago, has treated 300 patients already, and only a third of them are from India. \u201cIt is a growing trend in India,\u201d he says. \u201cI get around 20 calls a day, with people telling me \u2018I want to be tall, I have to be taller.\u2019\u201d One man who had surgery in 2015 says he met at least 20 doctors before deciding to go ahead with the procedure. \u201cMany of the doctors I approached had only done it once or twice before, and one had never ever done it before. I searched for around one year before I found the right person to do it.\u201d  Last month, an ethics committee in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh summoned orthopaedic surgeons who had operated on a 23-year-old man, after doctors raised concerns about why \u201cunusual, experimental surgery\u201d was performed. The surgery divides orthopaedic specialists in India, many of whom contend that the surgery is extremely difficult to perform and can cripple people for life.

Photograph: Amar Sarin    Dr Sudhir Kapoor, the president of the Indian Orthopaedic Association, says: \u201cWe don\u2019t recommend for people to do this surgery except for in very rare cases. These surgeries are not done routinely and there\u2019s a high risk of complications.\u201d Limb lengthening surgery was pioneered in the 1950s, in a small Soviet town called Kurgan in Siberia. Its inventor, a Polish man named Gavriil Ilizarov, once dismissed as a quack, became known as the \u201cmagician from Kurgan\u201d, after he performed orthopaedic operations on people including an Olympic high jump champion. Ilizarov never intended for his technique to be used for cosmetic purposes; his work was targeted at people who had had accidents or were born with limbs of different lengths. Now, the controversial Ilizarov technique is being used by surgeons across India, though with many modern modifications to make it quicker and less painful. Sarin, who has earned an international reputation for his skill in performing the surgery, says he struggled with the ethics of performing it at first. \u201cI used to wonder whether what I\u2019m doing is right, but when I saw how much their self-esteem was improving, I decided to keep going,\u201d he says.    It\u2019s worth it when you see how much their self esteem grows  Amar Sarin, surgeon     The surgery should be used only as a last resort, he adds. \u201cWe often turn people away,\u201d he says, explaining many of his patients have suffered acute psychological disorders. \u201cWe try counselling first, but we\u2019ve had patients who even threaten to commit suicide if I refuse to do the surgery. Twice I\u2019ve had to call the police in emergency situations like that.\u201d Though he has performed the surgery successfully on hundreds of people, Sarin admits: \u201cIt\u2019s madness to do it.\u201d Still, he feels successful limb lengthening can transform a person\u2019s life: \u201cYou can barely recognise them. It\u2019s worth it when you see how much their self esteem grows.\u201d",
