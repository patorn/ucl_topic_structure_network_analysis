  "body": "Players who fail a drug test and receive a provisional ban \u2013 such as Maria Sharapova in March \u2013 should be named, the International Tennis Federation president, David Haggerty, has told the Guardian. This would help eradicate suspicions about players who mysteriously disappear from the Tour while the suspension is played out before an official decision on their guilt or innocence is announced. Marin Cilic is a case in point from the past \u2013 when it was misleadingly claimed that he left Wimbledon because of injury, though the ITF accepted his account that he had ingested a stimulant inadvertently \u2013 and Sharapova exposed the fallacy of the policy when she held a televised press conference in Los Angeles in March to announce her own failed drug test at the Australian Open in January. \u201cWe\u2019ve discussed the possibility of announcing provisional suspensions, as a way to be transparent as to what\u2019s going on,\u201d Haggerty said. \u201cI think that you\u2019ll see after Wimbledon some announcements because each of seven bodies has to go back to their stakeholders and have formal approval of things. But we understand the importance of transparency. We\u2019re also doing that with the integrity unit; they\u2019ve begun to publish a quarterly report.\u201d So secretive has the federation had to be to comply with out-of-date protocols that Haggerty could not even confirm in our exclusive interview that Sharapova\u2019s hearing into the ban began in London two weeks ago, and a decision was expected shortly. He would only say: \u201cI really can\u2019t tell you what [the date of a decision] would be but what I can tell you is, generally, it\u2019s about a three-week process from when the hearing occurs until something is published.\u201d Further anomalies remain, however. Rafael Nadal recently met with little enthusiasm when he asked the ITF to publish the records of all his drug tests, to kill rumours he had been using performance-enhancing substances. Haggerty said: \u201cUnder the rules that we have today he made a statement and we were able to collaborate that statement. I think what will happen in the future with provisional suspensions is it would become known. In theory, then, anything you hear means there is a suspension; if you don\u2019t hear anything, there isn\u2019t a suspension. The challenge is, when you have a set of rules, you have to follow them. \u201cBut now we\u2019re saying, \u2018Let\u2019s look at the rules. Are they fit for purpose? Are there ways to adapt them, so that perhaps there is a more logical way for things to be done, could be done?\u201d In response to the gathering storm of criticism that administrators are not doing enough to fight drug-taking and match-fixing, Haggerty admits the ITF has had to move quickly to save the game\u2019s reputation after reheated allegations on the BBC and BuzzFeed during the Australian Open, three months after he took over the presidency from the Italian Francesco Ricci Bitti, who had been in the post for 16 years. \u201cThe seven stakeholders have gotten together here and understand that integrity is the most important part of our reputation. Zero tolerance is really what we believe in. No player, no administrator, no official is above the law. \u201cWe\u2019ve got six regional associations and 211 member nations and we\u2019ve just got to make sure we do everything we can to keep tennis clean. We want the players to participate, we want fans to believe that what they see on the court is a key sport. \u201cWe want to continue to put rigour into the system, to do more biological passports, to do more out-of-competition testing. We want to protect the clean athletes, and the majority of them are. We will keep more samples for a longer period of time, so, as new testing comes, you may discover some things that you didn\u2019t discover early on. You see that with what the IOC are doing with the Beijing [and London] Olympics. You can always build a better mousetrap, but you have to be open to thinking what you need to do.\u201d Match-fixing remains the game\u2019s other irritant. Haggerty concedes: \u201cWe need to do more with officials, with the players at the pro circuit levels, as well as what we\u2019re doing at the Challengers and the grand slam events. We need to put more rigour into it. We maybe need to invest more funding. We\u2019ve added another investigator, we\u2019ve added another analyst, to try to make it more robust. There has been no request from the TIU [Tennis Integrity Unit] turned down, financial resources, whatever.\u201d",
