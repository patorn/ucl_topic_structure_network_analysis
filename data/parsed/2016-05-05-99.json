  "body": "South Yorkshire police sought to influence media reporting of the recent inquests into the deaths of 96 people in the Hillsborough disaster and secure positive coverage, according to a former communications specialist employed by the embattled force. Hayley Court told the Guardian she was instructed to emphasise evidence considered favourable to the force to journalists attending the hearings, including allegations of misbehaviour by Liverpool supporters.    Related: Hillsborough disaster: deadly mistakes and lies that lasted decades    She said she felt duty-bound to expose the South Yorkshire police\u2019s media strategy \u2013 which she said she refused to follow and always complained was unethical \u2013 now the inquests were concluded, with the jury\u2019s verdicts of unlawful killing and exoneration of supporters. \u201cThe South Yorkshire police, having made a full apology for the Hillsborough disaster in 2012, should not have been seeking to spread the blame on to others, including Liverpool supporters, at the inquests, and seeking to influence the media to take that line,\u201d Court said. She added: \u201cI tried to make this point in every formal way within the South Yorkshire police, but in response I faced criticism for my own performance and felt bullied. The police are upheld as models of behaviour in society; South Yorkshire police rely now on being a very different force from 1989, yet unfortunately there are still similarities. It is so important for public confidence in the police that South Yorkshire police finally recognise this and reform.\u201d Court, an experienced journalist who worked from 2010-13 for Hampshire constabulary as a media relations officer, was the acting director of communications for the Association of Chief Police Officers when she was headhunted by South Yorkshire police to work specifically on the Hillsborough inquests.  She said she believed it was an opportunity to help South Yorkshire police deal truthfully and face their failings which caused the disaster, and their conduct in the aftermath, when the force blamed innocent supporters who were the victims of the lethal crush at the 1989 FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. She planned to write objective, daily reports from the inquests for the force\u2019s website, and to prepare for its stance afterwards, which she believed should be to accept responsibility. However, from her first day in the job, 19 May 2014, Court said she was expected to be a \u201cspin doctor\u201d for the force at the inquests at the court in Warrington. Court said she was told: \u201cYour job is to round up the media at the end of the day and tell them: \u2018This is the line.\u2019\u201d Court said it was clear to her that the \u201cline\u201d was to prominently highlight evidence that suggested South Yorkshire police\u2019s failings were not in fact to blame for the disaster, and to stress any evidence given by witnesses that supporters had misbehaved.   Related: Hillsborough families criticise South Yorkshire PCC over inquest tactics    \u201cI took that as being told my job was to tell the media what they would be reporting, which isn\u2019t ethical or even possible to do,\u201d Court said. \u201cNo self-respecting member of the press is going to listen to that, especially from a press officer working for one of the culprits of the Hillsborough disaster. It was an impossible task \u2013 and secondly, I just wasn\u2019t prepared to get involved in doing it.\u201d In a 20-week review of Court\u2019s performance, in November 2014, when she was signed off sick with depression following her complaints of bullying, the South Yorkshire police head of communications, Carrie Goodwin, acknowledged: \u201cHayley disclosed that she felt she had been asked to act in an unethical manner in that she should coerce the media.\u201d Goodwin said she believed Court had misunderstood the instruction, and that in fact: \u201cHayley was asked to encourage the media to report on the positives (as well as accepting that they would report the negatives).\u201d  However, Goodwin accepted that: \u201cThe suggestion of how Hayley might do this would have presented SYP in an unprofessional light as it did not meet with \u2018media etiquette\u2019.\u201d Another internal report, on Court\u2019s complaint that she was being bullied, made it clear that South Yorkshire police believed media coverage of the Hillsborough inquests was biased against them, and managers claimed Court had failed to redress it. The internal investigation did not uphold that there had been \u201cintentional bullying\u201d of Court, but did find that \u201ca number of process issues\u201d in how she had been managed, including not having been set clear objectives for her role when she started at the Hillsborough inquests and negative feedback, had \u201ccaused Hayley to feel like she was the victim of bullying\u201d. The report, which the Guardian has seen, also concluded that Court herself had \u201cperformance issues\u201d to address. These included, the report stated: \u201cA failure to proactively redress the obvious imbalance in the media reporting of the inquests to the extent that evidential matters, significant to the force, were not being reported accurately.\u201d In response to detailed questions from the Guardian, South Yorkshire police did not clarify what evidence at the inquests into the 96 deaths it had considered \u201csignificant to the force\u201d or \u201cpositive\u201d, nor in what way it had considered there was \u201cobvious imbalance\u201d in the media coverage. In a statement, the force said: \u201cSpecifically in relation to the concerns raised about suggested unethical practices \u2026 these were not substantiated at the time [through the force\u2019s grievance procedures].\u201d     The chief constable of South Yorkshire police, David Crompton, was suspended in the wake of the Hillsborough inquest findings. Photograph: Dave Higgens/PA    After the verdicts last week, lawyers for families whose relatives were among the 96 people to die at Hillsborough furiously criticised South Yorkshire police\u2019s stance at the inquests, accusing the force of going back on its 2012 apology, and seeking to avoid responsibility and maintain its \u201ccover-up\u201d of blaming supporters. Families\u2019 lawyers complained that this adversarial approach doubled the length and multiplied the costs of the inquests, and caused the families great unnecessary distress. Court told the Guardian that her experience working within the South Yorkshire police team at the inquests confirmed that view of the force\u2019s legal strategy. The chief constable, David Crompton, was suspended last Wednesday by Alan Billings, the South Yorkshire police and crime commissioner, whom families have also criticised for failing to hold Crompton to account for the way the force conducted the inquests. Describing the last two years as \u201cwithout a doubt, the most difficult experience of my life\u201d, Court has this week made a full statement to the Independent Police Complaints Commission about her experience. She says she is not bitter, and remains supportive of the police and proud to have served for six years. Members of her family are police officers, and her partner is a serving officer in the South Yorkshire police. \u201cI have worked with incredibly talented and dedicated individuals and people who are as horrified by what has happened in relation to the Hillsborough inquests as I am,\u201d she said. \u201cI hate seeing good people tarred with the brush of collusion and cover-up, and believe the force needs to sincerely recognise its terrible management of the Hillsborough inquests.\u201d In its statement in response, the South Yorkshire police acknowledged Court\u2019s \u201cserious concerns\u201d about her role within its Hillsborough team. \u201cIt is clear that the staff member remains concerned about her experiences, and following the outcome of the Hillsborough inquests, we would like to talk to her and give these matters further consideration.\u201d",
