Four months after winning a historic landslide election, Tsai Ing-wen, from the Democratic Progressive party (DPP), formally took up her post on Friday morning. In a 25-minute inaugural speech she told thousands of supporters that the self-ruled island faced \u201ca multitude of challenges\u201d but pledged to fight for social injustice and to improve the lives of Taiwan\u2019s youth.  In a move likely to infuriate Beijing \u2013 which still views Taiwan as part of its territory \u2013 she also repeatedly referred to the self-reliant island as a \u201ccountry\u201d and refused to embrace the idea that Taiwan and mainland China were part of \u201cone China\u201d.    Related: The Guardian view on China and Taiwan: keep calm and carry on | Editorial    After her rise to power had been marked with a 21-gun salute, 59-year-old Tsai told the crowds: \u201cOnce again, the people of Taiwan have shown the world through our actions that we, as a free and democratic people, are committed to the defence of our freedom and democracy as a way of life. Each and every one of us participated in this journey. My dear fellow Taiwanese, we did it.\u201d Tsai, who some call the Angela Merkel of the east, said her government\u2019s top priority was reviving the island\u2019s flagging economy. \u201cThe people elected a new president and new government with one single expectation: solving problems,\u201d she said.  \u201cAt this very moment, Taiwan faces a difficult situation that requires its leaders to shoulder the burdens without hesitation. This is something I will not forget.\u201d  Earlier, Tsai escorted Ma Ying-jeou, the outgoing Nationalist party president, from the presidential palace in Taipei as part of the symbolic transfer of power. About 20,000 guests and supporters turned out to watch proceedings as Taiwan\u2019s first female leader took office.  \u201cI want to witness this sacred moment,\u201d Chen Su-mei, a 48-year-old teacher who was among the crowds, told Channel News Asia.  \u201cI hope she will bring more stability to Taiwan and revive our economy. We have high hopes for her.\u201d Jonathan Sullivan, a Taiwan exprt from the University of Nottingham, said Tsai faced \u201ca slew of domestic issues\u201d, the most pressing of which was injecting new life into the economy. \u201cTsai needs to make fast and tangible progress on the socio-economic issues that decided the election, and that will be the priority.\u201d Sullivan said Tsai had pledged to increase wages and provide affordable housing. \u201cBut this is easier said than done.\u201d J Michael Cole, a Taipei-based political observer, said Tsai\u2019s political honeymoon would be short.  \u201cEverybody you talk to [says], \u2018We want her to improve the economy,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cExpectations are high. People here are probably going to be impatient and that will be a headache for Tsai because no matter how good she might be, turning around that sagging economy will take a while. Nothing will happen over night. It is going to take months if not years before they succeed, if they succeed.\u201d Experts believe Taiwan\u2019s thorny relationship with Beijing may also prove a severe challenge for its new leader.  Tsai\u2019s predecessor oversaw an unprecedented rapprochement with China but her election was widely seen as a sign of public frustration that such a policy had failed to benefit Taiwan\u2019s 23 million citizens. On Friday, Taiwan\u2019s new leader hinted she would seek to reduce its economic dependence on mainland China. \u201cWe will\u2026 bid farewell to our past over-reliance on a single market,\u201d she said.  Tsai\u2019s victory has gone down badly with China\u2019s Communist party rulers, who still lay claim to the island and view her independence-leaning party with mistrust.  Officially, Beijing still hopes to reabsorb Taiwan, which has been self-ruled since 1949, and in the wake of Tsai\u2019s victory Beijing has warned that she must explicitly state her commitment to the so-called \u201cone China principle\u201d \u2013 the idea that Taiwan and mainland China are a single nation.  Tsai made no such commitment in her speech, referring simply to a controversial 1992 \u201cconsensus\u201d about the island\u2019s status as a \u201chistorical fact\u201d.  Tsai vowed to make her country \u201ca staunch guardian of peace\u201d but risked angering China\u2019s authoritarian leaders by repeatedly referring to Taiwan as a \u201ccountry\u201d, a notion Beijing rejects. Sullivan said such allusions were \u201csure to displease Beijing\u201d.  \u201cAll told, this is not a speech Beijing wanted to hear,\u201d he said. \u201cBeijing already eyed her with great suspicion, and this speech will confirm them.\u201d  In an editorial the Beijing-controlled Global Times newspaper warned that cross-strait ties were entering an \u201cera of uncertainty\u201d.  While Tsai\u2019s comments on the relationship with China grabbed headlines, most of her speech focused on domestic issues, with the president vowing to reform the pension system and inject new \u201cmomentum\u201d into the economy. \u201cThis country urgently needs a new model for economic development,\u201d Tsai said. Tsai, who has a PhD in law from the London School of Economics, also vowed to set up a truth and reconciliation commission to investigate human rights abuses committed during decades of military rule between 1947 and 1987. \u201cWe will discover the truth, heal wounds, and clarify responsibilities. From here on out, history will no longer divide Taiwan. Instead, it will propel Taiwan forward.\u201d Cole said enthusiasm about the rise of Taiwan\u2019s first female leader was tempered by the fact that her cabinet was packed with middle-aged men and technocrats.  Voters hoping for an administration as diverse as that of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau were disappointed. \u201cUnfortunately Tsai does not seem to have been willing to or capable of taking such chances. So we are seeing a new cabinet that is oddly reminiscent of the one that just resigned. Civil society is disappointed.\u201d",
