Since Xi Jinping took power in 2012 the epithet has been at the centre of an energetic push to portray the Communist party leader as an omnipotent people\u2019s president. An entire genre of \u201cBig Daddy Xi\u201d-themed songs has sprung up, fuelling fears that he is attempting to build a Mao-like personality cult.   Related: Singing Xi's praises: chorus of Chinese pop songs celebrate president    However, China\u2019s official news agency, Xinhua, and the leading 21st Century Business Herald newspaper have received instructions to steer clear of the nickname, Bloomberg reported.  One Xinhua journalist told the Guardian the news group had become cautious in its use of the nickname \u201cXi Dada\u201d \u2013 which translates as Big Daddy or Uncle Xi \u2013 although they had not seen a specific written instruction to avoid the term. The moniker has not appeared on Xinhua\u2019s website since 27 April but did show up in a 1 May story on another party-run news website with the headline: \u201cWhat Big Daddy Xi said at the Communist party\u2019s Central Party School conference.\u201d It is unclear why Beijing\u2019s propaganda officials have decided to step back from Xi\u2019s nickname. Experts believe it may hint at growing discomfort \u2013 both in and outside China \u2013 about how the leader is portrayed as a Mao-style autocrat. In recent weeks, Chinese officials have expressed discomfort over the perception that a cult of personality is growing around their leader. The website of the Economist was blocked in China after a cartoon on its front page showed Xi sporting a Mao-style Zhongshan suit beside the headline: \u201cBeware the cult of Xi\u201d. Writing in the New York Review of Books this month, Columbia University\u2019s Prof Andrew J Nathan accused Xi of bringing back \u201cmany of the most dangerous features of Mao\u2019s rule: personal dictatorship, enforced ideological conformity, and arbitrary persecution\u201d.  Kerry Brown, the author of CEO, China: The Rise of Xi Jinping, said the apparent move to purge Xi\u2019s nickname from headlines was a possible admission that China\u2019s portrayal of its leader had backfired. While spin doctors had hoped to paint Xi as a respected globe-trotting world leader, Brown said, large portions of the international community and media now viewed Xi as \u201ca big, big dictator\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s a big-time propaganda failure,\u201d he said. \u201cI can imagine that in their five-minute-a-month meeting with Xi Jinping, the head of publicity got told: \u2018Whose bright idea was that [nickname]? Send him or her to Gansu [in China\u2019s far west]!\u2019\u201d Brown added: \u201cThey don\u2019t want [China] to be seen as an autocracy. So this interpretation of the outside world as a Xi Jinping autocracy must be driving them absolutely nuts.\u201d   Related: 'Rule the party strictly!': Chinese president 'Big Daddy Xi' makes rap debut    Roderick MacFarquhar, a Harvard University China expert, said the apparent abandonment of the nickname was unlikely to signal a change in direction for the authoritarian leader, who has suggested is the country\u2019s most powerful since Mao.  \u201cMy own feeling is that he may be tweaking the way he presents himself but I don\u2019t think that he is changing his fundamental principles. [His belief remains] that if there is going to be a \u2018Chinese dream\u2019 it has got to be Xi Jinping who is in charge,\u201d MacFarquhar said. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether his spies or informants have told him that \u2018Xi Dada\u2019 has made him look rather ridiculous \u2026 but there is some talk that the propaganda chief may have been overdoing it deliberately, and maybe Xi Jinping fell for that.\u201d Qiao Mu, an outspoken journalism professor from the Beijing Foreign Studies University, said he was unaware of an explicit directive to avoid the nickname but said it was possible verbal orders had been given to tone down the intense media focus on Xi. The academic said he would welcome such a move. \u201cThe members of the politburo should all be equal. So why don\u2019t we have a \u2018Big Daddy Wang\u2019 and a \u2018Big Daddy Zhang\u2019, as well as a \u2018Big Daddy Xi\u2019?\u201d MacFarquhar admitted the inner workings of Chinese politics were so opaque it was hard to grasp the significance of the move. \u201cI think there are all sorts of currents around Chinese leaders at the moment and it is difficult to tell who is on whose side,\u201d he said.
