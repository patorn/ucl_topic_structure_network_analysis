  "body": "The Turnbull government\u2019s superannuation changes will hit wealthy women aged over 50 more than any other in their peer group. New analysis from the National Centre for Social and Economic Modelling (Natsem) shows the government\u2019s super reforms will actually discourage some women from contributing more to their super before they retire. It has found women over 50 \u2013 who are earning enough to be affected by the policy changes \u2013 will be forced to pay a higher tax on their super contributions, as a proportion of their income, than wealthy men.   Related: Ray Hadley tells Scott Morrison the Coalition may 'perish' over superannuation changes    Natsem\u2019s Prof Robert Tanton says the women most affected by the policy changes are at a stage in their lives where they should be contributing more to super, and are earning enough to do so, and should be encouraged to do so. But he says the government\u2019s policy will have the opposite effect, and he discovered the unintended consequences after running detailed modelling by age and gender. \u201cIt\u2019s a policy change that is intended to affect certain [high-income] groups, and is it affecting those groups, and that\u2019s probably a reasonable change,\u201d Tanton said. \u201cBut inadvertently it\u2019s affecting a particular group who should be increasing the amount of money they\u2019re putting into super, and that\u2019s females aged 50 to 64.\u201d The Turnbull government says its super changes will only affect the top 4% of income earners, with money saved at the top being redirected to fund super tax cuts for people at the bottom of the income distribution. But Tanton says the government\u2019s policy changes will affect men and women at the top of the income distribution in different ways. Sydney radio host Ray Hadley warned the treasurer, Scott Morrison, this week that even though the policy will only negatively affect high-income earners, he would lose lots of supporters if he pushed ahead with the reform. Tanton didn\u2019t run modelling to see how individuals at the lower end of the income distribution would benefit. Natsem modelled the impact of two of the government\u2019s proposed changes, by age group and gender: the reduction in the super contributions cap from $30,000 (or from $35,000 for those aged over 50) to $25,000; and the requirement for those with combined incomes above $250,000 to pay 30% tax on their concessional contributions, up from 15%. It found the policy changes would affect 305,000 high-income men (the top 5% of the male workforce) and 89,000 high-income women (the top 1.5% of the female workforce). It says the median income of each age group affected by the policy is: age 30 to 49 ($297k for men; $253k for women), 50 to 64 ($229k for men; $113k for women), and 65 and over ($162k for men; $80,000 for women).  It found men aged between 50 and 64 would pay the highest absolute tax of any group, at an average $2,090 a year (compared to $1,550 for women of that age group).  It also found men would pay a higher absolute tax increase than women overall. But it also found women aged over 50 would pay the highest tax increase as a proportion of their income (up 0.97% for 50 to 64 year olds; and 1.29% for 65+), because women in these age groups were earning a lower average income than men. Tanton said the government\u2019s argument that its policy changes would only affect high income earners was not necessarily true. \u201cWhile this is the case for males, this is not the case for females aged 50 to 64, where the median income of those affected was $112,732, a reasonable income for women to think about contributing more to their concessional super,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat these results suggest is that this policy is going to discourage female workers aged 50 to 64 and 65 and over contributing concessional amounts to superannuation, mainly due to the proposed tax on concessional contributions over $25,000 per year.\u201d Labor has said it is concerned about the retrospective nature and unintended consequences of some of the government\u2019s super proposals. \u201cWe want to fully understand the distributional impacts, as well as behavioural effects and any unintended consequences,\u201d Jim Chalmers, Labor\u2019s spokesman for superannuation, will say in a speech on Thursday.

The Coalition must fight for them | Gareth Hutchens    \u201cThis is precisely why we announced our plans with proper lead time before an election. It\u2019s precisely why we are worried about the government\u2019s haste and handling in this area.\u201d Natsem could not model the Turnbull government\u2019s plan to introduce a lifetime cap of $500,000 for non-concessional contributions, down from $180,000 a year, because it did not have the data. Natsem is one of Australia\u2019s best economic modellers of social policy. It said the modelling was not commissioned by any political party, group, or individual.  Correction: An error in Natsem\u2019s original calculations showed the government policy changes would affect 610,000 high-income men (the top 9.6% of the male workforce) and 177,000 high-income women (the top 3% of the female workforce). Those figures have been amended.",
