  "body": "Call it the \u201cDownton effect\u201d, or the return of old-fashioned regional snobbery, but there is, increasingly, one acceptable way to be in society, and that is to be middle class and from the south-east of England. When you actually live in the north, the \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d is self-evidently nothing but a nice-sounding phrase, delivered in RP by someone who does not. As if further proof were needed that the dominance of middle-class values and identity is becoming more powerful, the linguistics researcher Alexander Baratta has reported that trainee teachers from the north and Midlands are being asked by their supervisors to lose their regional accents in order to be better \u201crole models\u201d for schoolchildren.   Related: Trainee teachers from northern England told to modify their accents    What he terms \u201clinguistic prejudice\u201d is essentially another form of class prejudice: northern accents, in particular, are perceived to be exclusively working class, with scouse accents firmly at the bottom of the value scale. A couple of months back, casting agents for a new Morrisons advert put out a call for \u201cproper working-class people\u201d \u2013 by which they meant people with northern accents \u2013 to appear in the campaign, but with the firm instruction: \u201cNobody from Liverpool, please.\u201d Teacher trainees from Leicester, Nottingham and Eccles interviewed by Baratta were variously told to \u201cgo back where [they] came from\u201d if they were to be understood by their pupils, that they needed to learn to \u201cspeak properly\u201d \u2013 in other words, without a regional accent \u2013 and that their pronunciation was \u201ctoo common\u201d. It provides further evidence that teachers are being inducted \u2013 institutionalised \u2013 into an education system designed to produce, essentially, identical types of people. People with identical accents, communication styles and methods of personal presentation are well primed to work in the private sector, to earn above the median, and to compete for work on the basis of not being different, but of simply being better at doing exactly the same thing. Becoming socially mobile, in the narrow sense defined by the government\u2019s own Commission on Social Mobility, is simply a matter of someone from a non-professional background getting into the professions. Take a rough diamond, polish it and send it back out into the world more economically productive than before: job\u2019s a good \u2019un. Such simplistic logic denies the experience of social mobility, which for many people \u2013 as revealed by the subjects of Baratta\u2019s study \u2013 involves being asked to change fundamental aspects of who they are in exchange for achieving their ambition.   Related: Anyone who still thinks Britain is a meritocracy must be deluded | Rhiannon Lucy Coslett    Schoolchildren interviewed by the education researcher Diane Reay noted how such forms of snobbery are passed down, from teacher trainer to teacher, from teacher to pupil. \u201cSome teachers act as if the child is stupid because they\u2019ve got a posh accent,\u201d said one pupil, \u201cKenny\u201d. \u201cI think telling you a different way [of speaking] is sort of good, but I think the way they do it isn\u2019t good because they correct you and make you look stupid.\u201d Kenny\u2019s not daft: he realises the importance of clear communication, and is aware that being given the chance to acquire some of the skills of the dominant class may go on to serve him better than a well-meaning teacher who pretends such things don\u2019t matter. What he resents is the implication that to sound working class is automatically to sound stupid. As aspects of culture become more centralised and focused on London, it stands to reason that the \u201cdominant person\u201d \u2013 the person who is valued most, who is viewed as the most civilised \u2013 happens to be middle class and to speak in a standardised south-eastern accent. It\u2019s the northern museums that are closing, the northern councils that have to prioritise adult care over libraries and parks because they can\u2019t afford both. The BBC\u2019s 5 Live and CBeebies channels may have moved to Salford, but you\u2019d never guess it from the accents of its presenters. The sociolinguist Peter Trudgill noted as long ago as the 1970s that language use had begun to change, and to some extent to level out, in smaller towns due to the undue influence of larger, more culturally dominant cities. But this is clearly not the sort of natural linguistic levelling that is brought about by people moving around more often. The urge to devalue regional accents is part of a deliberate process. We\u2019re all being taught that the only acceptable role model \u2013 intelligent, authoritative, responsible \u2013 is now a middle-class one.",
