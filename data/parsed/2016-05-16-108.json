  "body": "The first Syrians to be returned by plane under the EU-Turkey deal have been detained in a remote camp for the past three weeks with no access to lawyers, casting further doubts over EU claims that they are being sent back to a safe third country. With hundreds more likely to be expelled in similar fashion in the coming weeks, the returnees have warned that those following in their wake face arbitrary detention, an inscrutable asylum process, and substandard living conditions.  Their claims undermine the legitimacy of the EU-Turkey migration deal, under which it is likely most Syrians landing on Greek islands will be returned to Turkey, on the assumption that they can live without restrictions once there.  Turkey has said they will be released soon. But a group of 12 Syrians returned by plane on 27 April who were contacted by telephone said they had simply been detained without clear legal recourse since they arrived in a remote detention centre in southern Turkey called D\u00fczi\u00e7i. The fate of two other Syrians deported along with hundreds of non-Syrians earlier in April is unknown. \u201cYou can\u2019t imagine how bad a situation we are in right now,\u201d said one Syrian mother detained with her children, who now wants to return to Syria because she sees no alternative. \u201cMy children and I are suffering, the food is not edible. I\u2019m forcing my children to eat because I don\u2019t have any money to buy anything, but they refuse because there are bugs in it.\u201d The detainees have also been denied access to lawyers and specialised medical care, she alleged. Like all the interviewed detainees, the Syrian asked to remain anonymous for fear of reprisals, but said she now wanted to return to Syria because she felt that even a war-zone would be better for her family than the refugee detention centres in Greece and Turkey. Several of the Syrians had been living in Turkey before making the journey to Greece, but have now not been able to rejoin their families since being deported back to Turkish soil. After being detained in Greece following the start of the EU-Turkey deal, they agreed to be deported to Turkey on the assumption that they would not be granted asylum in Europe, and in hope of being reunited with their families. \u201cWe cancelled our asylum claims in Greece to come back to our homes, not to this prison here,\u201d said another inmate, who asked to be known by the pseudonym of Lara. She added: \u201cThey won\u2019t allow us to leave. I\u2019m pregnant, I\u2019m not good \u2013 what am I doing here? They just say we have to wait. If they told us you must stay here for one month or two months, that would be OK \u2013 but we just don\u2019t know.\u201d Hundreds of non-Syrians deported under the EU-Turkey deal to a separate camp have told European politicians they have not been given any opportunity to claim asylum. When asked to comment, a spokesman for the Turkish government predicted that the 12 Syrians would soon be let go. \u201cWe expect to release them next week once their background checks are completed,\u201d said the spokesman, who spoke anonymously in accordance with government protocol. \u201cUpon their release, they will be able to move into a refugee camp or opt out of the government-sponsored housing system.\u201d But other long-time inmates at the camp said they doubted that anyone would be released in the near future. One of the hundreds of other Syrian refugees also detained at D\u00fczi\u00e7i said that he had been held since 10 February after being seized from his home. He said he was still unsure of why he was detained, or when he would be released, and doubted any inmate would be freed soon. \u201cIt\u2019s all just talk,\u201d said Abu Hassan, a grocer detained with his wife and children, who asked to be known under a pseudonym. \u201cThey are just pressuring us to go back to Syria and die there.\u201d   Related: From war in Syria to a Turkish sweatshop for child refugees    Turkey has welcomed more Syrian refugees than the rest of the world combined since the start of the Syrian conflict in 2011, taking in roughly 2.7 million, according to UN data. But it stands accused of several rights abuses against refugees. Despite recent legislative changes, Syrians do not have the default right to work in Turkey, while many Syrian children are not in school. Syrian refugees also report being shot at on the Turkish-Syrian border and others claim to have been deported back to Syria. Turkey denies both charges, and says it maintains an open-door policy to Syrian refugees.  \u201cTurkey is the largest refugee-hosting country in the world,\u201d the Turkish foreign ministry has previously said. \u201cIt is out of the question that the Syrians are encouraged to return to their countries voluntarily or forcibly. Turkey is bound by its obligations under international law and is determined to continue providing protection to the Syrians who have fled from violence and instability in their country.\u201d An EU spokesperson said the EU-Turkey deal would ensure \u201chigh standards of international protection in the first country of asylum, namely Turkey\u201d. John Dalhuisen, Amnesty International\u2019s Europe director, said: \u201cThe automatic detention of the 12 Syrians returned voluntarily to Turkey bodes ill for those whose appeals are currently being heard in Greece. This is not what the European public and Syrian refugees were being sold when EU and Turkish officials promised that their deal would scrupulously respect refugee rights.\u201d Dalhuisen added: \u201cTurkey has to guarantee there\u2019s no arbitrary detention, and if it does detain refugees and asylum seekers, they are held in decent conditions. If a group of Syrians who have voluntarily returned is locked up without medical care and lack of access to legal aid, what does that mean for those who are returned against their will?\u201d",
