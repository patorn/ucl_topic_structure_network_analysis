  "body": "The agent of the Barcelona right back Dani Alves has denied suggestions his client has signed a pre-contract agreement with Juventus but says the player is a target for both the Italian champions and a team in England. The Barcelona-based publications El Mundo Deportivo and Sport reported on Thursday that Alves\u2019 eight-year spell at the club would end this summer with a move to Turin on a three-year deal. However his agent and former wife, Dinorah Santa Ana da Silva, told Marca: \u201cIt\u2019s not true that there is an agreement. Dani has not completed any deal with anyone and, right now, he is in Brazil and is only exclusively concerned with doing good things with the national team. \u201cIt\u2019s true that I\u2019ve met with Juventus but not just with them,\u201d added Da Silva. \u201cI have met with two Turkish clubs, one English club and another one in France but there is no offer and we have nothing to evaluate.\u201d The 33-year-old Alves was at the centre of transfer speculation last summer but, after months of negotiations, he signed a new deal with Bar\u00e7a until June 2017 with an option to extend for a further year.   Related: Manchester United, Arsenal and PSG lead chase for \u00a340m \u00c1lvaro Morata    Alves, who joined Bar\u00e7a from Sevilla in 2008 and made 43 appearances for the club as they won the double this season, has been included in Brazil\u2019s squad for next month\u2019s Copa Am\u00e9rica. Juventus have also been linked with a move for Barcelona\u2019s Javier Mascherano, although their chief executive Beppe Marotta has admitted deals for either player are far from completion. \u201cDani Alves? We\u2019re talking about an important player, but he isn\u2019t our property. We\u2019ll see what we can do.\u201d Marotta told Tuttomercatoweb. \u201cMascherano? These are media situations, but we don\u2019t want to sell anyone from our defence unless [Mart\u00edn] C\u00e1ceres leaves on a free transfer. \u201cAt the moment, though, we haven\u2019t done anything, I can\u2019t confirm or deny it. And the same goes for [Andr\u00e9] Gomes and [Miralem] Pjanic. \u201cLa Liga is the league that best represents European football. It seems like a poor game, as we only talk about three teams, but their ranking improves thanks to their values on the pitch. \u201cSpeaking of Barcelona and Real Madrid, you\u2019re talking about champions who could make the difference in our game and be important.\u201d Marotta also confirmed that Juve would like to sign the rising star Domenico Berardi from Sassuolo but remains determined not to sell the Arsenal and Chelsea target \u00c1lvaro Morata back to Real Madrid. \u201cBerardi is a great talent, there\u2019s a verbal agreement with Sassuolo and Juventus have the moral right of first refusal and we\u2019re going to complete this deal,\u201d he said. \u201cMorata? He\u2019s becoming a champion, we\u2019ll do everything possible to keep him in Turin. Real Madrid\u2019s buy-back clause is like the Sword of Damocles, but we\u2019ll meet with them after the Champions League final.\u201d",
