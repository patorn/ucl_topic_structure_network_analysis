  "body": "Leicester City\u2019 vice-chairman, Aiyawatt Srivaddhanaprabha, has suggested Claudio Ranieri will be offered a contract extension at the end of the season as a reward for leading the club to the Premier League title. Ranieri signed a three-year contact on taking over at the east Midlands club last July and the hierarchy at the King Power Stadium are keen to extend the Italian\u2019s stay for as long as possible given the remarkable achievement he has masterminded there. The 64-year-old spoke this week about his desire to one day manage Italy, with the current national team coach Antonio Conte departing after the European Championship to take over at Chelsea. But there is little suggestion Ranieri would leave Leicester to succeed the former Juventus midfielder.

He said: \u201cAt the end of the season we will talk about that [extending Ranieri\u2019s contract] with him. We will sit down together and when we talk about something, it\u2019s long term, not just until September. I like people to work for me when they are happy and enjoy working with the group of people. \u201cI think both [Shakespeare and Walsh] have agreed [new deals]. They did a brilliant job here and happy to do that.\u201d That will come as good news to Leicester supporters but some will fear that while the manager and backroom staff stay on, some of the players who led the club to a first top-flight championship, will move on. Riyad Mahrez and N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 have both linked with other, wealthier clubs with the latter believed to have a \u00a320m release clause in his contract. Aiyawatt claims to be unsure of any such clause in the midfielder\u2019s contract and insists the desire of those in charge at Leicester is to not only retain all key members of the title-winning squad but add to it. \u201cWe will try everything that we can to build the team and to secure the same group of players and add some quality,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to talk to all of the scouts when they give me the lists. I have to talk to Claudio about which player he wants. I always support, always.\u201d Speaking about bonuses that may have been given to the Leicester players for winning the title, Aiyawatt said: \u201cThe players deserve as in the contract. The contracts they have, I think they are already happy. I cannot say the number. \u201cI heard we are going to give Mercedes Benz, I don\u2019t know where that\u2019s from. But it\u2019s a good idea, if I can I will do it. I have to see the regulations and I follow. If I can I will.\u201d",
