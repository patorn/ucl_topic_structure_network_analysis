  "body": "Their playoff defeat by the Thunder may have prompted questions about the future of this San Antonio Spurs team, but veteran duo Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili insist they haven\u2019t made their minds up whether to call time on their Spurs careers just yet.   Related: The Spurs' season was not supposed to end this way. What does the future hold?    Duncan, 40, left questions about his future plans unanswered after his team\u2019s 4-2 series defeat by OKC, saying only: \u201cI\u2019ll get to that after I get out of here and figure out life. That\u2019s it.\u201d Ginobili, 38, said he plans to \u201ctake my time as always\u201d in deciding whether to return to the Spurs for another season. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s been an amazing run,\u201d said Ginobili, 38. \u201cWe all enjoy playing with each other. I\u2019m so proud of having played with those guys for so many years and winning so many games, and even playing with the new guys. If there\u2019s a reason why you always want to come back and keep being part of this, [it\u2019s] because of the amazing chemistry, the good times and the good people that you play with and spend time with. \u201cIt\u2019s not always about winning a game or winning a championship. But you learn from losses, and it\u2019s important to enjoy every day. Being a part of this team, I\u2019m very proud of it, even if sometimes it doesn\u2019t go our way.\u201d Ginobili admitted any decision would be a difficult one to take. \u201cYes, of course,\u201d Ginobili said. \u201cIf I was miserable every day and I couldn\u2019t stand the guys next to me, it would be an easy decision. It could have happened two years ago. I really appreciate everybody: the team, front office, coaches, everything. So it makes it different.\u201d Duncan and Ginobili both have player options for the 2016-17 season. The option total on Duncan\u2019s deal is $6.4m, while Ginobili\u2019s option total sits at $2.9m. Only Kobe Bryant has played more NBA seasons with one team than Tim Duncan. Bryant departed this season after 20 years with the Lakers; Duncan has just completed his 19th with the Spurs.\u00a0John Stockton\u00a0of the Uta Jazz is the only other player to play 19 seasons with one team. Spurs coach Gregg Popovich expressed surprise when asked whether Duncan had played his last game. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d Popovich asked. \u201cDo you know something that I don\u2019t know? I just wanted to make that clear. Tim was playing really well. So we played him as much as we possibly could because he earned the minutes. He really did a good job.\u201d Duncan scored 19 points on seven-of-14 shooting on Thursday night \u2013 the most by a 40-year-old in the playoffs since\u00a0Karl Malone\u00a0had 30 in 2004. Tony Parker said: \u201cEvery year, it\u2019s the same thing with us. TD, obviously, and Manu, it\u2019s the same question every year. They\u2019re either going to come back or not. We\u2019ll see.\u201d",
