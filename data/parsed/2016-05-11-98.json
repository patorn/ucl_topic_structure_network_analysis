So it is with Pel\u00e9, the soccer star, who must disregard the Eurocentric obsessions of his coach and team captain, embrace his innate Brazilian gifts, and destroy those French jerks (and even nastier Swedes) who stand in the way of national glory.   Related: Pel\u00e9: Birth of a Legend continues the soccer star's big screen legacy    Did Brazil\u2019s 1958 World Cup victory in Sweden really go down with quite the transformative drama shown in Pel\u00e9: Birth of a Legend? No, probably not, but it\u2019s evident early on that this biopic, which lists the 75-year-old Pel\u00e9 himself as one of its producers, is far less interested in being anything more than a kid-friendly believe-in-yourself after-school special with added penalty kicks. That in itself isn\u2019t so bad (who doesn\u2019t like a good message now and then?), but unfortunately the acting, writing and editing has all the subtlety of a Robert Huth free kick thwomping off your head while you sit in the stands. Young Dico (Pel\u00e9\u2019s original nickname) grows up poor in Brazil, scraping together money shining shoes while dazzling all around him with his soccer ability. Directors Jeff and Michael Zimbalist and cinematographer Matthew Libatique go a bit wild with these sequences, with the barefoot Pel\u00e9 leaping among the rickety shacks and the camera switching perspective to imply a Spider-Man style dominance over physics. He and his mates form a low-rent soccer squad but are teased by the rich kids. The big meanie, who happens to live where Dico\u2019s mother works as a maid, is the one who first calls him Pel\u00e9, mocking his mispronunciation of a famous soccer player\u2019s name. He\u2019ll get his comeuppance, though, during a match in which the ragtag team embrace their harsdscrabble style of play, a theme which is revisited many more times on the way to that World Cup win in Sweden. (More comeuppance comes when the two play on the national team eight years later.) Along the way, we\u2019ll see how Pel\u00e9 is more than just an athlete: he is a redeemer, the anointed one who will bring forgiveness to Brazil for losing their way during their crushing loss against Uruguay in 1950. In a very brief montage, an elderly coach (how do you say Obi-Wan in Portuguese?) explains that Pel\u00e9\u2019s natural gifts evoke \u201cginga\u201d, a capoeira-inspired style of play derived from the first African slaves brought to Brazil. While the film is frustratingly vague with any specifics (it maybe involves swaying?) it\u2019s clear that ginga is right, and representative of the very heartbeat of ethnically diverse Brazil. Moreover, trying to force Brazilians to play using the very strict formation method of those obnoxious Swedes, led by their insulting coach (Colm Meaney), is a rebuke to all that\u2019s good in the world. As the sportscaster bellows during the final game: \u201cFinally, the world can see Brazil\u2019s beauty! Our heroes now in perfect harmony! It\u2019s beyond football \u2013 it\u2019s the Beautiful Game!\u201d To a non-fan, it looks like one guy kicked the ball to another guy and that guy kicked the ball in the net, but what the hell do I know? Soccer fanatics will meet me halfway and agree that AR Rahman\u2019s anachronistic and omnipresent score is distracting, the dialogue sounds like made-for-TV gibberish, and the wide spectrum of accents is infuriating. That one kid in the same slum would speak English like an American while others sound Brazilian seems like a pretty easy production fix, and God only knows why they are speaking English in the first place. Nevertheless, if you can get past the whole nationalist aspect of competitive soccer, the choreography during the lengthy game sequences is undeniably well shot. Considering this is the first biopic of one of the world\u2019s most beloved athletes, it\u2019s too bad such a predictable and ham-fisted kids\u2019 flick was the goal.",
