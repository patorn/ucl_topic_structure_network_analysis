The foreign minister, Julie Bishop, was among the first of Dutton\u2019s colleague to parse his statement for palatable pebbles, presenting a generous interpretation in the form of this \u201creality check\u201d:  There\u2019s an extraordinarily high cost in ensuring they can be a contributing member of society \u2026 What he\u2019s pointing out is that we would want such people to have a job, we wouldn\u2019t want them to be on welfare, we would want them in jobs.\u201d     Julie Bishop Defends Peter Dutton's Claim That He Didn't Actually Piss Himself, No He Just Spilled A Coffee On His Pants, Really\u2014 content enjoyer (@dannolan) May 17, 2016    Later, in far north Queensland, Malcolm Turnbull came to the defence of his \u201coutstanding immigration minister\u201d, repeating Dutton\u2019s observation that \u201clarge percentages\u201d of refugees are \u201cilliterate in their own language\u201d but adding that was \u201cno fault of theirs\u201d. On the \u201ctaking Australian jobs\u201d point, he said, \u201cWe want them to become part of our workforce.\u201d   Related: When Peter Dutton insults refugees he insults the Australian people | Lenore Taylor    And so, as in a particularly grim round of Chinese whispers, Dutton\u2019s original statement was diluted with each repetition by his colleagues. (And to quote Louis CK: \u201cMaybe, if someone without contacts, money, or speaking the language steals your job, you\u2019re shit.\u201d)  \u201cBut we all heard what Dutton said the first time,\u201d said political editor Lenore Taylor, marking an escalation in the scare tactics at play in this campaign from \u201cdog whistle\u201d to \u201cfoghorn\u201d. Here\u2019s Guardian Australia\u2019s fact check of Dutton\u2019s statement.

And new findings into the impact incomers have on host communities in Europe state similar. Back in Sydney, Bill Shorten said Dutton\u2019s remarks were \u201cdeeply divisive and offensive\u201d and \u201ccomments that Pauline Hanson would have been proud to make\u201d. And on Twitter, users were sharing their own experiences with the hashtag \u2013 at Mariam Veiszadeh\u2019s suggestion \u2013 #soilliterate.    I'm #Soilliterate that I could take #PeterDutton 's job. #Auspol\u2014 Mariam Veiszadeh (@MariamVeiszadeh) May 18, 2016      My grandparents were so #soilliterate they came here with nothing, worked hard, learnt the language and made their new lives in a decade\u2014 Jacqueline Maree (@PSDontTellMum) May 18, 2016    Mirabella cut loose The Liberal party\u2019s Indi candidate, Sophie Mirabella, has been cut loose by the Coalition, writes Guardian Australia\u2019s Gabrielle Chan. Senior government sources claim she has been starved of Liberal party funding, leaving her to foot the bill for her campaign with only what she can raise locally. Adding insult to financial injury, Barnaby Joyce \u2013 deputy prime minister, Nationals leader, and \u201csweaty, big-gutted man from Australia\u201d (Johnny Depp, 2015) \u2013 openly mocked Mirabella at a party event for the Nationals candidate Marty Corboy in Indi last night.  \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk too much about the other candidates, they can talk for themselves \u2026 What I can say is the more they talk, the better you look, Marty.\u201d This was a day after Mirabella accused some in the Liberal party of destabilising her campaign in an intriguing appearance on the ABC\u2019s 7.30, in which she said, \u201cIf you want a friend in politics, get a dog.\u201d But don\u2019t tell Johnny Depp that.    Greg Mirabella removes his cat from shot without breaking eye contact with the 7.30 reporter pic.twitter.com/JfJUeuBy9J\u2014 Freya Newman (@freyanewmn) May 17, 2016      The reporter reads Mirabella some of her bad press pic.twitter.com/EqQkj1j7Jr\u2014 Freya Newman (@freyanewmn) May 17, 2016      'Not a happy day at camp Mirabella' pic.twitter.com/I92kDvb1pG\u2014 Freya Newman (@freyanewmn) May 17, 2016    It suggests that the Coalition doesn\u2019t fancy Mirabella\u2019s chances against the current MP, independent MP Cathy McGowan. Corboy \u2013 who has a stock feed supply business \u2013 is also an outsider, though he\u2019s not without optimism about his chances: \u201cWithout sounding sexist, some people are rapt to have a man to vote for.\u201d Perhaps conscious of this competitive advantage, Joyce suggested Corboy was a future leader within the National party. \u201cIf we start now in Indi, we know we can bed him down and the return will be great to this seat.\u201d  Feeney not so positive on negative gearing Negative gearing, the policy that sounds boring but is in fact of apparently endless interest to everyone, is still trucking along in the headlines.    Hey @TurnbullMalcolm should we be allowing the one year olds of illiterate job-taking refugees to access negative gearing?\u2014 Bernard Keane (@BernardKeane) May 17, 2016    Labor frontbencher David Feeney is facing questions over his $2.3m property, which he failed to declare in his parliamentary interests register. He says the purchase of the negatively geared house in Northcote is on the public record but he neglected to register it. \u201cI\u2019ve racked my mind how this omission came to be.\u201d Feeney \u2013 who is in a tight battle with a Greens candidate over his inner Melbourne seat of Batman \u2013 has today written to the register of members interests seeking to rectify his mistake. When first questioned on Tuesday, he didn\u2019t know if the house was negatively geared or not.    .@Feeney4Batman has tweeted about negative gearing being a lurk for millionaires #ausvotes #Afronthetrail pic.twitter.com/GTrqHy7MAO\u2014 Joanna Mather (@JoannaMather) May 18, 2016    Cormann popped up again to say Feeney was hypocritical to be negative gearing a property when Labor planned to introduce a policy reining-in the practice. \u201cUnder Labor\u2019s policy on negative gearing, all of those Labor members of parliament that are negatively gearing existing investment properties will be able to continue to do so while they\u2019re taking that opportunity from everybody else,\u201d he told the ABC. This comes after Aussie Home Loans founder, John Symond, warned that Labor\u2019s policy could cause a recession and (it was strongly inferred) dark clouds to black out the sun and frogs to fall from the sky en masse. \u201cAll of a sudden it could be armageddon with the housing industry that\u2019s propped up the Australian economy the last four years\u201d. Here\u2019s Guardian Australia\u2019s fact check of his statement. We\u2019re big into fact checks here, we are. Best of Bowers     Mike Bowers joined Bill Shorten, Anthony Albanese and the member for Kingsford Smith, Matt Thistlethwaite, in a rare moment out of their high-vis gear after touring a container freight facility in Port Botany on Tuesday morning. Photograph: Mike Bowers for the Guardian    Further reading \u2022 The truth about Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s Google tax (Sydney Morning Herald) You could be forgiven for being sceptical about Turnbull and Scott Morrison\u2019s bid to ensure multinational companies \u201cpay their fair share of tax in Australia\u201d. \u2022 Could Bill Shorten win? And why is everyone so scared of the Greens? In the latest episode of Guardian Australia\u2019s Behind the Lines podcast, David Marr discusses the Labor leader\u2019s chances \u2013 and how this election is shaping up as a repeat of 2013. See also the extract from Marr\u2019s revelatory new book on Shorten. \u2022 Seizing the memes of production (Overland) \u201cThe most leverage a campaign can extract from a potent or \u2018dank\u2019 meme is limited to young, internet-savvy audiences already steeped in online culture,\u201d writes young, internet-savvy Osman Faruqi.    hey @PeterDutton_MP pic.twitter.com/hsBYlajV32\u2014 The AMWU (@theamwu) May 17, 2016    And also ... The Sydney Morning Herald columnist Paul Sheehan has been given a redundancy package two months after he was suspended indefinitely over his false story of a woman, \u201cLouise\u201d, who claimed she had been raped and beaten by Arabic-speaking men. Sheehan told Guardian Australia he was made redundant from the Fairfax newspaper he first worked for 30 years ago but he declined to clarify whether the arrangement was voluntary or forced. Meanwhile, in the rest of the world ... Speaking of drawn-out campaigns \u2026 Bernie Sanders\u2019 supporters have handed him a win in the Oregon primary, adding to his run of late victories over the Democratic frontrunner, Hillary Clinton. In Kentucky, which also voted on Tuesday, the race was too close to call \u2013 though Clinton went right ahead and declared victory hours after polls closed. Here\u2019s the Guardian US tracker.           Megyn Kelly questions Donald Trump for calling her a \u2018bimbo\u2019    In the Republican camp, Donald Trump was declared winner in Oregon over rivals Ted Cruz and John Kasich, still on the ballot after dropping out of the race earlier this month. Trump\u2019s win was announced just after his interview with Megyn Kelly aired on Fox, ending a feud between the two that dated back to the first Republican presidential debate last August. Trump said Kelly, one of the moderators of that debate, had treated him unfairly \u2013 perhaps, he infamously supposed, because she had \u201cblood coming out of her wherever\u201d. The public animosity between the two continued until their hourlong meeting at the Trump tower in April. But Tuesday\u2019s interview was not without confrontations as Trump pleaded ignorance over retweeting followers\u2019 description of Kelly as a \u201cbimbo\u201d \u2013 and then a defence: \u201cOver your life, Megyn, you\u2019ve been called a lot worse.\u201d And if today was a pop song ...         \u201cAnd though the news was rather sad, well I just had to laugh.\u201d    There\u2019s an ultrasonic dog whistle just audible in the last 30 seconds of A Day in the Life, inserted by John Lennon into the run-out groove at the end of Sgt Pepper. You may not be able to hear it in the YouTube clip, but \u201coh boy\u201d is as good an assessment of the news today as any.
