  "body": "Generally speaking, I love being surprised. It\u2019s an increasingly hard\u00a0thing to do, because the world\u00a0is so predictable and my cynicism is a hard shell to breach. But sometimes along comes a\u00a0breath\u00a0of fresh air that cracks it\u00a0just\u00a0a little, before coaxing it wide open. The most recent fragrant breeze? Her name is Michaela Coel, 28, a one-woman powerhouse. I first saw her in the raucous, incredibly filthy and funny award-winning E4 sitcom she created and starred in, Chewing Gum. But that\u2019s just\u00a0her highest-profile gig. Her talent is multi-pronged: she\u2019s a Royal Television Society award-winning actor, talented spoken-word\u00a0artist and a playwright\u00a0(Chewing Gum\u2019s\u00a0first life was as a one-woman stage show called\u00a0Chewing Gum\u00a0Dreams). Last\u00a0month she won a Bafta, crowning her as TV\u2019s breakthrough star. Coel is fearless. No joke is too risque, no comedic situation too outrageous to explore in pursuit of the funny. She has this great face \u2013 big eyes, wide smile \u2013 that she can make into whatever shape she wants, and leaves the audience leaning in to hear what she\u2019s saying. It was especially delightful to watch her call out (and then forgive) a previous detractor on Twitter when he congratulated her on her Bafta win, thereby gracefully winning the internet. Her very presence on British telly, in a landscape that doesn\u2019t normally allow dark-skinned black girls to shine so brightly, is thrilling.\u00a0   Related: Why I love\u2026 Jon Bernthal    Next she will star in\u00a0Charlie Brooker\u2019s new Black\u00a0Mirror, and is writing series two of Chewing Gum. She\u2019s thriving. That\u2019s the best, most welcome\u00a0surprise.",
