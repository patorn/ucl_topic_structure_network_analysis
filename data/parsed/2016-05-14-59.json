But even though the summer season is just under way, the bars, restaurants and roads of Mallorca are thronged with people and traffic.   Related: Barcelona\u2019s tourist hordes are target for radical new mayor Ada Colau    The famous dance clubs of Ibiza are planning their seasonal launch parties this week, while Menorca and Formentera expect to bust their environmentally sustainable levels of visitors even earlier than last year. The cruise ships are already arriving, looming into port out of the Mediterranean like giant futuristic housing estates. On one day in the first week of May a record eight of the sea monsters came in at Palma, the largest of Mallorca\u2019s two ports, disgorging more than 22,000 passengers into buses and taxis for the short hop into the old town to look at the cathedral and linger over the tapas. The three main Balearic islands of Ibiza, Mallorca and Menorca have become the second-biggest destination in the Med for cruise ships, themselves a growing phenomenon in tourism, with 790 ships stopping off last year. While Palma expects 524 ships this season, Ibiza predicts 154, up 28% from last year\u2019s 120. On Monday the 275m-long MSC Armonia, owned by Swiss-based MSC Cruises, became the first giant cruise ship to slip into the freshly deepened port of Mah\u00f3n in Menorca. The ports authority says the visits translate to 3,000 jobs on the islands. But they bring just a small percentage of the total 65 million visitors to Spain last year, a number some think could rise by up to 20% this year. The Balearics, with a permanent population of 1.1 million, had 13 million visitors last year. Palma is already pushing its airport capacity of 66 flights an hour to 100 this season. As Europeans turn away from Turkey, Tunisia, Egypt, and any other destination tinged with a threat of terrorism, Spain \u2013 along with Portugal, Greece and Italy \u2013 is picking up the trade. That\u2019s good economic news \u2013 but Spain\u2019s holiday hotspots are creaking at the seams. \u201cWhere do people go to find peace? Into the sea?\u201d said Gerard Hau, a geographer and spokesman at Grup Balear d\u2019Ornitologia Defensa de la Naturalesa (GOB), an umbrella group for environmentalists in the Balearics. \u201cThis will be a crazy year. The infrastructure will not cope. Mallorca is booked out. We will have serious problems this summer. \u201cPeople come here to enjoy life, but they are stressed because they can\u2019t get a seat on the buses \u2013 there aren\u2019t enough buses. Already we have 60,000 rental cars on this island. We are second only to Hong Kong in our car density. The traffic is gridlocked, so people are stressed. There are no parking places. \u201cIf they can\u2019t go in the sea sometimes, they are stressed. Last year we had problems with sewage. The system just couldn\u2019t cope, and we do not let people into the sea if there are such problems. They are stressed because there is no room on the beaches, they are stressed and they won\u2019t come back. Tourism is a vital thing, mass tourism is a tricky, tricky thing. This year will be a crisis year,\u201d he said.     Cruise ships bring thousands of visitors to Palma, Mallorca\u2019s biggest port, every day. Photograph: Enrique Calvo/Reuters    Hau recognises the benefits of tourism and the beauty of the islands, but is worried at the lack of controls. GOB has been influential in bringing to court some 15 politicans now languishing in Mallorcan jails over illegal construction in sensitive areas. Last week in Palma, graffiti appeared saying \u201ctourism is terrorism\u201d and \u201ctourists go home\u201d. Hau believes there is strong support for sustainable development, but points to conservation issues. Mallorca has a rare population of 100 black vultures and \u201cpeople are now walking up to the nests\u201d. Sand dunes have been eroded. \u201cHow can you limit the people?\u201d asks Hau. \u201cIn Spain it\u2019s a fundamental right to be able to go anywhere and that is a good democratic right. You cannot start to ask people not to go, or to pay. It\u2019s tricky to reduce numbers. \u201cI think it\u2019s better to have those drinking ghettoes, Playa de Palma and Magaluf, where people go, rather than these intellectual types of tourists who tramp over everything in their search for the untouched bit, the original Mallorcan, and the residential tourists, who buy up property, buy a car, usually two, swimming pools, and want gardens with plants and grass like at home but that need water.\u201d In Barcelona there is full-throated debate over tourist capacity. Last year the new mayor, Ada Colau, allowed stallholders to ban big groups of tourists from la Boqueria market at set times and stopped all licensing for new tourist accommodation, which had tripled in a decade. Formentera and Ibiza are considering banning tourist cars and Mallorcan police scan the internet to clamp down on illegal holiday lets. The president of the Balearics, Francina Armengol, is deeply worried that the good money they can earn as a waiter or hotel worker is stopping young people from going into the professions. Others are leaving. Rose Sala is Mallorcan by birth and wanted to stay, but has changed her mind. \u201cIt\u2019s enough. It costs so much and the mainland is far cheaper. It would have been worth it because we love this place, but it is unbearable in the summer now. I\u2019m sorry because I have a lot of friends who need these jobs and want the tourists to be high in number, but for me, no. It\u2019s too much.\u201d Her friend is Lesley, a Scot who jumped ship from her job on a cruise liner 11 years ago and stayed, marrying a local doctor. \u201cThis is a beautiful island, and such friendly people,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone needs the tourists to survive, so I\u2019d hate to put anyone off, because a busy summer is good news and will be fun. What I\u2019d really like to see is more people coming off-season, because it\u2019s still lovely then.\u201d On 1 June a controversial tourist \u201ceco-tax\u201d comes into force \u2013 \u20ac2 a day towards environment protection. Professor Geoffrey Lipman runs the SUN Program, based in Brussels, which works towards sustainable tourism, and he fears the pressure is too often on politicians to end up throwing such a tax into their main budgets when austerity bites. \u201cIt\u2019s all a little like King Canute sitting on the seashore ordering back the waves. Who wants to attack the problem when it\u2019s helping you grow, bringing in to countries like Spain 4% per annum growth?\u201d he said. \u201cSo whether it\u2019s moral or not moral, leaving the destinations damaged or not, there is a huge economic driver.\u201d Lipman added: \u201cIf a cruise ship is dumping too many people in too small an area, then they shouldn\u2019t be. I worried about that when I saw the first cruise ships going to Cuba; it\u2019s a big problem. It could be damaging your assets, your coral reef, your resources, this tourist footprint that\u2019s wearing away the Taj Mahal, for instance, or your culture, like the Hindu population in Bali watching hordes of crazy Australians on their beaches. The cobbled streets of Prague which began to be destroyed as masses of tourist buses arrived.\u201d He is optimistic that governments, including Spain\u2019s, and the tourism industry are beginning to see sustainability as a goal. \u201cIt\u2019s not an overnight thing. Mallorca will have a difficult summer, but we have to balance the positive with the negative. Tourism brings in jobs, income, growth and a benefit across the economy, but we have to watch the balance sheet, and while we\u2019re not there yet, that is beginning to be accepted.\u201d In Playa de Palma, the party town around 10km from Mallorca\u2019s capital, a sheepish trio of Dutch men are returning a lifebelt they purloined in the early hours to the side of their hotel pool. It\u2019s early afternoon and the resort is heaving. Singsongs have already started in the Bier Konig. The bins and bars along the front are full. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy already, so the more people, the happier,\u201d said Lucas, 24. \u201cMore women would be fine. You come here to go a bit crazy and I think we spend plenty of euros, so it\u2019s good for Mallorca, too. See? We even return the safety swim.\u201d The hotel receptionist, Nico from Madrid, apologises for the noise from the bar next door: \u201cIt\u2019s a party place and the party is getting bigger and bigger. It\u2019s bad now, but come July and August, well, I would like to take a holiday then myself.\u201d",
