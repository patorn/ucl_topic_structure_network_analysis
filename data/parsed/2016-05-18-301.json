  "body": "The Filipino director Brillante Mendoza is one of Cannes\u2019 established auteur film-makers, and his new movie here, entitled Ma\u2019Rosa, returns us to the themes of his violent shocker Kinatay from 2009 \u2014 the cynicism and corruption of the police and the city authorities, the casual violence and the desperation of the ruled-over who must make what accommodation they can with those in power. It is a tough social realist slice of life at ground level in Manila, unfolding in what feels like real time: violent, though perhaps less so than in that notorious earlier movie and with a droll habit of transcribing the banal conversations of police officers as they deal what they consider to be their paperwork. I wonder if Mendoza hasn\u2019t taken something from the new Romanian cinema, with its similar satire of the red-tape world.

But the economics don\u2019t work: Ma\u2019Rosa also sells drugs through her shop, which has effectively become a way of laundering the cash income from the weed and meth. But the drugs aren\u2019t making her rich: just keeping her above the waterline.     Filippino director Brillante Mendoza during the 2008 Cannes film festival Photograph: Lionel Cironneau/AP    When the police show up and arrest them, Rosa, Nestor and their entire family are dragged off to the station where the officers are absolutely open about this arrest as a mouthwatering opportunity to solicit bribes \u2014 called \u201cbail money\u201d. Rosa is told to pay them a large amount of money, or else finger her supplier so he can be dragged in and leant on for a bribe. So it proves, and Mendoza finds the black comedy in how childlishly delighted the coppers are with the discovery of rolls of cash in the drug dealers\u2019 bag, which can be skimmed to pay for an impromptu beer and fried chicken party, before the exact sum has to be logged. But there is no party for Rosa and her family; the children must now be to be sent out into the city to raise the money by whatever means necessary. In many ways, it\u2019s a fierce and pessimistic satire, in which Ma\u2019Rosa is a sort of Mother Courage, doing what it takes to survive. There is in fact what seems like the beginning of a subplot in which the drug dealer is caught by the officers trying to text the news that he has been caught \u2014 to a senior policeman, indicating that the corruption is higher up and more complicated than we thought. But Mendoza appears to lose some interest in that narrative possibility and shifts the focus back to the impassive, determined Rosa and her kids. They must abase themselves in every way to spring their parents from prison, knowing now that all they have to look forward to is poverty, and the experience itself has embittered and hardened them even more than their mum and dad.   Related: Aquarius review: rich and mysterious Brazilian story of societal disintegration    Ma\u2019Rosa is made with control and clarity, a narrative purpose which is held on to despite an apparently aimless docu-style, and a clear sense of jeopardy. My reservation is that it doesn\u2019t reveal much of what is going on in Rosa\u2019s mind and heart: merely the externals of a grim situation, and we are finally impassively returned to the ground-zero of survival-struggle without having learned anything we didn\u2019t already know. But it\u2019s a cold, hard look at what being poor actually means, and how few options there are for escape.",
