The American singer will be singing his number one song Can\u2019t Stop the Feeling in the interval of the competition.  In a statement, Sven Stojanovic, one of show\u2019s producers, said: \u201cThis is a fantastic opportunity, we are very happy and excited that Justin Timberlake will perform his new song together with his band in our show. \u201cIt makes it extra special that the Swedish songwriters Max Martin and Shellback have co-written and co-produced the song together with Justin Timberlake.\u201d Last year the camp spectacle brought in 200m viewers, but the addition of Timberlake to the line-up is sure to appeal to American audiences, with this year being the first that Eurovision will be broadcast in the US. Can\u2019t Stop the Feeling, which features on the soundtrack of new Dreamworks film Trolls, is Timberlake\u2019s first musical project since 2013.  This year\u2019s contest in Stockholm will air in the 42 participating countries, plus China, Kazakhstan, Portugal, New Zealand and the United States. Britain\u2019s entry to the show this year is duo Joe and Jake who will perform You\u2019re Not Alone. The odds of them bringing home the Eurovision trophy currently stand at 25/1.  \u2022 This article was amended on 11 May to reflect that there have been other non-competitive performers in the song contest.",
