Tyler Brewer, the Augusta police chief, said the shooting was accidental and described it as a \u201cknucklehead situation\u201d.

The bullet went through the man\u2019s foot and travelled about another 50 feet before striking a woman in her calf.  The woman has been released from a hospital in Wichita, while the man has been admitted with an injury that\u2019s not life-threatening. CBS News reported the man shot himself in his right foot and was able to drive himself to hospital. Police said the man, who had a concealed weapon permit, accidentally discharged the gun while trying to adjust the pistol, which was making his foot feel uncomfortable.  Brewer said the Augusta High School commencement continued after the shooting, with most people unaware of what happened.  Brewer said he planned to present the case to prosecutors because it is illegal to carry a firearm on school grounds.  Associated Press contributed to this report",
