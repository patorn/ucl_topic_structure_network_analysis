  "body": "Tonight\u2019s episode was called Winner Takes All and it was a hell of an opening. Right off the bat Ralphie was confronted not only with the knowledge of Alice and Aafrin\u2019s deception, but also with the knowledge that Mr Charlie knows too. (That\u2019s a lot of knowledge.) And Mr Charlie knowing anything bad is double dangerous, as anyone with fingers standing near him when he\u2019s in a rage knows only too well. I liked it when Charlie was roaming the countryside trying to find people who would pretend to have seen Aafrin with Bonkers Naresh for cash. And when he said, \u201cI can run things from here.\u201d I wanted to see Mr Charlie running things. In fact, I wished Mr Charlie had been made Viceroy. It would have been extremely entertaining \u2013 and given us somewhere to go. Instead, there were few winners in this outing by the end, least of all the viewer. The superb drama of the opening scenes soon unravelled into a hotchpotch of plots. We were treated to a sort of \u201cGroundhog Day: The Mr Charlie Special\u201d where he reverted to being a secret psychopath after we\u2019d witnessed him so openly out of control last week. True to form, sure, but narratively unsatisfying as we\u2019ve seen so much of him like this. Alice has fought this fight many times. Wasn\u2019t it time for a different ending? I know in real life she would probably have had to capitulate. But we don\u2019t watch Indian Summers to see real life! Ah well, there\u2019s always next series. Oh, wait ...     What price has Alice paid for Aafrin\u2019s freedom? Photograph: Joe Alblas    The wife/puppy scene was odd at first, and then it became obvious: Alice was trying to preserve her relationship with her son and save Aafrin\u2019s life. What price has she paid for Aafrin\u2019s freedom? The price of her own happiness, of course, which was always the only thing she had to trade. This was perhaps the most realistic outcome, but the least pleasing for us. I was hoping we would get to see Mr Charlie go nuclear and still somehow be outwitted. It\u2019s worrying that, because we\u2019re not going to get a third series and next week\u2019s episode is the last ever (sob!) of Indian Summers, Mr Charlie may not get his comeuppance. And that is wrong, all wrong.     Poor Aafrin. Once Mr Charlie\u2019s got you in his sights, nothing is safe \u2026 especially not your fingers. Photograph: Joe Alblas    This is the problem with these last few hours of viewing. Wonderful performances, as always, despite the uncertain mix of light and shade. But presumably they didn\u2019t know there would be no series three when these episodes were made, so we\u2019re going to be left on an unsolvable cliffhanger whether we like it or not. Meanwhile there are irritating cross-references and attempts to tie up or revive old plots. \u201cHave you ever heard of a man called Ramu Sood? You should always make a note of the innocent men you hang.\u201d I wondered when that exposition was coming. But it was neither dramatic enough to be exciting nor explanatory enough for anyone feeling sketchy on series one. Perhaps worse: \u201cHer name was Jaya Mohan and she bore my child. I\u2019ve lied and I\u2019ve lied and I\u2019ve lied again.\u201d What were we supposed to make of the reaction Ralphie received to this?      You will find Cynthia in the club \u2014 both still hoping here that Ralphie might be Viceroy \u2026 Photograph: Joe Alblas    Ralphie\u2019s reaction to the Viceroy announcement was confusing and unconvincing too. You are about to receive news about something you have coveted for many years, making many sacrifices including pimping your wife out to a man in a dodgy earring who has now gone to Baden Baden. So what do you do? Hold a family conference and keep your boss waiting. His actual eventual reaction was priceless, a beautiful piece of acting. Bloody upstart Marquess with his important work on nutrition. (What is this? A Kellogg\u2019s research paper? We demand to know.)  So what\u2019s left to come in next week\u2019s finale? Can Alice find a way to escape \u2013 with Percy, we get it, it has to be with Percy \u2013 and foil Mr Charlie at last? How will Mr Ian use the information he has about Adam? Will Lina reappear? Will Sooni and Mr Khan finally be together? And most importantly: will the Maharajah and Phyllis/Sirene make a reappearance fresh from taking the waters in Baden Baden? Surely their casting agents\u2019 fees alone demand it. Political shenanigans Despite myriad plots we\u2019ve lost sight of the politics by this point. \u201cThere was a meeting in Whitehall this morning.\u201d So there\u2019s to be a new Viceroy ... \u201cYou had it on merit.\u201d Ah, but what does merit count for? But, of course, it\u2019s thanks to Charlie that everything has eventually been scuppered. Surely Ralphie has to take his revenge? It\u2019s a shame the bigger picture of Indian independence has all but disappeared, especially after Mr Khan taking Sooni to see Mahatma. So many opportunities to make history exciting ... not taken. Evil Britisher of the week \u201cAnd Aafrin?\u201d \u201cOh, he\u2019ll hang.\u201d So Mr Charlie wins again. It\u2019s getting boring now; he wins every week. Blake Ritson (Mr Charlie) is utterly fabulous and he has inhabited this character so entirely that I am currently considering wearing iron gloves in bed so Mr Charlie can\u2019t come and get my fingers in the night. But give him some variety, people! Last week was explosively brilliant because we got to see him under severe pressure and unable to control his murderous temper. Yes, that would have been impossible to sustain. But we could have seen something different from him here. I\u2019m hoping this is a slow burn to his eventual unravelling next week. The Julie Walters fan club     Poor Cynthia the massive pimp, who was not given much to do at all here. Photograph: Joe Alblas    \u201cIt\u2019s cocktail time!\u201d And the turban\u2019s come out! \u201cI just gave them somewhere private to do their business.\u201d You tell yourself that, Cynthia. You\u2019re no pimp! (Cynthia is a massive pimp and this is why we love her.) This was an interesting episode for Julie Walters in that it pointed up one of the key difficulties of this show: Indian Summers isn\u2019t comfortable with tone. Julie Walters can manage any key change and she just wasn\u2019t given much to do at all. That, my friends in Club Simla, is a warning sign. Cynthia should be used for comedy and light relief, for pathos and unexpected empathy. Here she was just shaking cocktails. Fingers crossed for a blinding finish next week.",
