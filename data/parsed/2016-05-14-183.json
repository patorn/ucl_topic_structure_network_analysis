This week\u2019s question: Last year we bought discounted National Trust membership at what was our only visit of the year. Now it wants \u00a3111 to renew. I want to support the charity but my husband says we should just \u201cpay as we go\u201d. Will it be money well spent? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.",
