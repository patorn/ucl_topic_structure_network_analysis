  "body": "Dear young adult reader, If you pick up a copy of my book The Deepest Cut and scan the blurb, you\u2019ll read a few key words; suicide, traumatised, argument... murder.  Murder. With that word, you\u2019re going to be expecting some violence within the book\u2019s pages, right? Of course you are.  I\u2019ve written a book about knife crime, leaving out the bit where he was actually stabbed would be the ultimate betrayal to you as my reader. I can imagine the conversation between us if you got to the end to find I\u2019d censored it out of the book.  You: Yeah, but what actually happened when he was stabbed?  Me: Oh, I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s too graphic for me to tell you.  You: Serious? Me: Uh-huh.     Natalie Flynn: I\u2019ve written a book about knife crime, leaving out the bit where he was actually stabbed would be the ultimate betrayal to you as my reader. Photograph: PR    You: I\u2019m not six. *hands book back and never speaks to me again* However, violence needs to be written with authenticity to be affective for you, so you know what would also have been a betrayal? If I\u2019d made it more than it was, over dramatized it; sensationalized it. I can imagine the conversation between us if you got to the end to find that I\u2019d over-hyped the violence and made it so much more than it should have been.  You: For real? Me: *laughs* Yeah, was good, wasn\u2019t it? You: Err, no. That character would never have done that.  Me: You: You\u2019re a rubbish writer. *hands book back and never speaks to me again*    Related: Can reading children's books help tackle knife crime?    It\u2019s a matter of balance. Too toned down, or too hyped up and it will completely invalidate the characters and the story for you in an instant, you\u2019ll lose faith in what you\u2019re reading and in me as an author. That\u2019s not what I want, so I didn\u2019t leave out the bit where he was stabbed. It\u2019s in there in black and white. I\u2019ve not watered it down and I\u2019ve not hyped it up. It is what it is. It\u2019s paramount to the story. It\u2019s true to the characters. It\u2019s being true to you.  Being true to you is important to me, my reader. You\u2019re not stupid. You\u2019re clever and wise. You live this stuff day in and day out, either first hand or through stories; through the media, through TV and films. You can sniff anything false a mile off. You can tell when you\u2019re being patronised or preached to and you don\u2019t take kindly to it and rightly so. Why should you? You\u2019re looking for authenticity. You\u2019re looking for truth and answers in a world that is often upside down and hard to make sense of. You\u2019re looking for validation and guidance through characters you can connect to, characters who are like you. You want to pick up a book and show your friends that bit of dialogue on page 47 and laugh because you lot are exactly the same. As an author, it\u2019s my duty to give you that.

It\u2019s sex and periods and emotions. It\u2019s heartbreak and friendship and annoying parents. It\u2019s how unbelievably boring school can sometimes be and how your best mate is not as good as you at Call of Duty, no matter what he says. It\u2019s the little things you go through on a day-to-day basis and it\u2019s the big stuff too. It\u2019s violence, suicide, drugs, abuse, teen pregnancy, bullying, death and mental health. It\u2019s the consequences of the choices you make. It\u2019s the responsibility you have as a member of society. It\u2019s what happens when things don\u2019t go right. It\u2019s how to find your way out of situations you\u2019ve got no idea how you got yourself in. These might be experiences you\u2019ve had and can relate to. Or they might be experiences you\u2019re in the midst of dealing with and we\u2019re potentially guiding you to the right help or the solution you need. How can we do that with anything other than the truth?  It\u2019s important to you that if you go looking for answers and guidance within the walls of your local bookshop, what you find there is nothing other than the truth. It\u2019s what you deserve.

I promise I will not water things down, or sugar coat them, nor will I hype them up. I promise I\u2019ll do my best to put it all down on paper realistically and fearlessly, mirroring back your world to you so that it feels like you\u2019re being listened to. So you\u2019ll feel like someone gets it, because, and I know I\u2019m not just speaking for myself when I say this but we do. We really do.  Natalie Flynn\u2019s The Deepest Cut is dedicated to the memory of knife crime victim Rob Knox who was killed on 24 May 2008. Rob Knox played Marcus Belby in the film Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince before he was killed in London aged just 18.",
