  "body": "1: O No!  If you have an aversion to audience participation and theatre about theatre you may think it wise to steer clear of this show by Jamie Wood. You would be so wrong. Taking its inspiration from Yoko Ono\u2019s art instructions, this wonky and utterly joyous hour is both a love letter to Ono and a gentle send-up, and it offers a kind of miracle as it turns even the most reluctant members of the audience into participants.  Wardrobe Theatre, Bristol, Sat & Sun  2: King Lear  There are still several Lears to come this year, including productions in Bristol (Timothy West), London\u2019s Old Vic (Glenda Jackson) and Stratford upon Avon (Antony Sher). But will we see a better one than Don Warrington\u2019s dispossessed king in Michael Buffong\u2019s plain but effective revival? Warrington acts up a storm as a majestic monarch who loses both his authority and his peace of mind as Cordelia\u2019s truth-telling punctures the trappings of power and tragedy ensues.   Birmingham Repertory Theatre, Thu to 28 May  3: Our Ladies Of Perpetual Succour  Vicky Featherstone\u2019s production of Alan Warner\u2019s cult 1998 novel The Sopranos is about a group of Scottish Catholic schoolgirls on the razzle during a choir trip to Edinburgh. Lee Hall\u2019s script captures both the inner and outer lives of these sweet-voiced and often dirty-minded teenagers, while the music \u2013 ranging from choral to pop \u2013 magnifies the emotions of an unashamedly big, bold and brassy story.  Theatre Royal, Brighton, Tue to 21 May  4: The Strange Undoing Of Prudencia Hart  David Greig and Wils Wilson\u2019s show \u2013 in which buttoned-up academic Prudencia Hart has an encounter with Satan while attending a conference \u2013 has been a deserved hit. Now it returns home to Scotland to spread its rough and ready magic on tour. Greig\u2019s rhyming couplets gleam with wit and cackle with naughtiness as Prudencia enters into a pact with the devil and at last becomes the lead character in her own story.   Blairgowrie, Tue; Montrose, Wed; St Andrews, Thu; Crieff, Fri  5: Ma Rainey\u2019s Black Bottom  Sharon D Clarke plays brilliantly obstreperous musician Ma Rainey in August Wilson\u2019s 1982 play set in a Chicago recording studio. It\u2019s your last chance to see Dominic Cooke\u2019s exquisitely acted revival, which follows the rhythms of jazz as the band try to fathom what it means to be an African American in a world where white men make all the rules.  National Theatre: Lyttelton, SE1, Mon to Wed",
