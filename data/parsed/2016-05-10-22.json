The beating, which the victim\u2019s attorney has described as \u201cthe worst law enforcement beating we\u2019ve seen on video since Rodney King\u201d, garnered national attention when surveillance footage was released to the public by the San Francisco public defender.  \u201cWhen officers take the law into their own hands, they undermine the moral authority of the entire criminal justice system,\u201d said district attorney George Gasc\u00f3n on announcing the charges. Luis Santamaria and Paul Wieber, both officers of the Alameda County sheriff\u2019s office (ACSO), struck the victim with their service batons at least 30 times over the course of 40 seconds in an alleyway on 12 November last year, the district attorney\u2019s office said. The deputies had chased Stanislav Petrov, a suspect in an auto theft, by car from a suburb about 25 miles east of San Francisco across the Bay Bridge and into the city.  News of the charges did not mollify Petrov\u2019s mother, Olga Petrov, who referenced allegations made by Petrov\u2019s attorney, Michael Haddad, that sheriff\u2019s deputies at the scene stole a gold chain that Petrov was wearing and used it to bribe two homeless witnesses to remain silent.  \u201cIt\u2019s a mockery of justice,\u201d she said Tuesday. \u201cAfter seven months, that they could throw in our face these miserable charges \u2026 It\u2019s an outrage.\u201d  The district attorney\u2019s office said that it is continuing to investigate allegations related to false police statements, theft, bribery and witness tampering.  \u201cThese charges against Wieber and Santamaria are 100% appropriate,\u201d said Haddad. \u201cAt the same time we\u2019re going forward with our civil rights case.\u201d Petrov has filed a claim against the Alameda County sheriff\u2019s office, a precursor to a civil rights lawsuit. He suffered broken bones in both hands, concussion, a mild traumatic brain injury, and deep lacerations to the head from the assault, according to court documents.  The announcement of the charges came on the same day that San Francisco\u2019s mayor, Ed Lee, put forward a proposal for $17.5m in new funding for police reforms over two years, with the stated goal of eliminating \u201cup to 80% of officer-involved shootings\u201d through a combination of training and new equipment, according to the mayor\u2019s office. The majority of the funding is earmarked for \u201cviolence prevention\u201d programs, including job training for \u201chigh-risk young adults\u201d. The mayor also plans to fund additional training for San Francisco police officers in implicit bias and de-escalation techniques and to purchase equipment including defensive shields, net guns, Tasers and beanbag guns.  Santamaria and Wieber are on paid administrative leave, but an ACSO spokesman, Sgt Ray Kelly, suggested that they may not be employed for long. \u201cThey\u2019ve been criminally charged. That\u2019s a really big deal,\u201d said Kelly. \u201cThe criminal charges are much more serious than any administrative charges that we could bring.\u201d Still, Kelly added, the administrative discipline for the two officers \u201cwill most likely be termination at some point\u201d.  According to Kelly, today\u2019s charges are the first time an Alameda County sheriff\u2019s deputy has been charged for using excessive force since officers fired shotguns at Berkeley student protesters in May 1969, killing one protester. Petrov is currently in jail on federal firearm and drug trafficking charges. Attorneys for the two deputies did not immediately respond to inquiries.  The original headline and video caption on this article have been corrected to reflect that it was Alameda County deputies, not San Francisco deputies, who were charged",
