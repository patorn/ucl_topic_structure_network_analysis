Related: Clerkenwell Design Week preview \u2013 in pictures    Creativity thrives in east London. Clerkenwell is at the heart of the action with, according to event organisers, more creative businesses and architects per square mile than any other place on the planet. Hundreds of new products will launch at the event, cementing its status as a world-class design hub. CDW has always used a variety of local spaces, and its organisers have introduced several new locations this year; creating a dedicated route running from Exmouth Market to Smithfield market, incorporating eight exhibition spaces and a series of commissioned installations. \u201cThe scale and ambition is the most significant change this year,\u201d says show director, William Knight. \u201cWe\u2019re extending the reach geographically and pushing the programme further north to Spa Fields. The half-mile route is a Hansel and Gretel model that joins the dots between installations and exhibitions. Local architects OMMX helped us with the strategy; they are stars of the future.\u201d     Jennifer Newman: \u2018CDW gives designers access to the Clerkenwell vibe and customers can touch and feel the products.\u2019 Photograph: PR    The new Spa Fields area houses the experiential Renault stand, which focuses on the company\u2019s commitment to innovation, technology and sustainable mobility for all. Here visitors can explore the innovative emissions-reducing technologies of the EOLAB, a revolutionary car prototype. Weighing 400kg less than an ordinary B-segment vehicle and using innovative ZE Hybrid rechargeable technology, it can travel 100km on just 1 litre of petrol, and implements around a hundred engineering innovations that will be incorporated in Renault cars of the future. One of eight main exhibition spaces, Icon House of Culture will be set in Smithfield\u2019s Fabric nightclub. Within the exhibition, Hove-based Dare Studio will show an exclusive cabinet collaboration with fashion house Eley Kishimoto, known for its vibrant graphic prints. Dare will also show a new chair from emerging furniture designer Alys Bryan and auction a special wingback chair, upholstered in John Burgerman fabric, to raise money for Maggie\u2019s Centres. \u201cWe\u2019re embracing the venue; creating a club within a club,\u201d says Sean Dare, who established Dare Studio in 2009. \u201cWe\u2019ve all enjoyed a night out at Fabric, so everyone is excited to see how it works as an exhibition space. \u201cWe\u2019ve been showing at CDW since the beginning. Putting on an exhibition on the doorstep of London\u2019s most important designers and architects is inspired, and the event gets bigger every year.\u201d The British Collection exhibition, at the Crypt on Clerkenwell Green, includes the launch of the new \u201cclub table\u201d, with steel legs and a bamboo surface, from Jennifer Newman Studio. \u201cWe\u2019ve been based in Clerkenwell for five years and CDW allows us to say hello to architects, interior designers and clients,\u201d says Jennifer Newman. \u201cAs well as showing new products, CDW is a testing area for us. We show prototypes to get direct feedback; people bring us new ideas, too. \u201cCDW gives designers access to the Clerkenwell vibe and customers can touch and feel the products; we first came to the event before we had a showroom, and giving our clients real-life access to our products was crucial. Even if new designers just get a tiny corner at the event, it can be a launchpad for them.\u201d     Renault\u2019s stand focuses on the company\u2019s commitment to innovation, technology and sustainable mobility.

With a focus on innovation that combines beautiful design and user-friendly technology, Renault is a natural headline sponsor for the event. This spring, Renault is also collaborating with Central Saint Martins on a project that invites design students to shape the future of personal transport, working with eco-friendly materials and technologies. At CDW, Renault will provide a fleet of electric Twizy cars to shuttle visitors around the show and opportunities to test-drive the all-electric Renault ZOE on site. \u201cVisitors loved jumping in and out of the Twizys last year,\u201d says Knight. \u201cWe have a true collaboration with Renault, and it adds a nice layer of creativity to CDW.\u201d Clerkenwell Design Week runs from 24 to 26 May 2016 http://www.clerkenwelldesignweek.com/",
