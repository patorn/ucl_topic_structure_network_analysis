  "body": "Why and how do we sing and what makes us enjoy listening to others sing? The question resounds through this wise and witty second book from Tracey Thorn, author of the bestselling pop memoir Bedsit Disco Queen, which chronicled her 30-year music career including her time in Everything But the Girl and subsequent solo adventures. This \u201cinside story of singing\u201d is wide ranging, charting her own development (from the \u201cjoyous experience\u201d of singing along to Patti Smith\u2019s Horses as a teenager to becoming a professional singer) and examining the mechanics of singing and anatomy of the throat, since \u201csinging is a physical activity as much as an emotional one\u201d. The title refers to Thorn\u2019s stage fright and a nightmare she would have about being naked at the Albert Hall, while alluding to ideas of emotional exposure and vulnerability. \u201cThere\u2019s more thinking in singing than you might think,\u201d writes Thorn, who not only draws on the rich reservoir of her experience but also weaves in thinking from throughout the ages (including Roland Barthes\u2019s 1972 essay The Grain of the Voice and Ian Bostridge\u2019s A Singer\u2019s Notebook exploring the relationship between singing, feeling and performance), and incisive interviews with singers Green Gartside, Alison Moyet and Linda Thompson, among others. \u201cI\u2019m writing as a book-lover, too, drawn to those points where my love of singing and my love of literature overlap; where novels or poems articulate deeper truths about singing, and its significance,\u201d writes Thorn. Some of the most compelling parts of the book are Thorn\u2019s insightful discussions of characters in fiction who embody different aspects of singers and singing: Bel Canto by Ann Patchett featuring a character obsessed with a singer; The Song of the Lark by Willa Cather, whose heroine leaves her home town and becomes a singer; A Slipping-Down Life by Anne Tyler, a fascinating exploration of the nature of fandom. Finding your unique, personal sound is \u201cthe key ingredient in becoming a singer\u201d, believes Thorn. \u201cListeners will follow you a long way if you keep them interested. The aim isn\u2019t necessarily to feel beholden to your innate voice, but above all to aim for one that has confidence in itself, and expresses something unique.\u201d Thorn eloquently strikes upon some profound truths about human communication as she tests the powers and limits of the human voice.
