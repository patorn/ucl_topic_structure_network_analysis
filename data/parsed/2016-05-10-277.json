  "body": "An Australian woman has been banned from social media for what a magistrate said might prove to be \u201cthe best six months of her life\u201d, after posting nude photos of another woman on Facebook. Courtney Marie Mulkentine, 19, of Mothar Mountain outside Gympie, Queensland, pleaded guilty to using an electronic carriage service to harass or offend on 26 January. The Gympie Times reports that the photos were sent to Mulkentine by the other woman\u2019s ex-boyfriend. She posted them to Facebook but removed them after the victim called her to complain. In sentencing, Magistrate Maxine Baldwin said Mulkentine needed to learn how to use social media \u201cresponsibly\u201d, noting that cases of suicide had been prompted by online harassment. She sentenced Mulkentine to six months\u2019 probation, with the condition that she not use any social media \u2013 including Snapchat, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and any other social medium \u201csome geek comes up with\u201d, reported the Gympie Times. \u201cDon\u2019t try to use another account or a false name. Someone will dob you,\u201d she said. \u201cIt might be the best six months of your life. You won\u2019t have to look at your phone every five minutes.\u201d     Courtney Marie Mulkentine\u2019s last Instagram post for a while.   Gympie lawyer Chris Anderson confirmed he represented Mulkentine but declined to comment. Mulkentine also declined to be interviewed by Guardian Australia, but said she had been offered money for interviews. She alerted her Facebook friends to her change in circumstances on Tuesday, suggesting a positively retro alternative. \u201cHeu [sic] guys due to court restrictions, I have been banned from facebook snapchat and instagram or any other social media site for 6 months heres my number if you want to chat.\u201d In February a Senate committee recommended that the government criminalise the unauthorised sharing of intimate photos, an increasingly common practice known as revenge porn. If the report\u2019s recommendations are adopted, anyone who takes intimate images without consent, and anyone who shares them or publishes them online, could face prosecution.",
