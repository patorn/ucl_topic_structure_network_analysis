I bought it again recently, and it still smelt as inky as I remembered. In Los Angeles the drugs were great, so were the food and sunshine. I saw the Brian Jonestown Massacre perform there in 1997, and moved out a year later. It felt as far away as I could get from life in England, from the Tim that was boring in Salford. My parents approved of my career. They knew I knew where it was at. They were around the table when the label Beggars Banquet signed the Charlatans. I wouldn\u2019t say they were cool, though. I used to post cocaine to myself, taped to the inside sleeve of records like Chicago or a Jamiroquai album. If I did get caught I could say I would never listen to a Jamiroquai record, so how could it possibly be mine? I\u2019ve always been compulsive. I eat nothing but crisps at the moment. And only one flavour \u2013 I can\u2019t get past cheese and onion. But I\u2019ve got to stop chomping down on them, because I\u2019ve just broken a tooth.    You can feel the fibres of your body sewing back together again when you meditate    Steve Coogan is the funniest person in the world. And he keeps getting funnier. I was backstage with him at a Paul Weller concert, and he was pissed, but so was I. Michael Douglas was also there, and I went over and just started talking to him. He told me the history of the Los Angeles Theatre. I had to stop taking drugs when I started running low on money. I spent a lot on cocaine and alcohol and, after that, prescription pills. When I tried to stop, my wife [Michelle] took more. She was probably trying to make me jealous. We did talk about it, but there was no one listening, really. So I left her, and everything apart from my records. Sex is the last thing on the agenda when you\u2019re taking drugs. It was for me, anyway, and definitely for my wife. Sober and with my new partner, Nik, of five years, it\u2019s a pure thing. It took me about 10 years to get over the death of my bandmate Rob [Collins, who was killed in a car crash in 1996]. It was so sudden and I blurred a lot of it out on purpose. When John [Brookes, the Charlatans drummer] passed away in 2013, my little boy had just been born, so I had something brand new and small to concentrate on. It\u2019s still raw, but I don\u2019t think of him as gone. I\u2019m more of a dad than a rock star. Richard Ashcroft [of the Verve] is a real \u201crock star\u201d. I like playing with my son and his Paw Patrol figures. Chase and Rubble are my favourites. You can feel the fibres of your body sewing back together again when you meditate. I very much recommend it. I do it for 20 minutes in the morning and 20 in the afternoon. My life before was sky high, and these days it\u2019s as real and natural as the extreme of what it used to be. The best hairdressers wouldn\u2019t do my hair the way I want it. I use the platinum stuff from Boots. I do the front myself, and cut my fringe, then Nik does the back. Blondes definitely have more fun. The Charlatans are headlining Electric Fields (26-27 August) and Kendal Calling (28-31 July) this summer.
