  "body": "Over almost a decade of increasingly failed strategies by the Home Office to counter the radicalisation of young people (Revealed: UK\u2019s covert propaganda bid to stop Muslims joining Isis, 2 May), is it not time the government embarked on a strategy of trusting British Muslims? It is now clear that the government has always considered its \u201cpsychological warfare and operations unit\u201d headquartered in the Home Office as the principal way of dealing with the British Muslim community and not the Bell Pottinger PR-spun \u201ccommunities\u201d cheer-led by those that \u201cministers can work with\u201d over recent years.\u00a0   Related: Revealed: UK's covert propaganda bid to stop Muslims joining Isis    It is time the government tried hard to work with the un-annointed \u201cothers\u201d, and stopped trying to navel gaze through the shameful use of battle-hardened soldiers and ex-MI6 officers to wage war on its own citizens. British Muslims, if engaged openly and honestly, may be able to help provide solutions and leadership that steer us away from current counterproductive paths which serve to ensure clashes of civilisation on our very own streets.Sharhabeel LoneChairman, Kentish Town Community Organisation, London \u2022 While it may well be quite right to employ clandestine propaganda as part of a counter-radicalisation programme, it is certainly quite wrong that the bulk of this should be discharged by a profit-making private company. We cannot have the defence of our realm secured by commercialism. If Breakthrough Media Network can run clandestine state security, we might as well hand policing over to G4S tomorrow.Robin WendtChester \u2022 Hand in Hand for Syria, Syria Relief, and Human Care Syria, the charities named in your article (Help for Syria; the \u2018aid campaign\u2019 secretly run by the UK government, 3 May), do crucial work in providing aid to communities under attack by the Syrian regime: communities that the UN is often unable to assist because of the obstruction of the Syrian government. If the British government chooses to assist that crucial lifeline \u2013 even in this convoluted manner \u2013 then what is the problem? I\u2019d rather see my taxes spent on food and clothing for dispossessed Syrians than on bombs. My sole objection is that they are spending money on expensive contractors that could be far better employed helping the besieged people of Syria. That is the real scandal here. I can only hope that the undeserved conspiratorial shadow that this story has cast over these organisations doesn\u2019t hamper their essential work. In order to ensure that, the Guardian owes these organisations equal space to explain what it is they do and why it matters so much.Brian SlocockChester \u2022 I wonder if your shock-horror expos\u00e9 of a government attempt by the Research, Information and Communications Unit (Ricu) to influence Muslim would-be martyrs through covert propaganda has done them or the country a service? Such impressionable young people were never going to listen to reason. I can\u2019t myself think of a better way to put across a \u201ccounter-narrative\u201d as Ricu calls it. Certainly the operation that you report is creepy, but it\u2019s not illegal and it might have done some good. But that has been negated by your revelations.Piers CrokeLondon \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
