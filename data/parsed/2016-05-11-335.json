  "body": "Dave Hill, 57, the new president of the Association of Directors of Children\u2019s Services (ADCS), used his inaugural speech last month to demand a debate about the limits of state interference in family life, saying plainly that \u201cwe intervene too often and sometimes too readily\u201d. \u201cWe may need to take fewer children into care than we currently do,\u201d he added.   Related: Rise in referrals to social services causing trauma to families, expert says    His speech came days after the government released figures for 2015-16 showing that council applications to take children into state care had reached a record high of 12, 741. Repeating the phrase to the Guardian, he is careful to say only that we \u201cmay\u201d need to remove fewer children. In the febrile, headline-driven and politically charged atmosphere around the public discussion of how best to protect children at risk of serious harm, Hill has been responsible for turning around a children\u2019s services department twice slated by the inspectorate, Ofsted. Since joining Essex county council in 2010, he has reduced the number of children in care in the county by around a third, from 1,650 to just under 1,000. That journey began with some fundamental principles and a hard look at the intent of the legislation that underpins all children\u2019s social work, he explains. \u201cThe Children Act 1989 says that when push comes to shove, of course, children must be protected, but there was also cross-party agreement then about what that legislation was also saying, which is that society has a responsibility to support children to live in their families, and if not Mum and Dad, then Granny or Auntie,\u201d he says.    What we shouldn\u2019t have is a big swing to \u2018less risk, even less risk, and bring more children into care\u2019  Dave Hill     Knowing that Essex had to make \u00a30.5bn in cuts, Hill drove a bargain with the then deputy leader of the Conservative-led council. \u201cI said for every pound I save you, will you give me 33p back to invest in early preventative services that help children stay with their families?\u201d Hill got the money. At the same time, he told social workers to \u201cstop worrying about computer systems and go and work with children and families all day long\u201d. He set up eight teams of 10 specially recruited social workers \u2013 which later expanded to 12 across the county \u2013 to do exactly that. \u201cAs many cases are being raised [in Essex] now as in 2010, so there is no less social work being done,\u201d he points out. And Hill argues that his teams are actually \u201csharper now at bringing children into care\u201d when that is required. Essex\u2019s turnaround happened, he suggests, by marrying investment in interventions that were known to be effective \u2013 with so little money, he won\u2019t spend a penny on anything that is not proven to work \u2013 with a determination to prevent a situation from deteriorating. \u201cIf your referrals and cases are defined by firefighting, you end up spending 90% of your budget on crises, and round and round you go. Because your systems are geared up only to fight fires,\u201d he says. It hasn\u2019t all gone smoothly. An early row with director of the \u201cTroubled Families\u201d programme Louise Casey \u2013 he refused to use the \u201cTroubled Families\u201d title, and said he intended to spend the proffered cash on all Essex families who needed support, rather than on a defined group of them \u2013 meant he was seriously worried at one point that Casey might take the money back. Essex was also the first local authority to trial a social impact bond . In hindsight, although he said it worked, and resulted in considerable savings, Hill sounds only moderately enthusiastic, possibly because investors wanted the bond spent on a particular group of families so they could see if their dosh was what made the difference. Although Hill says he might use social investment again, it\u2019s clear from these two examples that directing dollops of cash at particular groups of families \u2013 and therefore explicitly excluding others \u2013 does not sit comfortably with him. Given that the prime minister makes no bones of his enthusiasm for seeing more children adopted, more speedily, and the government recently declared it will change the law if judges don\u2019t sign off more adoption orders pronto, does Hill believe children\u2019s services now remove children too quickly, and plump for adoption too fast? Politically, this is highly sensitive stuff, not least because it involves contentious debates around ethics and human rights that will be interrogated in a year-long enquiry into adoption and social work by the British Association of Social Workers. Hill doesn\u2019t hesitate to answer. \u201cI think we\u2019ve lost a bit of our compass on it if I\u2019m honest. I don\u2019t think any of us have a problem with supporting adoption as an option, but I think we\u2019ve lost the nub of the legislation. I do understand that it\u2019s a human response to tragedy and a society\u2019s response to the pain of children being killed, but the authorities rated as good or outstanding [on child protection by Ofsted] tend to be underpinned by a philosophy of the way social work should be done, and social workers are able to make professional decisions and are supported well. When cases such as Baby Peter happen, we see social workers being less open to risk, and more likely to bring children into care or put them on child protection plans: though we\u2019ll never prevent a slight knee-jerk response to those tragedies, what we shouldn\u2019t have is a big swing to \u2018less risk, even less risk, and bring more children into care\u2019. What we need is a more balanced approach.\u201d Essex is not the only local authority to have turned its children\u2019s services around by creating a brand new mindset to safeguarding vulnerable children. With a distinctly different geography, economic and population profile, Leeds has reduced its numbers of children in care by 14% by deciding it will become, at a fundamental level, a \u201cchild-friendly city\u201d, extending its view of what a family is in child protection terms, and adopting the philosophical mindset that investing in children and families is critical to the city\u2019s regeneration. This kind of transformation takes big, brave thinking, and an acceptance of working in a situation of what Hill calls \u201cmanaged risk\u201d. He says straight up that social workers \u201care in the risk business\u201d and is clear that the balanced approach he advocates cannot be sustained without a confident, well supported workforce. How to achieve this will be one focus of his year as ADCS president. Hill, a trained social worker with a career spanning senior roles in children\u2019s services across many local authorities in London, also wants to redefine the role of the social work inspectorate.  While he accepts that Ofsted is good at determining when children\u2019s services are inadequate (there are 19 such departments in England), he doesn\u2019t think it is much good at helping them to improve. \u201cI would favour Ofsted having a black and white response to inspection: reached minimum grade, tick, or failed minimum grade, cross,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then the sector should be defining what is good practice.\u201d Just 17 English local authorities\u2019 children\u2019s services are rated as good. Hill\u2019s aim is for these to work closely in partnership with councils striving to improve. \u201cTo be clear, I am not talking about chasing a set of indicators,\u201d he says, \u201cbut more about how to establish practice models.\u201d He is also determined to change what he believes is a destructive public narrative that sees care leavers characterised as socially disruptive, failing in their education and prone to end up in prison. He is biting about some politicians whom he accuses of making \u201cclumsy\u201d statements that create an underlying sense of care being a bad place to end up. But surely those children\u2019s experiences of care, and their educational, social and employment outcomes could not, for very many, be described as resoundingly good? Hill points to recent research showing educational outcomes for children in care were better than those looked after in the community who are designated \u201cin need\u201d (though this doesn\u2019t mean that either compared well to the \u201cstandard\u201d cohort, he adds). He wants to \u201ccompletely transform\u201d the lives of those who do enter the care system. With councils so strapped for cash, how does he think they are going to manage it? \u201cYou\u2019ve got to look after fewer children,\u201d he says. That frees up foster carers so there is a better choice of \u201cresilient, child-centred and totally committed\u201d people who can better cope with traumatised children. It frees up money, too. It costs around \u00a354,000 a year for Essex county council to look after a child. And, he says, you need to develop social workers \u201cwho understand working from the children\u2019s perspective and being dependable and reliable\u201d. \u201cThese things sound obvious, but they do make the difference,\u201d Hill insists. He views the vulnerability of children in the context of the wider disadvantage experienced by their families. But with services split between adults\u2019 \u2013 under the Department of Health \u2013 and children\u2019s \u2013 managed by the Department for Education \u2013 policy and resources often dovetail poorly, if at all.: anyone over 18, including desperate parents at risk of having their child removed, often battles in vain to meet thresholds for mental health services, for example, unless they are in acute crisis. \u201cWe struggle to get people from those departments round the same table,\u201d Hill says with evident frustration. He dismisses the idea of merging the services as \u201ctoo simplistic\u201d, but believes there needs to be a \u201crecalibration\u201d in the way they understand and work with families so that needs are seen \u201cin the round\u201d. He says: \u201cRecognising the resilience of families and investing in families \u2013 because communities are made up of families \u2013 I think that\u2019s the absolute game changer in social policy over the next 30 years.\u201d Curriculum vitae Age 57.
