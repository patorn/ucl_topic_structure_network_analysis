  "body": "ITV News is being investigated by the broadcasting regulator over a complaint that a news report on the London mayoral election was biased against Ukip.

The rule states: \u201cDue impartiality must be strictly maintained in a constituency report or discussion and in an electoral area report or discussion.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re investigating whether due impartiality was maintained during a report on ITV about the London mayoral election,\u201d said a spokesman for Ofcom.",
