Related: UK elections: Sadiq Khan 'has won' London mayoral race - live updates    Clive Lewis, a shadow energy minister and Corbyn loyalist, told the Guardian that the leader needed to beef up his team of advisers and should be willing to make policy compromises with the rest of the party \u2013 including, if necessary, on the renewal of Trident. \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent on people around Jeremy to say, \u2018We\u2019re going to take a leap of faith,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m saying to people is: compromise, reach out. Sometimes we do forget. We are comrades, we are colleagues and we agree on more than we disagree on.\u201d Lewis, the Norwich South MP who has been a strong advocate of Corbyn\u2019s approach, said there were also concerns, even among those who are sympathetic to the leader, about the quality of his top team. \u201cI think it is fair to say that there has been an improvement in the leader\u2019s office and I think people want to see that move on faster,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about opening up and bringing in people with a wider range of experience. A narrative needs to be developed, and a strategy.\u201d Lewis\u2019s intervention comes after a number of shadow cabinet ministers, including Hilary Benn and Ian Murray, openly warned that the party needed to do better. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, told Corbyn\u2019s critics to \u201cput up or shut up\u201d amid persistent speculation about a leadership coup later this summer.

In a scathing critique on the BBC, Murray, the shadow Scottish secretary, said Corbyn\u2019s Labour had shown it was not a \u201ccredible party of future government in 2020\u201d, while Benn, the shadow foreign secretary, said that although Corbyn had a mandate, it was only \u201celectoral test that counts\u201d. \u201cIf we are going to form a government in 2020, which we want to to be able to get rid of this government, then we\u2019ve got to win back more people\u2019s trust and confidence and that\u2019s a task for all of us in the party,\u201d Benn said. Chris Bryant, the shadow leader of the House of Commons, said the party must learn it needed to win over the Corbynistas and the Blairites. \u201cWe have to be absolutely clear that we are not match-ready and if we just tumble forward to the 2020 election, we will lose,\u201d he said. The shadow education secretary, Lucy Powell, said the lesson was to \u201ctake stock, reflect, listen and learn\u201d from the victories and defeats. The results triggered a mea culpa by two new MPs who nominated Corbyn in the leadership race in a bid to widen the debate within the Labour party. Writing for the Guardian, Jo Cox and Neil Coyle said they regretted their decision, warning that \u201cweak leadership\u201d and \u201cpoor judgment\u201d could keep the party out of power until 2030. Peter Lamb, the leader of Crawley council where Labour retained its majority, said Corbyn had a \u201csignificant mandate\u201d from the party but said the leader\u2019s team were damaging the party\u2019s electoral prospects. \u201cThe most worrying thing for the Labour party right now is not losing 2020, it is about being so far out at the 2020 election that a majority in 2025 is impossible,\u201d said Lamb. Many of Corbyn\u2019s critics seized the warnings of psephologists who lined up to say that Labour had little to celebrate, even though it held its ground in England and got a slightly larger share of the votes than the Conservatives. YouGov\u2019s Marcus Roberts said: \u201cIt looks like Labour, for just the third time since 1974, is set to have lost seats in local elections as an opposition rather than gain them. Oppositions heading for government win local elections. Oppositions heading for big general election defeats lose local elections. Pure and simple.\u201d Worries that Corbyn needs to do more to unite the party have been growing even before it was pushed into third place in Scotland, behind the Conservatives, losing 13 seats. With most English council results in, Labour lost around 17 seats. In Wales, the party held on to control in the assembly, but lost the stronghold of the Rhondda to Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood. Momentum, the grassroots group of Corbyn supporters, is readying itself to see off any leadership challenge to the party leader, lining up activists to staff a phone bank and motivate sympathetic activists to back him. But Lewis said it was not good enough for Corbyn to postpone the reckoning. \u201cLet\u2019s just say in the next two years there\u2019s a coup: that\u2019s just going to be two years of constant in-fighting and backstabbing and looking like a shambles,\u201d he said. Instead, he said, the message to Corbyn should be: \u201cWe don\u2019t think you\u2019re firing on all cylinders, but let us help.\u201d With Emily Thornberry due to publish her report into defence policy - including the future of the UK\u2019s nuclear deterrent \u2013 in the coming weeks, Lewis said Corbyn, who has long championed unilateral nuclear disarmament, should accept the verdict of Labour\u2019s autumn conference, even if it backs Trident.     Hilary Benn has said the party needs to win back the trust and confidence of the electorate. Photograph: Giles Price for the Guardian    \u201cHave a debate,\u201d said Lewis. \u201cThere\u2019s no guarantee that Jeremy will win, but to my mind \u2013 yes that is an important issue, but park this after September. Let\u2019s find out what unites us.\u201d While some of Corbyn\u2019s supporters are keen to heal the rift in the party, others hope to use the better-than-expected results \u2013 some forecasters had pointed to a loss of more than a hundred council seats \u2013 to consolidate the left\u2019s hold on the party. Any attempt at an immediate coup appeared less likely after the party held its ground in England, retaining control of councils such as Nuneaton and Harlow. Jon Lansman, chair of Momentum, said the grim night in Scotland, where Labour slipped to third place behind the Conservatives, showed that the party should \u201cput its values up front\u201d. \u201cI think the real lesson of Scotland ... is that it is a problem and this can happen to Labour if it doesn\u2019t put its values up front,\u201d he said. \u201cShort-term electoral gain does not win in the long term, and what it has done is led to disaster in Scotland.\u201d He added that the party had made a mistake in Wales by failing to wholeheartedly embrace Corbyn and his anti-austerity stance. \u201cThe only major seat we have actually lost is to Plaid in Wales,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a warning in that. Carwyn Jones obviously distanced himself from Jeremy and repositioned the Welsh party somewhat to the right of his predecessors.\u201d While the results of Thursday\u2019s elections were not catastrophic, with the party\u2019s share of the vote up marginally from last year\u2019s general election, most observers, including a number of frontbenchers, believe a Labour government in 2020 remains an unlikely prospect, and there have been persistent rumours that several MPs are manoeuvring against Corbyn.   Related: What do Labour voters think of the party's election performance?    Dan Jarvis, the former paratrooper frequently touted as a potential challenger, registered a second \u00a312,500 donation from Labour donor Peter Hearn, who backed Yvette Cooper\u2019s leadership bid, at the end of April, in a hint that he may be preparing the ground for a future run. With former health secretary Andy Burnham, one of the party\u2019s heavy hitters, announcing that he is considering standing as the mayor of Manchester when radical new powers are devolved to the city, there are growing fears among some in Labour of a brain drain, if it appears that the earliest the party can expect to be back in government is 2025. Corbyn\u2019s critics are concerned that the party\u2019s dire performance in Scotland will raise the bar for winning a general election, because for every seat it loses in what was once its Scottish strongholds, it must make more inroads into less promising electoral territory in currently Conservative or Liberal Democrat areas of England. George Osborne\u2019s former adviser, Rupert Harrison, tweeted on Friday to say the Conservatives\u2019 performance in Scotland was \u201cby far [the] most significant ... election result\u201d.    Scotland by far most significant of today's election results: means 2020 general election will be re-run of 2015 whoever is Labour leader\u2014 Rupert Harrison (@rbrharrison) May 6, 2016",
