  "body": "Player of the season  Robert Kitson Impossible to look beyond Maro \u2018Is it a bird, is it a plane\u2019 Itoje. To be man of the match in both the semi-final and final as Saracens advanced to their first European title is some achievement, let alone for a 21-year-old. As his team-mate Schalk Brits said last month: \u201cHe is the total package...he\u2019s already world-class.\u201d Both Saracens and England are lucky to have him.    Related: Maro Itoje focusing on Leicester following standout display for Saracens | Paul Rees    Michael Aylwin Owen Farrell. His kicking - and not just from tee - tortured Racing in the final, but his confidence with ball in hand, up against the gainline, shredded Toulouse and Ulster in the pool stages. That tackling technique still needs work, but he\u2019s turning into quite the player.  Eddie Butler Billy Vunipola. He has become such a presence on the field, sorting out the occasional scrum that\u2019s not solid, taking the bumps when it\u2019s time to stop and start again, and above all playing a full part in the transition of Saracens from challengers to champions. Tough as old boots but with a smile on his face.  Paul Rees Any one of a number of Saracens, unbeaten in a tournament they have become equipped for. Their current England players have been to the fore, but no one epitomises their determination, work rate and willpower more than the player who led them to victory over Racing, Brad Barritt, as selfless as ever. Honourable mentions for Chris Masoe, Charles Piutau and Peter Betham.  Favourite match  Eddie Butler Wasps 25-24 Exeter. This had been England\u2019s season and this was an all-England quarter final that began at pace and grew faster with each passing minute. No two clubs epitomise better the evolution of old-style England into the spearhead of the game aiming at the future.  Michael Aylwin Clermont 28-37 Bordeaux. A few candidates, but this beats them all for breathless insanity. Just a bonus point would have done for Clermont. They led 14-0 after four minutes, then 28-20 after 63. But Bordeaux kept coming. Then Morgan Parra confounded us all by tapping the penalty that would have taken Clermont through.  Paul Rees Wasps\u2019 victory at Leinster in the opening round was based on opportunism rather than possession, seizing on mistakes and counter-attacking with dazzle. They followed it up at home to Toulon and at Bath, but Dublin marked the real start of their season.  Robert Kitson Exeter Chiefs 33-17 Ospreys. It should have been impossible for Exeter to top their European pool but a combination of a five-try drubbing of Ospreys and Morgan Parra\u2019s head-clutching decision to tap and go rather than kick a crucial penalty for Clermont against Bordeaux made for an unforgettable Sunday afternoon in the West Country.

Another remarkable match in the Massif Central ended with this astonishing try with time up. Dan Evans fielded restart, Dan Baker carried, Habberfield to Dan Biggar, half-break by Rory Thornton out of 22, three-quarter break by Hanno Dirksen, to Biggar for full break, then Habberfield with the pace of the winger he sometimes is to run in past two defenders for two bonus points.

Toulon had not suffered a bigger European defeat for five years.  Paul Rees Halai for Wasps at home to Exeter in the quarter-final. They were 24-11 down with 20 minutes do to go when Thomas Young won a turnover, Elliot Daly started a move from behind his own line and after Wasps briefly lost possession in Exeter\u2019s 22, Young\u2019s off-load to Siale Piutau who fed Halai to start an unlikely comeback.  Eddie Butler Dan Robson for Wasps against Saracens last month. A try from the kick-off that set the tone for a riveting semi-final. It wasn\u2019t an immediate break-out, because Wasps had to go left and then right to the touchlines before Jimmy Gopperth combined with George Smith to release Christian Wade, who in turn found his scrum half in support. A classic start to a classic match.  Best atmosphere Eddie Butler Sandy Park. The crowd played a full part in Exeter\u2019s defeat of the Ospreys in the last pool game. The match atmosphere was bettered only by the post-match euphoria that greeted Exeter\u2019s passage, thanks to results elsewhere, to the knock-out stage.  Paul Rees The City Ground at Nottingham in the semi-final when Racing 92 overcame an atmosphere as hostile as that in a French stadium to squeeze past Leicester.  Robert Kitson Even when the home side are not playing well the Stade Mayol in Toulon offers a vivid setting: passionate fans in the stands, great talent on the pitch, yachts bobbing in the adjoining Mediterranean. They may have lost their European title but in this category at least, they still lead the way.  Michael Aylwin Toulon. Can\u2019t imagine anywhere having a better atmosphere than Clermont, but didn\u2019t go there this season. Did go to Toulon, and that\u2019s next best. Drew Mitchell scored with the last play to beat Wasps. No four tries, but the papers went up in the air anyway. Steak-frites on the waterfront afterwards.

Eddie Butler No panic. The Pro 12 was never going to compete, it was said \u2013 just before Leinster became champions. England may have pulled ahead and may be embracing the grand style, but the neighbours won\u2019t be left behind for long. England\u2019s surge is just part of rugby union\u2019s rich cycle. The best hope: Glasgow.    Related: Glasgow Warriors sign Italy wing Leonardo Sarto for next season    Michael Aylwin What hope for the Premiership? France\u2019s next TV deal will be worth twice what the English earn from theirs now and seven times what the Pro12 do. The recent re-organisation of Europe further impoverishes the Pro12. If one league starts to fall behind it is to no one\u2019s benefit. Thankfully it remains 15 v 15, so there\u2019s some hope at least.  Paul Rees If Leicester City can win football\u2019s Premier League and Crystal Palace reach the FA Cup final \u2026  Which teams outside France and England will mount the strongest bid next season?  Robert Kitson Charles Piutau will give Ulster a different dimension and Leinster will surely come again. Looking at the power of the Montpellier pack and the growing spending power in England, though, an instant Celtic revival feels far from inevitable.",
