  "body": "How the mighty have fallen. A few weeks ago, George Blagden was playing Louis XIV in the extravagant miniseries Versailles, swanning around in heels and wigs and frilly blouses as he ordered the construction of his snazzy new palace. Today, he is at the self-service counter at a cafe in St James\u2019s Park, London, ordering his own tea (\u201cOoh is that mine? That was quick!\u201d). We repair to a table outside, under the gaze of some feral-looking pigeons. The 26-year-old actor is all in black: black jacket (zipped up), black hair (faintly curly), black stubble. He is dashing, with a touch of raggedy wildness that suggests a young Terence Stamp or Rufus Sewell.   Related: Antonia Fraser: the sexy and scandalous truth about Versailles    He is likely about to be very big indeed. The series \u2013 which tells the story of the Sun King\u2019s battles to strengthen the throne (and have lots of sex) after his decision to move his court from Paris to Versailles \u2013 attracted 1.07 million viewers when it debuted on Canal+ last year \u2013 a record for an original drama on the French network. It had already been commissioned for a second series and has now been sold to more than 135 countries.  This naughty, trashy and very knowing \u00a324m English-language production mixes historical fact, scandalous rumour and outright fabrication. In the first five minutes alone there is sex, violence and an unorthodox use of oranges. In the second episode, someone gets knifed in the eye by a chap in a dress. \u201cEveryone\u2019s going to be talking about different bits,\u201d says Blagden excitedly. \u201cThere\u2019s romance. Political intrigue. There\u2019s even a kind of CSI: Versailles element.\u201d With a predominantly French crew, there was no shortage of opinions about his character. \u201cI hadn\u2019t realised what a brand I was playing. Nearly everyone had a different take on Louis. Some were saying he was the godfather of modern culture. Others could see only his heartlessness. What was important to me was showing his vulnerability. He\u2019d been king from the age of five, and it took him a long time to stop being a boy. His mother made all the decisions until her death, when he was 28. Now he\u2019s at his weakest and most paranoid.\u201d         Watch a teaser for Versailles    Many of his woes arise from his sneaky, bisexual brother, Philippe, Duke of Orl\u00e9ans, played with lip-smacking delight by Alexander Vlahos. While Blagden is the heart-throb of the show, it is Vlahos who gets the campest lines. Admonished by Louis for spending a fortune on shoes, he purrs: \u201cYou haven\u2019t seen the shoes.\u201d But Blagden insists there wasn\u2019t any rivalry. \u201cWhen we do scenes, we really feed off one another. Neither of us takes anything that happens on screen away from the set. We weren\u2019t kicking off and throwing cappuccinos at each other.\u201d     Who\u2019s the fairest of them all? Alexander Vlahos, left, and Blagden in Versailles. Photograph: Canal+/BBC    At least Blagden gets the spiffiest costumes. Heels were the big revelation. \u201cNow I understand why people wear them. They do wonders for your confidence.\u201d Not that he didn\u2019t suffer for his art. \u201cWe were filming outside in summer, it was 27 degrees and I was dripping with sweat. I said to the costume designer, \u2018I\u2019m wearing five layers and you can only see two of them. Can\u2019t I take some off?\u2019 She said, \u2018No, George. If you do that, the jacket won\u2019t sit right.\u2019 No one was willing to cut any corners.\u201d You don\u2019t get that attention to detail on every series. \u201cI heard Sean Bean on Game of Thrones had pockets sewn into his leather armour for his cigarette packs,\u201d he says.    Eddie Redmayne told me actors only work six months a year. I thought, God, I hope he's lying    Three days before shooting, he filmed his last scenes on Vikings, the grimy drama for the History channel in which he played the monk Athelstan for three series. Blagden was in a removals van when he got the news he was being killed off. \u201cI was on the A64 north of York, taking some things from my parents\u2019 home back to my place in London. I pulled over and read the email. My girlfriend said, \u2018What\u2019s wrong?\u2019 I said, \u2018I\u2019m dying.\u2019 It\u2019s like being fired, isn\u2019t it? But in a creative way.\u201d Going immediately from Athelstan to Louis XIV suited him. \u201cI hate not working. It\u2019s that lack of purpose. It becomes very easy to lie in until midday.\u201d When he was cast as the revolutionary Grantaire in the film of Les Mis\u00e9rables straight after drama school, Blagden\u2019s co-star Eddie Redmayne confided to him that even full-time actors only work six months a year. \u201cI thought, \u2018God, I hope he\u2019s lying.\u2019 I should have picked a nine-to-five.\u201d     Raggedy wildness \u2026 Blagden is like a young Terence Stamp or Rufus Sewell. Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian    He tries to keep himself busy: until 18 months ago, he uploaded clips of himself singing and playing guitar to YouTube. He dedicated one number to his parents for their 25th wedding anniversary, and he even took song requests on Twitter. Did I see him cringe at the mention of that? \u201cMight\u2019ve done,\u201d he says bashfully. At boarding school in Peterborough, he had a band that played covers at the disco. What were they called? He cringes again. \u201cFlashpoint.\u201d Singing, though, is Blagden\u2019s thing. In fact, he always meant to end up in a West End extravaganza. \u201cEveryone at drama school called me Musical Boy. If I\u2019m totally frank, it seemed like a more achievable career than the one I have now.\u201d In a day or two, he\u2019s off to Paris to continue filming the second series of Versailles. More luxury. Someone else can fetch his tea for a while. \u2022 Versailles begins at 9.30pm on 1 June on BBC2.",
