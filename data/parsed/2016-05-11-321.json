Yes, fine, nobody remembers what they were guffawing at half an hour ago, let alone last week, but that doesn\u2019t mean web humour is above (or below) a session under the microscope. Somewhere between the meme as christened by Richard Dawkins (that is, a component of culture that is disseminated through human interaction) and the term as it now exists in the popular imagination (a graphic with text superimposed to side-splitting effect), lies the internet meme as this column understands it: a phrase or image or idea that spreads rapidly through the virtual consciousness. The meme is a pop culture medium in itself nowadays, and one that is only gathering steam: when music and cinema have long been consigned to history, they\u2019ll be all that\u2019s left; I hope you like videos of cats that have just been to the dentist.     Views my own: personalised Drake album art     Related: Drake: Views review \u2013 more sharp introspection    Megastars have clearly been well briefed on this development. When serial memer Drake released the artwork for fourth album Views, the idea of a little Drake photoshopped on to Toronto\u2019s CN Tower was so meme-friendly (it being a peculiar image with easily substituted component parts) that it quickly spawned spoofs, as well as a website that could generate personalised versions.  But this month\u2019s queen of meme is Beyonc\u00e9. By addressing a cheating spouse on Lemonade she not only managed to generate more than 17,000 thinkpieces (give or take), but by telling him to call \u201cBecky with the good hair\u201d she planted a prospective meme that social media duly ushered into internet parlance. As a simple yet highly distinctive phrase with the potential to co-opt other cultural reference points, it got social media going, drawing comedy connections with everyone from Aunt Becky from 90s sitcom Full House to a 2012 meme that had recast Taylor Swift as a deceased marijuana snorter named Becky. Increasingly, it seems, a musician\u2019s influence can be measured in the memes they generate: as Beyonc\u00e9 pointed out on Formation: \u201cYou know you that bitch when you cause all this conversation.\u201d            Trailer for Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade album    The internet has long been a nostalgia factory \u2013 just ask the Buzzfeed article 39 Signs You Grew Up In The 90s. But with the childhood memories of millennials having now been fed comprehensively into the machine \u2013 just ask the Buzzfeed article 11 Charts Only Canadians Who Grew Up In The 90s Would Appreciate \u2013 the web seems to be moving on to the next stage of communal past-crunching. Namely the 00s. Last month, Rowan Martin of London band the Rhythm Method started the trending topic #indieamnesty with the tweet \u201cOnce wrote an excruciatingly twee lyric along the lines of \u2018Now you\u2019re crying in your Ready Brek\u2019. What\u2019s your #indieamnesty?\u201d Being the dominant subculture of the 00s in the UK (and this was specifically referring to the mid-00s music scene, we regret to inform John Prescott and the time he met Blur), there were a lot of memories to share.      Rowan Martin\u2019s original #IndieAmnesty tweet    This wasn\u2019t just simple reminiscence: in actual fact, the hashtag soon became the perfect opportunity for a good old-fashioned humblebrag (circa 2010; the act of showing off on social media under the pretence of self-deprecation). The humble bit came courtesy of indie\u2019s soiled name. If you were a teenager in the early 00s, the indie music scene seemed hugely exciting, if not positively glamorous. Over the last decade, though, thanks to the bastardisation of its values via dadification (Kaiser Chiefs), ladification (the Courteeners) and indie landfill, the scene and its accoutrements have mutated into something putrid and grotesquely uncool. Admitting you once had made an emotional investment in indie allowed Twitter users a boast (according to the laws of the humblebrag): either about how well connected they had been \u2013 depending on how celeb-studded their confessions were \u2013 or to trade on the apparently still-functional social currency of the trend.     Sweetness and light: Ed Balls\u2019 response to online humiliation     Related: On this fourth #EdBallsDay, has the hype become too much?    Finally, how does a throwaway internet joke metamorphose into a linchpin of society as we know it? On 28 April, former MP Ed Balls celebrated the five-year anniversary of the time he accidentally tweeted the words \u201cEd Balls\u201d (when intending to search for mentions of his name) by baking a commemorative cake. Now known as Ed Balls Day, thanks to the sheer, myopic persistence of internet callbacks, could the date become a new national holiday? It could serve as a reminder of those heady days when the Labour party lurched from omnishambles to omnishambles. Or perhaps that\u2019s not strictly necessary. In any case, it was nice to see that instead of just being a joke, our politicians could actually make a decent one, too.",
