The highly anticipated keynote address from SAP CEO Bill McDermott was astonishingly personal in both delivery style and message. After a meeting with the top 30 CIO\u2019s from SAP\u2019s global customer base, McDermott tossed out his carefully prepared speech and decided on a new message of customer empathy.  According to McDermott, everything has to start with empathy for the end user. SAP\u2019s company culture already puts customer success at the center of everything. Bill McDermott\u2019s message was clear that the bar will be set even higher to consistently and diligently listen to the customers on their terms. In case the audience wasn\u2019t convinced, he proceeded to share his personal email, stating that concerns or unheeded requests should be forwarded to him. McDermott also shared his excitement for SAP\u2019s joint announcement with Microsoft, to simplify work through new integrations between Microsoft Office 365 and cloud solutions from SAP. The audience got a rare treat when Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella joined McDermott on stage and the two technology giants shared their views on the cloud, business agility and innovation and new ways to work.
