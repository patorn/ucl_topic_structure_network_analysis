I need not look too far for the cause of this nocturnal flashback \u2013 it was sparked by some comments made by the original villain of the piece, the BBC golf commentator Peter Alliss. Reacting to Muirfield golf club\u2019s decision to continue to exclude women members this week, Alliss recalled meeting some members\u2019 wives when he was there for the Open a few years ago. He had been in the area in which womenfolk are kept \u2013 let\u2019s call it the Saudi Snug \u2013 where these Real Housewives of Muirfield had explained to him they didn\u2019t want to be members because then \u201cour husbands would have to pay thousands of pounds for our entry fee and our subscriptions\u201d. These helpmeets, he implied, could never be of \u201clike spirit\u201d with the male members. \u201cIf someone wants to join,\u201d concluded the logical genius of the 19th\u00a0hole, \u201cwell, you\u2019d better get married\u00a0to somebody who\u2019s a member.\u201d Or maybe just sit outside the gates holding a cardboard sign reading: \u201cWill fuck for foursomes\u201d?    What do you say about this unprecedented, spellbinding, adorable act of total and utter lunacy?    A legendary commentator \u2013 though sadly not a mythical one \u2013 the 85-year-old Alliss was always going to react to the push for equality much as an incontinent old dog might react to a rug.\u00a0Alliss just knows what women want. Indeed, only last year he explained that Johnson\u2019s wife would\u00a0have been watching him putt for the Open thinking: \u201cIf this goes in, I get a new kitchen.\u201d Each man kills the thing he loves, and Alliss\u2019s tireless efforts to reinforce the worst of golf have done much to legitimise the sort of attitudes that Muirfield has now lost its place on the Open rota to defend. It\u2019s not just women, of course \u2013 other beneficiaries of his grimly avuncular tone have included the Japanese golfer Shigeki Maruyama (\u201cthe wily Oriental\u201d) and Tiger Woods (\u201cnot a handsome Adonis all in white\u201d). But it is to Alliss\u2019s part in the closing holes of the 1999 Open at Carnoustie that anyone seeking to understand him and all his mid-Cretaceous Muirfield chums must always return. There is no vignette that more perfectly encapsulates the historic tension between the majesty and madness of the great game of golf, and the men too repressed and desiccated to share it. We lay our scene at the 18th. The hero of the hour \u2013 the hero of all hours for anyone who has ever played golf and experienced its unique ability to fry the brain \u2013 was the Frenchman Jean van de Velde. Having been the clear leader, a series of cavalier decisions and\u00a0calamities saw Van de Velde eventually chunk a shot out of the deep rough and into a water hazard. After much contemplation, he removed his shoes and socks. He then began to roll up his trousers \u2013 oh my God, what was he DOING? \u2013 before stepping down into the\u00a0shin-high waters of Barry Burn. What do you say about this unprecedented, spellbinding, adorable act of total and utter lunacy? If you are Peter Alliss, then you know\u00a0exactly the right tone to adopt. It\u00a0is that of a peevish man unexpectedly required to put in some overtime. By rights, Alliss informed viewers during the play-off Van de Velde eventually forced, he himself should be \u201csitting at home enjoying a glass of malt by now, and waiting for the old lady to bring in a\u00a0nice steak\u201d.   Related: I love golf, Muirfield, but I don\u2019t want to join your snotty club | Alice Arnold    Can you conceive of a more arid, joyless take on one of the most memorable sporting meltdowns ever to grace our screens? I\u2019ve argued before that the smallness of Alliss threw the huge \u2013 if hugely misguided \u2013 actions of Van de Velde into even sharper relief, and certainly his excruciatingly parochial commentary is interwoven into my memory of the occasion. \u201cThis is so, so, so, so sad,\u201d Alliss claimed, with all the empathy of a one-iron, \u201cand so unnecessary. No, would somebody please go and stop him \u2026 no, this really is beyond a joke now.\u201d In that instant I felt I had never wanted anyone to do anything as much I wanted Van de Velde\u00a0to pull off a miracle. Particularly when Alliss served the chaser: \u201cIf this goes in, I\u2019m going to pack it in. I\u2019m going\u00a0to retire.\u201d COME ON JEAN. DO IT FOR ALL OF US. He didn\u2019t, of course, finally deciding to take a drop, and going on to lose the play-off to Paul Lawrie. The fate of Alliss\u2019s steak remains unclear. That was then. Yet 17 years later there are such powerful echoes of Alliss\u2019s sensibility \u2013 if we can even call it that \u2013 in the Muirfield no lobby. A leaked letter from the group of members marshalling opposition to women even mirrors the childish preoccupation with what they\u2019re going to get to eat and when, featuring not one but two fretful mentions of \u201cour lunch arrangements\u201d. If these are such a big deal, what fantastically small lives they must lead. That they couldn\u2019t lay a string-backed glove on Van de Velde hardly needs stating, but it is a mark of Jean\u2019s immense stature that he was able to understand in the immediate aftermath of those extraordinary moments what the Lexus-driving bores of Muirfield never will. \u201cYou have to remember,\u201d he told the cameras, \u201cit\u2019s a game. It\u2019s a game. It\u2019s not like life and death.\u201d After all that, the sheer brass perspective of it! Yet Van de Velde is just one amazing Open moment among many past glories and many future ones, which will now take place somewhere other than Muirfield. I think of Tiger Woods breaking down in tears for his recently dead father in\u00a02006. I think of my beloved, tragically flawed John Daly winning in 1995, despite Costantino Rocca having forced a play-off with one of the greatest putts ever. I think of Tom Watson falling at the last hole at Turnberry at the age of 59. And Seve, always Seve, clinching his\u00a0second Open at St Andrews with a birdie putt. \u201cThis was the happiest moment of my whole sporting life,\u201d Ballesteros recalled in his autobiography. \u201cMy moment of glory, my most fantastic shot. I had my deepest emotional experience in my golfing life when I played in the 1984 Open at the cradle of golf.\u201d Ah well. From such heroics, such humanity, such hubris and such humour, the men-only members of Muirfield will now be insulated. No grand passions for them. But then, perhaps that\u2019s the way they feel safest. After all, they do not truly love golf. They love clubs.",
