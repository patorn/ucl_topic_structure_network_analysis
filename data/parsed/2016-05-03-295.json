  "body": "The 18th-century printer and type designer John Baskerville (he of the \u201cBaskerville font\u201d) was so averse to religion and its conventions that he requested that, upon his death, his body be buried upright in a specially prepared vault in an old mill on his property. In 1775, his wishes were fulfilled. In 1821, however, a canal was built locally and the mill was destroyed. The landowner at the time put Baskerville\u2019s body on display until his descendants had it moved to a crypt in Christ Church, Birmingham. In 1897, the church was demolished and poor Baskerville\u2019s remains were moved again, this time to the catacombs of Warstone Lane Cemetery. In 1963, a petition was put forward to the Birmingham city council that what little remained of John Baskerville be moved a fifth time to unconsecrated grounds, in keeping with his original wishes. The petition was denied.   Related: Why wait for a funeral? I\u2019d like one hell of a party while I\u2019m still around | Jackie Ashley    Baskerville wasn\u2019t the only person in the 18th century (or indeed any century) to flout traditional death practices. Since time immemorial, people have sought alternative solutions to disposing of human remains. The news stories we see today \u2013 like the man whose ashes were turned into fishing bait and used by his friends to catch a 180lb fish \u2013 are nothing new. Dr John Troyer, who heads the Centre for Death & Society at the University of Bath, is currently spearheading the Future Cemetery project in conjunction with Arnos Vale cemetery in Bristol. \u201cThe idea was to deliver a large-scale project that experimented with new approaches like projection, augmented reality, and Bluetooth soundscapes to engage visitors with this stunning but sensitive space.\u201d In other words, you may someday be able to walk into a cemetery and listen to a hologram of a dead loved one speak about his or her life.     Ma\u2019nene festival of corpses, Indonesia. Photograph: Paul Koudounaris    Although some people might be averse to these developments, we should remember that new technologies and death have often gone hand-in-hand in the past. For instance, postmortem photos began to emerge shortly after commercial photography itself became available in 1839, and carried on being popular into the early 20th century. Today, we might liken this to the trend among millennials to take \u201cfuneral selfies\u201d. The desire for alternative death practices is growing, especially among an ageing population of baby boomers who have been accustomed to having a wide range of choice in their lives. Caitlin Doughty \u2013 mortician, writer and founder of the Order of the Good Death \u2013 educates the public about their options through her popular YouTube series, Ask a Mortician. She recently opened a new funeral parlour, Undertaking LA, which \u201callows families to reclaim rightful control of the dying process and care of the dead body\u201d. The bereaved can wash and dress the bodies of their loved ones in preparation for burial. This process brings a mourner closer to death, and breaks down unwarranted fears of the dead body. \u201cIt\u2019s what everyone did 150 years ago,\u201d Doughty says, \u201cand it can be a beautiful way to mourn.\u201d Although this type of intimacy with a corpse might seem alien to us in the west, there are many cultures around the world that have no problem interacting with the dead. Dr Paul Koudounaris \u2013 author of The Empire of Death \u2013 has travelled to more than 70 different countries and encountered countless cultures and belief systems along the way. His book features hundreds of photographs of the dead.

Sometimes they even walk them around the village.\u201d This past year, Koudounaris attended Ma\u2019nene. After the festival was over, some villagers asked Koudounaris as an afterthought if he wanted to see their grandmother, whose dead body had been laid out in the hut next to his for the past month. \u201cIt was the casualness of it that was really striking,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the USA, that would not be a casual situation that would slip one\u2019s mind.\u201d Koudounaris rightly reminds me that we need to be careful about \u201ctreating \u2018western culture\u2019 as some homogeneous thing,\u201d and that death rituals in westernised society can vary greatly. That said, the more intimate practices tend to come from non-western areas of the world. What Koudounaris hopes we learn from these cultures is that \u201cthe dead can still have a role in society, and that death need not be fatalistic\u201d. Like Doughty, he hopes we can reclaim something from the past that we\u2019ve lost: \u201cThe irony is that we once understood this in western society, we were much the same way. We forgot it over the past 200 years, and now we\u2019re seeing a nascent movement to relearn that exact lesson.\u201d     Ma\u2019nene festival of corpses, Indonesia.

He reminds us that: \u201cWhat\u2019s weird today is almost always normalised, forgotten about over time, rediscovered, turned into an \u2018alternative\u2019 that seems weird and then becomes normal again.\u201d Cremation was once considered a radical alternative to burial in Britain. The first woman cremated in this country was Honoretta Pratt in 1769. Today, approximately 75% of Britons are cremated. What will the next big thing in death be for us as we head towards the 22nd century?",
