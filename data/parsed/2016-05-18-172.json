Aged between 18 and 23, they form the junior wing of Nederlands Dans Theater; and while they can boast all the unflagging speed and accuracy of their seniors, they have an engaging openness to them still, a porousness, as if their personalities haven\u2019t yet hardened into performing egos.  So versatile and so hungry are these young artists, however, that it\u2019s frustrating to see them confined to a repertory that showcase only a limited range of their skills. The aesthetic of Ji\u0159\u00ed Kyli\u00e1n, the company\u2019s founder, is still a dominant influence and while his successors, Paul Lightfoot and Sol Leon, are seeking to expand the repertory, much of the work in this UK programme is very reminiscent of Kyli\u00e1n\u2019s style, with its reliance on visual gags and its tendency to chop the choreography into short emphatic gestures and attention-seeking body shapes.     Madoka Kariya and Paxton Ricketts in Some Other Time. Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian     Three shortish works by Leon and Lightfoot occupy the opening section, of which the best by far is Schubert, a duet for the excellent Katarina van den Wouwer and Alexander Anderson. Here the choppiness of the phrasing works beautifully to convey a relationship of hesitant, complex impulses; you can almost hear the couple\u2019s spoken dialogue, as Anderson dances with his head tenderly resting on Van den Wouwer\u2019s shoulder, as she retreats from him in an inward, almost huffy contraction of her torso. Some Other Time has a certain wan and wistful beauty, as its four men and women slip between lightness and dark. But in the overlong Sad Case, the five dancers who waddle and squat and flap their hands to Mexican mambo music are forced to strain too hard for their jokes.  Far more consistently satisfying are the works that share the middle section. In Mutual Comfort, Edward Clug explores a world of wariness, of hard-won emotional sympathy, which feels subtly pertinent to our era of mass global migration. He builds a vocabulary of partnerwork that is rich in expressive invention: light, brittle touch, exploratory lifts and balances, caresses that spread consolation like butter.

Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian     By contrast, Hans van Manen\u2019s solo is a mockingly virtuoso party piece that sends three male dancers spinning at reckless speeds through Bach\u2019s Violin Partita No 1. As always with Van Manen, the work\u2019s brilliance lies in its musicality, the split-second wit on which the stresses fall, the subtle acceleration and diminishing of attack. Solo is the one piece where the dancers get to play with phrasing in this way, and it\u2019s a joy to see the intelligent performance of Helias Tur-Dorvault.  The programme closes with Alexander Ekman\u2019s perennially popular Cacti. On one level, the work is all gimmick, with its ironically postmodern voiceover, its 16 dancers banging and shouting their own musical accompaniment, its flagrantly pointless cacti. Yet it has a flying energy that\u2019s hard to resist, and an impeccable sense of timing which nails the jokes, every time around.  At Sadler\u2019s Wells, London, until 20 May.
