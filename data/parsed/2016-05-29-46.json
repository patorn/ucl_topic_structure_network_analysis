Yet among those gathering on Sunday at the home of London\u2019s Gaelic Athletic Association scene, remain campaigners were hard at work, seeking to tap into what they see as a potentially key \u201cbloc\u201d of support in the form of about half a million Ireland-born voters in Britain, not to mention many more of Irish heritage. A key target is the wave of young Irish professionals who have come to Britain in recent years, a demographic well represented among green-shirted volunteers of the Irish4Europe campaign on the streets outside the GAA pitch in the suburb of Ruislip.   Related: Irish leader says border controls may return if Brexit vote prevails    \u201cFor me it\u2019s about Northern Ireland and the threat of border controls,\u201d said Dearbhaile Flynn, a 27-year-old Phd student who had given up her bank holiday Sunday to join others handing out leaflets warning about the potential impact of a UK exit on everything from from the peace process to freedom of movement. Nearby, the potential effect of Brexit on his business interests in mainland Europe was cited by Frank Salmon, an IT founder and resident of London for 32 years, as he waited with his two children: Izzy, supporting her father\u2019s native Mayo, and Harry, who had plumped for their opponents London. \u201cContinuing to be able to access the European market freely is a priority for me,\u201d Salmon said. \u201cWe also shouldn\u2019t forget the EU has preserved peace in Europe for the past 75 years.\u201d The presence at the game of Ireland\u2019s taoiseach, Enda Kenny, comes as the Irish government prepares, in the words of one remain campaigner, to \u201cthrow the diplomatic kitchen sink at Brexit\u201d. The extent to which Irish voters are likely to behave as a bloc is unclear. No published polling of them exists, while ambivalence was also not uncommon on the sidelines on Sunday.  At least one man welcomed Britain leaving the EU if it meant less competition from eastern European builders. In regions outside of London, too, concerns about immigration have been told anecdotally in reports about the view of an older, more working-class generation of Irish voters. Prof Mary Hickman, an expert on the history of the Irish diaspora, told the Guardian that on the whole, however, second generation Irish voters in northern cities such as Liverpool were still more likely to be Labour voters. Nevertheless, the Irish community in Britain was now much more disparate, she added, and the younger, more highly educated arrivals who had personal stake in free movement would be more receptive to appeals by the Irish government. \u201cPeople who have been here longer and are of a second generation are going to be as much, if not considerably more, influenced by what the vote means for Britain rather than just what it means for Ireland,\u201d Hickman said. Also at the game was Elaine Regain, the daughter of Irish immigrants from County Mayo, who said that while the demographic face of the Irish in Britain had changed dramatically, common bonds existed in the form of the Gaelic Athletic Association. She is planning to vote remain and suggested that her family would do the same, although she bemoaned what she described as a lack of objective information ahead of polling day.",
