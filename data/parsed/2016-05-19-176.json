  "body": "They are called dabs, those short, snappy and highly shareable videos that dominate your Facebook or Twitter feed. News organisations such as NowThisNews and AJ+ (Al Jazeera) are leading the way in this micro-video style, based on the idea of a little bit of news, every now and then.    Related: 10 tricks to appear intelligent during development meetings    How they work The videos are short and reduce a story to its bare bones, but \u201cthat doesn\u2019t mean they are any less sophisticated,\u201d says Michael Tait, multimedia commissioning editor at the Guardian. A great deal of thought goes into the script, length, amount of words and which images or footage is used. \u201cIn fact, it\u2019s really difficult to take a journalistic story and reduce it to 20 lines of texts, and then make all the images graphic enough to be engaging,\u201d he says. More and more people watch videos on their mobile phones (Facebook has actually changed its algorithm to prioritise live video) so the videos must be made for mobile rather than, say, created for desktop and pushed through social media channels. Critically, videos must be shareable. \u201cIf people don\u2019t share the video, it won\u2019t get the reach,\u201d says Fred McConnell, deputy video editor for Guardian Australia. \u201cWe have 5m followers on Facebook, but have views of more than 18m on some videos.\u201d Think beyond your own followers and make the video as accessible to as many people as possible. But don\u2019t make it with the thought that people should share it because that never works, he says. Ask yourself instead, \u201cWould I share it?\u201d How to make your own Hire millennials     Greenpeace\u2019s video gives us George Osborne and nuclear power stations.   The hardest part is finding the right people to do the job. They need to be digital natives, millennials, and they need to understand the language. \u201cWe\u2019re hiring people who aren\u2019t just great filmmakers or who can produce really artistic stuff, it\u2019s about having a strong understanding of why people share stuff on social media and how they interact with content,\u201d says Richard Casson, online campaigner at Greenpeace. As well as being social media savvy, you need someone who can use Premier, Final Cut Pro, Photoshop and, ideally, AfterEffects to create motion graphics. They should also have some journalism experience. \u201cWe\u2019re not close to these stories so we can make decisions that improve the storytelling, but if someone is really invested in the issue, they\u2019re not going to have that distance or that objectivity,\u201d says McConnell.  Invest in assets You don\u2019t need a huge team to make micro-videos, but you do need access to images, footage and music. \u201cWe try to use open source music and we always credit the person whose songs we\u2019re using at the end of the video, with a link to wherever we found it,\u201d says Casson. \u201cWe also try to use open source footage or pay a fee to use someone else\u2019s. If it\u2019s a small organisation, they\u2019re often happy for us to just credit them.\u201d Another option is to buy subscriptions to production libraries or photography agencies for instant access to images and video. \u201cA licence is quite expensive in the short-term but would pay off over time, both in terms of finance and the speed at which you can produce these videos,\u201d says McConnell. But these days, says Tait, even an iPhone will do and there are apps \u2013 such as Verify \u2013 that ensure coverage from news hotspots around the world. If you have that, and the means to steady your iPhone, you can record all sorts of things to include in videos. Grab people\u2019s attention \u201cWe call them thumbstoppers,\u201d says Tait. \u201cBecause you\u2019re scrolling through your news feed on your phone and whatever holding image and headline you choose has to be dynamic and powerful enough to stop someone scrolling.\u201d McConnell says you have around a second to get people\u2019s attention, so don\u2019t have an introduction, a build-up, or fade in from a black screen. You should also create a separate eye-catching holding image for the video that gives a good overview of what it\u2019s about. Putting a famous face at the front of the video also helps, says Casson. \u201cWhen we bring people like George Osbourne or David Cameron to the forefront of the video we tend to get a higher reaction.\u201d  Be concise If you want the video to be watched on social media, keep it short. \u201cIt has to be as tight as you can get it without compromising on the content,\u201d says Tait. Micro-videos shouldn\u2019t be longer than two minutes. \u201cFocusing on an individual is really effective when you only have a minute,\u201d says McConnell.

Avoid talking points, but if someone is speaking, add subtitles that can be read on a small screen. And think carefully about any text used in the video.  \u201cStrike a balance between having enough time to read the text and having it move in a way that keeps you interested,\u201d says McConnell. \u201cYour eye shouldn\u2019t have to travel from one corner of the screen to the other, either.\u201d Also make sure that any words are positioned above the play bar so it doesn\u2019t obstruct the text.     A Guardian video made in Damascus.    Tell real (and positive) stories \u201cCharity videos often feel fake,\u201d says McConnell. \u201cWe know that person\u2019s probably not called Jean, for example \u2013 it\u2019s just an anonymous child you happen to have footage of.\u201d Videos can be serious, but doom and gloom is not appealing and won\u2019t make people stop scrolling. Use real people, focus on the issue and deliver character and narrative. Tell a positive story about an inspirational person. \u201cWe had really interesting footage of a 26-year-old girl who refuses to leave Damascus and is still teaching ballet at a school without heating or anything like that,\u201d says Guardian video producer Ekaterina Ochagavia. \u201cShe spoke so passionately about the kids, dancing and how she couldn\u2019t leave her home, but it was also interesting about the crisis there. You could show a story like that and, at the end, have a call to action for donations to help her.\u201d Include a call to action  We try to make it as explicit as possible that there is some sort of call to action,\u201d says Casson. \u201cWe might put words at the end, such as \u2018Share to expose this story\u2019 or \u2018Share to celebrate\u2019 if we have some good news. Within the video itself, we always try to have a mini theory of change so that it\u2019s not just reporting on a problem, but actually a way for people to participate in the campaign by interacting with the video afterwards.\u201d And ideally, posts should have a link accompanying the video where people can read more.   Related: Aid fundraising videos: the best and worst of 2015    Don\u2019t make it all about the campaign A good approach is to have a desire to create good content that will increase your NGO\u2019s social media reach. If Facebook recognises, through its algorithm, that your page produces good videos, it will continue to place them into people\u2019s news feeds. \u201cA successful piece of content will bring more people to our page,\u201d says Casson. \u201cMore likes means more reach and more ways for people to support us.\u201d Join our community of development professionals and humanitarians.
