  "body": "At first glance, Bhramarpura\u2019s dusty, sun-seared streets look like many others in southern Nepal. But there is a conspicuous difference. Nearly everyone making the wheels of this small town turn \u2013 selling groceries, carrying grain or pumping water \u2013 is female. There is hardly a young man in sight. Years of migration, fuelled by hope of providing a better life for their families, have drained Bhramarpura of working-age fathers, brothers and sons. Practically every household has at least one male family member working overseas, leaving boys and elderly men as the few remaining males in a town run by women.   Related: 'I don\u2019t feel safe but life must go on': one year on from the Nepal earthquake    In a male-dominated country where women are largely confined to household chores, or certain tasks in the fields, Bhramarpura is a notable exception, with women assuming duties usually reserved for men. They are the backbone of the community, and its public representatives. The outflow of men and the influx of remittances have given Bhramarpura a local reputation for wealth, relatively speaking. But while poverty here may be less severe than in neighbouring villages, privilege comes at a cost. Taradevi Sah, 36, has seen her husband only twice in six years since he left for Kuwait. \u201cIt\u2019s painful,\u201d she says, sitting on a rug on a porch among a dozen other women, and an equal number of children. \u201cBut it\u2019s less painful than poverty. Him sending money takes some of the pain away.\u201d The women of Bhramarpura are used to paying for that money with loneliness.     Madhu Thakur, a health worker in Bhramarpura.    \u201cIt is a cause of sorrow that newly wedded husbands have to leave their wives,\u201d says Madhu Thakur, a community health worker. \u201cThere are problems. But problems would be bigger if there were no money here.\u201d Nepal is among the latest countries in south Asia to be transformed by mass migration of low-skilled workers, mainly to countries in the Gulf. The country\u2019s south is leading the trend. Mahottari district, in which Bhramarpura lies, is the second-largest source of migrants, according to the government. An estimated 1,500 Nepalese leave the country daily, not counting those who go to India, who are not registered because a long-standing bilateral agreement between the governments of India and Nepal means they do not need work permits. The remittances they send home make up almost one-third of Nepal\u2019s gross domestic product. Since 2006, about 2.6 million Nepalese have gone abroad to work \u2013 one in 10 of the entire population. In Bhramarpura, nearly one in four people migrate. Out of 13,000 inhabitants, about 3,000 are working abroad, according to the town secretary, Ram Paradath Thakur. The visible gender bias has fed another reputation, one locals say is unfair: that Bhramarpura is promiscuous. The rumour has been reinforced by the plethora of children in the town, despite most husbands living overseas. Binod Kumar Sah, a health worker who moved here recently, relayed an acerbic saying among neighbouring villages that: \u201cIn Bhramarpura, a child is conceived over the phone.\u201d Bijay Shah, 25, worked in Saudi Arabia for five years before marrying. He continued to work abroad but decided to return home five years later because he worried his wife might have an affair, he says. There is some male presence in Bhramarpura. Groups of young men lounge in the shade around the main square, but almost all were on leave from Qatar, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries, where they work in construction or the services industry.   Related: Acts of kindness that helped the people of Nepal survive the earthquake \u2013 in pictures    Nepalese migrants are often exploited by overseas employers, as well as recruitment agencies in Nepal, which deceive them about wages and conditions. Still, in a country where unemployment is unemployment as high as 46%, remittances help families pay for healthcare and education, and invest in land. But new money often feeds new lifestyles, says Madhu Thakur. Many of the migrants, she says, return with alcohol or drug addictions, while at home, older boys who refuse to obey their mothers sometimes spend their fathers\u2019 wages on alcohol or pills.  Large-scale migration not only profoundly changes the social fabric of communities, it can also undermine long-term development. \u201c[Migration] has deepened the consumption-driven economy in Nepal, where goods are not produced but consumed, and where jobs are not created,\u201d says Jeevan Sharma, a Nepalese migration expert at the University of Edinburgh. \u201cAgriculture has suffered, as there is less labour available, and there has been a tendency to leave the land barren,\u201d he says. Like their husbands abroad, women left behind are vulnerable to exploitation, too. Sunaina Devi, an elderly woman with a granddaughter on her lap, recalls how a man from a different village had tried to \u201cdishonour\u201d her before a male neighbour had intervened. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do. If my husband had been here, he would have known what to do,\u201d she says. She and other women in Bhramarpura accuse corrupt officials of taking advantage of them, and banks of demanding bribes before releasing remittances from their husbands. \u201cWe can\u2019t protest like men can,\u201d Devi says.     These couples both decided that a life together is worth more than a migrant\u2019s income. Madhu Thakur and Bhadesh are the couple in the centre.    \u201cI was very aware [of the corruption]. It made me angry,\u201d says Madhu Thakur\u2019s husband, Bhadesh. In Saudi Arabia, he says, he earned only 600 riyals (\u00a3110) a month, working 12 hours a day, six days a week. \u201cBut how can we oppose? I worked, my whole family ate.\u201d Now, he and Madhu are among the few couples who have concluded that a life together is worth more than a migrant\u2019s income. After three years in Saudi Arabia and Qatar, Bhadesh decided his salary \u2013 part of which he spent on sending his 11-year-old son and eight-year-old daughter to school \u2013 was not enough incentive to be separated from them. \u201cI make less money now, but at least I\u2019m with my family,\u201d Bhadesh says, serving energy drinks from a fridge in the small convenience store he bought when he returned last year. \u201cWe have decided to celebrate with what we earn,\u201d Madhu says. \u201cI would have done anything to stop him from going again.\u201d  Additional reporting by Arpan Shrestha",
