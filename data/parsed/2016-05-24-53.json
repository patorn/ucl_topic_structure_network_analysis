The song, one of the fastest charting of his career, is also the name of his summer tour that takes the country music star to North American arenas and amphitheaters through September. Bentley, 40, is a country star who has survived changing trends by being unpredictable. While signature hits such as the playful Drunk on a Plane brandish big pop hooks, his songwriting also has a deeply introspective side. He straddles both sides of the industry\u2019s spectrum and is rooted in traditional country but his music is also unmistakably contemporary. This latest record, Black, which will be released on Friday, is a concept album that tracks a young relationship through its peaks and valleys.  You\u2019ve had an incredible run \u2013 eight records since 2003. Is that unusual for a career in country music these days? Yeah, I think it is a little unusual. Because I came out with a lot of hits and toured relentlessly and, aside from touring with [Kenny] Chesney and George Strait, I passed through the bars and the clubs and took it about as far as it can go. Musically, I found myself trying to write songs and make records that reflected who I was at the time, but I was always thinking about touring and how to get to the next level. That certainly was not a winning formula. That\u2019s why I kept hitting my head against the ceiling trying to headline. But it wasn\u2019t really happening.  Then I did that bluegrass record [Up on the Ridge, in 2010] and it got me back to where I wanted to be musically. From that point forward, I have only made albums for albums\u2019 sake and have not worried at how they translate on the road. This is my eighth record \u2013 I don\u2019t know how many more I\u2019ll be able to make. I want to go out and make the best records I can.     Onstage in Dublin. Photograph: PR    That\u2019s the opposite of what people say in the business these days: ie, focus more on touring and not the studio, because that\u2019s where the money is. My first record was all about the musicians. The next record, Modern Day Drifter, reflected who I was on the road. The transformation that happens when a young artist goes on the road: you put the acoustic guitar down and start to play the electric a little louder \u2013 it gets a little bit ragged. Before, I was carrying the torch for being single. I had songs called Lot of Leavin\u2019 Left to Do and Modern Day Drifter. Now I feel more comfortable in my skin than I ever have. My dad passed away. My son Knox was born. I went into Black with a total blank slate to ask: \u201cWhere am I right now?\u201d It\u2019s way more interesting being married for 10 years and having kids. And so I wrote that song Black about love at this level \u2013 real love, you\u2019re committed, you\u2019re in for it, it\u2019s constantly changing, moving and how does it work? Many of the songs on the new record have much more depth. Did you want to show you had a serious side? I see myself as a serious artist, but yeah, when people come to my shows, they want to hear What Was I Thinkin\u2019, Drunk on a Plane and lots of up-tempo, fun songs. But my records have always had serious stuff on [them], some really lonesome stuff. But people probably think of me more for the fun stuff. It\u2019s bizarre. Even Drunk on a Plane \u2013 I almost didn\u2019t put it on the record, but thank God I did: it\u2019s the most fun song I play every night. For Black, I had this concept album in mind about two years ago about an affair. But I shelved it. I was watching the [Showtime] show The Affair, which is about leaving one relationship for another. And when I went to sequence this record, the story fell into place for me.   Related: Merle Haggard: the maverick musician and his \u2018defiantly contrarian journey\u2019    The death of Merle Haggard has brought attention to the complaint that country radio is no longer interested in songwriting with more depth.  It\u2019s a worthy debate. And certainly with Chris Stapleton and the awareness he brought to country music outside of country radio. I\u2019d say the same thing with Haggard. The radio is not show fun, it\u2019s show business. It\u2019s money. The reason Merle Haggard is not played on the radio is because Merle Haggard is not bringing in Coca-Cola dollars. It\u2019s not something to bemoan. I\u2019m driving in my van now and I have Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band on the stereo. They\u2019re not playing the Beatles on the radio but I can go put them on my record player. There is so much great music coming out of Nashville. If you want to find it, you have to be a little bit more aggressive. You have to go look for it a little bit. When Merle Haggard was doing his thing, I\u2019m sure there were people getting kicked off the radio because of the new hot sound coming out of Bakersfield. I think it\u2019s always evolving.      Bentley and the London crowd on his UK tour. Photograph: PR    What makes a contemporary country album \u2018country\u2019? There should be a whole book written about that one word: country. What does that mean, country? It\u2019s such a huge umbrella. I would hope that what makes it country is that it all starts with a song. The story being told in three and a half minutes that is not being told on another station. Whether it\u2019s a heartbreak song or a hook-up song or a party song, it\u2019s got some movement through the verses in telling a story. You started out at the Station Inn in Nashville, which is ground zero for bluegrass pickers in that city. What did you take away from that time? If not for the Station Inn, I would never have had a record deal. I would have no career in country music. I moved here in 1994 looking for the source of country music. I wanted to be a star but I didn\u2019t walk into town saying: \u201cHey, look at me.\u201d A lot of people were dressing like Garth [Brooks], but no one was writing their own music. I knew there was a songwriting community, but I didn\u2019t realize that there were some people who, when they put a record out, didn\u2019t write one song on the album. That blew my mind. I remember thinking: \u201cThat\u2019s shit, that\u2019s crap.\u201d It was real life. That\u2019s where I really learned to sing. That\u2019s where I learned the real appreciation of country music \u2013 not just to listen to it, but also to actually hear it. How did your fans respond to your bigger hits, such as Somewhere on a Beach? When I put that out there, my hardcore fans hated it. My wife goes on the websites and told me. I love that because I don\u2019t want to carry the torch for anybody. I\u2019m not trying to carry the torch for official country music. I want to be able to do my own thing. So to put a song out there that is really young with an urban delivery-type vocal \u2013 I can relate to that character because I have been that guy. So the fact that people first hated it, that\u2019s good. I really don\u2019t like to put out something that doesn\u2019t get people feeling something.",
