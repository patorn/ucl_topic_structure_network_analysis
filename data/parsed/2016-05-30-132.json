But in recent weeks, two actors have proven that understudies can not only save the show \u2013 they can steal it too.    Related: Bring on the understudy! Does it matter if the star isn't in the show?    The high-profile West End shows Funny Girl, starring Sheridan Smith, and English National Opera\u2019s Sunset Boulevard, starring Glenn Close, were called upon to replace their leading ladies at the last minute. Both prompted immediate anger and consternation from some ticket-holders who had paid more than \u00a3100 to see their favourite actors on the stage. Yet the next day headlines were filled not with tales of disaster, but accounts of the life-changing performances. Natasha Barnes, who stepped in for Smith, was described as a \u201csensation in her own right\u201d while Ria Jones, who replaced Close, received a seven minute standing ovation. Barnes, 25, is at the beginning of her career while Jones, 49, is a theatre veteran. Jones had in fact faced criticism for her decision to be Close\u2019s standby, where she watched from the wings every night. The majority of her career has been spent playing lead roles, so this was considered by some to be a step backwards.

And of course, deep down I thought \u2018maybe I\u2019ll get on\u2019, but with the show being just five weeks I knew there was a big possibility I would not.\u201d The role of Norma was a poignant one for Jones, having been the first actor to play the character 25 years ago at Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s house, where he did a private run through of the newly written Sunset Boulevard musical. \u201cI knew back then I was way too young to play the role, but I vividly remember saying to Andrew: \u2018You never know, one day I might do the revival.\u2019 And lo and behold, 25 years later, there I was suddenly about to play her.\u201d It was 2pm on the day of the show that Jones was told she would definitely be stepping in for Close, who had developed a chest infection. While she had watched every performance from the wings, quietly singing along and quoting the lines, she had never actually performed the show with the cast or the live orchestra or even done it in full costume.

Particularly because I knew the majority of the audience had come to see Glenn Close rather than solely the show,\u201d said Jones. \u201cWhen it was announced that she wasn\u2019t on, there were boos and people shouting for their money back, so I had to turn my PA down backstage. I knew some people would have preferred Glenn to just walk on and perform it with a chest infection than have me singing the part.\u201d  Jones says that stepping out in front of the audience was one the hardest things she had ever done, but that as soon as she finished the first song of the night, \u201ceveryone went wild\u201d. \u201cIt took me by surprise to be honest, but it was that which gave me confidence to carry on the rest of the show and just concentrate on being Norma Desmond. And by the end of the night, the tables turned and the crowd gave me a full standing ovation. You never think that will happen to you.\u201d Jones ended up doing four shows as Norma before Close returned to finish the run, and she insisted she did not found it difficult to step back into the wings. \u201cThat Saturday night will stay with me for the rest of my life; they just wouldn\u2019t let me off the stage,\u201d she said. It is easy to imagine that the relationship between the lead actor and the understudy is a complex one, with the latter silently wishing for the other to fall prey to illness or injury. Yet Edward Bennett, who stepped in for David Tennant\u2019s much-hyped production of Hamlet at the RSC in 2008, said the myth of backstage rivalry and resentment was just that. Bennett never thought he would be called upon to step into Tennant\u2019s shoes, and so had only gone through his lines once, reluctantly, since rehearsals had finished. But on the final preview, the day before press night, he woke with 15 urgent messages on his phone and the news that Tennant had put his back out.

Photograph: Dan Wooller/Rex/Shutterstock    \u201cYou never expect it, especially for someone like David Tennant who is so fit and works so hard, and there had never been any sign of anything wrong with him,\u201d recalled Bennett. \u201c I remember trying to process it, thinking \u2018OK, this is happening\u2019 and trying to tie my shoelaces but not even be able to do that, I was in such a state of shock.\u201d Before he went on Tennant rang him up, and while Bennett said he was \u201cobviously gutted and disappointed\u201d, he offered reassuring advice and was \u201cvery supportive \u2013 he just told me to relax and wished me all the best\u201d. \u201cAfter that I genuinely don\u2019t remember anything about the first three or four nights that I did it, apart from the beginning and the end and a few flashes in between,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when I realised that I would have to go on for the press night, that was scary, so scary. But everyone stood up at the end and I remember crying \u2013 a lot. Probably out of relief more than anything. It was overwhelming because to play Hamlet at the RSC is a fairytale really.\u201d    It\u2019s genuinely like an out-of-body experience \u2013 that\u2019s the only way to explain it  Paapa Essiedu     He admitted he forgot two lines and that \u201cthe fight scene looked like two actors waving swords around for the first couple of nights \u2013 but apparently that didn\u2019t show.\u201d Bennett was also quite frank about the need, as an understudy, to emulate the actor you are stepping in for. Putting too much of your own originality and mark on the role can throw the rest of the cast off. \u201cYour primary job is to fill a stage with a performance that works seamlessly with the other actors. So I wouldn\u2019t say you are constrained, but there are limitations as to how far you can go with putting your own stamp on the part. \u201cI had David\u2019s performance in mind, and I think I did base quite a lot of my performance on what he was doing; partly because I had to and partly because he was really, really good.\u201d Bennett did four weeks as Hamlet before Tennant returned. \u201cDavid just said \u2018thanks mate\u2019 and I went \u2018no problem\u2019, and that was all we ever mentioned of it to this day\u201d. However, while playing Hamlet at the RSC is what most actors dream of, being Tennant\u2019s understudy also left Bennett \u201cstuck between two stools\u201d, and he didn\u2019t work for four months afterwards. \u201cPersonally I found a significant lull after understudying Hamlet, and I didn\u2019t hear from the RSC for another five years,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I finished it there was an expectation that this was my career sorted and that lots of opportunities would come knocking. And a few did \u2013 I had auditions to play leads in films that I was never going to get, going up for roles that Hugh Jackman and Ewan McGregor got. It was a weird time of being quite high profile but professionally nothing really happened.\u201d Bennett will star in the RSC\u2019s Love\u2019s Labour\u2019s Lost and Love\u2019s Labour\u2019s Won at the end of the year in the West End.     Paapa Essiedu had to step in Sam Troughton to play Edmund in King Lear halfway through the performance. Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer    Paapa Essiedu, who was forced to live the understudy\u2019s nightmare of taking over a role halfway through a performance, also spoke about the difficulty of getting a taste for a role, only to have to hand it back later. Essiedu was in a National Theatre production of King Lear when Sam Troughton, playing Edmund, lost his voice during the show and he had to take over. \u201cI hadn\u2019t had proper rehearsal time, but thank god I\u2019d already learned my lines,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t remember it at all, it\u2019s genuinely like an out-of-body experience \u2013 that\u2019s the only way to explain it. But when I said my last line and died on stage, I took this huge breath because it felt like I hadn\u2019t been able to breathe for an hour.\u201d Essiedu did one more performance as Edmund before Troughton returned to the role. Essiedu admitted going back to being an understudy was not an easy transition. \u201cIt is a bit difficult \u2013 especially as a young actor. It is a big thrill, a big rush to play a role like Edmund, so going back to normality can be a bit deflating. But those were certainly two character-building days.\u201d  Nonetheless, his performance was so successful that Essiedu will now be playing Edmund in the RSC production of King Lear later this year. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to actually rehearsing the role this time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I want to throw everything out the window and start again. He will be unrecognisable, a completely different Edmund, because this time, I get time to make the character my own.\u201d",
