  "body": "I was in my early 20s and home for the winter holidays. Family friends had come round for dinner. I was in the living room with one of them, a father with three grown sons around my age. I had known them all my whole life; their smiles evoked memories of beach picnics and summer ball games.  My mother was in the kitchen. I don\u2019t know where my sisters were. My father was long since dead. \u201cIsn\u2019t Rose looking beautiful?\u201d the father said, standing next to me, addressing his sons. My throat seized up. I couldn\u2019t remember a precedent for this with him. Rushed thoughts \u2013 evaluating my safety levels, appraising the social situation at hand \u2013 flooded my brain.  I only had half a second. As he finished his question, staring straight into his sons\u2019 eyes, he placed a hand on my ass, and held it there. The sons shuffled, mumbling embarrassed acquiescence.  His touch sent sickening and humiliating shock waves through my body. I went into a combination of survival and appeasement mode. My reactions were passive but felt programmed, the result of experience and implicit lessons I had been learning since I was a child.     De-escalation had been my trick, to the detriment of my agency.    I didn\u2019t run or scream. I paused, turned around and left the room. I avoided proximity to the patriarch for the rest of the night. Worse, for the rest of the evening, I kept smiling and stayed polite while making a note to do everything in my power to avoid seeing this man ever again (the list already had a few names on it). I had certainly been through worse over the years, including with a stranger who had assaulted me in an underground tunnel in Rome with a knife.  Years later, I realized the abuse was less in the act I had been subjected to, and more in my learned silence. De-escalation had been my trick, to the detriment of my agency. A blog entry from last fall put this into words for me. It made me realise that women around me had been doing for years: de-escalating situations caused by men, with the burden of minimising incidents being placed squarely on our shoulders.  Occurrences could be as mundane as a street catcall, as infuriating as a sexist comment at work, or as troubling as an unwelcome physical touch. Occurrences also include compliments we have to decipher (just nice, or suggesting an expression of male ownership over our bodies?).  To the initial weight of having to deal with those acts of dominance is the added mental drain of having to evaluate how best to deal with it and not risk a violent backlash. De-escalating is just another form of the \u201cemotional work\u201d women provide with little recognition of its ongoing exertion and toll.  For Hanna Rusin, a 29-year-old fashion industry worker based in New York, gendered micro- and macro-aggressions are a \u201cvast, vast\u201d part of her everyday life. She recalls, off the top of her head, scarring incidents including being stalked by a man who was her neighbor for six years and being followed home by a policeman after he asked to see her ID on the subway. She also remembers unwelcome attention growing up \u2013 comments and physical contact in private settings \u2013 but being taught to dismiss it. \u201cIn a more intimate setting, it\u2019s more subtle. If you say something, you\u2019re a troublemaker,\u201d Rusin says. \u201cIf you would go to your mother, they would just say, \u2018This is how they are, they\u2019re just drunk old men, ignore them.\u2019 Women don\u2019t even notice that it\u2019s happening to them until they hear someone else talk about it. And then they are like, wait, is this what this is?\u201d   Related: Why is travelling alone still considered a risky, frivolous pursuit for women?    Rusin speaks of the mental toll of deciding whether to report incidents. The situation became so bad with her neighbor that she worried making too much of a fuss with authorities could result in him murdering her in revenge. As unrealistic as that may sound (and it may not be as unrealistic as you think), the fear was very real, she says. Ashwini Hardikar, a 31-year-old health center program director, says that after years of come-ons and unwelcome comments, she has come up with her own solution. \u201cIf someone compliments me, tells me I am attractive or whatever, I reply, \u2018OK.\u2019 It works for me.\u201d Hardikar says she does not want to say \u201cthank you\u201d to something she is not sure she feels thankful for, but knows that for her own safety, she must express acknowledgement. \u201cNot saying thank you or not responding to someone telling you you are beautiful can escalate into a really unsafe situation. There are women who have been killed over not responding to men\u2019s advances. It\u2019s not as simple as men are just giving you a compliment \u2026 You\u2019ve got to make that decision in a second. That is the difference between being safe and not safe.\u201d Ashlie Butler, a 30-year-old doula and executive assistant in the academic field, says she is subjected to sexist comments at work, but feels that for her own professional survival she cannot say anything \u2013 certainly not while she hopes to continue being employed. \u201cIn my current position, I am the administrator, so people \u2013 men \u2013 are commenting on my looks in a way that is inappropriate and makes me feel uncomfortable.\u201d  Minimizing the situation and ignoring comments are part of her economic survival. \u201cI struggle a lot. I have seen how when other people do speak up, things don\u2019t change \u2013 they get bullied or penalized.\u201d Nichole Thomas, a 26-year-old attorney, says the sexism she feels in her male-dominated law office is understated but very real. When she was at an office outing recently, she noticed every time a junior male colleague spoke, his point was uplifted and highlighted by other men, including higher-ranking men. Women did not receive the same treatment. The way in which Thomas has decided to deal with what she is sure are expressions of sexism at work? De-escalating by taking it in her stride and not letting it affect her work performance. \u201cI would never say anything at all to anybody. I notice it in that moment and then I forget about it. I try and not think about it every day.\u201d    Safe was a funny word to use. His words made sure I felt anything but.    Butler, the academic executive assistant, says not speaking up is also a decision, but it is less of a peaceful one: \u201cIt\u2019s tough, because I am very vocal, I am very militant, but there are some spaces where you can\u2019t do that.\u201d Butler, who is faced with what she calls a \u201cdouble whammy\u201d of prejudice because she is black, says there are limited solutions in terms of avoiding forced silencing. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like it then create your own business, become an entrepreneur \u2026 because it\u2019s not changing,\u201d she says.  When she tries to explain the toll of such experiences to men, she says it is so exhausting she feels \u201cit\u2019s not even worth the effort half the time\u201d.  \u201cThey don\u2019t get it. It\u2019s just not a reality for them.\u201d Hardikar, the health worker, adds: \u201cThere is a construct within masculinity that teaches them that they have the right to exert power over any space \u2026 It\u2019s about demonstrating who is in charge in that space. I am sure that it\u2019s subconscious, but it is learned and it is taught.\u201d This reminded me of yet another anecdote.  Riding the Greyhound bus on a night trip back from New York to Detroit while I was living in the Motor City, a middle-aged man sitting two rows in front of me turned to strike up a conversation. He commented positively on my ability to write while the bus was moving and remarked on my short hair. Perhaps emboldened by his previous comments, he told me I was beautiful before adding: \u201cYou are lucky to make it home safe.\u201d Safe was a funny word to use. His words made sure I felt anything but.",
