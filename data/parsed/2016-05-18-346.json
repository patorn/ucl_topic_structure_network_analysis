Here\u2019s what happened:  Democrats Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton won one state each, Oregon for the Vermont senator and Kentucky for the former secretary of state, while Donald Trump won Oregon, the only Republican contest of the night, beating a field of opponents who had long since dropped out.  Neither party\u2019s nominating race was technically resolved, with frontrunners Trump and Clinton not yet over their delegate majority thresholds. The Kentucky race was so close that the Associated Press declined to project a winner. The state secretary of state, a Clinton supporter, called Clinton the \u201cunofficial\u201d winner. Clinton declared victory. Sanders was agnostic, declaring: \u201cWe\u2019re going to end up with about half the delegates.\u201d Even with his Oregon win, Sanders appeared to have eaten into Clinton\u2019s lead of about 280 pledged delegates minimally. He would need to win 67% of all remaining pledged delegates to score a majority. Sanders said in a victory speech in Carson, California, that \u201cwe are in till the last ballot is cast\u201d. Clinton did not make a speech but tweeted victory. Trump appeared to have garnered about two-thirds of the Oregon vote, which was conducted by mail. With 60% of returns in, John Kasich held 17% and Ted Cruz 16%. Trump needs fewer than 100 delegates to get to the magic number of 1,237 but cannot cross the threshold until 7 June. Oregon awarded 28 Republican delegates.  Clinton is 94 delegates away from clinching the nomination, counting superdelegates, the party elites who can vote how they want and are mostly backing her, and 618 delegates away not counting them. Kentucky awarded 55 pledged Democratic delegates and Oregon 61. Visit our comprehensive results page here and our state-by-state delegates tracker here. Donald Trump was interviewed by Fox News host and former nemesis Megyn Kelly, who challenged him on having retweeted a follower calling her a bimbo.
