  "body": "Two Americans and a Canadian detained for nearly two years in the United Arab Emirates have been acquitted of all charges by the country\u2019s supreme court. They remain in detention, however, as their families wonder when the \u201cdark nightmare\u201d will finally end.   Related: UAE beat foreign prisoners and gave them electric shocks, evidence shows    In August 2014, after decades of travelling and working in the UAE without incident, Salim Alaradi, a Canadian Libyan, and Kamal and Mohamed Eldarat, a Libyan American father and son, were arrested by state security officials.  Before being charged with terrorism-related offences, the men were held in prison for 505 days without charges. Family members allege they were subjected to torture, suffering beatings, electric shocks and sleep deprivation.  In March, prosecutors dropped the terrorism-related charges but continued to hold the businessmen in custody, on downgraded charges of providing supplies to groups in a foreign country and collecting donations without permission. On Monday, a judge in the UAE declared the three dual nationals, as well as Libyan Issa al Manna, not guilty on all charges. The four men cheered as the verdict was delivered and embraced one another, said the lawyer for Alaradi. Amal Eldarat, 27, said she was elated by the verdict, which came after nearly 21 months of campaigning to have her brother and father released.  \u201cI\u2019m overjoyed,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took so long but it finally happened.\u201d She had hoped to speak with both after the verdict, but all of the men were whisked away by guards and returned to custody. Their return to prison was blamed on administrative paperwork.  \u201cRight now, there isn\u2019t anything we can do,\u201d said Eldarat. \u201cWe just have to wait for Emirati officials to do the right thing and release them immediately so they can move on with their lives and we can end this dark nightmare.\u201d  While she welcomed news of Monday\u2019s verdict, Marwa Alaradi, the 18-year-old daughter of Canadian Salim Alaradi, said the ordeal would not be over until her father was allowed to return home. \u201cMy father should not be in prison,\u201d she said. \u201cThe courts have ruled that he is innocent, and as such should not have to spend another moment in prison.\u201d Worried for her father\u2019s safety and health, she described his return to detention as a \u201ccontinuation of the gross violation of his human rights\u201d. Canadian officials said they anticipated Alaradi would soon be released. \u201cWe expect an expedited process to promptly reunite him with his family and friends,\u201d St\u00e9phane Dion, the country\u2019s foreign affairs minister, said in a statement.  \u201cCanadian officials will continue to provide consular assistance to Mr Alaradi and his family, including by helping to facilitate his return home.\u201d  An exact timeline of when the men could be released is difficult to ascertain, said Paul Champ, the lawyer for Alaradi.  \u201cThis case has been characterised from the very beginning with arbitrariness and secrecy and lack of transparency by the UAE government,\u201d he said. Plans have already been laid to transport Alaradi to Istanbul, where he will receive medical treatment and be reunited with his family.  \u201cWhen he is released, he still is going to have a very long road to recovery and to rebuild his life,\u201d said Champ, citing the physical and psychological effects of Alaradi\u2019s 642-day imprisonment.  \u201cReintegrating into family life is going to be very difficult, and simply rebuilding his life is going to be very hard.\u201d Greg Craig, the Eldarat family\u2019s US-based attorney and a former White House counsel under Barack Obama, said: \u201cThis is the right result but long overdue.\u201d The trial has attracted widespread criticism from groups such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International over the UAE\u2019s treatment of the detainees. Drewery Dyke, a researcher for Amnesty International, told the Guardian in an earlier interview the trial had been \u201cstrewn with a catalogue of flaws and shocking human rights violations\u201d, including imprisonment for a year without charge or access to counsel.  In February, a report by the UN working group on arbitrary detention called for the immediate release of the four men, documenting the men\u2019s claims that they were subjected to electric shocks, whipped, had guns held to their heads, had been placed in a freezer for up to 45 minutes and \u201chung with a rope around the neck\u201d.",
