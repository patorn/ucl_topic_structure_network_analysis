  "body": "Is there anything more rock\u2019n\u2019roll than a celebrity injunction to ban publication of some semi-naked photos of you at a fancy dress party a few years ago? Certainly not if you are Ned Rocknroll, husband to Oscar-winning girl-next-door Kate Winslet, whose lifestyle appears to be rejecting his name transplant. I imagine doctors are working round the clock to find the right cocktail of medication to make it take again, but, as things stand, Ned is probably sitting by his Sussex Aga making some primly irate calls to his London lawyers. Talk about a rocknroll swindle. I haven\u2019t seen these pictures \u2013 now being described in injunction-resistant US publications \u2013 so have no idea why \u201csemi-naked\u201d would be deemed so shocking. I suppose it depends which half \u2013 or, indeed, whether there is an alternative clue in the word semi. But what I am familiar with \u2013 in an armchair-historian type way, of course \u2013 is the concept of \u201crocknroll\u201d. I have listened to some albums. I occasionally wear the thousand-yard stare of someone who has read M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce: The Dirt. And, with the best will in the world, I am struggling to imagine Jimmy Page, say, placing a similar call to his brief at the same age. At this stage in the formal rock\u2019n\u2019roll pathway, outgoing communication is restricted almost entirely to the emergency services. Consequently, Lost in Showbiz is minded to suggest a second trip to the deed poll office for Ned. Could he not undergo a second rebrand as Ned Liftmusic, or Ned Teadance? If he can\u2019t warm to one of those, he could adopt a holding position \u2013 something like Ned Pending, or even Ned Superinjunction. Alas, before we go any further, I must offer a formal apology. When Ned was first introduced to readers of Lost in Showbiz, it was as a key piece in the 2011 autumn collection, wherein he was described as a \u201cspoof character\u201d. Yet again, my fact-checking appears to have let me down, for, as the years have gone by, it has become difficult to avoid the possibility that Ned is, at least in some sense, real. In fairness, consider the details I had to work with at the time: his name was Ned Rocknroll, and his job was at his Uncle Richard Branson\u2019s spaceport, where he was \u201chead of astronaut relations\u201d. I mean \u2026 come on. COME ON. His romance with Winslet seems to have been literally forged in a fire \u2013 to wit, the one that engulfed Branson\u2019s house on his private Caribbean island of Necker in that same summer. Kate and another boyfriend were staying in the house with various of Richard\u2019s family, including Ned, when the house was struck by lightning. Thanks to Richard\u2019s self-effacing yet diurnal blogposts on the matter, we learned that the entrepreneur had himself raised the alarm in the nude. In a later post, he would liken the destruction of the main house on Necker to the moment when Thomas Edison\u2019s factory caught fire, only for the inventor to immediately order it to be rebuilt. (If anything, I think that comparison undersells the cultural loss to the early 21st century of a Balinese-themed holiday home, but I expect Richard knows best.) Anyway, spool forward a few years, and it was to this event Kate and Ned turned when seeking a middle name for their new baby. \u201cWe wanted something out of the fire,\u201d she told a talkshow host, \u201cso Blaze was the name we came up with.\u201d As for the rest of Ned\u2019s rocknroll journey, the annals still feel tantalisingly incomplete. For filling in at least some of the blanks, I am indebted to a lengthy Daily Mail article for informing me that Winslet is, in fact, The Second Mrs Rocknroll, Ned having wed previously in an open-air pagan ceremony presided over by \u201ca druid called JJ Middleway\u201d. Actually, hang on. Called what? I\u2019m not sure I fought in two world wars for druids to be called things such as \u201cJJ\u201d. A Cathbhadh is a druid. A Myrddin is a druid. A JJ is an attacking midfielder who can also play as a striker. All that can be seriously said about this faintly hallucinatory tale is that it is one in which no one seems to have a correct name. Consider it A Misnomer\u2019s Night Dream, and await further legal developments.",
