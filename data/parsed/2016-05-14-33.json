  "body": "An English motorcyclist was killed at the North West 200 road races in Northern Ireland on Saturday. He has been named as Malachi Mitchell Thomas, who came from Chorley in Lancashire. The 20-year-old was treated by medics at the Dhu Varren/Portrush part of the route, but died of his injuries. He had been riding for the Cookstown BE racing team from County Tyrone. The motorcyle event, which attracts tens of thousands of spectators every year on the north coast, was cancelled after the tragedy. A few hours earlier on Saturday, Thomas had finished fourth in the supersport race. Earlier in the week a Northern Irish rider, Ryan Farquhar, was seriously injured in a crash at the same event. He is still in intensive care at Belfast\u2019s Royal Victoria hospital.",
