  "body": "\u201cBe you never so high, the law is above you.\u201d When that term was coined in 1733, there was no electronic communication, let alone the internet. Within the jurisdiction of the English courts, the law was supreme. Every citizen, whether politician or journalist, was subject to the rule of law. Almost three centuries on, amid a digital revolution that has made a nonsense of geographical frontiers, injunctions issued by English judges - including those sitting in the highest court in the land - cannot be guaranteed to hold sway. Injunctions - or gagging orders, as newspapers prefer to call them - still prevent publication within the jurisdiction. But they cannot stop secrets be divulged elsewhere and cannot stop people accessing them from within the jurisdiction. Privacy, as so many digital pioneers, such as Facebook\u2019s founder Mark Zuckerberg observed long ago, is dead.  That is the background to a battle between English judges and some national newspaper editors who are opposed to the supreme court\u2019s decision to uphold the injunction preventing identification of a celebrity who has been involved in a three-way sexual encounter. The Sun on Sunday\u2019s legal struggle to publish the story is supported by several rivals papers, including the Daily Mail, Daily Mirror, Daily Telegraph and the Times. All carried articles on Friday in which they criticised the supreme court judges - and politicians - for their ruling. In varying ways, some titles have also dared to thumb their nose at the law by providing broad hints about the identity of the celebrity. At its heart, this battle, as Max Mosley points out in a Guardian article, is all about interpretations of the public interest.  For popular newspapers, there is a public interest in the sex lives of celebrities. For the judges, and for a minority of editors, such matters may be interesting to the public but are of no genuine public interest (or public benefit). On that differing interpretation also hangs a central debate about society\u2019s right to freedom of the press as against an individual\u2019s right to a private life.  So what did the editors who support the Sun on Sunday have to say? The Telegraph illustrated its interest by devoting a spread to the story. Its leading article began by stating that it had no interest in the sexual proclivities of the celebrity known in court papers as PJS. But, it said, his desire to prevent publication of the story about him \u201chas raised questions of the clearest public interest, about the making and implementing of laws, about the responsibilities of judges and politicians, and about the free speech on which all British liberties depend.\u201d Yet, given that the identity has been leaked via websites in the US and by newspapers in Scotland, the bid to maintain anonymity \u201chas been spectacularly counterproductive\u201d and \u201ceven the judges concede that their ruling may invite ridicule.\u201d For the Telegraph, the culprit is was the \u201cwoefully reckless\u201d decision by Tony Blair\u2019s government in 1998 to pass the human rights act in order to \u201censhrine in law the European Convention on Human Rights.\u201d So the paper calls for an amendment to that act to set a higher bar for privacy injunctions and slams judges for misuing \u201ca bad law to usurp parliament and take the power to gag the media.\u201d The Times, even though it thought such privacy battles to be \u201ctawdry,\u201d believed the supreme court ruling on the \u201cnow-notorious\u201d injunction, plus the law on which it is based, to be \u201ctroubling in a free society.\u201d  It offered three reasons: one, precedent. \u201cThe horrifying revelations of Jimmy Savile should leave nobody in doubt that fame is a form of power which can be exploited like any other form of power.\u201d Two, practicality. Privacy cannot be protected in the internet age. The identities of the people involved in the affair \u201chave been shared widely on social media, even in England and Wales.\u201d Three, \u201cthe strongest objection\u201d: the case \u201cis no longer about privacy... but about freedom and control... It impinges on the freedom of everybody. This injunction puts any ordinary citizen tweeting facts at risk of prosecution; an extraordinary imposition in a democracy.\u201d The Mail, which carried a spread headlined \u201cFour Canutes of British justice\u201d, argued that the supreme court ruling was \u201castonishing\u201d and \u201cdeeply depressing.\u201d The judges, said, had \u201cswung their authority behind the ridiculous and unsustainable ban... the law is an ass to uphold an injunction which has proved so porous as to become virtually meaningless.\u201d It continued:  \u201cSuch purblind judicial obstinacy is threatening to bring the rule of law into disrepute.\u201d  It praised one judge, Lord Toulson, for having \u201cthe courage and realism to dissent from the judgment\u201d, concluding: \u201cThe sooner his colleagues start agreeing with him, the sooner they will stop making a mockery of the law.\u201d In a short commentary, the Mirror contended that \u201cthere is very little popular sympathy for celebrities seeking to use the courts to cover up activities perceived to be embarrassing.\u201d It said:  \u201cWe are seeing the spread of \u2018injunction busting\u2019 - particularly on social media - where the public, especially outside this jurisdiction, deliberately break the injunction.\u201d  Unsurprisingly, the Sun unleashed its big guns. Its front page, \u201cThe day free speech drowned in a pool of olive oil\u201d, was supplemented by a spread, \u201cCheaters\u2019 charter\u201d and a leading article, \u201cCourt\u2019s snobs reign supreme\u201d. It called the judges\u2019s ruling \u201cillogical and idiotic\u201d and called them \u201cout-of-touch old \u00adduffers with a predictably contemptuous snobbery towards popular papers and our millions of readers.\u201d It exempted Lord Toulson, for \u201cusing his brain\u201d by saying that the court \u201cmust live in the world as it is and not as it would like\u201d.  He was overruled, said the Sun, \u201cby four analogue colleagues befuddled by the digital age.\u201d The paper argued: \u201cJudges should rule on the law, not impose their snooty prejudices about tabloid stories they find \u2018prurient\u2019. It\u2019s not their call to decide what\u2019s in the public interest or whether that differs from what the public is interested in.\u201d In fact, the opposite is the case. The law does require judges to make decisions based on their interpretation of the public interest. Editors may wish it were otherwise, but - as it stands - that is the reality. Which takes me back to Max Mosley\u2019s long-held view that he trusts judges to make wiser decisions on privacy rights rather than editors.  That, of course, takes us straight to the main contradiction: any inhibition on what a paper can or cannot publish must amount to a denial of press freedom. It is an inescapable truth that we who find it distasteful to see people\u2019s private sex lives opened up to scrutiny, and who think the editors\u2019 \u201cright to know\u201d argument is wholly bogus, must accept.",
