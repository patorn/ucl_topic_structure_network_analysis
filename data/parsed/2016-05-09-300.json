On Monday the Medical Board of Australia issued regulations for medical practitioners following wide consultation with the industry and the public about how to protect people undergoing cosmetic procedures.   Related: In the aggressive world of cosmetic surgery, patients can't afford to be naive | Ranjana Srivastava    The cosmetic industry has been only lightly regulated. While plastic surgeons must undergo extensive medical education and training to become accredited after obtaining their medical degree, cosmetic surgeons need only to have completed a basic medical degree to perform some surgeries.  The new regulations, which will take effect from October, prescribe a seven-day cooling off period for adults before major procedures. For anyone under 18 there will be a three-month cooling-off period before major procedures, with a mandatory evaluation by a registered psychologist, general practitioner or psychiatrist, and a seven-day cooling off period before minor procedures. Treating medical practitioners will have to take \u201cexplicit responsibility for postoperative care and for making sure there are emergency facilities when they are using sedation, anaesthesia or analgesia\u201d. The vice president of the Australian Society of Plastic Surgeons, Dr Gazi Hussain, welcomed those requirements. But he said it did not change the fact that any doctor with a basic medical qualification could perform some potentially dangerous and invasive cosmetic operations. \u201cIn our submission to the Medical Board we specifically requested there be a requirement for basic training in cosmetic surgery, and we would always recommend someone has training from the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons given the lack of regulation,\u201d he said.  Medical doctors might be capable of making incisions and performing some surgeries, he said, but they might lack the training to respond if something went wrong. When procedures were carried out in non-licensed medical facilities, there were no specialists, such as anaesthetists or emergency doctors, on hand to respond. It is not illegal to conduct surgical procedures in an unaccredited facility, such as an office space, Hussain said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen patients who have had branches of their facial nerves cut and I have had to try to repair or improve that; I\u2019ve seen patients with breast implants who then come to emergency departments with infections, and I\u2019ve had patients with tummy tucks falling apart,\u201d Hussain said. \u201cMostly it had been done by non-plastic surgeons.\u201d There have been calls for tougher regulations for plastic surgeons as well, and the new regulations will also apply to them. When complications from both cosmetic and plastic surgery occur, it can be difficult for patients to know if they are suffering a statistically unfortunate but genuine complication, or are a victim of malpractice. Research by Marie Bismark, a doctor and lawyer, found that of nearly 10,000 Australian medico-legal cases resolved over a six-year period, 16% involved cosmetic procedures. Plastic surgeons, orthopaedic surgeons, vascular surgeons and dermatologists experienced disproportionately high rates of consent disputes, with patients feeling they were not given enough information to give informed consent, her study found. As well as the cooling-off period, the new regulations contain explicit guidance on patient assessment and informed consent, and require doctors to provide clear information to consumers about costs, risks and possible complications.

It included everything from non-surgical laser hair removal and Botox through to breast augmentation and other invasive procedures. \u201cThese guidelines haven\u2019t gone into the issue of specific qualifications, but not all the harm is done by those with less training,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was consideration about whether cosmetic surgery should be recognised as a speciality in its own right which would require certain specialisation, and that needs to happen before the Medical Board can implement a need for specific qualifications. But it didn\u2019t meet the test requirements for making it a speciality, and that\u2019s largely because it\u2019s such a diverse field encompassing relatively minor to major procedures.\u201d",
