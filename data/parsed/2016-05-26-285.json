  "body": "World Cup Carnival by Frank Lampard Review by Alfie  The book is about the World Cup final and the Golden Ball. Children aged five to ten will like this.       I liked this because I like football and if other people do, they will like it too. Best Friends by Jacqueline Wilson Review by Abby Star rating 9 / 10 This book is about two girls called Gemma and Alice. They have been best friends since they were babies. But Alice has a secret. When Gemma finds out, it\u2019s hard to stay BFFs\u2026 I like this book because it gets very tense at the end, and the way Jacqueline Wilson lets it out is fascinating. Recommended for people aged 9-10.      Want to tell the world about a book you\u2019ve read? Join the site and send us your review!",
