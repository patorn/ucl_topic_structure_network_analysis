  "body": "Ted Cruz dared not speak the name of the man who defeated him for the Republican nomination for president on Saturday, avoiding mention of the candidate he once called both \u201cterrific\u201d and a \u201cbuffoon\u201d and instead telling Texans he would fight on in the vanguard of a far-right conservative movement.   Trump Tracker   The only Republican who had a chance at preventing Donald Trump from securing the nomination, Cruz did not use the presumptive nominee\u2019s name once in his keynote speech to Texas Republicans at their state convention. But he did allude to the deep unease, and in some quarters overwhelming repulsion, that many Republicans feel about having the former reality TV star represent their party. \u201cSome are asking, \u2018What now?\u2019\u201d the Texas senator said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the future will hold, but I want to encourage each of you to have hope.\u201d He added: \u201cFor those who are discouraged, let me simply say this: truth will prevail.\u201d Cruz defeated Trump in Texas, amassed nearly 550 delegates that will go to the party\u2019s national convention in July, and for a time seemed likely to at least prevent Trump from clinching the nomination before the national convention. In the early months of the primary, he praised Trump and let other candidates wither under the businessman\u2019s personal attacks.  But Cruz was overwhelmed in north-eastern states where his ultraconservative views earned scorn, and Trump eventually branded him \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d for his campaign\u2019s false claims about another candidate and its backroom machinations. In the final days of Cruz\u2019s campaign, he could hardly find support in states thought to be sympathetic to his message. He was heckled by a child, mocked to his face by voters, and contended with a baseless tabloid story \u2013 surfaced by Trump \u2013 that associated his father with the assassination of John F Kennedy.  Hours before dropping out of the race, Cruz finally abandoned any pretense of civility and declared Trump an \u201camoral pathological liar\u201d who threatened to take the US into \u201cthe abyss\u201d. On Saturday he again hinted at Trump with such language, saying he would lead \u201cin this battle to pull America back from the abyss\u201d. The senator has so far refused to support Trump, though during the primary he repeatedly said he would support the nominee. He told the Texas Tribune on Saturday he was \u201cwatching and listening\u201d, but added: \u201cI don\u2019t have anything else to say about Donald Trump.\u201d During his speech, Cruz also alluded to the way the Republican party has splintered in recent months between hardline conservatives who back Cruz, \u201ccorporate\u201d or \u201cestablishment\u201d Republicans who dislike the senator and support conventional candidates, and the new base of less ideological voters who have elected Trump. Those factions face a difficult reconciliation, and Cruz referred to \u201cgrowing challenges\u201d in the weeks ahead. He spoke of the party in quasi-religious tones, as if it were facing an apocalyptic purge, and returned to his theme when he said his conservative movement \u201cwill be the remnant, will be the core of pulling this country back from the abyss\u201d. \u201cI am convinced with my soul God is not done with America yet,\u201d Cruz said. \u201cI\u2019m gonna devote my time, my energy, to mobilizing we the people, this movement, that believes in commonsense conservative principles.\u201d Cruz could still have considerable influence at the convention in July, using his delegates to change the rules and pull the party platform to the right. On Saturday, he only promised to work for conservative principles in the Senate, which he suggested should not do the work of making laws. \u201cThe federal government needs to leave us the heck alone,\u201d he said. \u201cSecure the border, deliver the mail and keep us safe: that\u2019s it!\u201d   Related: How Donald Trump convinced the Republican party to revolve around him    Similarly, Cruz criticized Barack Obama for new public school guidelines that allow transgender students to use bathrooms that match their gender identity. \u201cThere is nothing in the constitution that gives the president the power to be the bathroom police in this country,\u201d he said.  Cruz instead supports a state-level law that bars transgender people from using the bathroom they identify with, a law state police have said they do not know how to enforce. The senator gave a religious rationale for his argument that government has virtually no place in society, saying: \u201cOur rights don\u2019t come from government \u2013 they come from God almighty.\u201d He promised to renew his fight for \u201creligious freedom\u201d protections in the Senate, where for years his colleagues have heard his uncompromising, evangelical-inspired views with exasperation.  Earlier this week, he joked at a party lunch: \u201cTo be honest with you, I didn\u2019t want to come back.\u201d Senator John McCain, the Republicans\u2019 2008 nominee, had a ready reply: \u201cWe didn\u2019t really want you back, either.\u201d",
