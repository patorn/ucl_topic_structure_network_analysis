  "body": "Louis van Gaal has promised Manchester United will fight until the end to qualify for the Champions League despite it now being out of their hands. On Sunday\u2019s final day of the Premier League season United must beat Bournemouth at Old Trafford and hope Manchester City are beaten at Swansea City to ensure a top-four finish. United stand on 63 points, two behind their rivals, and Van Gaal admits frustration that Tuesday night\u2019s defeat at West Ham United has ceded the initiative to City.   Related: Manchester United will lose \u00a330m if they miss next year\u2019s Champions League    He said: \u201cWe fight until the end. We are dependent on Manchester City, that\u2019s the difference. That\u2019s also frustrating when you had the chance two matches before the end to keep that advantage. We were 2-1 ahead with 15 minutes to play and then we gave it away, that\u2019s frustrating. Now we are dependent but still it is possible.\u201d Swansea\u2019s manager, Francesco Guidolin, has said he will rest Ashley Williams, Neil Taylor and Gylfi Sigurdsson for City\u2019s visit due to a combination of workload and their participation in the upcoming European Championship. It may make City\u2019s task easier and so give United less chance of overhauling them but Van Gaal refused to complain. \u201cNo, because I have also given players rest and I have won [games],\u201d the Dutchman said. \u201cThat is also possible for Swansea. It\u2019s the responsibility of the club and manager to do what he thinks is right for the team. I can\u2019t judge that. My task is the same because we have to play against Bournemouth and I don\u2019t play against Manchester City.\u201d Asked what lessons can be learned from the uneven campaign, Van Gaal said: \u201cStill I have to remind you that we can qualify ourselves. I can say that we have to improve still. I don\u2019t think we have to improve defensive organisation too much, now we have to score more in our attacking way. That is also what I have said before this season \u2013 we need creative, fast players in attack. We have to change that, and that is very important. \u201cI am always evaluating and always adapting to the situation where we stand for. It\u2019s always the same, you have to evaluate yourself but also your staff and players, and then with that kind of people you have to communicate and listen to each other and that I\u2019m doing. That shall be done also next season. \u201cThe principles are always the same except when one of the members of my staff or players or board members can convince me of other arguments.\u201d Van Gaal pointed again to an inability to kill off opposing sides. \u201cI have said that many times [about this]. We need to train and that is what we are doing,\u201d he said. \u201cTraining in the situations we have. You have to make the pitch big and keep the ball better, then the opposition has to run more metres. You don\u2019t always have to make goals, you have to keep the ball in possession. We shall do that better when we train more.\u201d Van Gaal would not reveal if Michael Carrick is to have his contract renewed. \u201cIt\u2019s not a matter that I discuss with you,\u201d he said.",
