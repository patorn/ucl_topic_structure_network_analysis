  "body": "Thank you. On behalf of all of us who worked on Wolf Hall, a huge thank you to Bafta.   Related: Bafta TV awards: BBC is under threat, says Wolf Hall director    But, in the week in which our secretary of state, John Whittingdale, described the disappearance of the BBC as a \u201ctempting prospect\u201d, I\u2019d like to say a few words in defence of that organisation. Most people would agree that the BBC\u2019s main job is to speak truth to power \u2013 to report to the British public without fear or favour, no matter how unpalatable that might be to those in government. It\u2019s a public broadcaster \u2013 independent of government \u2013 not a state broadcaster, where the people who make the editorial decisions are appointed by the government \u2013 like they do in those bastions of democracy: Russia or North Korea. All of this is under threat, right now. The secretary of state has talked about putting six government nominees \u2013 a working majority \u2013 onto the editorial board of the BBC. Think about that for a moment. The editorial board \u2013 the body charged with safeguarding the editorial independence of the BBC from, amongst other things, government interference \u2013 will be appointed by the government. As a sign of things to come, the secretary of state has lately been telling the BBC when to schedule its main news bulletin, what programmes it should make and what programmes it shouldn\u2019t make. Do you want this? This is really scary stuff \u2013 not something I thought I\u2019d see in my lifetime in this country.           Mark Rylance: I owe my Oscar and Bafta to the BBC    And you know what? It\u2019s not their BBC, it\u2019s your BBC. In many ways our broadcasting \u2013 the BBC, Channel 4 which they are also attempting to eviscerate \u2013 is the envy of the world and we should stand up and fight for it, not let it go by default. If we don\u2019t, blink and it will be gone \u2013 no more Wolf Halls, no more award-winning Dispatches documentaries on Channel 4. Just a broadcasting landscape where the only determinant of whether something gets made is whether it\u2019s likely to line the pockets of its shareholders.  No. No. It\u2019s time for us to stand up and say no to this dangerous nonsense.",
