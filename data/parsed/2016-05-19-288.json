  "body": "Leicester have Steve Walsh. Southampton have a complex web of scouts backed up by a meticulous library of statistics. Sevilla have a colour-coded spreadsheet. Manchester United have Ed Woodward\u2019s nose. What a nose it is, as the successes of Anthony Martial, Louis van Gaal and Memphis Depay will testify. And Ed\u2019s nose has picked up a new scent: Schalke\u2019s Leroy San\u00e9.  Arguably the worst-kept secret in European football, San\u00e9 has been in excellent form this season, scoring nine goals from the right flank, which has secured the 20-year-old a place in Germany\u2019s provisional Euro 2016 squad. Squuuuaaaaaaaad. The prospect of dressing-room banter with Jesse Lingard may prove to much to turn down for young Leroy, if United stump up the \u00a330m necessaries. That\u2019s if Manchester City don\u2019t come calling first: Pep Guardiola has seen first-hand what wizardry Schalke\u2019s young star was capable of in the Bundesliga last season, and seeing as he has carte blanche - because Premier League - City could well end up stealing San\u00e9 from under their rival\u2019s, erm, nose.    Related: West Ham face competition from Tottenham for Bournemouth\u2019s Callum Wilson    The two Manchester clubs might also be interested in Rapha\u00ebl Varane\u2019s latest comments after the Real Madrid defender conveniently had a mic thrust in front of him just as he was having a good old sulk. \u201cUntil November I played nearly every game,\u201d he told AFP. \u201cIt\u2019s true that I would have liked to play the season\u2019s decisive games, especially in the Champions League, but these are the manager\u2019s decisions. After five years in Madrid I hope to be able to overcome some obstacles. I feel this is a crucial moment. I think a player has to develop and feel that they are important.\u201d It\u2019s true, Varane played the sum total of 90 seconds in Real\u2019s Champions League quarter-final and semi-final, yet any potential suitors will have to spend big to persuade Real to part with the Frenchman. Which probably puts Arsenal out of the running. But when City are reportedly willing to spend \u00a339.6m on an alternative that has a broken leg and a dislocated ankle, Varane\u2019s potential price tag might not be such a big problem. After Aston Villa announced that Randy Lerner had agreed to sell the club Dr Tony Xia, job applications for the vacant managerial hotseat have been flying into the office at Villa Park. Top of the pile is Roberto Di Matteo, who will turn up to his interview, plonk his Champions League winner\u2019s medal on Tony\u2019s desk, turn on his heel and wait for the phonecall. After being 66-1 for the job last week, Bobby is now 1-4 to beat his nearest rival, Nigel Pearson, to the position.  Elsewhere, Sunderland want to sign DeAndre Yedlin from Tottenham on a permanent deal, after the American impressed in the closing stages of Big Sam\u2019s Glorious Fight Against Relegation. With Kyle Walker and Kieran Trippier in front of Yedlin at Spurs, the 22-year-old right back was asked about a return to the north-east and suggested that he is standing in front of many doors, and is definitely planning on walking through one of those said doors in the near future. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a door I would not close. I would not mind going back [to Sunderland]. I\u2019m keeping all doors open, I don\u2019t want to shut any right now. Any opportunity that is offered to me is a big opportunity.\u201d  Elsewhere, Internazionale manager Roberto Mancini is interested in Atletico Paranaense midfielder Ot\u00e1vio Henrique Passos Santos, according to reports in Italy, after the uncapped tough-tackling Brazilian was named the best midfielder in the state of Parana this year after leading his team to their first Campeonato Paranaense championship since 2009. Yaya Tour\u00e9 will be hoping that one doesn\u2019t come off: the the Ivorian\u2019s Mr 15%, Dimitri Seluk apparently told Italian website Calciomercato.com \u201cIt\u2019s true, we\u2019re talking with Mancini. We\u2019re looking for a solution with Manchester City, who want to sell Yaya only up front, not on loan.\u201d",
