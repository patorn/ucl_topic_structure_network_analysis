  "body": "Regarding Zoe Williams\u2019 review of How It Works: The Dad (Review, 14 May), many Guardian readers are probably unaware that the original satire on the Ladybird children\u2019s education series was an art project written and illustrated by Miriam and Ezra Elia \u2013 We Go to the Gallery \u2013 and published under their own imprint, Dung Beetle Books. When the book first appeared in 2014, Penguin erupted in fury and demanded that the entire print run be withdrawn and destroyed. When this didn\u2019t work, they decided it was a case of \u201cif you can\u2019t beat \u2019em, join \u2019em\u201d, and published their own comic series under a different creative team. Unlike these subsequent titles, such as The Dad, We Go to the Gallery was genuinely funny \u2013 a brilliant spoof on both the Ladybird style of education and the contemporary art world. Anyone disappointed by the official Ladybird parodies and with a glancing interest in contemporary art is advised to get hold of the Elia version, which will have them laughing out loud. I believe the authors are currently\u00a0preparing a sequel.Davina ThackaraLondon \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
