  "body": "Those roses you bought the other day for the person you love, they were picked by a lovely lady in an English garden, right? Probably not. More likely, they were grown in Kenya, in the biggest polytunnel in the world, picked by poorly paid workers, dipped in an antibacterial agent, chilled in a massive refrigerator then flown by night-time jumbo jet to Holland to be sorted, graded, wrapped in cellophane, sold and bought at the biggest and most hi-tech flower market in the world, then loaded on to a refrigerated lorry and driven to your supermarket. Romantic, huh? It\u2019s the lilies in The World\u2019s Biggest Flower Market (BBC2) that are the biggest eye-opener. They\u2019re grown not too far away at least, in Holland, very close to the monster Aalsmeer flower market. It all happens in a glasshouse the size of 16 football pitches, with artificial sunlight so they grow at night and through the winter. And they move around! A mega army of flowers, divided into cohorts, marching in formation. It\u2019s The Day of the Lilies. And there\u2019s not a person in sight. Well, actually here\u2019s one, called Wim, to show Cherry Healey, who\u2019s presenting alongside royal florist Simon Lycett, around. But Wim is one of only 18 people in the entire place. The lilies are largely looked after by robots.     Presenter Cherry Healey in The World\u2019s Biggest Flower Market. Photograph: Thomas van Galen/BBC/Endemol Shine UK/Thomas van Galen    The lily bulbs are grown in peat moss from Russia. That\u2019s not great is it, environmentally, peat moss not being sustainable. I doubt George Monbiot would approve. I\u2019d like to have seen more on that side \u2013 the green, or rather non-green side \u2013 of things. Otherwise this is oddly fascinating, especially the big Dutch market itself. It\u2019s an airport-sized building with electric trolleys buzzing about like a nightmare video game, a monorail for flowers, fiendish sorting systems and comedy Dutchmen bidding millions of euros for billions of flowers on incomprehensible flashing screens. The Wall Street of flowers, they call it.  Fascinating but also a touch appalling: if anything, it has put me off buying flowers. From now on, I may be saying it with something else.",
