  "body": "In small groups, Hillary Clinton answers questions in perfect paragraphs, sometimes long ones. It can be a dazzling display. She is so prepared that she rarely needs a pause to think about what to say. One aspect of her precision and careful phrasing, with nary a \u201clike\u201d or \u201cyou know\u201d ever tumbling from her mouth, is that you need to listen hard to take it all in. Clinton is definitely the candidate for voters with long attention spans.    Time described a recent stop at a Virginia bakery as 'so boring that you could practically hear the muffins get crusty.'    That could be a challenge in a world where the human attention span has fallen to eight seconds, shorter than a goldfish, according to a recent Microsoft study.  At rallies, her studied speeches can drag on. In Kentucky last weekend, some of the school-age girls standing behind her with their Fighting for Us signs openly yawned or fiddled with their hair during the talk. One put her back to the audience to chat with a friend. Time described a recent stop at a Virginia bakery as \u201cso boring that you could practically hear the muffins get crusty\u201d. As president, Bill Clinton, of course, was also famous for his long-winded, policy-rich speeches. But this was before the iPhone, Twitter, YouTube and Snapchat helped usher us into the age of distraction. No one is better suited to these times than Donald Trump, the candidate of short attention spans. Unlike Clinton, who often starves the press pack following her, Trump is constantly feeding them a 24-hour diet of delectable and irresistible snacks. He almost always wins the morning. Then he orchestrates at least three or four \u201cnews events\u201d a day. His Cinco De Mayo buffoonery \u2013 the tweet showing him eating his taco bowl and declaring \u201cI love Hispanics\u201d \u2013 kicked off one recent day.     Happy #CincoDeMayo! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics! https://t.co/ufoTeQd8yA pic.twitter.com/k01Mc6CuDI\u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 5, 2016    Then came Paul Ryan\u2019s announcement that he was not ready to support Trump and Trump\u2019s immediate rejoinder that he was \u201cnot ready to support Speaker Ryan\u2019s agenda\u201d. Then he drew 12,000 people to a rally in West Virginia where he made the far-fetched promise \u201cto put the miners back to work. We\u2019re going to get those mines open!\u201d Afterwards, there were pithy, quotable lashes at Hillary Clinton.  By generating so much \u201cnews\u201d, Trump keeps the press in a reactive state. It\u2019s head-spinning for reporters, unless they are the \u201cchosen ones\u201d he calls between stops. And some of their bosses don\u2019t mind: Trump is traffic and ratings gold. In return, he gets more than a billion dollars in free media.     By generating so much 'news', Trump keeps the press in a reactive state    The hyping of stories, like the inconclusive meeting between Trump and Paul Ryan, only adds to the din of distraction. For efficiency\u2019s sake, Politico\u2019s Playbook has launched a feature called \u201cThe Daily Trump\u201d, which aggregates many of the lesser stories about him. There have been some long investigations recently that examined Trump\u2019s past, including his apparent use of the false identity \u201cJohn Miller\u201d, which he denies, and his treatment of women. But to absorb these stories requires more than one swipe of the mobile screen. Then, in serial tweets, Trump blasted the unfair hit-jobs, reclaiming the headlines. With so many Americans reading with their thumbs, Trump\u2019s advisers seem to believe he\u2019s helped by any attention as long as you spell his name right.  Nate Silver studied the headlines over the nine months since Trump entered the race. He concluded: \u201cWith his ability to make news any time he wants with a tweet, news conference or conveniently placed leak, Trump has challenged news organizations\u2019 editorial prerogative.\u201d  Then he asked, \u201cShould the press cover a candidate differently when he makes trolling the media an explicit part of his strategy, on the theory that some coverage is almost always better than none?\u201d It\u2019s a dilemma. As the presumptive nominee of his party, the campaign press corps has to cover much of what he says and does. But his own background as an entertainer means that Trump makes the line between news and entertainment fuzzier than ever. He\u2019s unbelievably clever at exploiting that.  Clinton, meanwhile, has all but disappeared from the coverage in recent days, except for a Washington Post front-page piece about her supporters worrying about how bad a campaigner she is. Her wariness of the media is well known. Although she\u2019s made repeat appearances on shows anchored by favorites like NBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell and did a hilarious turn as Val the bartender on Saturday Night Live, she never seems like a natural. Given that she is the long attention span candidate, it\u2019s not surprising that she doesn\u2019t have a memorable or catchy campaign slogan that sums up what she wants to change or do as president. Is it Hillary for America or Fighting for Us? I can\u2019t remember (perhaps my withering attention span is to blame). It\u2019s certainly nothing memorable like Making America Great Again, or Hope and Change, Morning in America, or even Bill\u2019s It\u2019s the Economy, Stupid. The press, too, is bored with her. Some reporters have covered her since the Clintons arrived in the White House. Even if they have shorter attention spans, they have long memories. Revisiting Whitewater or watching reruns of the Benghazi hearings isn\u2019t an exciting prospect. The Clinton supporters I called last week sounded worried but resigned. Having been criticized for being inauthentic, she can only be who she is, they say: a sincere policy wonk who has the experience to be an excellent president, even if she\u2019s a dull candidate. Compared to Trump, \u201cShe can never be entertaining in the same way,\u2019\u2019 one supporter noted. Trump is the exploding watermelon of politics. Recently, 800,000 people, a record audience for Facebook Live, watched two employees of Buzzfeed wrap rubber bands around a watermelon to see how long it would take to explode (44 minutes, it turned out). One Buzzfeed editor said suspense was the key element of the experiment\u2019s success. Trump builds the same kind of suspense: you never know what he might say. It\u2019s unclear whether the public, or for that matter any goldfish who cares to tune in, will find the spectacle entertaining or horrifying.",
