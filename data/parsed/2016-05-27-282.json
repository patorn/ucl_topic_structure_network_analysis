Most days Isis fighters fire mortars or bullets at their frontline, 10 miles south of Sinjar, sometimes crawling through long grass for hours until they are close enough to shoot. Several miles further south, some of Isis\u2019s most senior leaders regularly gather in the grey concrete villages of the terror group\u2019s northern vanguard, which for more than a decade had been the safest corners of Iraq for them to come and go. Moving among the nearby towns of Ba\u2019ej and Billij, according to the Kurds watching from the ground, and intelligence officials keeping tabs from other vantage points, is the world\u2019s most wanted man, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Intelligence officials, who have spent the past two years trying to pinpoint Baghdadi\u2019s movements, are now convinced that he moves within a tight arc of north-western Iraq and north-eastern Syria, within sight of this frontline, an area in which he has remained for almost all of his time as self-anointed leader.

Photograph: Scott Peterson/Getty Images    For almost six months of that time, from March last year, Kurdish and western officials, senior members of Isis and several others who are close to Baghdadi say he did not move from Ba\u2019ej, as he recovered from serious injuries he suffered in an airstrike that few friends, or even foes, knew had hit him. In northern Iraq, which has been the the most important hub in the war against Isis, intelligence officers and Peshmerga leaders say they are sure that Baghdadi has been moving widely around north-western Iraq in recent weeks, particularly near Ba\u2019ej and Tal Afar. \u201cHe\u2019s on the move a lot,\u201d said a senior intelligence official. \u201cHe also goes into Mosul.\u201d On the frontline south of Sinjar, which was retaken by Kurdish forces aided by US airstrikes last November, Lieutenant Colonel Khalid Hamza said he was certain that Baghdadi had visited Ba\u2019ej two months ago. \u201cWe have very accurate information from inside the city that he was there visiting the Wali [local Isis leader],\u201d he said, standing behind a giant earth berm built to stop sniper fire from Isis positions less than two miles away.

In the foreground were three mass graves, containing the bodies of an estimated 150 Yazidi women, whom Isis forces had deemed unsuitable to be enslaved when they rampaged into Sinjar from Ba\u2019ej and Billij in August 2014. \u201cHe is supported by tribes there,\u201d said Hamza. \u201cThey are very loyal to him. We know when he is in town. On that day, they confiscated all the phones off everyone several hours before he arrived. They didn\u2019t want anyone making calls.\u201d Next to him was a Peshmerga air spotter, whose job it was to call in airstrikes by providing GPS co-ordinates. He wore a large watch-like device on his wrist, with a broad screen, and was called on most days to summon fighter jets to attack Isis members either speeding towards the frontline along a long straight road or crawling through long grass to within sniping distance. Two years into the fight against Isis, more than 15 of the group\u2019s most senior members have been killed by airstrikes. They include Baghdadi\u2019s former deputies Abu Muslim al-Turkmani and Abu Ali al-Anbari, Omar al-Shishani, the head of the group\u2019s chemical weapons programme in Iraq, Abu Malik and numerous regional leaders in Anbar and Nineveh province. Last year Baghdadi very nearly joined them.      A photograph said to be of Baghdadi released by the Iraqi Ministry of Interior in 2014. Photograph: Ho /AFP/Getty Images    Interviews conducted by the Guardian over the year have revealed that the extent of Baghdadi\u2019s injuries after he was hurt in an airstrike remained one of the most closely guarded secrets of his organisation. His enemies were also reluctant to disclose just how close they had come to killing Baghdadi \u2013 seemingly because the airstrike that wounded him was intended for someone else. A Guardian investigation has pieced together details of the attack, of Baghdadi\u2019s slow recuperation, his recent return to prominence within Isis communities, and of the now intensified efforts to ensure that the next strike is both targeted and successful. Baghdadi was hit near the small Iraqi town of Shurgat on the Tigris river, about 190 miles (300km) north of Baghdad, a regional intelligence chief has confirmed.  The Guardian has contacted eight sources with direct knowledge of Baghdadi\u2019s injuries. All reported that he had suffered a serious wound to his lower back, which had immobilised him for several months before a long recovery. As he was being treated, only a small number of his personal doctors and nurses knew of his condition. Within Isis itself, very few outside of the senior leadership groups were aware. Even confidantes who had known Baghdadi well before the terror group\u2019s inception were left guessing at the reason for their boss\u2019s long absence from gatherings where his presence would normally have been expected. A senior Isis member and Iraqi officials in Baghdad had earlier believed that the airstrike had taken place near the Syrian border on 18 March last year. The Shurgat strike took place around the same time, but was about 100 miles to the east.   Hunt for Baghdadi   One source is a senior member of the organisation\u2019s foreign legion, from Uzbekistan, Hamid Khalilov. He had been based near Dabiq in Syria with Shishani, the group\u2019s commander in northern Syria, who was killed in an airstrike two months ago. Khalilov was captured in Baiji, near Shurgat, in August 2015 and spoke of meeting Baghdadi with Shishani both near Shurgat and in the town of Ba\u2019ej in Iraq\u2019s north-west, where he was being treated. Khalilov has provided details of his meetings with Baghdadi to intelligence officers in Iraq. He has also responded to questions from the Guardian.     Omar al-Shishani. Photograph: AP    A second prisoner, who was captured near Shurgat, has detailed Baghdadi\u2019s injuries to Iraqi and US interrogators. So too has a third man with direct regular access to the Isis leader, who has insisted on his name being protected. The Guardian has independently verified the man\u2019s identity. A fourth source is a senior member of Isis, with whom the Guardian has maintained close contact over several years. The information provided by all four men has been corroborated by a senior regional intelligence chief, and two western governments with access to details of both the airstrike and Baghdadi\u2019s recovery. None would put their names to the information, citing sensitivities about relationships with intelligence partners. \u201cI know he was injured. It was an accident, and it wasn\u2019t fatal,\u201d said one of the intelligence sources. \u201cHe is moving around now, but it took a long time. And we have a better idea of his movements than we used to.\u201d \u201cThis is now widely known by Iraqi intelligence agencies,\u201d said the Baghdad-based scholar and author on Isis Dr Hisham al-Hashimi. \u201cIt took a long time for the information from the Americans and others to be confirmed, but that has happened now.\u201d Details of Baghdadi\u2019s injuries have been shared across the Five Eyes intelligence community of the US, UK, Australia, Canada and New Zealand, and among partners in the Middle East, including the Kurds, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States. However, a divide remains between intelligence officers who wanted to disclose the details and policy makers who chose not to. The discussion centred on who would end up prevailing in the court of public opinion if information about a failed and accidental attack was revealed. \u201cI can\u2019t really tell you why people don\u2019t want to talk about it, because I don\u2019t know,\u201d said one senior official with full knowledge of what happened. \u201cHowever, there has been an ongoing discussion about whether to talk about it would build him up because he could say he survived, and whether that would outweigh the value of us being able to say we got him in the first place. \u201cWhat we all know is that he was back on his feet by late last year.\u201d In a statement to the Guardian, a US official continued to deny knowledge of an airstrike having hit Baghdadi: \u201cWe have no credible information to indicate al-Baghdadi was injured in an airstrike,\u201d the official said in a statement. \u201cThe intelligence community considers al-Baghdadi the overall emir of [Isis], providing leadership to the group, consistent with his role as described in [Isis] propaganda.\u201d Officials in Iraq\u2019s Kurdish north and in Europe believe that, having mostly recovered, Baghdadi is now moving regularly around northern Iraq and north-eastern Syria. In the past six months there have been confirmed sightings of him in Shadadi in Syria and the nearby border town of Boukamel, and a strong belief that he has also visited Ba\u2019ej, Abbasia and Tal Afar in Iraq\u2019s north-west, as well as Mosul, where he anointed himself as caliph of the so-called Islamic State in June 2014 in a public appearance at the city\u2019s al-Nouri mosque.  Inside Sinjar, Lieutenant Colonel Qassem, the leader of the local security unit, known as Asseyesh, said: \u201cWe have people who speak with us. We know when [Baghdadi] comes. Around three weeks ago, Isis in Tal Afar all started acting strangely, moving all their cars out into the open and standing openly themselves. It was clear something was going on and we called the Americans. They agreed, but said: \u2018We can\u2019t just attack anything. Give us a target.\u2019 \u201cI also know for a fact that he has been back in Abassia delivering prayers recently. He was staying in a small hut near the edge of town. We are very sure of this. We know when he comes and goes.\u201d The air campaign is being led by a mix of signals intelligence, which comes from interceptions of telephone calls and messages, as well as emails and short messaging programs. A former US intelligence officer has told the Guardian that Isis\u2019s information technology arm is in the hands of no more than 30 people, who are entrusted with establishing secure communications within the so-called Caliphate and other members of the organisation elsewhere in the world. \u201cThe best of them are very good, as good as we have,\u201d the source said. \u201cBut many others are sloppy.\u201d Tal Afar, Billij and Ba\u2019ej are all within range of phone towers erected by the Kurdish region. And, while Isis has targeted some towers, residents of the towns can still get access to the Kurdish networks \u2013 which allows sources to make contact with Kurdish officials. \u201cWe will get him eventually,\u201d said one of the Kurdish officials in Sinjar. \u201cThese villages you see may be very loyal to him, but not everyone inside them is.\u201d Additional reporting by Salem Rizk",
