  "body": "When Australia entered the Asian Football Confederation in 2006, Jeonju and Jinan were probably not the kind of exotic destinations that captured the imagination but it is in these cities where Melbourne Victory and Sydney FC will either fall at the second round stage of the 2016 Asian Champions League or progress to the last eight where things really get interesting. The exit of Guangzhou Evergrande from a group that Sydney topped not only increased respect for the Sky Blues around Asia but made an open tournament that much more unpredictable. As one official from Thai champions Buriram United remarked when the draw was made in December \u201cIf Western Sydney Wanderers can do it, any team can do it.\u201d And with Sydney and Melbourne achieving their first goal of a debut appearance in the knockout stage for the first time, there is no reason not to dream.   Related: Melbourne Victory join Sydney FC in Asian Cup last 16    Of the two, Melbourne have, on paper at least, the more difficult job over the two legs, the first of which is at home. Jeonbuk Motors are parked in the way. The Motors may be, like Victory, a headline writer\u2019s dream but when it comes to experience in the knockout stages, there is no comparison. The Koreans have played more games in the tournament than any other and have finished at every stage: as winners, finalists, semi-finalists, quarter-finalists, at the round of 16 and the group stage. When Group E was drawn in Kuala Lumpur, coach Choi Kang-hee was so happy back home that he called the club\u2019s officials to express his delight at the easy opposition. That was before Jiangsu Suning spent $100 million on Brazilian talent and two of his players got sent off in a crazy 3-2 defeat in Vietnam. The Greens topped the group thanks to a nervy 2-2 draw with Jiangsu at home. Jeonbuk have won the last two domestic titles and, more than any other club in Korea, want Asian success. After elimination in the last minute of the quarter-final last year, Choi went shopping. In came stars such as Kim Shin-wook, the almost two metres-tall 2014 World Cup striker , right-back Kim Chang-soo and, best of all, Kim Bo-kyung, whose form for Cerezo Osaka before heading to Europe in 2012, ensured that Japanese fans did not miss Shinji Kagawa. Victory finished above Suwon Bluewings in the group stage (despite an inferior goal difference) but unlike Jeonbuk\u2019s youthful compatriots, who played some good football but lacked a cutting edge, the Korean champions are powerful, battle-hardened and have firepower \u2013 Lee Dong-gook is the competition\u2019s record goalscorer. The men from Jeonju are beatable though. They defend from the front, denying opponents space but if you can get to the final third, there are vulnerabilities in the defence that Alex Wilkinson left last season.  There is a feeling in Korea that Choi, despite all of his experience and success, struggles against a tactically astute and flexible coach. Kevin Muscat may be able to make a difference. Tuesday\u2019s first leg in Melbourne will, of course, be crucial but Jeonbuk\u2019s journey was made easier by the league allowing the club to reschedule the weekend\u2019s K-League clash. Shandong, meanwhile, share with their opponents Sydney FC a contrast between domestic and continental form. The Australians didn\u2019t even manage to make the A-League play-offs this season and only Asian exploits averted disaster. Shandong are not in their domestic title race, though any Asian advantage that may accrue from that is negated by the possibility of being sucked into a relegation battle. Coach Mano Menezes is already under pressure and elimination at the hands of Sydney FC would not go down well. Were the axe to fall on the former Brazil boss, Sydney coach Graham Arnold would perhaps be in the running. He was quizzed on the chances of coaching in China when in Guangzhou earlier this month and diplomatically kept his options open. Shandong have already won in Australia this year however, eliminating Adelaide United in the playoffs back in February. The Jinan club is not part of the Chinese nouveau riche and lifted the title in 2010 when the spending was just starting. Guangzhou Evergrande have won every championship since. It took Shandong a little time to react to the changing environment in China but now there is the requisite big-name foreign coach in Menezes and big name Brazilians such as Diego Tardelli. He and compatriot Aloisio are obvious dangermen, or at least they were last season when Shandong finished third in the league. Hao Junmin, formerly of Schalke, and striker Yang Xu are established internationals and Australian fans may remember goalkeeper Wang Dalei from the Asian Cup. He may not be quite as chatty with ballboys this time around though, as he and his defence have conceded 16 goals in the first nine games of the season. Sydney will be hoping to add to Wang\u2019s pain.",
