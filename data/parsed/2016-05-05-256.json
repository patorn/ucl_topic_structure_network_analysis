  "body": "If you play an acoustic guitar, and can draw a crowd of 300 or so, each of whom has a few dollars to spare, then the chances are that when you visit New York you will be playing at the City Winery. Which is where, on a bitterly cold April night, Teddy Thompson and Kelly Jones - not the one from Stereophonics \u2013 are on stage.  It\u2019s a curious venue. Not least because it\u2019s also a restaurant. The crowd are all seated at tables, some finishing their dinner, others hoping against hope that at some point a member of staff might pass and they can actually order a drink. Everyone has to twist awkwardly to watch, or scrape their chairs against the floor to turn and face the stage. It\u2019s against this backdrop that Thompson and Jones gamely press ahead with a set drawn largely from their album of duets, Little Windows, on which the pair sing songs, all written themselves, in the style of the pop of the late 50s and early 60s: think the Brill Building, the Everly Brothers, Buddy Holly.  Jones seems cheery enough on stage \u2013 she chats away and teases her partner gently \u2013 but Thompson is mildly distracted, perhaps a little tense. It\u2019s not the diners, though, but the fact that he\u2019s not entirely happy with the sound \u2013 and that can be the difference between an adequate show and one that soars. \u201cThe way you hear yourself when you sing makes a tremendous difference to the way you perform,\u201d he explains three weeks later, in company with Jones, in the top-floor bar of a hotel, overlooking central London. \u201cPerforming in a beautiful hall or an opera house, where you can hear the whole room, where you can hear someone 50 rows back go, \u2018I love you!\u2019 or even just \u2018Yesssss!\u2019\u201d \u2013 that word delivered in a whispered hiss \u2013 \u201cand you can hear every inflection of of what you\u2019re doing \u2026 You play better.\u201d            Thompson and Jones are not hitmakers du jour. Their songs, as they admit, would sound out of time and out of place on pop radio, even though it\u2019s a pop record. It\u2019s not just that the songs hark back to the past \u2013 though Jones insists they are classic, rather than old-fashioned \u2013 but also that the recording eschews modern techniques. It\u2019s not a Jack White-ish exercise in audio Luddism, recording straight to wax cylinder using only mics touched by Robert Johnson \u2013 but they did eschew digital technology, recording to tape, to get a warm, full sound. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy these days, because people are out of practice recording that way,\u201d Thompson says. \u201cBut once you get everything lined up in the way they made records before recording desks got big in the 70s, when there were less tracks, it\u2019s all very simple \u2013 less microphones and everybody has to play together with dynamics. It\u2019s a wonderfully simplifying experience, musically.\u201d Both see themselves as existing in a lineage that has little to do with modern pop. Thompson says that, with a few exceptions, he\u2019s not really interested in music made after the late 60s. \u201cThe way [modern] pop music sounds, and the way it is recorded and the frequencies involved, does not appeal to my ear,\u201d he says.  \u201cI don\u2019t really see myself putting something out that\u2019s set to a hip-hop beat,\u201d Jones says. \u201cIt just isn\u2019t what I was raised with. Somehow it doesn\u2019t connect with me at a soul level. It\u2019s all about what you listen to and what you love. It\u2019s in your memories and your DNA. Those are the places you are drawing from.\u201d The songs eschew the personal writing of their previous records, aiming for something more universal, just as the Everly Brothers or Buddy Holly produced. But wasn\u2019t it the case that a lot of the music they are referring back to was actually written from a personal standpoint \u2013 and that it has come to seem universal because of the great shift in songwriting perspective in the mid-60s, driven by Bob Dylan? \u201cThat\u2019s true,\u201d Thompson says. \u201cThat\u2019s interesting. It was a simpler time, to coin a phrase. So the way Buddy Holly was expressing his sentiments was very, very simple, in a way that would now be considered hokey or childish, but then was just true and honest. That\u2019s true. I hadn\u2019t thought of it.\u201d \u201cThey were probably listening to 30s Tin Pan Alley songs and early folk and R&B and blues,\u201d Jones suggests. \u201cAnd none of that was going too far into leftfield. And the singer-songwriter as we know it today didn\u2019t exist. So they had very strong songwriting examples in the craft.\u201d Thompson laughs. \u201cFucking Bob Dylan. What a hack.\u201d       Thompson and Jones have both been making music for years. Thompson \u2013 the son of Richard and Linda Thompson \u2013 might be the better known, but Jones has recorded a series of jolly albums, venturing around country and folk and 60s-styled pop. When they started writing together, along with Bill DeMain, it wasn\u2019t with the intention of recording the songs \u2013 Thompson says he was idly dreaming of a Brill Building-style arrangement, where their songs were taken by other performers \u2013 but the further they went along, the more it became apparent that what they were writing suited the blend of their voices.  For Thompson, too, the project became a necessary counterpoint to his previous album, Family, featuring not just Richard and Linda but most of the rest of the Thompson musical family, too. Which, given the strains of that family \u2013 Richard and Linda went through a bloody separation as their marriage collapsed during a US tour, when Teddy was just a small child \u2013 was not the easiest project to pull together. \u201cI think this was a reaction in lots of ways,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was hard work making that record, and it was difficult in lots of ways. So I was looking for something a bit more fun.\u201d Jones reckons she supplies the optimism in their partnership \u2013 that bit more fun. \u201cI bring out the cynicism in him,\u201d she suggests. \u201cI\u2019m more of a people person.\u201d This is Jones\u2019s fourth album, and Thompson\u2019s seventh, including Family. You would think, at this point, they were secure. That making a living from music was now a certainty. Not so. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy at all to make a living,\u201d Jones say. \u201cThat\u2019s why I do a million and one things. I do as many things musically as possible. I sing on session for TV and film. I teach. I\u2019ll do anything.\u201d            \u201cAvailable for weddings and bar mitzvahs?\u201d Thompson jokes. \u201cI actually don\u2019t do that. But if someone called me and said, \u2018Will you do a bunch of Carly Simon songs?\u2019 I\u2019d probably do it.\u201d There\u2019s an endearing glumness about Thompson. Like me, he\u2019s ginger, and after a burst of swapping stories about receiving ginger insults, he posits his suggestion for a Rihanna-like perfume line to boost his earnings. \u201cEau de Ginger. In the rest of the world, it would just mean \u2018of ginger\u2019. But here it would also mean Oh! De-ginger. Remove the ginger.\u201d Thompson had a major deal with Verve before being dropped when gushing reviews failed to translate into album sales, and he thinks we will see the end of the musical middle class \u2013 the people who are neither superstars nor the aspirant twentysomethings on the toilet circuit. \u201cWe\u2019re regular people, who make what regular people make in regular jobs. We\u2019re travelling salesmen almost. We will disappear and the music will disappear. And is disappearing.\u201d Nor is there any consolation in the fact that at least he\u2019s doing the thing he loves. \u201cPeople often say that. But how do you you know this is what I love? What makes you assume I love it with such a passion I\u2019d be doing it anyway if it wasn\u2019t my job? That\u2019s not true of a lot of musicians. People think musicians are born with music spewing out of them, but it\u2019s a job, too. How many musicians would be doing it if there was no pay involved? Not many. I love it sometimes, and sometimes I really don\u2019t.\u201d You get no hint of that when Thompson and Jones sing together. You don\u2019t hear insecurity, money worries, concern about the place their music occupies in the world. You hear just the sound of two voices, a man and a woman, singing harmonies that sound as old as the sky and as fresh as the breeze. You hear the sound of music from a time when it sounded innocent. You don\u2019t hear worry; you hear joy.  Little Windows is out now on Cooking Vinyl. Teddy Thompson and Kelly Jones play the Apex in Bury St Edmunds on 5 May, then tour until 27 May. Details here.",
