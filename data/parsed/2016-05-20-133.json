  "body": "Two weeks ago, the Cannes film festival was preparing to unroll its red carpet beneath a double shadow. First was the threat of terrorism \u2013 then deemed strong enough to warrant 500 extra police officers and hugely-tightened security. The second was the persistent criticism levelled at the festival that it discriminates against female directors. Just three of the 21 films in competition this year were made by women (though that\u2019s still a healthier ratio than in Hollywood).  But as the festival enters its final weekend, both clouds are dispersing. Any terror attacks appear to have been averted, and two of the best-reviewed movies in contention were made by women (Andrea Arnold\u2019s American Honey and Maren Ade\u2019s Toni Erdmann). And, as the credits have rolled, so evidence has mounted to indicate a larger shift \u2013 on screen, rather than behind the camera. Twelve of those 21 films feature a female protagonist, most of them with bigger fish to fry than mooning over men. As well as those films by female directors, the festival has premiered Olivier Assayas\u2019s Personal Shopper, starring Kirsten Stewart as a psychic PA, the Dardenne brothers\u2019 The Unknown Girl, about a female inner-city doctor, Park Chan-Wook\u2019s adaptation of Sarah Waters\u2019 Fingersmith, Ma Rosa, about an impoverished mother fighting crime in Manila, Aquarius, in which a 65-year-old woman fends off housing developers and Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s Julieta, about a woman seeking to reconnect with her estranged daughter. The final film, screening on Saturday, is Elle, Paul Verhoeven\u2019s drama starring Isabelle Huppert as the CEO of a video games company.     Hard at work \u2026 Kirsten Stewart in Personal Shopper    What links most of these women is that their careers, or their causes, are key; romantic attachments largely relegated. Even in the quasi-romances \u2013 Loving by Jeff Nichols, Sean Penn\u2019s The Last Face \u2013 the women enjoy more airtime, and are at their most keenly-drawn when it comes to their activism, rather than their love lives.  Friday saw the emergence of perhaps the most formidable of this new breed of female heroines: Jesse, played by Elle Fanning, the teen supermodel at the heart of Nicolas Winding Refn\u2019s The Neon Demon. The director described how the film, his first with a female lead, allowed him to \u201clive out my perverse dream of being a 16-year old girl, which I think every man has inside them\u201d. When he first met Fanning, he said, his first thought was \u201cOh my God, you\u2019re me\u201d; though he was keen to stress that the actor needed to \u201ctake the lead\u201d, given his distance from her age and gender.    Related: Nicolas Winding Refn: society has become necrophiliac as the internet merges death and beauty    What Refn has done in The Neon Demon, however, is to wholly demote the focus offered to his male characters. \u201cI wanted to make all the men like the girlfriends in other movies. All the women are the focus; everything else is secondary. I wasn\u2019t particularly interested in the men\u2019s world but in order to create a story, we needed the \u2018girlfriends\u2019 to toss in here and there.\u201d Refn\u2019s gender-reversal is taken one stage further by Maren Ade, whose three-hour German comedy Toni Erdmann is the current frontrunner to win the Palme d\u2019Or on Sunday. The film is the story of Ines, a serious, successful businesswoman in her mid 30s whose larky father pays a visit. Ines is, by and large, emotionally, intellectually and sexually self-sufficient. That she is a woman seems an afterthought rather than a mission statement. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s best to think of Ines,\u201d says the director, \u201cas a contemporary, gender-neutral character \u2013 much like a man who cries now and then and has father issues.\u201d  The current debate can be frustrating, adds Ade, \u201cespecially when it\u2019s given so much weight. As a woman I\u2019m used to identifying with male characters. When I watch a James Bond movie, I\u2019m not just the Bond Girl, I\u2019m James Bond too.\u201d     Working girl \u2026 the Dardennes brothers\u2019 La Fille Inconnue    Yet for Melissa Silverstein, founder and publisher of campaigning website Women and Hollywood, Toni Erdmann was the exception, rather than the figurehead for a new wave of empowered, evolved, gender-irrelevant characters. \u201cInes is the best of a working woman,\u201d she says. \u201cThe compromises for success, what you have to leave behind, the different kind of choices you have to make compared to men.\u201d   Related: BFI funding chief: \u2018Awards voters must consider diversity as well as quality\u2019     The glut of male-directed, female-led movies may have \u201cforced the conversation on gender into this festival,\u201d thinks Silverstein, but that is scant compensation for the increase in women\u2019s stories which more women behind the camera would likely bring.  Her sentiments find an echo in the words of one of the male directors who has been bucking the trend for decades: Pedro Almod\u00f3var, whose back catalogue features scores of leading ladies. Speaking at the festival on Thursday, the Spaniard denounced what he saw as the US industry\u2019s continuing \u201cdiabolical sexism\u201d. \u201cWith those movies ... if a woman appears, their function is to prove that the hero is not a homosexual,\u201d he said. \u201cHollywood is losing an enormous opportunity when it doesn\u2019t actually create these good roles for women of all ages.\u201d The general mood as the sun sets on this year\u2019s Cannes is that few films have emerged which are set to be future classics. Yet the lessons the festival may hold for wider cinema could have a far longer legacy.",
