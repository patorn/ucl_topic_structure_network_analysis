  "body": "Noreena Hertz, ITV News\u2019s new economics editor, told her new colleagues that she has a steep learning curve to cut it as TV correspondent on one of the UK\u2019s top flight news programmes. The economist and author has come in for criticism from some quarters for her lack of news reporting experience and for having \u201cleftie\u201d political views. Hertz was officially unveiled to staff on Thursday by ITV news editor Geoff Hill at a meet-and-greet event. \u201cThank you for believing in me,\u201d Hertz said, according to those who met her. \u201cI know that I have a lot to learn\u201d. The appointment of the high profile academic with limited broadcasting experience came as a surprise to some staff, but is part of a plan by ITV to try to bring a more personality led, analysis-driven feel to its news output. While not having any direct TV reporting experience, Hertz has written a number of business bestsellers including Eyes Wide Open, the Silent Takeover and IOU: the Debt Threat. She has also been criticised for her political views by the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph. The Mail devoted a whole page to her, under a piece headlined \u201cBacklash after Leftie (with no TV experience) is appointed economics editor of ITV\u201d.    Related: Eyes Wide Open by Noreena Hertz \u2013 review    In the staff meeting to introduce Hertz her colleagues, Hill is understood to have acknowledged that \u201ca lot of you will not be familiar with Noreena\u2019s work.\u201d Friends of Hertz, who will start at ITV at the end of the month, say she is keen to focus on her job and does not intend to respond to criticism of her appointment raised in rightwing press.  Some insiders voiced criticism at the appointment. \u201cIt went down like a cup of cold sick,\u201d said one ITV News executive. \u201cAnother \u2018name\u2019 on a massive salary, but this time with no obvious TV reporting experience.\u201d The 48-year old\u2019s appointment follows that of the high-profile poaching of the BBC\u2019s Robert Peston as political editor, who sources believe could be on a deal worth as much as \u00a3700,000 a year. ITV denies that Peston, or Hertz, are on extravagant salaries.  Peston is understood to have been \u201chappy\u201d with the appointment of Hertz, whom he knows, but is not thought to have had a say in the recruitment process. ITV News editor Geoff Hill is understood to have approached and appointed Hertz, while Michael Jermey, ITV\u2019s director of news and current affairs, was also present at the staff unveiling of Hertz. Hertz is married to Danny Cohen, who was one of Britain\u2019s most powerful television executives when he was director of television at the BBC. He recently took up a new job working for billionaire Len Blavatnik. Hertz also sat on the board of another Blavatnik company \u2013 Warner Music \u2013 a position she is standing down from to take ITV job.  She will be eased into reporting, which will include the 1.30pm and 6.30pm bulletins and programmes such as Tonight, with her first major test likely to be on the Brexit vote on 23 June. \u201cShe will receive training when she joins and is expected to be part of ITV\u2019s coverage of the European Union referendum,\u201d said an ITV News source.   Earlier this year Hertz, who graduated from London\u2019s University College where she studied economics, clashed with the former Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson. Clarkson told a newspaper that Hertz said she was a Marxist, prompting her to tweet that the claim was \u201cmade up nonsense\u201d.    Surprised to see myself described today in papers as a Marxist. No truth whatsoever in this story. #MadeUpNonsense\u2014 Noreena Hertz (@noreenahertz) March 19, 2016",
