  "body": "The most interesting discovery of the week was not that IBM, Citigroup and Microsoft were unwittingly running ads on (and therefore providing funds to) an Indonesian jihadi website \u2013 though they were \u2013 but that Peter Thiel is supporting Donald Trump in his bid to become the next president of the United States. \u201cPeter who?\u201d I hear you say. Mr Thiel is not exactly a household name in these parts, but in Silicon Valley he\u2019s a big cheese, as a co-founder of PayPal and the first investor in Facebook. He is therefore rich beyond the dreams of avarice. But he is also: a philosophy graduate; a lawyer; a former bond trader; a hedge-fund manager; a venture capitalist; a philanthropist; a far-out libertarian; and an entertaining author. So what is a guy like that doing supporting Trump? One answer might be that he\u2019s as much of an irritant to the Silicon Valley crowd as Trump is to the Republican establishment. Although the Valley\u2019s tech titans like to portray themselves as non-statist disruptors, in fact most of them are \u2013 politically speaking \u2013 Democratic party supporters, albeit of an unusual kind. They may detest trade unions, for example, but they\u2019re very keen on immigration \u2013 so long as the immigrants have PhDs from elite Indian or Chinese universities. And they\u2019re not opposed to big government, so long as it\u2019s \u201csmart\u201d, whatever that\u00a0means.    What is a billionaire fantasist to do? Why, \u00a0hitch his wagon\u00a0to that of another billionaire fantasist, of\u00a0course    Peter Thiel doesn\u2019t fit this template at all. In 2009, he published an intriguing essay entitled The Education \u00a0of a Libertarian. \u201cI remain committed to the faith of my teenage years\u201d, it began: \u201cto authentic human freedom as a precondition for the highest good. I stand against confiscatory taxes, totalitarian collectives, and the ideology of the inevitability of the death of every individual. For all these reasons, I still call myself \u2018libertarian\u2019.\u201d But, he confessed, \u201cover the last two decades, I have changed radically on the question of how to achieve these goals. Most importantly, I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are\u00a0compatible.\u201d So what changed his mind? Answer: the 2008 banking collapse, which Thiel describes as \u201ca financial crisis caused by too much debt and leverage, facilitated by a government that insured against all sorts of moral hazards \u2013 and we know that the response to this crisis involves way more debt and leverage, and way more government. Those who have argued for free markets have been screaming into a hurricane. The events of recent months shatter any remaining hopes of politically minded libertarians. For\u00a0those of us who are libertarian in 2009, our education culminates with the knowledge that the broader education of the body politic has become a fool\u2019s errand.\u201d The emerging theme is that democratic politics is irretrievably broken. \u201cIn our time,\u201d Thiel says, \u201cthe great task for libertarians is to find an escape from politics in all its forms \u2013 from the totalitarian and fundamentalist catastrophes to the unthinking demos that guides so-called \u2018social democracy\u2019. The critical question then becomes one of means, of how to escape not via politics but beyond it.\u201d           Why people vote Trump: the death of the American dream    In 2009 Thiel could only see three possible escape routes. The first was cyberspace: \u201cBy starting a new internet business,\u201d he wrote, \u201can entrepreneur may create a new world. The hope of the internet is that these new worlds will impact and force change on the existing social and political order.\u201d The second was \u2013 wait for it \u2013 outer space: \u201cBecause the vast reaches of outer space represent a limitless frontier, they also represent a limitless possibility for escape from world politics.\u201d And finally there was what Thiel called \u201cseasteading\u201d \u2013 floating islands in international waters run as libertarian paradises, presumably with free copies of Ayn Rand\u2019s books on every bedside table. Sadly, none of these ideas has \u2013 as yet \u2013 borne much fruit. The internet has been captured by governments and huge corporations. Colonising Mars and escaping to other galaxies is a proposition only for Hollywood and the Starship Enterprise. And seasteading, though technically less impracticable, remains the fantasy of dreamers and flakes of Cadbury\u00a0proportions. Faced with these cruel disappointments, what is a billionaire fantasist to do? Why, hitch his wagon to that of another billionaire fantasist, of course. And Trump and Thiel have more in common than perhaps they realise. In his 2009 essay, for example, Thiel wrote: \u201cSince 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women \u2013 two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians \u2013 have rendered the notion of \u2018capitalist democracy\u2019 into an oxymoron.\u201d Trump\u00a0is hoping to turn that oxymoron into a reality.",
