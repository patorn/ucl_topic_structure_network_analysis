  "body": "Among the tributes following Barry Hines\u2019s death in March this year was Kathy Burke\u2019s comment that he was \u201cour generation\u2019s JK Rowling\u201d. Hines\u2019s popularity among readers of all ages remains undiminished, though you do wonder what Billy Casper might have achieved given Harry Potter\u2019s advantages in life. No wizardry here, just a kid with the nous to get a book on falconry from the library and make magic happen for himself.  Hines\u2019s novel has proven to be endlessly adaptable; famously becoming a film, a musical and, most recently, a ballet. Robert Alan Evans\u2019s version \u2013 first produced by Scottish company Catherine Wheels \u2013 is by far the most modest, yet arguably one of the best. There are only two characters, and both of them are Billy \u2013 one a truculent 15-year-old, the other his more reflective, adult self. It\u2019s a compelling conceit, which enables the action to flit between past and present like a falcon returning to its master. Amy Leach\u2019s taut, 70-minute production finds poetry within the assembly hall apparatus of Max Johns\u2019s design, while the action seems to float on the gentle eddies of Tom Mills\u2019s score. The interplay between the elder and younger Billys is deftly achieved. Dan Parr is a sensitive soul condemned to the scrap heap of a South Yorkshire secondary modern. Jack Lord morphs into all the bitter, unfulfilled adults who make his life a misery, while attempting to resist the inevitability of becoming one himself.  At West Yorkshire Playhouse, Leeds, until 4 June. Box office 0113-213 7700.",
