  "body": "You might be my mom. Only you will know. I think about you often. I have visited the place where you left me, in that hedge in a beautiful straw basket with hand-knitted clothes, swathed in a blanket. This is where my identity was forged as a foundling. From that little bundle you left behind in 1965, a great big me was formed. A dog sniffed me out. That day not only changed your life for ever, it changed the dog\u2019s owners\u2019 \u2013 an elderly couple who lived in that road and took me to the hospital after which I was named. Then I was taken to a children\u2019s home. The local paper urged you to come forward, to no avail. My case was distinctive. I was far from newborn and had been nurtured for at least six weeks; a fact that remained an unresolved stress into my early adulthood. I wonder if I look like you? Are some of my weird ways yours too? What\u2019s nature or nurture \u2013 who knows? What I do know is that it\u2019s been hard to decide what to include here \u2013 my experiences in care are too numerous for one letter. Social services tried to find adoptive parents. Then I failed my pre-adoption medical. I quote: \u201cThis child will never walk. She shows signs of spasticity.\u201d Consequently, I became a long-term foster child. Months of physiotherapy began and a wheelchair was ordered in 1967. Those early years were tough.    I don\u2019t want it to be your deepest regret, never knowing me, your beautiful daughter    My foster mom always had a small transient community of babies waiting, pre-adoptive, for their parents. She accomplished this in a businesslike way: \u201cLove them and leave them\u201d was her motto. I was moved around to a lot of homes only to be returned \u201cto base\u201d unwanted. Hence, my doggedly determined foster mother never took delivery of that wheelchair. She reluctantly project-managed my walking; in a letter from social services she was described as \u201cexpecting nothing less than perfection\u201d. This I remember only too vividly. As I learned to talk, I became well versed in requesting anything out of my reach. I clung on contentedly to the garden gate for hours, chatting to the milkman, postman and passers-by. So, the prognosis was wrong. I walked, eventually, at three, and many years later completed the great walk along King Offa\u2019s Dyke \u2013 180 miles. Many foster children came and went, each with their own hurt and narrative. We functioned as a unit, nappies changed, laundry done, beds made, babies fed. I learned how much love I had to give and that this was always reciprocated. I joke now that we were all mongrels, bereft of a bloodline, which made us all very different. I was quite driven to study, not what my working-class family could envisage. With rebellion and determination, leaving the care system at 16 seemed the only way. I took refuge in the YWCA to take four A-levels while I worked nights in a doll factory \u2013 and I haven\u2019t looked back. I have a deep academic quest for knowledge and advancement. I have been fortunate to travel the globe teaching, published numerous articles and several academic books. I have, as they say, come out \u201con top\u201d. I have had an exhilarating life. I don\u2019t want it to be your deepest regret, never knowing me, your beautiful daughter. We are each individually carved from our family tree, the branches of which makes everyone interconnected; many people before us helped to make us who we are. So it\u2019s not just about the two of us. I am part of a foster family tree. My foster parents were catapulted without dignity, through illness and frailty into their older years, and events evoke deep emotions about \u201clife\u201d. You must be a septuagenarian by now and I wonder where your life has taken you. What stories have we got to share? This before, perhaps, the sands of time run out and that opportunity is lost. I have the most wonderful husband and he often jokes, \u201cWhere did you come from\u201d? I can only respond, if only I knew \u2026 Liz Richmond",
