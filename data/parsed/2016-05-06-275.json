  "body": "A young Irish student was one of the first people from outside Germany to recognise the danger of Adolf Hitler\u2019s inflammatory oratory, a new biography reveals. Daniel Binchy, who went on to become the Irish ambassador to Berlin between 1929 and 1932, spotted Hitler\u2019s rhetorical power inside a Munich beer hall in 1921, when the future Nazi dictator was nothing more than the leader of a small \u201cfreak party\u201d. Writing in his diary about a trip in November 1921 to Munich\u2019s B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4ukeller, Binchy describes seeing a man with a \u201ccarefully docked \u2018toothbrush\u2019 moustache\u201d giving off an \u201cimpression of insignificance\u201d. Hitler, a virtual unknown, rises to speak, at which point Binchy is struck by his transformation: \u201cHere was a born natural orator. He began slowly, almost hesitatingly, stumbling over the construction of his sentences, correcting his dialect pronunciation. Then all at once he seemed to take fire. His voice rose victorious over falterings, his eyes blazed with conviction, his whole body became an instrument of rude eloquence.     Daniel Binchy in Germany in October 1929. Photograph: Ullstein Bild via Getty Images    \u201cAs his exaltation increased, his voice rose almost to a scream, his gesticulation became a pantomime, and I noticed traces of foam at the corners of his mouth.  \u201cHe spoke so quickly and in such a pronounced dialect that I had great difficulty in following him, but the same phrases kept recurring all through his address like motifs in a symphony: the Marxist traitors, the criminals who caused the revolution, the German army which was stabbed in the back, and \u2013 most insistent of all \u2013 the Jews.\u201d  Hitler stayed in control of most of the audience, Binchy recalls, despite some heckles. \u201cHis purple passages were greeted with roars of applause, and when finally he sank back exhausted into his chair, there was a scene of hysterical enthusiasm which baffles description. As we left the meeting my friend asked me what I thought of this new party leader. With all the arrogance of 21 I replied: \u2018A harmless lunatic with the gift of oratory.\u2019 I can still hear his retort: \u2018No lunatic with the gift of oratory is harmless.\u2019\u201d Binchy had a second encounter with Hitler in Berlin in 1930, when the Nazis were on the brink of power. \u201cIn his speech I found no change at all. Allowing for the altered place and circumstances, it was substantially the same address which I had heard in the B\u00fcrgerbr\u00e4ukeller. There were the same denunciations, the same digressions \u2013 and the same enthusiasm. At the conclusion of his speech the vast throng cheered itself hoarse. The obscure housepainter was now the leader of the second largest party in Germany.\u201d Binchy\u2019s warnings about Hitler in 1921 and 1930 are contained in The Lives of Daniel Binchy: Irish Scholar, Diplomat, Public Intellectual, a new biography by the Irish academic Prof Tom Garvin. It includes an article Binchy wrote in 1933 in the influential journal Studies, again warning about the danger posed by Hitler and totalitarianism.  The diplomat and intellectual, who later held senior positions at University College Dublin, Corpus Christi College, Oxford, and Harvard, was the uncle of the bestselling Irish novelist Maeve Binchy.",
