  "body": "Sidecar Factory Club In a former life, Sidecar \u2013 known phonetically to locals as \u201ccedar car\u201d \u2013 used to play host to singles nights for the US army, who would trot eagerly up the Ramblas to the Pla\u00e7a Reial from the port. Sadly, you won\u2019t find much military hedonism at Sidecar today, but the spirit of this American bacchanal remains in the venue\u2019s devotion to guttural rock\u2019n\u2019roll, punk and garage rock. Sidecar has hosted more than 4,000 concerts since it opened in 1982, with a small stage fit snugly into a beautifully lit, low-ceilinged cellar venue. It also hosts DJ sessions until the early hours, six nights a week, covering everything from ghetto funk to indie. Local bands are a speciality, but you\u2019ll also get visiting acts like Bill Ryder-Jones and Natalie Prass. The recent problems at Heliog\u00e0bal \u2013 long a home to up-and-coming local bands and now faced with potentially crippling fines for alleged overcrowding \u2013 make Sidecar, as well as Freedonia, more important than ever.\u2022 Pla\u00e7a Reial 7, +34 933 021 586, sidecarfactoryclub.com Gran Bodega Salt\u00f3      Rumba Catalana \u2013 a mixture of flamenco rumba, Cuban music and rock\u2019n\u2019roll which developed in Barcelona\u2019s Romani community in the 1950s \u2013 is one of Catalonia\u2019s most endearing musical legacies. You can still hear it all over Barcelona, but rarely in a venue as eye-catching as Gran Bodega Salt\u00f3, an old wine shop in Poble-Sec decorated with cartoon tigers, dolls and even a hybrid shark-carrot. The venue also plays host to blues, swing and other musical mixes. Even better, you can sample another great Barcelona tradition, the Sunday vermouth. Entry is usually free, but it gets busy, so get there early, when you can still see the decor.\u2022 Carrer de Blesa 36, +34 934 413 709, bodegasalto.net Wah Wah Records      For vinyl fiends, Barcelona is a paradise, with the city\u2019s location making it a treasure trove of French, Italian, Latin American, Spanish and, of course, Catalan records, both new and secondhand. Most of the city\u2019s record shops are located in El Raval, a brief sunshine stroll from each other, which makes a shopping trip the work of one very pleasant late afternoon. But if you can only visit one shop then Wah Wah Records is the pick, both for its exquisite selection of discs \u2013 it\u2019s the kind of place where French prog rock has its own extensive section \u2013 and for the air of record shopping it gives off, with vinyl heaped on vinyl in chaotic piles.\u2022 Carrer Riera Baixa 14, +34 934 423 703, wah-wahsupersonic.com Dep\u00f3sito Legal      L\u2019Hospitalet de Llobregat is, technically, the second largest city in Catalonia and the 16th largest in Spain. However, it has become rather subsumed into the Barcelona sprawl: you\u2019d struggle to fit a cigarette paper between the two cities, and it is well served by the Barcelona metro. That may be bad news for L\u2019Hospitalet\u2019s civic pride, but it\u2019s a welcome development for anyone who wants to visit one of Catalonia\u2019s most legendary indie music venues, Dep\u00f3sito Legal \u2013 or el Depo, as everyone knows it. AKA the \u201cindie temple\u201d of l\u2019Hospitalet, El Depo was born in 1985 of the same free spirit that inspired the Movida Madrile\u00f1a (the countercultural movement that followed Franco\u2019s death). These days it\u2019s known for its friendly, unpretentious atmosphere and some of Catalonia\u2019s best indie nights, calling on the region\u2019s most established indie spinners, like Luis Le Nuit, Hal 9000 and Monam\u00ed.\u2022 Carrer Santa Anna 14, L\u2019Hospitalet de Llobregat, +34 933 377 616, depositolegal.com Jamboree     Olivier Durand, left, and Elliot Murphy perform at Jamboree. Photograph: Xavi Torrent/Redferns via Getty Images    \u201cLegendary\u201d is overused in the musical world, but it\u2019s hard to find another way to describe Jamboree, a venue that has played host to the likes of Bill Coleman, Chet Baker and Ornette Coleman since opening in 1960. Even today, the venue still plays hosts to two live performances a day \u2013 at 8pm and 10pm \u2013 365 days a year, offering blues, swing and funk, and predominantly jazz, while the Jamboree Dance Club hosts R&B, soul and hip-hop DJs from midnight. The music at Jamboree is uniformly brilliant. But perhaps even better is the decor: the venue is all low ceilings, exposed brick and darkness \u2013 precisely how you\u2019d want a jazz club to look, in other words.\u2022 Pla\u00e7a Reial 17, +34 933 191 789, masimas.com/jamboree Parc de la Ciutadella       In a city where green space is at a premium, Parc de la Ciutadella is Barcelona\u2019s beating heart, a 70-acre park to the north-east of Ciutat Vella where people go to relax, take the sun, walk their dogs and throw frisbees. It\u2019s also an amateur musical hive, home to drum circles, buskers, practising trombone players, swing classes, improv jazz trios, the occasional live gig and even secret DJ sets, notably when Richie Hawtin played the Ciutadella bandstand during Sonar 2013. Primavera Sound may have moved its free gig programme from Ciutadella to Raval in 2016, but the park is warmly recommended for anyone who wants to bring their own instrument and join in the fun, or just experience the charming musical chaos of Ciutadella during a warm summer day.\u2022 Passeig de Picasso 21 Bar Pastis       Allegedly modelled on a typical bar in prewar Marseille, Bar Pastis is home to intimate live music performances in one of the most charming small spaces in Barcelona, all elderly wooden panels, faded pictures, low lighting and layers of random nostalgic trinkets, infused with the kind of corporeal smell that makes you wish they\u2019d repeal the smoking ban. Expect tango, blues, folk and more, in a bar about the size of your lounge, where you can see the whites of the performer\u2019s eyes, all for a \u20ac2 supplement on your first drink. The experience, both musical and alcoholic, is like stepping back in time.\u2022 Carrer de Santa M\u00f2nica 4, +34 634 938 422, barpastis.com Manchester Bar       In the late 19th century, Barcelona\u2019s Poblenou district was known as \u201cthe Catalan Manchester\u201d, thanks to its textile industries. In 2016, however, \u201cthe Catalan Manchester\u201d is Manchester Bar, a higgledy-piggledy homage to the rainy city tucked away in a small square in Barri G\u00f2tic, behind a Joy Division shutter (there\u2019s a tiny sister bar in El Raval, at Carrer de Valldonzella 40). The music, as you might expect, is British to a tee \u2013 all Happy Mondays, Stone Roses and New Order, as well as the cream of modern indie \u2013 attracting both homesick exchange students and a surprising number of Anglophile Catalans, who cram into the corners of the darkened bar to drink and dream the night away. \u2022 Carrer de Milans 5, +34 627 733 081, facebook.com/manchesterbar Hiroshima     Contemporary dance at Hiroshima.    At the other end of the stylistic spectrum to Manchester Bar is Hiroshima, a relatively new venue in Poble-sec that devotes itself to the unconventional and arty. Contemporary dance is a speciality, but Hiroshima also plays host to leftfield musical acts such as Berlinist and Nerval, while the monthly Poetry in the Darkness nights, which pair electronic music with film, have proved a hit.\u2022 Vil\u00e0 i Vil\u00e0 61-69, +34 933 155 458, hiroshima.cat Switch Technically this may be a bar, but its owners prefer to call it a \u201cpocket club\u201d, and, as you step down into this dark, mysterious, Gr\u00e0cia locale, you can see why. There\u2019s something essentially club-ish about Switch, from the brilliant sound system, thunderous yet clear, to the music \u2013 from dub techno to house, new wave and EBM, with few concessions to polite conversation. And yet the place is determinedly pocket-sized, with a small dance floor pushed up against a well-stocked bar in a way that determines you\u2019ll make new friends as you tune in and Switch on. Gr\u00e0cia certainly doesn\u2019t lack for bars, but few are as intensely satisfying as Switch on a good night.\u2022 Carrer de Francisco Giner 24, facebook.com/switchpocketclub",
