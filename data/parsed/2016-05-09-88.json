  "body": "A senior judge has criticised a police detective and the Crown Prosecution Service for their handling of an accusation of gang rape after the case against four young men collapsed just as their trial was due to begin. Judge Jamie Tabor QC said DC Ben Lewis of Gloucestershire police had got too close to the complainant and did not understand his job properly. Tabor said the officer and the CPS had to bear responsibility for not disclosing \u201cgame-changing\u201d material to the defence teams of the men who were due to stand trial.  The four men, three of them students and one a promising jockey, had been accused of involvement in the gang rape of a young woman at an annual college ball at the Royal Agricultural University in Cirencester, Gloucestershire in May 2014. She claimed that she had been subjected to violence, including strangulation, and that some of it had been filmed and sent by one of the men to friends via social media.  The trial had been due to begin at Gloucester crown court but at the last moment the prosecution offered no evidence and the four defendants were cleared. After the case collapsed, the defendants\u2019 legal team accused police in court of \u201ccherry picking\u201d evidence supportive of the prosecution\u2019s case and \u201cairbrushing out of the picture\u201d anything that could have helped the men.

Photograph: Andrew Matthews/PA    This included text messages sent by the complainant in the hours after the alleged incident and a conversation with a friend about what would happen if the video became common knowledge. It also emerged as the trial was due to begin that police failed to disclose that the complainant was a witness to an alleged rape on an army base in October 2014 and that there were inconsistencies in her evidence. The alleged rapist, a soldier, was later cleared. Tabor, the recorder of Gloucester, said Lewis had a \u201climited grasp of responsibilities\u201d as disclosure officer \u2013 the person responsible for handing over relevant information to the defence.  The judge criticised the detective for getting too close to the complainant, failing to properly record his dealings with her, and for a lack of training. Tabor also attacked the CPS for its delay in obtaining from the Royal Military Police the files of the case in which the complainant was a witness.  He said: \u201cTo do nothing about the Royal Military Police file for months was stark and wrong. The Crown Prosecution Service and DC Lewis must bear joint responsibility for the failure to properly disclose this game-changing material.\u201d A police spokesman said the force took the judge\u2019s findings very seriously. \u201cWe accept the judge\u2019s findings and are now reviewing his comments in conjunction with the CPS to learn the lessons of this case and to improve how we investigate such cases,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is of course the case that although the judge has identified failings in relation to the disclosure process it is right to note that DC Lewis has not been found to have acted in bad faith in any way. \u201cFurther the officer was available and willing to give evidence \u2026 but was never provided with any opportunity to answer any of the allegations made against him. \u201cThe force shall refer the judge\u2019s findings to the professional standards department who shall consider whether or not any conduct issues have been identified in relation to any officers and these will be assessed in conjunction with the Independent Police Complaints Commission if necessary.\u201d  A CPS spokesperson said: \u201cWe note today\u2019s judgment. Issues involving disclosure meant that, ahead of the trial taking place, the CPS determined there was no longer enough evidence to progress the case to trial.\u201d Students Thady Duff, Leo Mahon and Patrick Foster, all 22, and jockey James Martin, 20, were cleared of rape. Duff, Mahon and Foster returned to court to apply for a proportion of their legal costs to be paid by the prosecution. They have been left with legal bills totalling \u00a3221,000 after hiring three QCs to lead the fight to clear their names. Martin received legal aid in the case.",
