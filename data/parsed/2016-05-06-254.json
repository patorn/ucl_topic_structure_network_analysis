Westminster has slashed the annual \u00a3150,000 budget for the Cornish language, without explanation and with immediate effect. Ed Rowe, AKA comedian Kernow King, calls the PM an \u201comgyjer glusek\u201d, or \u201csticky wanker\u201d. But when it is estimated that fewer than 500 people speak Cornish fluently, and (at time of writing) fewer than 6,000 people have signed a petition asking the government to reconsider, the effects of the cuts aren\u2019t immediately clear. Steve Double, Conservative MP for St Austell and Newquay, says he can\u2019t see how Cornwall council could have spent \u00a3650,000 it has received over the past four years, and that the language is not a priority for his electorate. But campaigners such as Loveday Jenkin, who chairs the Cornish Language Fellowship, argue that great value was extracted from the tiny sum. Core staff at Cornwall council facilitated volunteer groups, who translate road signs and documentation for the council and local businesses. Maga Kernow, the Cornish Language Partnership, offers educational resources and training. Pensans primary school, in Penzance, has been teaching Cornish since 2005, which wouldn\u2019t have been possible without Maga, says the school\u2019s Sarah Crummay. \u201cWe have children from all over the world, and it\u2019s lovely that everybody\u2019s learning something about where they live. It\u2019s a way of breaking down barriers, and it has cognitive and cultural benefits.\u201d Chairman Mark Trevethan says that Maga is now stuck in no-man\u2019s land: last summer, Cornwall won landmark devolutionary powers, which the government said it could use to support the language. But the relevant allocations have not yet been devolved from Westminster. \u201cWe don\u2019t really fit into mainstream UK policies, despite the obligations of the European charter for regional or minority languages,\u201d he says. But why is it important to keep Cornish alive when so few speak it? Jenkin calls Cornwall a place of low aspirations, and suggests that renewed regional pride, coupled with a local rise in high-value creative and digital jobs, might stop people from leaving the county to find work. Councillor Julian German agrees. \u201cFor a government that\u2019s so interested in economics, it seems a very small resource to put into something with such a large potential dividend.\u201d He points to the word glas \u2013 \u201cthe colour of the sea\u201d \u2013 as an example of Cornish\u2019s unique expression. German\u2019s favourite Cornish-language artist, poet Tim Saunders, says he writes in Cornish, \u201cbecause there is so much that I could never express otherwise\u201d. As campaigners point out, Cornish was revived by local people long before it was recognised by the government in 2002. Saunders\u2019 daughter Gwenno is a synth-pop musician who was inspired by the \u201ccomplete labour of love\u201d to re-establish the language. Her 2015 debut album featured a song in Cornish. \u201cIt\u2019s one of Britain\u2019s indigenous languages,\u201d she says, \u201cpart of the history of all of us who reside here.\u201d Dr Merv Davey is the grand bard of Gorsedh Kernow, which maintains the region\u2019s Celtic traditions. He is angered by the cuts, but remains optimistic. \u201cWe have to carry on fighting for proper recognition and what we\u2019re owed, but I don\u2019t think we should be obsessed with that; we must get on with it ourselves,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re quite resourceful, as Cornish people. We\u2019ve never really kowtowed to central government, and we\u2019re not going to start now.\u201d * Mad",
