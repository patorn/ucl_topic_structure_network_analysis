  "body": "When Morgan Maguire was growing up, she struggled to find a role model. As a young Catholic schoolgirl in Hanover, Pennsylvania, she was often teased about her love of history and scary stories, and when it came to one of her most beloved hobbies, there were no women on television or in her life to inspire her. It\u2019s a story familiar to many young girls, although the male-dominated field she wanted to join is one that\u2019s rarely associated with debates on gender equality and sexism. Maguire wanted to be a ghost hunter. \u201cI\u2019ve been fascinated with the paranormal, God, probably since birth,\u201d said Maguire, 24, who now works in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, which some say is one of the most haunted cities in the US. \u201cWhen I was little, I didn\u2019t have any female ghost hunters to look up to.\u201d Maguire is now part of a group that claims to be one of the country\u2019s first-ever all-female team of \u201cparanormal investigators\u201d, which means they search for evidence of ghosts and help people respond to spirits haunting their homes. The women are part of a movement of female ghost hunters that they say has grown in recent years, and they\u2019re hoping many more young girls will be encouraged to join after the highly anticipated women-led remake of Ghostbusters hits the big screen. \u201cI am so ungodly excited for the new movie, it\u2019s not even funny,\u201d said Maguire, who is a member of a paranormal group called the Gettysburg Ghost Gals and also works at the historic Farnsworth House Inn, a tourist site marketed as one of the most haunted places in the world. \u201cThe original Ghostbusters, as amazing and awesome as it is, is four dudes \u2026 Now, girls of any age can realize, \u2018Hey, I can do that!\u2019\u201d     Brigid Goode, who has been doing paranormal investigations for decades, is illuminated in the basement of the Farnsworth House Inn by a green laser grid used to detect possible spirits and shadow people who block out the grid\u2019s pattern. Photograph: JM Giordano for the Guardian    The controversial reboot of Ghostbusters, which opens on 15 July, is the brainchild of director Paul Feig, who cast the stars of his 2011 hit Bridesmaids \u2013 Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig \u2013 along with Saturday Night Live comics Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones. With a trailer that earned the title of most-disliked film promo in YouTube history and a Twitter storm of attacks that Feig recently described as \u201cvile, misogynistic shit\u201d, the film is sure to face harsh scrutiny from fans of the 1984 original, which starred Bill Murray as one of four parapsychologists chasing ghosts in New York City. While Feig\u2019s film has been thrust to the center of the contentious debates about sexism in comedy and the lack of female representation across Hollywood, there\u2019s been parallel \u2013 albeit much smaller \u2013 discussions brewing among real-life ghostbusters about the lack of women in the paranormal world.    Every team back in the 90s was male-dominated. You didn\u2019t find any teams that were female-run  Brigid Goode     \u201cEvery team back in the 90s was male-dominated. You didn\u2019t find any teams that were female-run,\u201d said Brigid Goode, who has been doing paranormal investigations for decades but founded the Gettysburg Ghost Gals in 2012 in an effort to support women in the field. Although Ghostbusters is a comedy, the women of Gettysburg Ghost Gals and similar groups take their work seriously and have no doubts that ghosts and spirits are real \u2013 and that hunters provide a vital service.  Real-world ghostbusters respond to inquiries from clients concerned about ghosts lurking in their homes. They conduct lengthy investigations to confirm or deny their presence and sometimes help families cleanse their homes of unwelcome intruders.     Jenny Thomas, a psychic medium in the Gettysburg Ghost Gals, records real-time electronic voice phenomena in the attic of the Farnsworth House Inn. Photograph: JM Giordano for the Guardian    They use a wide range of equipment, including full-spectrum cameras, electromagnetic field (EMF) meters, \u201celectronic voice phenomenon\u201d (EVP) analyzers (which capture audio in high-definition wave formats), sage (for cleansing), and \u201ctrigger props\u201d (to attract spirits). They do not, however, use \u201cproton packs\u201d \u2013 the Ghostbusters\u2019 famous device for capturing ghosts, which Goode said is the key difference between the movie and her work. \u201cIt is yet to be proven that you can catch a ghost,\u201d Goode said. Much has changed since the 90s, and there are now thousands of paranormal societies across the country, with an increasing number of women joining teams and leading organizations.  Samantha Hawes, a longtime paranormal researcher and now a cast member of Ghost Hunters, a Syfy reality series, said she always felt welcome in the field but noted that other women have struggled in the face of sexist men who believe they will be frightened \u201cdamsels in distress\u201d when confronted with ghosts.  \u201cMost people don\u2019t imagine women crawling through old dilapidated buildings and tunnels and talking to things that could possibly hurt them if not handled the right way,\u201d Hawes said. She hopes the new Ghostbusters will help shift people\u2019s perceptions. \u201cI want people to see the movie and stop for two minutes and think, \u2018Hey, maybe a woman\u2019s not going to be scared if she comes with us\u2019.\u201d     Goode and Thomas take readings in the McFarlan bedroom at the Farnsworth House Inn. Photograph: JM Giordano for the Guardian    But like TV series across the industry, Ghost Hunters, which only features two women, has also faced criticisms for failing to have a diverse cast. \u201cIn the paranormal world itself, there are a lot of women \u2026 but as far as TV, we are sorely underrepresented,\u201d said Jenny Thomas, a psychic medium in the Gettysburg Ghost Gals, who said the original Ghostbusters was a major source of inspiration.  \u201cI do hope [the reboot] helps propel women in the paranormal field on TV and propels us in the public eye.\u201d    I do hope [the reboot\u200b\u200b] helps propel women in the paranormal field on TV and propels us in the public eye  Jenny Thomas     In the same way that critics say the lack of diversity in Hollywood has many consequences for the film industry, women say that when men dominate ghost hunting, people lose out. \u201cI think we get better results because we\u2019re women,\u201d Goode said. \u201cWomen are much more sensitive \u2026 we\u2019re not a dominating force.\u201d Female ghost hunters said they can connect better with frightened families seeking aid \u2013 and they\u2019re more successful at communicating with child spirits. \u201cWe are a very nurturing group of women,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cWe care very much about the people we\u2019re helping.\u201d",
