The UN\u2019s head of disaster planning, Robert Glasser, has called for immediate action on mitigating the risks posed by climate change, droughts and the humanitarian crises that follow. Which country is most at risk from natural disasters? Explore our analysis of the world risk index, which measures countries by the frequency of natural disasters as well as how well-equipped they are to recover.

Amy Whalley, of Results UK, calls for an effective immunisation programme, which she argues could help developing health systems. It is time for Liberia to ban female genital mutilation, following similar bans in Nigeria and the Gambia, writes Equality Now\u2019s Mary Wandia. Although Liberian president Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf called on other countries to \u201cmuster the courage to ban the irreparable harm inflicted by genital mutilation\u201d, she is yet to make this a reality in her own country. Multimedia In Colombia, women who survived years of rape and violence during the country\u2019s conflict have built their own haven. The City of Women houses almost 500 people and has its own school and shops. Kary Stewart visited the settlement for our latest podcast. You can also read Sibylla Brodzinsky\u2019s report.

Submit a response of 250 words or fewer, telling us what your first act in office would be, and we\u2019ll publish the best ones. What you said On The construction industry must step up on human rights, Silvia Mera wrote:  We need companies to embrace disclosure (and upcoming regulations \u2013 ie the Modern Slavery Act \u2013 are slowly making it more and more compelling) which means 1) share if they\u2019re taking action and 2) share which challenges they are facing when addressing this problem and 3) find solutions as an industry!  Naming and shaming is not the way if we want companies to come forward rather than stepping back \u2026 These are businesses with resources to fix the problem once they have understood the issue, the risks and are willing to put solutions in place, and believe me, most do, as they do not want to shut down or lose competitiveness. How can they fix the problem if they just go out of business? For a business that closes down another one will open and potentially thrive on abuse of human rights. And abused workers will never be freed.   Highlight from the blogosphere The world humanitarian summit will have little hope of addressing the biggest crises facing the world if governments refuse to tackle the root causes, argues Ed Cairns on From Poverty to Power.  And finally \u2026 Poverty matters will return in two weeks with another roundup of the latest news and comment. In the meantime, keep up to date on the Global development website.
