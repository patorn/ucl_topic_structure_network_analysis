  "body": "I learned only recently that Charlotte Bronte is a masterful writer. She crafted the story of Jane Eyre, a tale following young, abused Jane, through her experiences in school, then as a governess, and finally as a young independent women. As the story progresses, Ms. Bronte introduces a series of characters (Rochester, Helen Burns, Blanche Ingrim, St. John River, etc.) that also affect Jane\u2019s life and kind of get the ball rolling for her character growth.  So much happened in this book to fit into a little biased box that is a review, but I can say that overall, I loved Jane Eyre. At first I was struck most by Bronte\u2019s writing style, which is eloquent and beautiful, but then the storyline caught up with me and I fell in love with that too.       For me, the best part of the story was the beginning, when Jane is at Lowood School and defining herself as a person. The book could have ended there, but then Jane went to live with the horrible, horrible Rochester. To say the least, I hated him. He probably had some redeemable qualities, but I didn\u2019t see them. As I read the story, I physically cringed ever time he was in a scene\u2026. But the writing won out and I finished the book and am happy I did because Jane\u2019s growth overpowers any hatred of Rochester (even my burning enmity). Unfortunately, at times the profound language of the book was difficult to get through and I found myself trudging through the words rather than letting them carry me away. And sometimes the story grew very gloomy and creepy (ahem, Bertha Mason).  This book is definitely a commitment so if you have a fear of long books or thoughtful language, you might want to watch the movie instead. However, this classic book is really worth reading just for Jane and you should know that if you feel that Rochester is a conniving, disgusting, ridiculous, jerky playboy, you are not alone.    Related: How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?    I would give this tome a 4.3/5 rating. I know, a little specific, but I really loved the book overall and only disliked how overburdened the language was at times and the actions of some of the characters (specifically one whose name starts with R and ends with -ochester). Also, I was really only completely hooked by the story in the beginning and the rest I had to get into much slower.
