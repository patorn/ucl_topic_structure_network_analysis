  "body": "It is not unusual for Anthony D\u2019Argenzio to remove a painting from his apartment wall and take it to work with him. He is a prop stylist for photography shoots and creative events, and his home doubles as a prop store. That\u2019s not to say it is a collection of random junk. The tiny New York apartment is a carefully curated tableau with everything designed and placed to create a visual statement. Throughout his living space, props repeatedly lend themselves to decoration. An old wooden ladder hangs horizontally above the kitchen shelves. As you enter the hallway, two slim reclaimed windowpanes are fixed either side of the wall, because he likes the way they look. D\u2019Argenzio is creative director of photographic styling agency Zio & Sons, and his most used item from home is a small still life oil painting of tangerines. He picks these things up on his travels, at flea markets and at regular visits to the stylists\u2019 mecca Brimfield Antique Show in Massachusetts. \u201cIt\u2019s where Soho House and Ralph Lauren send huge teams of buyers,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ll buy all the Chesterfields or all the trunks and then put them in storage until they need them.\u201d Just down the street from his home, D\u2019Argenzio has studio space where he houses the majority of his own prop collection. He lives in his one-bedroom Alphabet City apartment with his wife, Hillary, and their dog, Sabra. It\u2019s part of a co-operative they bought three years ago from a \u201cPuerto Rican grandma\u201d who had a fondness for curtain swags and pink. \u201cAll the rooms had been boxed out in the 80s and were really small,\u201d he remembers. One of the first things he did when they moved into the apartment was to remove the dry wall and expose the brick behind it, adding 25cm to the perimeter of each of the rooms.     Creating space: a coffee table slides away to create a bigger living area. Photograph: Marili Forastieri    The whitewashed walls stand out. \u201cIt was dirty brick when we first revealed them,\u201d he says. \u201cKind of tarred and black.\u201d He transformed them by mixing paint and water \u2013 at a ratio of four to one \u2013 to get a milky consistency, and applied it with a sponge for mottled coverage. Similarly, he tackled the yellowed wooden floors by bleaching and roughly whitewashing them. Textures are central to D\u2019Argenzio\u2019s look. Against one of the bumpy walls sits a smooth, plump navy sofa. To disguise a hot water pipe he tightly wound it in rope. \u201cThat took about 300ft of different types of rope and a month of winding and gluing,\u201d he recalls. It\u2019s no mistake that there\u2019s a nautical feel to the place with its whites, blues and wood. \u201cWhen I was doing the design, I didn\u2019t want it to feel as if you were in New York City,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted it to be more like a little beach shack.\u201d     Colour pop: plants and carefully collected items of crockery add areas of interest to the living room. Photograph: Marili Forastieri    It\u2019s this mix of textures that gives depth to his small open-plan kitchen. The small breakfast bar is made of reclaimed wood from an old church. He constructed a copper pot rack out of piece of piping that he found at a hardware shop. The original wooden under-counter cabinets have been painted, finished with new handles and topped with a slab of salvaged marble which D\u2019Argenzio found for $100. Even the ceiling is lined with panels of tongue-and-groove board. D\u2019Argenzio replaced the original upper wall cabinets with open shelves. As well as allowing more light in the space, his cooking objects and crockery became display items, offset against walls finished with an oversized subway tile. In the lounge, the emphasis is on transformative space saving. When guests come for dinner, a drop-down desk closes and a folding dining table opens. A coffee table slides under a built-in storage unit stacked with trinkets (\u201cMy wife says I have too many tchotchkes.\u201d) The anomaly is the massive sofa. \u201cWe thought, if you\u2019re going to be in a small space, you might as well fill the area with something comfortable for people to sit on.\u201d And that\u2019s where the attraction of the space lies \u2013in comfort. D\u2019Argenzio\u2019s aim of creating a space that takes you away from the city has been achieved. Sinking into the big blue couch, you\u2019ve got all the beauty of a well-designed photography set with the relaxed vibe of a beach shack.",
