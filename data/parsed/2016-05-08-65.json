  "body": "On his last day in office as chairman of Channel 4, Lord Burns told listeners to BBC Radio 4\u2019s The Media Show that \u201cyou can have the Channel 4 remit, or you can have privatisation, but you cannot have both\u201d. Yet there is abundant evidence that this is not a binary choice between content and paying dividends to shareholders. The kind of situation where new shareholders require large dividends is typically a private equity transaction. If one thing is certain in this whole affair, it is that there will not be a sale to private equity.But a sale only makes sense to an existing media player \u2013 one that can extract synergies and savings from ownership of Channel 4. The scale of savings that might be achieved by a buyer such as Sky, Viacom (owner of Channel 5), Discovery or Liberty Global (owner of Virgin Media) must easily run to \u00a3200m a year. The formula so often used by leaders of Channel 4 \u2013 that we make a valuable contribution to the creative economy \u201cat zero cost to the taxpayer\u201d \u2013 is simply wrong. Allowing that \u00a3200m to go begging every year, when public service broadcasting is in long term decline, cannot be the right answer. The issue with Channel 4 is not privatisation, but how to enhance its central public service broadcasting role. Since 2003, Ofcom has charted a steady decline in the delivery of public service content and of originated programming, without ever suggesting how this depressing trend might be reversed. As far as Channel 4 is concerned the main changes by Ofcom have been to loosen public service obligations, not tighten them. The most recent requirements introduced in 2010 for Channel 4 to make a \u201cstatement of media policy\u201d offer no established measure of success, nor any prescribed penalty for failure. The tests for whether they are being met are devised by Channel 4 itself, and presently show commendable achievement. But if these \u2013 or other \u2013 tests showed lesser success, or even failure, there is no provision for any remedial action. The requirement is to state the aspirations, not fulfil them in an objective fashion. Channel 4\u2019s portfolio of channels are nominally part of the Channel 4 remit, which \u2018applies across all services and genres\u2019. But the fact is that anything recognisably public service about Channel 4\u2019s output is almost exclusively confined to the main channel. If there is to be a sale process, Ofcom \u2013 and especially its content board \u2013 needs to be meaningfully strengthened, so that any new remit can be vigorously enforced. If Channel 4 can survive \u2013 even thrive \u2013 indefinitely in public ownership, thanks to a weak remit, then it is all the harder to justify leaving money, and a stronger remit, \u201con the table\u201d, unrealised.
