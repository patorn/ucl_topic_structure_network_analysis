They work with buildings, which are generally large, expensive, long-lived and important to life, but it\u2019s not always obvious what is significant about the specifically architectural aspect of their work \u2013 the refinements and rearrangements to the functional object that might otherwise come into being without architects\u2019 help. If they have some influence over large budgets, it is developers or politicians who usually make the real decisions. At best, an architect can be like a jockey on a horse. Often, he or she is more like the groom, who puts nice plaits in its mane and tail. They\u2019re also open to accusations of self-indulgence, of hijacking commissions to fulfil their creative whim, never more than in the age of \u201ciconic\u201d architecture that may or may not be now coming to an end. Hence the appeal of what is sometimes called \u201chumanitarian architecture\u201d, where architects apply their skills to helping people in disaster zones or suffering extreme need. What, indeed, could be more useful than helping in such situations? Nothing, as long as the architects really are helping. Otherwise they are only taking their self-indulgence to a higher level, at the expense of people least able to afford it.    The Polish pavilion concentrates not on architects but on the construction workers for which the country is famous    Such issues are raised, if not completely answered, by this year\u2019s edition of the Venice architecture biennale, the world\u2019s biggest exhibition of architecture. Under the slightly sententious title of Reporting from the Front, it aims, says its Chilean director Alejandro Aravena, to explore \u201cthe social, political, economic and environmental end of the spectrum\u201d. It is not the first time that the biennale has declared a social purpose, but the idea is pursued more vigorously than before. There is a display on the water tanks in Medellin, Colombia, that once stood in fenced-off areas of grass around which settlements grew up, now opened up into public oases. The Indian architect Anupama Kundoo has built a mock-up of her Full Fill Home, which uses hollow blocks of ferrocement to achieve \u201cspeedy and affordable housing units that have low environmental impact\u201d. Wang Shu and Lu Wenyu show beautiful panels of brick and tile as part of their campaign to support traditional rural techniques, by using them on a new museum in the city of Fuyang.

Using a combination of high and low technology, the ports are to be vaulted structures in bricks made out of local earth, which can be built at least partly with local labour. In Venice he and his team are demonstrating how they will be built. One of the most memorable displays is in a tent-like structure created by the German architect Manuel Herz and the National Union of Sahrawi Women. With a combination of photographs, maps and specially woven tapestries, it shows the camps in Algeria created by refugees from Western Sahara since its occupation by Morocco in 1975. Here, says Herz, they have created \u201ca place of emancipation and self-governance, truly democratic, and not a place of misery\u201d. The institutions of society \u2013 ministries, a parliament, schools \u2013 are housed in buildings that, despite their rough building techniques, are planned with \u201cincredible beauty\u201d.

The \u201cfront\u201d he describes is any situation in which an architect can deflect or guide the forces that go into buildings and places such that they have a greater public benefit. It can mean the conversion of expanses of landfill into parks by the Catalan architects Batlle i Roig. The Portuguese Eduardo Souto de Moura shows how he was asked to modify a youthful work of his, a market in the city of Braga, into a completely new use as a dance and arts centre. Heroically, he was prepared to rip the roof off his early masterpiece and leave it as a part ruin. The biennale consists of distinct elements. There are the huge 16th-century corderie, or ropeworks, of the Arsenale and a large central pavilion in the gardens dedicated to the biennale: in both venues the director chooses the content. The gardens also contain national pavilions where individual countries interpret his theme as they see fit. Among these is the British pavilion where the young curators respond to housing need by proposing new ways of living in homes. Their concepts are strong and their installation elegant, although the latter does not always connect perfectly with the former. The Polish pavilion concentrates not on architects but on the construction workers for which the country is famous, and on the pressures and dangers of their lives.

In the urge to do good, or to be seen to do good, architects can forget their skills of making spaces and buildings that are desirable to inhabit. But the biennale includes some corrective installations, for example by the venerable Portuguese \u00c1lvaro Siza and the Chilean Pezo von Ellrichshausen, that are simply about enclosing spaces and capturing light in delightful ways. It is not clear how they fit the curatorial theme, but they enrich the show. The strongest exhibit combines constructional wonder with the possibility of usefulness: under the title of Beyond Bending, the Block Research Group of Zurich construct beautiful and delicate vaults that update traditional techniques and economise on building materials. The weakest is called Matrex, its inclusion inexplicable, a mixed-use building for the Skolkovo business zone near Moscow. For symbolic reasons not worth repeating, it chooses to insert the shape of a multistorey matryoshka doll into a pyramidal exterior, a model of which is then displayed with intrusive blue lights and buzzing noises.    If the biennale offers no more than suggestions, they are nonetheless engaging, enriching and sometimes enlightening    There are many pitfalls in a project such as this year\u2019s biennale, not all of which are avoided. The voices of the people in whose name much of the work is done tend to be in the background, except in films where they express their gratitude and happiness for the results. Poverty and informal construction can be sentimentalised, romanticised and patronised, sometimes made into aesthetic of brownness and low droning music. At its worst, the biennale can look like a Fairtrade garden furniture shop. Truly terrible captioning \u2013 badly lit, small type, obscure wording \u2013 doesn\u2019t help. Ultimately, none of the work on show is verifiable, at least in the context of the biennale. Any form of intervention has social and economic ramifications \u2013 well-meaning volunteer work, for example, might put local builders out of business \u2013 and it takes knowledge of each and every situation to know whether interesting-sounding proposals for water-gathering towers in Africa or for helping crime-ravaged parts of Mexico will have the effect they promise. The Venezuelan pavilion shows small community projects sponsored by the same government under whom the economy is currently tanking, which makes you wonder if the former are a poor substitute for fixing the latter. The biennale is therefore a series of suggestions as to what might be a good idea, rather than evidence of actions that work.     A Block Research Group vault. Photograph: La Biennale di Venezia    Sometimes the benefit might flow less from architects to the poor than in the opposite direction. Low-cost, low-technology construction returns architecture to its roots, of laying one block on another by hand, and making best use of light and climate. In an age otherwise dominated by mechanised and impersonal building processes, it enables you to see in a finished structure the story of its making. If the biennale offers no more than suggestions, they are nonetheless engaging, enriching and sometimes enlightening. Compared with previous more Eurocentric biennales, it presents a realigned perspective of the world of architecture, in which Latin America, Asia and Africa take their rightful place. Although the big old names of architecture are still there, a substantially new cast of creative characters is offered. It feels like a new world.",
