Adolescent boys and young men between the ages of 12 and 24 were found to be most at risk, along with children and young adults not in education, internally displaced people and refugees without supportive family structures.   Related: UN demands protection for war zone hospitals after 'epidemic of attacks'    Interviews with more than 300 young Syrians \u2013 in Syria, Lebanon and Turkey \u2013 point to factors of both vulnerability and resilience to recruitment by Isis and Jabhat al-Nusra (al-Qaida\u2019s Syrian affiliate), which are both proscribed as terrorist organisations by the UN. \u201cRadicalisation is not an explanation for joining a violent extremist group per se,\u201d said the study by International Alert (pdf). \u201cFor many young Syrians, belief in extreme ideologies appears to be, at most, a secondary factor in the initial decision to join an extremist group. Religion is providing a moral medium for coping and justification for fighting, rather than a basis for rigid and extreme ideologies.\u201d Vulnerability is driven by a combination of extreme trauma, loss and displacement, lack of alternative ways to make a decent living, the collapse of social structures and institutions, including education, and the desire to take revenge against the regime of President Bashar al-Assad, the report says. Its findings about the causes of extremism are broadly in line with a recent wider survey of Arab youth, which situated the causes of radicalisation in a lack of jobs and opportunities. In eight of the 16 countries surveyed, employment problems were a bigger pull factor for Isis than extreme religious views. Young Syrian men also said that joining armed groups provides a strong sense of purpose, honour and self-worth \u2013 \u201ca new life where they are wanted\u201d. Economic imperatives explained why individuals have switched membership and allegiance based on salaries, resources and the regularity of payment. Fighting for an extremist group is normally far more lucrative than fighting for a moderate one. Nusra fighters are paid $300\u2013400 (\u00a3205-275) per month. Fighters in the Free Syrian Army are paid only \u2013 and often late \u2013 about $100 per month. In the words of one interviewee: \u201cAn 18-year-old guy I met was fighting with the Free Syrian Army \u2026 After two days of fighting, his unit ran out of ammunition. For two further days, he remained there, waiting to be hit by Syrian regime forces. He then managed to escape his unit, went over to Jabhat al-Nusra\u2019s territory and [the group] offered him ammunition and a salary to fight for [it]. He didn\u2019t believe in [its] ideology but [it] had the bullets.\u201d Nusra had been more successful than Isis in establishing itself as a \u201cquasi-legitimate, community-based organisation providing relative security, protection, education and structure on a daily basis\u201d, the survey found. But trauma played an important role in extremist recruitment \u2013 one young man joined Isis after being raped and tortured in a regime prison. A friend described him as now being \u201ccompletely brainwashed\u201d. The report shows that the collapse of Syria\u2019s education system, with about 2 million children now out of school, has also greatly contributed to young people\u2019s vulnerability to joining violent extremist groups, which are filling the gap by providing segregated and sectarian teaching. Comprehensive, inclusive and quality education, including trauma healing and psychosocial support \u2013 such as that being implemented through International Alert\u2019s peace education project in Syria and the region \u2013 was one of the four key factors that could prevent recruitment. \u201cIn Syria, children who aren\u2019t engaged in [psychosocial support] like this are so vulnerable \u2026 they could be directly recruited by Daesh [Isis] or al-Nusra,\u201d said one peace educator in Lebanon. \u201cWe give them tools to express themselves in the community, rather than using weapons to express anger at their losses.\u201d Other preventive factors included providing alternative and respected sources of livelihood, access to supportive social networks and alternative avenues for non-violent activism. The conflict in Syria erupted at the height of the Arab spring in March 2011. It has claimed up to 400,000 lives and displaced 6.6 million people internally and prompted 4.8 million more to flee the country.",
