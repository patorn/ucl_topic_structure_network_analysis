Or you could choose a broader approach, addressing one of our categories by detailing ongoing work.  To enter, simply complete the online entry form. Ensure you fill in every box. Additional/support material Please do not send any additional material with your entry at this stage. If your organisation is selected for the shortlist, you may be asked to provide a supporting statement, a set of financial accounts and optional promotional material where appropriate.  If your application is shortlisted, a limit of three promotional items may be sent. The Guardian and its advisers may request additional information if necessary to meet judging criteria. All material is generally non-returnable. Pointers It is important that your entry is clear, concise and in the appropriate category. Think hard about how you can grab the judges\u2019 attention by making your entry stand out. Judges will be looking for clear evidence of teamwork, an ambition for improvement and demonstrable impact.  This last point is especially important: if you cannot quantify any change, you must seek to demonstrate it in qualitative terms. In your submission, you should clearly outline the aims of your scheme, problems faced, solutions and subsequent benefits. Remember some element of the project or initiative entered must have taken place between 9 July 2015 and 8 July 2016.
