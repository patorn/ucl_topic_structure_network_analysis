This week the Melbourne fashion label Misha closed their Australian Fashion Week show with models walking to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s black power anthem Formation. On a video clip posted to Instagram by IMG Models, users howled with outrage that none of the models shown were black; indeed, most appeared to be white.   Related: Beyonc\u00e9's Formation reclaims black America's narrative from the margins | Syreeta McFadden    With its almost war cry-like chorus (\u201cOkay ladies, now let\u2019s get in formation, cause I slay\u201d), Formation is an intensely political track and affirmation of black womanhood, and its video contains a litany of black cultural and political references, including nods to the #BlackLivesMatter movement and 2005\u2019s Hurricane Katrina. In other words, it is not a song to be used lightly, or without an awareness of what it signifies \u2013 particularly at this point in the cultural conversation. And when you use models that are all cut from the same pale and slender cloth, it becomes an insult to a song that, in part, rallies against that very beauty convention (\u201cI like my baby heir with baby hair and afros / I like my negro nose with Jackson Five nostrils\u201d).       As the Indigenous Australian choreographer Amrita Hepi said in a post on Facebook addressed to Australian Fashion Week: \u201cIf you want to take from all of the subcultures and exoticism of minorities how\u2019s about you at least put them in your shows? \u2013 don\u2019t tell me you tried. TRY HARDER.  \u201c\u202a#\u200embfwa\u202c show me the real Australia. It\u2019s better looking and browner and more unbinary and interesting than you think.\u201d   Related: Why Beyonc\u00e9 can never leave her blackness at the door - Token podcast    Fashion has always been one of the worst offenders of cultural appropriation \u2013 up there with music, of course, with Beyonc\u00e9 herself guilty of Indian cultural appropriation in her collaboration with Coldplay, Hymn for the Weekend. Also see: Native American headdresses at music festivals, Justin Bieber\u2019s dreadlocks, Chola-style and the Diesel ad featuring a niqab, just to name a few. A recent documentary, The First Monday in May, lifts the curtain on the making of an exhibition by the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Costume Institute called China: Through the Looking Glass and its 2015 launch at the Met Gala. The superficial exoticism through which the vast majority of the showcased designers engaged with the country became crystal clear when one admitted he drew inspiration from a \u201cpostcard version\u201d of China as presented by film-makers like Wong Kar-wai and, with a naughty twinkle in his eye, said that drawing from this fantasy version was better than actually visiting the country. Respectful cultural appreciation \u2013 as opposed to appropriation \u2013 is possible; one could argue it even has the potential to bring us more interesting and profound fashion concepts. Interrupt Mag posted an excellent guide to wading through these tricky waters but, in short, it requires asking careful questions throughout one\u2019s design process: what culture does this style reference, and what is my relation to that culture? Why have I chosen to reference this culture? Have I done so aware of its political and historical context? How will my work impact the community I am referencing? As an industry, fashion sits uneasily between art and commerce. If a designer trades on lazy stereotypes or uses politically charged symbols as mere window dressing to their work, it might make for excellent sales figures but let\u2019s not kid ourselves that they\u2019re making art. And while cultural insensitivity is hardly a uniquely Australian trait, when you\u2019re as multicultural as we are and carry the trauma of colonialism, there should be aspiration to something greater.",
