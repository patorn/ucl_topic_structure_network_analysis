The summit, which will be held in Istanbul, has been billed as an opportunity for the international community to end \u201cthe greatest humanitarian crisis of our lifetime\u201d.  About 5,000 people, including political and business leaders, aid organisations and civil society groups, are expected to attend the UN-backed event in a bid to \u201creinspire and reinvigorate a commitment to humanity and to the universality of humanitarian principles\u201d.   Related: How do we make life better for people living as refugees for generations? | Laurie Lee    But, in a damning assessment of the summit\u2019s validity and effectiveness, MSF has announced its intention to withdraw because it does not believe the conference has any chance of achieving its lofty aims. \u201cWe no longer have any hope that the WHS will address the weaknesses in humanitarian action and emergency response, particularly in conflict areas or epidemic situations,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cInstead, the WHS\u2019s focus would seem to be an incorporation of humanitarian assistance into a broader development and resilience agenda. Further, the summit neglects to reinforce the obligations of states to uphold and implement the humanitarian and refugee laws which they have signed up to.\u201d MSF has been bitterly critical of the international community\u2019s failure to respect humanitarian law as its hospitals, staff and patients in warzones have been repeatedly targeted over the past two years. The organisation said it was simply not confident that the summit would address the issue. \u201cAs shocking violations of international humanitarian law and refugee rights continue on a daily basis, WHS participants will be pressed to a consensus on non-specific, good intentions to \u2018uphold norms\u2019 and \u2018end needs\u2019,\u201d it said. \u201cThe summit has become a fig-leaf of good intentions, allowing these systematic violations, by states above all, to be ignored.\u201d The charity said it was particularly troubled by the decision to ask all participants \u2013 whether NGOs, UN agencies or states \u2013 to sign up to such commitments as it would, in effect, minimise the responsibility of governments. \u201cIn addition, the non-binding nature of the commitments means that very few actors will sign up to any commitments they haven\u2019t previously committed to.\u201d MSF said it could not see how talk of \u201cdoing aid differently\u201d and \u201cending need\u201d would do anything to address the dangers its staff and patients have faced in Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen and South Sudan. Nor did it understand what the summit would do to help refugees in Jordan, Turkey, Macedonia, Greece and Australia.  The NGO, which was among the first to warn the world of the scale of the Ebola epidemic in parts of west Africa, said it did not think the summit would do enough to address the \u201cserious gaps\u201d it faced when trying to respond to the outbreak. It was a similar story \u2013 albeit on a smaller scale \u2013 when it came to the current yellow fever epidemic in Angola, the heavy restrictions placed by some countries on humanitarian access, and the \u201ccontinuing lack of effective mobilisation\u201d in the face of recurring disease outbreaks in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The organisation added: \u201cIn all of these situations, the responsibilities of states in their making, and the diminished capacity of the humanitarian system to respond, causing yet more suffering and death, will go unaddressed.\u201d Earlier this week, the UN security council unanimously adopted a resolution intended to protect hospitals, medical professionals and patients from what MSF had termed \u201can epidemic of attacks\u201d on health facilities in conflict areas. The resolution, which was drafted by New Zealand, Spain, Egypt, Japan and Uruguay, and adopted on Tuesday, came days after 55 people died when an MSF-supported hospital was bombed in the Syrian city of Aleppo.",
