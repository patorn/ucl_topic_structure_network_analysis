  "body": "Floyd Mayweather has hinted that he may consider a return to the ring despite retiring from boxing last September.\u00a0 In an interview with Showtime on Saturday, Mayweather said he was content in retirement but had received \u201ccrazy\u201d offers to fight again.\u00a0\u201cEveryone is asking me, \u2018Is Floyd Mayweather coming back?\u2019\u201d Mayweather said. \u201cRight now, I\u2019m happy being on this side [promoting fights], but I\u2019ve been talking with CBS and Showtime, and you just never know. But right now, I\u2019m just happy on this side.\u201d Mayweather was then asked what kind of purse would be required for him to return.\u00a0\u201cAs of right now, some crazy numbers have been thrown my way \u2013 upwards, of course, of nine figures,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I\u2019m truly blessed beyond belief, and I really don\u2019t know what we\u2019re going to do. But right now, I\u2019m really happy being on this side helping our fighters.\u201d   Related: Andre Berto rallies for fourth-round TKO of Victor Ortiz to avenge 2011 loss    The most popular match-up for Mayweather would be the undefeated middleweight champion\u00a0Gennady Golovkin, who many consider to be the world\u2019s best pound-for-pound fighter. But Mayweather has never fought at Golovkin\u2019s weight and said that if he was to come out of retirement it is unlikely it would be against the Kazakh fighter.\u00a0 \u201cI think that it\u2019s best that [Golovkin] go up and fight Andre Ward,\u201d Mayweather said. \u201cI think that would be a good fight for Triple G and Andre Ward. How can Floyd Mayweather fight at 160lbs when I can never even make 154?\u201d Mayweather retired with an unbeaten 49-0 record.",
