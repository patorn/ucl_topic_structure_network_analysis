  "body": "\u2022 An article about the possibility of women serving as deacons in the Catholic church said deacons could say mass, but were barred from giving communion. In fact it is the other way round: a deacon cannot say mass, but can distribute communion. The article went on to say that when the Catholic church reinstated the diaconate as a permanent office in the 1960s it restricted the role to \u201cmature married men\u201d over 35. Rather than restricting the role to those men, it said it could be open to them (Pope floats idea of appointing female deacons, 13 May, page 19). \u2022 A report about Andy Murray winning the Rome Masters singles title said it was the first time a British player had done so since 1931. To clarify, Murray\u2019s win was the first by a British player since 1971, when Virginia Wade beat Helga Niessen Masthoff. It was the first by a British man since 1931 (Murray ready for Paris after making the most of Djokovic\u2019s agitation in Rome, 16 May, page 10, Sport). \u2022 Homophone corner: \u201cWe meet Ben Pennington, a geoarchaeologist who, with young Egyptian trainees, is sinking an augur nine metres below the surface in order to glean information about the area\u2019s ancient topography and environment\u201d (Up from the depths, 16 May, page 16, G2). \u2022 Other recently corrected articles include: Cuba Gooding Jr on OJ Simpson: \u2018It could have been me in that Bronco\u2019",
