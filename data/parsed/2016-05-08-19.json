  "body": "Those who do not learn from their recent history are doomed to be relegated from the Premier League twice in a row. Two years ago Norwich went down because of inadequate recruitment and they are close to sinking this season for the same reason. To survive Norwich need other results to go in their favour and to win both of their remaining matches, which does not look likely given that they have failed to score in their last four, including this one against a vulnerable Manchester United. How Norwich must rue their repeated failure to invest properly, especially in forwards. Two years ago, when Chris Hughton was manager, they spent a club-record fee on the Dutch striker Ricky van Wolfswinkel and also bought Gary Hooper but neither succeeded, especially not the former, and Norwich were demoted as the lowest scorers in the top flight.   Related: Manchester United\u2019s Juan Mata leaves Norwich City in relegation zone    This season their impotence up front has again cost them, a fact that Cameron Jerome and Dieumerci Mbokani underlined by fluffing clear chances against United. At least those two were considered worthy of a place on the pitch whereas Steven Naismith, the man signed from Everton for \u00a38.5m in January to repair the club\u2019s attacking problems, remained an unused substitute, which spoke volumes about his ineffectiveness. Alex Neil said he omitted Naismith for tactical reasons \u2013 Jerome is faster and Wes Hoolahan works well with him \u2013 but acknowledged that the club would have been in a stronger position if they had recruited more since wining promotion through the Championship play-offs last season. \u201cThere has been a whole host of reasons why that hasn\u2019t been the case,\u201d said the Scot. \u201cWe were last to go up, through the play-offs, and the recruitment team needed to be put together a bit more than what it was, so that wasn\u2019t fully functioning in the way it should\u2019ve been. And there have been players we\u2019ve tried to attract that ultimately we didn\u2019t manage to get. If you combine all those reasons we found ourselves in a situation where we didn\u2019t add as many as we\u2019d have liked.\u201d The forwards\u2019 quality is not high and, what is more, their confidence seems low. Neil seems exasperated. \u201cHow do you give people confidence?\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t put the ball in the net for them.\u201d One area that Norwich have managed to strengthen this season is central defence, where Timm Klose brought solidity after joining in January. But the Swiss has been injured for the last month and Neil has been forced to resort to defenders who were relegated two years ago. It has shown. A misjudgment by S\u00e9bastien Bassong allowed Wayne Rooney to tee up Juan Mata for United\u2019s winning goal. Louis van Gaal\u2019s team thus edged closer to a top-four finish despite being deprived of the pace and thrust of Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial. The former was rested before Tuesday\u2019s visit to West Ham, while Martial suffered a muscular injury in the warm-up and is a doubt for that match. Without those youngsters United produced a plodding performance, although midfielder Ander Herrera said that was partially due to the heat. \u201cIt was similar to southern Spain,\u201d said Herrera. \u201cIt was so tough I couldn\u2019t speak with my team-mates because my mouth was so dry.\u201d In May 2013 Herrera was part of the Athletic Bilbao team that bid farewell to the Sam Mam\u00e9s Stadium, the club\u2019s home for a century. That experience tells him that United should expect an intense occasion on Tuesday, West Ham\u2019s final match at Upton Park. \u201cIt is going to be very special for them and their fans but we have to show we are playing for something very, very important,\u201d said Herrera, whose Bilbao team were beaten 1-0 by Levante on that emotional day two years ago. \u201cHopefully [West Ham] won\u2019t enjoy their last game,\u201d he said.
