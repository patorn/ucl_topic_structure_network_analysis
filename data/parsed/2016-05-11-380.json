  "body": "The West Virginia and Nebraska primaries have come and gone. Here\u2019s what happened:  Bernie Sanders cruised to victory over Hillary Clinton in West Virginia, while on the Republican side Donald Trump won big in both states.  Sanders was estimated to have netted about three delegates, while Trump picked up closer to 60 in his pair of wins. Trump is now about 100 delegates away from a 1,237 majority; his last opponents, Ted Cruz and John Kasich, dropped out of the race last week. Sanders said: \u201cWe are in this campaign to win the Democratic presidential nomination ... Now we fully acknowledge \u2013 we are good at arithmetic \u2013 that we have an uphill climb ahead of us. But we are used to fighting uphill climbs.\u201d  The Clinton camp was quiet. Up next are contests in Oregon, where Clinton has recently polled ahead of Sanders, and Kentucky. Trump hailed his victories \u201cby such massive margins\u201d and called the wins \u201ca great honor\u201d.  Here\u2019s how the delegate race stands on the Democratic side:   Democratic delegates   Here\u2019s how the delegate race stands on the Republican side:   Republican delegates   Nebraska Democrats were also able to vote in a primary tonight, but it did not count, because Nebraska Democrats already held a caucus that did count, in March. Sanders won the caucus. But Clinton \u201cwon\u201d the primary:    Clinton, in purple, won Nebraska primary (up 58-42). Sanders, in green, won caucus, 58-42.
