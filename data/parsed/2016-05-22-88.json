However, the theatrical establishment did nothing to acknowledge Edward Bond reaching 80 in 2014, nor was there a revival to mark the passing last year of five decades since the electrifying premiere of Saved, his tragedy about disaffected youth. And although Bond\u2019s Bingo is probably the best biographical play about Shakespeare, it failed to feature in the epic death quadricentennial commemorations by the Royal Shakespeare Company and the BBC.   Related: Torture and baby-stonings: why we need shock theatre ... in small doses    So is Bond bitter about his treatment by British theatre? \u201cNo!\u201d he insists. \u201cI\u2019m far too busy.\u201d In Rome, there is a new production of Lear, his 1971 variation on Shakespeare, and another work from the same period, The Sea \u2013 a weird comedy of beachside goings-on \u2013 has become a hit at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise in Paris. Currently, Bond is working with the composer Laura Jayne Bowler on an opera based on his play Early Morning \u2013 censored in 1968 for depicting Queen Victoria as a cannibal lesbian in love with Florence Nightingale \u2013 and is directing Dea at the Secombe theatre in Sutton, his first play (apart from pieces for teenagers) to be premiered in the UK for two decades. There might be some surprise at this work turning up in a suburban theatre named after the comedian and religious broadcaster Sir Harry Secombe, but Bond claims not to be craving the facilities of his earlier patrons, the National Theatre, the RSC and the Royal Court. \u201cIf they did one of my plays, it would be rubbish,\u201d he says. Why? \u201cBecause they wouldn\u2019t understand it.\u201d The problem with British theatre, says Bond, is that \u201cat the moment, we don\u2019t have any drama. That\u2019s really frightening. It\u2019s all been taken over by the Hollywood entertainment industry.\u201d     Marianne Faithfull and Moira Redmond in Bond\u2019s Early Morning at the Royal Court in 1968    But wouldn\u2019t the NT, RSC, Royal Court and West End say that we do have quite a lot of drama? \u201cNo. Not for one second. Take the last guy who ran the National Theatre. I don\u2019t know his name \u2026\u201d Sir Nicholas Hytner? \u201cWas it him? Puppets? Was he the puppets one?\u201d This seems to be a reference to War Horse, adapted from Michael Morpurgo\u2019s novel, which ran for two years at the National, seven in the West End and is now touring the UK. \u201cYes. That was an obscenity. Black Beauty goes to war. What is wrong with our society? That is obscene! And it goes around the world.\u201d Why is it obscene? \u201cWar makes bodies. It\u2019s hard on the horses, of course. But it\u2019s harder on human beings.\u201d Apart from his open contempt for its repertoire, British theatre may also be put off by Bond\u2019s reputation as a testing collaborator. After some of the anecdotes that circulate \u2013 more Blofeld than Bond \u2013 it\u2019s a surprise not to find him sinisterly stroking a white cat as he sits in the Secombe\u2019s bar. \u201cLook,\u201d he politely protests, \u201cI have this reputation of getting very angry in rehearsals. I promise you that I never ever do, really. What I may do, when a director is working on one of my plays, is say: \u2018But that doesn\u2019t make any sense!\u2019 And then it\u2019s the director who gets very, very angry.\u201d Bond admits to having walked out of two London revivals of The Sea because \u201cthey were so boring. It\u2019s supposed to be a funny play. So I got in my car and went.\u201d The director of one spurned interpretation pursued Bond up the A1 to his home in Cambridge, in a sort of dramaturgical car chase, but the playwright refused to return.     \u2018Drama has to push things to extremes\u2019 \u2026 Bond, centre, with Edward Avison-Scott and Helen Bang at rehearsals for Dea. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    There can be no such disagreement at Sutton, because Bond himself is directing Dea. The play is named after a central character who shares three of the letters and much of the biography of Medea \u2013 who, in the Greek tragedy by Euripides, murders her children as an act of revenge against her adulterous husband, Jason. Bond\u2019s version deals more directly than the original with the pursuit of power \u2013 \u201cThe play is very concerned with political ambitions. Jason wants to get to No 10\u201d \u2013 but he is also keen that audiences should not be able to dismiss the infanticide as something that happened once in ancient Greece. \u201cPeople see Medea as shocking because a woman kills her children. But we\u2019re quite happy to send our children off to war,\u201d he argues. \u201cAnd a child is killed in a home once a week in England. I think I read that, but can that be really be right?\u201d (I checked later. The most recent figures from the government\u2019s Child Death Oversight Panel attributed 60 fatalities a year to \u201cdeliberate harm, abuse or neglect\u201d.)     The stoning scene in Saved at the Royal Court in 1969. Photograph: Donald Cooper/Photostage    Five decades after the simulated stoning to death of a baby in a pram caused scandalised reaction at the Royal Court, Sutton may also be in for some fuss. Apart from the Euripidean child-killing, Dea includes two brutal rape scenes, one of them necrophiliac, and a mother giving fellatio to her son. Bond, though, is shocked at the suggestion that he sets out to challenge or appalaudiences. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t occur to me for one moment as I write that a scene is shocking. I\u2019m just pursuing the logic of a situation \u2013 only ever that. I think drama has to push things to extremes so that we can understand what we are doing in our society.\u201d Scenes in Greek tragedies that were once regarded as unimaginable now seem increasingly recognisable to our era, Bond feels. He thinks that Antigone by Sophocles \u201cwas the key play for the last century. Because it\u2019s all to do with dictators and obedience to orders. But our play for this century is Medea. It involves much more profound questions for us: what does it mean to be human and how do we build a society?\u201d     \u2018Spitefully patronising\u2019 \u2026 Bond on Downtown Abbey. Photograph: Nick Briggs/ITV Plc    Some people believe that the best drama is now on TV. So has Bond tried Line of Duty, Happy Valley, or Breaking Bad? These titles seem to spark no recognition, although he then unexpectedly offers: \u201cI\u2019ve watched Downton Abbey. I watched one and was so fascinated that I had to watch another.\u201d What drew him back? \u201cTo be exact: it was spitefully patronising, and I found that fascinating. No, I don\u2019t think TV is the place for drama. If you were really writing about the times we live in, they wouldn\u2019t put it on television.\u201d   Related: Best of Bond    If the writer\u2019s views on War Horse and Downton Abbey are what might be expected from a theatrical radical, his attitude on one issue is surprising. Asked about his personal ideology, Bond replies: \u201cI regard myself as a socialist. I have always voted for Labour.\u201d Including three times for Tony Blair? \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d So Bond, a lifelong pacifist, voted for Blair, even after the Iraq war? \u201cYes. I don\u2019t think we understand the Iraq war yet. Harold Pinter thought Blair should be tried as a war criminal. Whatever the situation is in the Middle East now, it was an inevitable crisis then. The real war criminals were probably in the 18th and 19th century, colonists taking over these places. To blame Blair for everything that happened is not to understand the seriousness of politics.\u201d After Sutton, Dea will be seen in France, where Bond is as hymned as he is ignored in Britain, and he is already working on a play that addresses what he feels to be \u201cunanswered questions\u201d in Shakespeare\u2019s tragedies. He expects it to be savagely satirical. Returning to rehearsal, he says: \u201cOur society is so absurd that I sometimes feel I haven\u2019t got enough legs to be pulled.\u201d \u2022 Dea is at the Secombe theatre from 24 May until 11 June.",
