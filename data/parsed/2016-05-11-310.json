  "body": "Almost a year after it came out in the US, Facebook is releasing its facial recognition-powered photo app Moments in Europe. Except the new version won\u2019t actually include any facial recognition technology, thanks to the company\u2019s long-running fight with the Irish data protection commissioner over whether the technology is actually legal in the EU. Launched in June, Moments is Facebook\u2019s answer to dedicated photo management applications like Google Photos and Apple\u2019s Photos. The app bundles pictures together by the event they\u2019re taken at, and applies facial recognition technology to identify who\u2019s in each picture. Facebook takes the offering a step further than Apple or Google, by leveraging its social network: once you\u2019ve created your \u201cmoments\u201d, you can share them with other people at the same event, to ensure that they have the photos of them, and you have the photos of you. And, naturally, you can then post them to your wall with just a click, creating some new original content that Facebook so desperately needs. The core idea is solid. As Facebook says: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to get the photos your friends have taken of you, and everyone always insists on taking that same group shot with multiple phones to ensure they get a copy. Even if you do end up getting some of your friends\u2019 photos, it\u2019s difficult to keep them all organised in one place on your phone.\u201d     Facebook\u2019s Moments app works with facial recognition at its core to make selfies easily shareable. Can it work without the technology? Photograph: Alamy    But will the app work without facial recognition technology at its core? Rather than simply uploading an album and hitting sync, European users have to individually, manually, tag friends. Facebook helps a bit, by \u201cclustering\u201d pictures of the same person together (so you can tag all the photos of the groom at a wedding at once, say). That\u2019s the most it can do while still complying with data protection regulations. It\u2019s a laborious process, and one that isn\u2019t much simpler than simply uploading the pictures publicly and letting friends tag themselves. The big difference that remains is the ability to privately share pictures, though, and it\u2019s one that cuts to the core of Facebook\u2019s issues today. The company has to deal with a user-base increasingly aware of privacy issues, and can often be unwilling to post publicly where they would once share copiously. The ability to share images privately with others could reverse that trend. Facebook would probably like to release the full version of Moments in Europe, but its longstanding issues with European privacy regulations prevent that. In 2011, for instance, Germany ruled that Facebook\u2019s \u201ctag suggestions\u201d feature, which applied facial recognition to public pictures, violated privacy laws and offered potential for \u201cconsiderable abuse\u201d. In 2012, Irish data protection regulators reiterated that tag suggestions weren\u2019t fit for Europe. In that, the regulators are currently looking fairly prescient. Last month, a Russian photographer showed just how powerful facial recognition can be for invading privacy, tracking down multiple people on \u201cRussia\u2019s Facebook\u201d, VKontake, using just a picture taken on the St Petersburg metro and a site called FindFace. \u201cNobody noticed that I photographed them, but I used a simple camera and I didn\u2019t try to hide it,\u201d the photographer, said Yegor Tsvetkov. \u201cOne girl in the project texted me after the publication and said that it was a bad feeling when she saw herself \u2026 but she fully understood my idea.\u201d",
