  "body": "At the recent premiere of HBO\u2019s drama All the Way at the National Archives in Washington, there was a moment that prompted murmurs of recognition from an audience including senators, political correspondents and Lyndon Johnson\u2019s granddaughter. It came when Bryan Cranston\u2019s Johnson, alarmed by his Republican rival\u2019s populist tactics, snarls: \u201cGoldwater wants to get down into the mud? By God, I can do that.\u201d   Related: Donald Trump takes poll lead over Hillary Clinton \u2013 is it time to panic?    It was always a question of when, not if, Donald Trump would get his hands dirty in the 2016 presidential contest against Hillary Clinton. That time is now. In recent days the Republican presumptive nominee, seeking to deflect attention from his own chauvinism, has unleashed an attack ad that raises allegations of sexual harassment or assault by Bill Clinton. In a TV interview he used the word \u201crape\u201d. He has also revived conspiracy theories that the suicide of White House counsel Vince Foster was actually murder. So far Hillary Clinton\u2019s response has been very different from LBJ\u2019s, with no intention of engaging in a mud-slinging contest. Asked by CNN if she felt compelled to defend her and her husband\u2019s honour, the Democratic frontrunner replied: \u201cNo. I know that that\u2019s exactly what he is fishing [for], and I\u2019m not going to be responding.\u201d It is a calculated risk. It did not work for those Republican primary candidates who tried to ignore Trump and rise above the fray. But those candidates who took him on directly \u2013 Jeb Bush branding him the \u201cchaos candidate\u201d, Marco Rubio mocking the size of his hands, Ted Cruz calling him a \u201cpathological liar\u201d \u2013 did not fare too well either. Hillary Clinton still faces the humiliating prospect of Trump goading her with allegations of her husband\u2019s cheating during primetime televised debates. While she is eager to remind the public of the 1990s as a golden decade for the economy, she would rather not revisit the tawdry scandals that dogged her husband during the same period. To recap, in 1994 Paula Jones sued Bill Clinton for sexual harassment over an alleged 1991 incident in which she said he exposed himself to her. Bill Clinton settled out of court with Jones for $850,000. In 1998 Kathleen Willey claimed that the president sexually assaulted her during his first term in the White House in 1993. Bill Clinton denied Willey\u2019s accusations. And in 1999 Juanita Broaddrick alleged that Bill Clinton raped her in 1978 when she was looking to volunteer on his Arkansas gubernatorial campaign. Bill Clinton\u2019s attorney denied the allegations on his behalf. Broaddrick and Willey\u2019s voices can be heard in the attack ad, and all three women were interviewed by conservative broadcaster and Trump cheerleader Sean Hannity on Talk Radio this week. He described the former president as \u201ca serial predator\u201d. Broaddrick told Hannity: \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to say the word \u2018rape\u2019. I always usually say \u2018sexual assault\u2019 but \u2018rape\u2019 is the perfect terminology for what happened.\u201d Hannity suggested that Hillary Clinton has argued that women who claim sexual assault deserve to be believed except, apparently, when the case involves her own husband. \u201cExactly,\u201d Broaddrick agreed. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to hear that.\u201d Asked how she feels about Clinton now running for president and claiming to be on the side of women, Broaddrick added: \u201cI think it\u2019s just disgusting what she\u2019s saying and what she\u2019s doing. I\u2019m so appreciative to Donald Trump for bringing it. I couldn\u2019t: it\u2019s very difficult for me to bring it forward because it\u2019s still too painful, but I appreciate his efforts.\u201d How should the Clintons handle such radioactive materials? By steering well clear, according to Al From, founder of the Democratic Leadership Council and the man who in 1989 handpicked Bill Clinton to lead the revival of the party as the New Democrats. \u201cIt\u2019s the dirtiest damn campaign I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d From told the Guardian on Tuesday. \u201cIt\u2019s just unbelievable. Bill Clinton left office with a 67% performance rating, the highest any president has had since taking polls, and that was after two years of attacks on these things and impeachment. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to resist the bait. Hopefully people will see what an empty vessel Trump is. You never win rolling in the dirt with someone whose politics is in the dirt. I don\u2019t think Bill Clinton should respond. I don\u2019t think you dignify that kind of thing.\u201d     Donald Trump is deeply unpopular with women, according to opinion polls. Photograph: Mark Kauzlarich/Reuters    Historically, there is little evidence that highlighting Bill Clinton\u2019s past indiscretions hurts his wife in the polls. Survey data from the Pew Research Center showed that her favourability rating went up to 66% in 1998 at the time her husband was impeached. From said Trump would find it hard to sustain this offensive for the next five months. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing in a primary where you have a targeted audience. Donald Trump has to appeal to voters who have an overwhelmingly negative perception of him: the people who participated in the Democratic primary. \u201cAll the attacks on President Clinton don\u2019t help him one bit. Rather than dredge up old, mostly discredited allegations on things that were adjudicated at the highest level, he\u2019d be doing the country a service by being transparent about his own conduct and releasing his taxes.\u201d Opinion polls show a stark gender divide in the electorate, with Trump deeply unpopular with women and Clinton struggling to gain support among men. The brash tycoon has sought to fight back by describing Bill Clinton as an \u201cabuser\u201d of women and rallying anti-Clinton sentiment among the Republican base. But in 1998, Trump was singing a different tune. In an interview on Fox News, the businessman appeared to side with Clinton against his accusers, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s like it\u2019s from hell. It\u2019s a terrible group of people \u2026 The whole group \u2013 Paula Jones, [Monica] Lewinsky \u2013 it\u2019s just a really unattractive group. And I\u2019m not just talking about physical, but I am also talking about physical.\u201d And he said of the president: \u201cI don\u2019t necessarily agree with his victims. His victims are terrible. He is really a victim himself. But he put himself in that position.\u201d As his attitude to gun control demonstrates, however, Trump seems to have no compunction about shifting his positions. He is likely to come out in the debate spoiling for a brawl. Democratic strategist Bob Shrum said: \u201cTrump will bring up every sleazy charge he can think of. When he says something like that, Hillary Clinton could have a couple of sharp lines about it and then say let\u2019s look at the issues the American people care about.  \u201cShe is going to have to push back at some point, but she should probably save it for the debates.\u201d",
