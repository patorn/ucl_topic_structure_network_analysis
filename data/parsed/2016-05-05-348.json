  "body": "A legislative bid to abolish dolphin captivity in New South Wales, targeting the remaining park in the state in Coffs Harbour, has gained cross-party support as well as that of the former premier Bob Carr. More than 85,000 people have already backed advocacy group Australia for Dolphins\u2019 appeal to premier Mike Baird to end dolphin captivity in the state since it launched on 9 April.   Related: These dolphins talk to each other. Why do we insist it isn\u2019t language?    Carr, Labor members Penny Sharpe and Mick Veitch, Greens NSW MP Mehreen Faruqi, and Animal Justice party member Mark Pearson threw their support behind the bid to \u201cconvince Coffs\u201d on Thursday morning. \u201cThose two words, dolphins and captivity, don\u2019t sit happily together,\u201d said Carr, citing the \u201cmagnificent\u201d animals\u2019 intelligence and abilities.    Those two words, dolphins and captivity, don\u2019t sit happily together  Bob Carr     \u201cTo think of these creature being confined in a pool, one-third of the size of an Olympic swimming pool, is to know what this is all about. It\u2019s plain cruel.\u201d Only two dolphin parks remain open in Australia, one of which is Dolphin Marine Magic in Coffs Harbour. It has five bottlenose dolphins in its care, which perform tricks and swim with visitors.  All five animals were either born in captivity or rescued with debilitating injuries that, its website says: \u201cmeant they would have been unable to survive in the wild\u201d. The park also functions as a rescue and rehabilitation centre for native marine mammals. \u201cDolphin Marine Magic does not support at either a company or operational level the live capture or trade of any species of wild marine mammal for display.  \u201cWe ... strongly believe that all animals belong in the wild wherever possible.\u201d Ji-Ling, the park\u2019s youngest dolphin, died in August last year. His cause of death was not publicised but SBS revealed on Thursday he had swallowed leaves, sticks and a small piece of metal, which led to an ulcer forming in his belly. Hec Goodall, the founder of the park and still a major shareholder, also voiced his support for the campaign on Thursday. He told SBS he was \u201cvery disappointed\u201d with the path the park had gone down since he was removed from the board in 2004: \u201cThe place has just turned into a greed-driven damned enterprise now. And all the charity work we used to do, or most of the charity work, has gone out the window.\u201d It is already an offence to capture healthy dolphins for the purposes of keeping them in captivity, which Carr implemented as the environment minister for NSW in the 1980s.  He said on Thursday he was \u201cvery proud\u201d of the role he played in the law change, which resulted in the closure of three dolphinariums. Dolphins born in captivity are allowed to remain there. Legislation to abolish all dolphin captivity in NSW will be presented by NSW Labor and co-sponsored by the NSW Greens and the Animal Justice party. Penny Sharpe said Labor was \u201chappy to finish what Bob Carr started in the 1980s\u201d. \u201cKeeping and breeding dolphins in captivity \u2013 forcing them to perform tricks for our entertainment \u2013 must be relegated to the history books,\u201d said Mehreen Faruqi, environment spokesperson for the NSW Greens.   Related: SeaWorld decides to stop killer whale breeding program    Australia for Dolphins is fundraising to help it secure the backing of the Coffs Harbour community, which it says is crucial for change. It will hold its third annual \u201cEmpty the Tanks\u201d protest in Coffs Harbour at Dolphin Marine Magic\u2019s \u201cpet porpoise pool\u201d on Saturday. More than 85,200 people have signed its petition to be presented to Mike Baird and the NSW Department of Primary Industries minister, Niall Blair, in the coming weeks.  The other dolphin park in Australia is SeaWorld on the Gold Coast. In Queensland, there are no animal welfare standards for dolphins in captivity. In March this year, SeaWorld in the United States announced the end of its orca captive breeding program, following calls for it to end the public exhibition of the animals altogether.",
