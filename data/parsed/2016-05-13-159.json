  "body": "The blood had dried by the time Bart George pulled his Ford pickup over on a high mountain pass in southern British Columbia. It was late fall in 2015. George always kept his passport in the truck \u2013 he never knew when he\u2019d need to rush across the border between the US and Canada to investigate a kill.  Now was one of those times.  Three other men mingled on the side of the highway. One carried a large-caliber rifle. Together they descended the mountain and entered a creek bed. They were surrounded by yellow brush. George\u2019s adrenaline was pumping. \u201cWe start finding blood and fur,\u201d he said. Disturbed earth, matted grass. As the men crept forward, they saw a dark hump moving in the brush. Black bear. George\u2019s heart walloped; after a moment, he picked up a stick and threw it at the animal. The other men hollered, and the bear skittered away from the meal it was scavenging on: a dead woodland caribou. Woodland caribou are different from their northerly, arctic-dwelling cousins. They\u2019re larger, darker, and don\u2019t really migrate. Before the 19th century there were thousands of woodland caribou living in the contiguous United States. However, decades of deforestation, overhunting and habitat fragmentation greatly reduced their numbers. There are now only a dozen left in the lower 48, and they flit across parts of Washington, Idaho and southern British Columbia, in a region known as the south Selkirk mountain ecosystem. This particular woodland caribou lay torn apart in the grass, eyes glazed white with death. \u201cYou treat it like a crime scene,\u201d George said. George is a biologist with the wildlife and territorial resources division of the Kalispel Tribe of Indians based in Usk, Washington. His agency is part of a transnational recovery team consisting of several American and Canadian agencies. They\u2019ve been trying to stymie the decline of caribou in the south Selkirks for more than 30 years \u2013 ever since the animal was listed in the Endangered Species Act in 1984. Two of the other three men at the death site, a Kootenai tribal biologist and a British Columbia provincial biologist, were also part of the recovery team. The third was a professional wolf trapper. If they had found a wolf scavenging the caribou, George said, they would\u2019ve killed it.     If they had found a wolf scavenging the caribou, George said, they would\u2019ve killed it.

They are also killing a lot of south Selkirk caribou, according to the British Columbia government. More than half the herd has died since wolves re-entered the ecosystem in 2008. It\u2019s not that wolves and caribou can\u2019t live in the same ecosystem \u2013 they coexisted for centuries before European settlement \u2013 it\u2019s that this particular, dwindling herd can\u2019t handle any predation. They can\u2019t breed fast enough to make up the numbers. So the recovery team agreed to a drastic and controversial measure: allowing the British Columbia government to shoot wolves in the south Selkirks in order to save endangered caribou. They\u2019ve killed 19 wolves since the plan was enacted in 2015. It\u2019s part of a province-wide wolf management plan that has prompted outcries and at least one court challenge from environmental groups (even Miley Cyrus got into the mix and condemned the shootings on Twitter).    .@pacificwild fuck the fucking wolf cull what the fuck?!?!?!?! How the fuck is this happening! Let's make it STOP! https://t.co/BQdXY3eSAh\u2014 Miley Ray Cyrus (@MileyCyrus) February 18, 2016    \u201cI really hate to see it come to that. To have to sacrifice some wolves to save the caribou. But I\u2019d hate to see the caribou disappear, too,\u201d said Tim Layser, a former member of the recovery team and current director of the Selkirk Conservation Alliance, a not-for-profit organization dedicated to saving all that is wild in the south Selkirks, including both wolves and caribou. \u201cGod, that\u2019s a tough one. To reduce the wolf population to allow the caribou a chance to survive, it\u2019s a kind of necessary evil.\u201d Ray Entz, the director of the wildlife and territorial resources division for the Kalispel tribe, calls it triage. \u201cYou have a bleeding patient on the table,\u201d he said, \u201cand there are a few things we can do, that are temporary in nature, that can stave off extinction and give us a chance at recovery.\u201d    I really hate ... to sacrifice some wolves to save the caribou. But I\u2019d hate to see the caribou disappear, too  Tim Layser     According to a 2015 study of wolf and caribou dynamics in western Alberta, killing wolves to save endangered caribou can help stabilize a population. But it isn\u2019t enough to allow the herd to grow and thrive. As Entz said, it\u2019s temporary.  What they really need is more old-growth, roadless habitat. Woodland caribou, especially the ones that live in the mountains, survive winter by eating arboreal lichen, which takes 80 to 150 years to grow. So it only exists in old forests. When Europeans arrived in North America they began chopping down old-growth forests and building roads. The caribou lost most of their habitat and their numbers declined. In 2007, the government of British Columbia protected nearly 400 square miles of woodland caribou habitat in the south Selkirks, banning logging and road-building. That\u2019s a space larger than New York City. When the United States tried to pull off a similar feat, however, it failed.     A woodland caribou.

The government scaled back their proposal to a mere 46 square miles in 2013, arguing that, since the caribou spent most of their time in British Columbia, efforts to protect the species in Canada were adequate. \u201cWe agree that Canada has the largest role in recovery,\u201d said Entz, the Kalispel tribal resource manager. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t abdicate the United States from their responsibility.\u201d Conservation organizations sued the US government for slashing critical habitat. In April, under court order, US Fish and Wildlife Service reopened the opportunity for public comment on the decision. They\u2019ve also given the Kootenai tribe $35,000 to run meetings and help develop an updated recovery plan for the caribou. They hope to have a draft of that plan available for public comment next year, according to Chris Warren, a US Fish and Wildlife Service representative. \u201cNothing is off the the table,\u201d Warren said. \u201cWe are considering all options to see what is best to save the Selkirk herd.\u201d But Entz isn\u2019t holding his breath. The recovery plan is just that, he said \u2013 a plan. Real change requires funding and follow through, all of which he said have been in short supply for the past 16 years. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about two countries, transboundary issues, several fish and wildlife agencies, a few tribes. It\u2019s hard to get everyone wrangled around the same fire,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the frustrating part.\u201d It doesn\u2019t help that many Americans don\u2019t even know that caribou exist in the lower 48. \u201cYou drive anywhere around here and talk to people, they don\u2019t have the foggiest idea that we have caribou in the [contiguous] United States. So there\u2019s not a lot of public pressure,\u201d said Layser, the conservationist and former recovery team member.     Woodland caribou looking for food in Jasper National Park. Photograph: Alamy    \u201cNobody seems to care,\u201d Entz said. \u201cWe used to eat caribou. They were a winter food source for the tribe. I don\u2019t want to be the biologist working with the tribe the year caribou go extinct in the [contiguous] United States.\u201d Entz would like to see the caribou population recovered to the point where Kalispel tribal members could hunt them again. Elk \u2013 one of the American west\u2019s premiere game animals \u2013 help support a US hunting industry worth $38bn and benefit from 6.8m acres of protected habitat courtesy of the Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation, a hunting and conservation organization. State and federal wildlife agencies in Idaho have shot more than 60 wolves in Idaho to save a dwindling herd of elk there. \u201cElk get a lot of love because you can put a set of crosshairs on them,\u201d he said. \u201cCaribou don\u2019t write the checks.\u201d There are also nearly 1 million elk in the contiguous United States, according to a census of state agency elk biologists. There are only 12 caribou. \u201cThey\u2019re functionally extinct,\u201d Entz said, meaning the herd isn\u2019t a viable player in the ecosystem anymore. It barely exists. A ghost of itself. Back at the death site, George and the team were performing a necropsy \u2013 taking pictures and investigating the dead caribou\u2019s body. It was a mature bull \u2013 the biggest in the herd \u2013 and its head had been pulled mostly away from the body and eaten. \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much left,\u201d George said. He peeled back the bull\u2019s skin and saw bruising on its front leg. It was lying less than a quarter-mile from the highway. Wolf tracks, bear tracks and scat surrounded the body. The animals scavenged the caribou, but a truck or a car probably killed it. George gathered what was left \u2013 a half-eaten head, a bloody hide, a pair of antlers arching towards the sun \u2013 and stuffed the remains of one of the last wild caribou in the lower 48 into a backpack. He would like to see the herd survive, but time is running out. There isn\u2019t enough money, resources or demand, he said.  \u201cYou\u2019re frustrated, you don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d George said. \u201cYou feel helpless.\u201d",
