  "body": "The commitment by both major parties to new coalmines that threaten the Great Barrier Reef was \u201cthe great tragedy\u201d of Australian politics, Greens leader Richard Di Natale told the ABC\u2019s Q&A program on Monday. Di Natale, who was forced to defend the role of his party from both Labor and Coalition rivals, who branded him \u201carrogant\u201d, linked fossil fuel donations to the two major parties to the economic woes now felt in regions like central Queensland. Pressed by an audience member on how the Greens would boost the economy in former mining boom towns, Di Natale jumped on an earlier answer from Coalition MP Steve Ciobo that the government was banking partly on the huge Carmichael mine.  \u201cI tell you what we won\u2019t be doing is opening up a new coalmine and killing the Great Barrier Reef,\u201d Di Natale said to applause from the Brisbane audience. \u201cIf you care about tourism you don\u2019t open up a whopping great big coalmine and fuel catastrophic global warming.    Related: Environment scorecard rates Coalition's policies 'woefully inadequate'    \u201cBut this is the great tragedy here in Australia right now, is we\u2019ve got the two old parties committed to opening up new coalmines and preventing this country from realising the huge opportunities that come with making a transition to the clean, renewable energy economy.\u201d Di Natale said both the Coalition and Labor were complicit in \u201cslashing\u201d the renewable energy target and funding to the renewable energy agency, with \u201cno strategy\u201d to develop renewable sector investment to the point where it could deliver \u201c100,000 jobs\u201d as in Germany, denying new employment opportunities to regional Australia.  \u201cAnd if you want to know why those communities you spoke about are in such trouble, look no further than the massive donations that have been given to both the old parties from the fossil fuel lobby,\u201d Di Natale said, again to applause.  Di Natale, a day after an election leaders\u2019 debate he declared a \u201csnoozefest\u201d, came under repeated attack from Ciobo and Labor MP Terri Butler. Butler, who said she personally did not support the Carmichael mine and that the state Labor government did not \u201chave much discretion\u201d around its approval, told Di Natale: \u201cIt\u2019s great you have a good policy, Richard, it\u2019s absolutely fantastic.    Most Australians don\u2019t identify with Greens policies. They \u2026  actually want strong border sovereignty,  Steve Ciobo     \u201cBut we have a fantastic policy and we can form government and deliver it. That\u2019s the difference between Labor and the Greens,\u201d Butler said.  \u201cNot for long,\u201d Di Natale replied, to which Butler said: \u201cNo, no, this is serious \u2013 this is actually serious,\u201d before referring to Labor\u2019s plan for a 50% renewables target by 2030, $500m in reef water quality funding and skills and training investment for a \u201cjust transition\u201d in post-mining communities.  Asked by host Tony Jones about the \u201cexistential threat\u201d to the reef, and the Flinders university estimate that $10bn in funding over 10 years was needed to save it, Ciobo defended the Coalition\u2019s $460m to improve water quality and its carbon pollution reduction scheme that would achieve \u201cone of the highest per capita reductions in the world\u201d. Ciobo also pointed to skills and training funding, international tourism and agribusiness as the way for mining dependent communities to make a transition, but said global coal demand was \u201cgoing through the roof\u201d. Di Natale retorted: \u201cThat\u2019s why the coal price is tanking.\u201d Ciobo accused Di Natale, by calling for a moratorium on new mines in Australia, of exporting the production of coal. \u201cThat\u2019s not going to save the reef, mate, it might make you feel good, but it\u2019s not actually going to make a difference,\u201d he said. South Australian senator and new party leader Nick Xenophon confessed he did not know the answer to reviving struggling mining communities, but said: \u201cWe blew the mining boom. \u201cWe should have had a sovereign wealth fund. We should have been able to cushion ourselves from these shocks.\u201d Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie \u2013 whose other notable contribution was a call for young adults not working or studying to be conscripted into military service \u2013 questioned Di Natale\u2019s reference to Germany\u2019s renewables sector. Lambie said the country paid \u201cdouble\u201d what Australians did for electricity and relied on France\u2019s nuclear energy for its \u201cbaseload\u201d power. Di Natale disputed this.    You do not have the capacity to become the PM after the federal election  Terri Butler to Richard Di Natale     The Greens leader and Xenophon were both upbraided by Ciobo \u2013 with agreement from Butler \u2013 as \u201creally arrogant\u201d in their attitudes to the major parties, whom Di Natale branded the \u201cColes and Woolies\u201d of politics. \u201cRichard, most Australians don\u2019t identify with Greens policies. They\u2019re not in favour of legalising drugs \u2026 they actually want strong border sovereignty,\u201d Ciobo said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the reason why they will support the Labor party or the Liberal party in stronger numbers than they will your party.  \u201cAnd mate, you can sit there and be arrogant about it and say well that\u2019s just because they\u2019re not that smart, but I mean the reality is, mate, the reason they get behind the majors is because of those common values.\u201d Butler told Di Natale he had been excluded from the leaders\u2019 debate \u201cbecause you do not have the capacity to become the PM after the federal election\u201d. \u201cPeople have got a serious choice to make here: a choice between a government who\u2019s going to make big cuts to services and hand over money to foreign investors and big corporations, and someone else who\u2019s actually got capacity to do real work and save the reef,\u201d Butler said. Di Natale, the only panel member to attract regular applause, said the \u201cidentity politics\u201d that helped Labor and the Coalition was breaking down and that \u201cour time is coming\u201d. \u201cIf there was a vote among people who are under 30 in Australia there\u2019d possibly be a Greens prime minister,\u201d he said.   Related: Deal and no deal: decoding Turnbull and Shorten's double talk on minority rule | Lenore Taylor    Ciobo said it was \u201cquite fascinating to watch Terri and Richard bicker because what\u2019s fascinating about this election is that the Labor party know they are in serious strife because [the Greens] obviously appeal to the centre left\u201d.  He said Labor was \u201ccompletely split down the guts\u201d on asylum policy and Di Natale was \u201cexcited\u201d at the prospect of the Greens winning lower house votes on the issue. Di Natale\u2019s response again won him applause. \u201cI know this is really hard to believe, but I don\u2019t care what the Labor party thinks about this issue,\u201d he said.  \u201cI care about those kids who are rotting in hellholes in those offshore camps because we\u2019ve got a Liberal government and a Labor party who haven\u2019t got the courage to stand up and say these are people who are going to make a contribution to this country. \u201cAnd a decent society doesn\u2019t take innocent people and harm them \u2013 and we know they\u2019re being harmed \u2013 to send a message to someone else.\u201d",
