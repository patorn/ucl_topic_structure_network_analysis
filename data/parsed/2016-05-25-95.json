  "body": "Billionaire businessman Donald Trump \u2013 whose name appears emblazoned on buildings across the world \u2013 knows the power of branding, and he is currently attempting to use it on his likely general election opponent, Hillary Clinton. Since he first used the term \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d in a speech on 16 April, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee has returned to the insult at least 50 times.   Related: From surprising synonyms to expected insults, the top nicknames for Trump    In the last week alone, he has called Clinton \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d on Twitter 17 times \u2013 plus in numerous rallies and interviews \u2013 and he also unveiled an additional nickname at the NRA convention on Friday, dubbing the Clintons \u201cheartless hypocrites\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re going to call her Heartless Hillary,\u201d said Trump, before adding: \u201cSomehow I like Crooked Hillary better.\u201d This is not a new tactic for Trump, whose Republican opponents \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted\u201d Cruz, \u201cLittle Marco\u201d Rubio and \u201cLow-energy\u201d Jeb all found their insulting nicknames difficult to respond to. How should the Clinton campaign handle it now Trump is trying the same approach with her?  \u201cIgnore it,\u201d said Bob Liff, a Democratic strategist and senior vice-president for George Arzt Communications, a political public relations firm in New York. Liff points out that as soon as Rubio, Cruz and Bush started getting as personal and aggressive in their insults as Trump, they lost ground, partly because, as elected officials, they were held to higher standards than Trump. \u201cWhen you lie down with dogs, you get up with fleas,\u201d he added. But Patrick Meirick, the director of the Political Communication Center, a research center and archive of political advertisements at the University of Oklahoma, disagreed. Since George HW Bush\u2019s successful crushing of Michael Dukakis in the 1988 election with a series of powerful attack ads, \u201cthe conventional wisdom is you don\u2019t let attacks go unanswered \u2013 you have to refute and counterpunch\u201d, he said. \u201cWhat I understand is that Hillary Clinton is letting these less substantive attacks and name calling roll off her back and she\u2019s not calling additional attention to them. I\u2019m not sure how that\u2019s going to play.\u201d Evan Siegfried, a Republican strategist and author of an upcoming book about millennials and the Republican party called GOP GPS, said he thought Clinton \u201cwould have been better served by hitting back by challenging Donald to come and say it to her face\u201d, he said. This would offer Clinton the chance to bring up his faults and business failings and would give him a chance to stumble, argued Siegfried, who has said he plans to vote for Clinton over Trump. Alternatively, someone else could hit back for her, he said. \u201cShe should also have a strong woman vice-presidential nominee to balance her ticket who goes out as a complete attack dog whose entire job is to target and annoy him to the point of making mistakes,\u201d said Siegfried, suggesting Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who has recently gone on Twitter rampages against Trump. (Trump dubs Warren \u201cgoofy\u201d.) Nicknames work best \u201cwhen the metaphor fits, when it picks up on an existing narrative or an issue\u201d, said Meirick. For decades, Republicans have attempted to label the Clintons as dishonest and shady \u2013 with Hillary hounded in particular over her personal email server and Benghazi. The \u201ccrooked\u201d name fits into that pattern. \u201cThey\u2019re saying: \u2018We\u2019ve been throwing all these charges, therefore she\u2019s crooked,\u2019\u201d said Liff. Another problem for Clinton is that she lacks her own catchy slogan \u2013 such as Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cyes we can\u201d \u2013 allowing Trump to brand her. \u201cHillary\u2019s big problem is that she has no message \u2026 whether you agree or not, he says he\u2019s running to make America great again,\u201d said Siegfried. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt Trump that [Bernie] Sanders is hitting Clinton and the Democratic establishment as being crooked and corrupt. It only helps Trump,\u201d he added. Despite Trump trying out \u201cheartless\u201d this week, political experts did not think that one would stick around.  \u201cOut of the two \u2026 I think \u2018Crooked Hillary\u2019 probably has a better likelihood of gaining traction and resonating,\u201d said Meirick. \u201cEven though \u2018heartless\u2019 has that alliteration, it works against the notion that Clinton has offered of being a champion of working people, children, for women,\u201d he added.  This campaign in particular has offered a \u201csofter side\u201d to Clinton, said Liff. She is now a grandmother (with a second grandchild on its way), and her campaign has focused on the victims of gun and police violence, particularly the mothers of unarmed African American men who have been killed, such as Michael Brown and Eric Garner. But even if \u201cheartless\u201d isn\u2019t as effective as \u201ccrooked\u201d, it could still help the Trump campaign, said Evan. \u201cEven putting this into the narrative, it gets people talking about \u2018why is he calling her heartless\u2019 and it dredges up every past scandal that the Clintons say are old news and shouldn\u2019t be covered,\u201d Siegfried said. The Democratic national committee briefly tried the same technique against the presumptive Republican nominee, calling him \u201cDangerous Donald\u201d in a Cinco de Mayo statement about how a Trump presidency could affect US relations with Mexico. \u201cThe attempt to do \u2018Dangerous Donald\u2019 was just her ripping it off, and people saw it as a phony,\u201d said Siegfried, \u201cwhile Trump\u2019s entire schtick is being that outside personality who isn\u2019t afraid to get down in the mud and go after anything or anyone, no matter how ridiculous.\u201d And the nastiness won\u2019t end anytime soon, predicted Meirick. \u201cI expect this to be the most negative presidential campaign we\u2019ve ever seen. This is because these are the presumptive nominees with the highest unfavorable ratings we\u2019ve seen in the modern era. It would be difficult to motivate enthusiasm for the candidates themselves. Instead, it\u2019s motivating anxiety about the opponent that they\u2019re going to use to drive turnout,\u201d he said.",
