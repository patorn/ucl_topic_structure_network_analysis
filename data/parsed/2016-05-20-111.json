  "body": "MUTANTS UNITE  It\u2019s not been a good week for fans of Manchester United. First they were bundled out of Old Trafford after a security c0ck-up led to a bomb scare before their game against Bournemouth on Sunday. Then they discovered that they still had to sit through another spectacular Louis van Gaal production when the game was replayed on Tuesday, even though they already knew that Manchester City had pipped them to a Big Cup spot. They would have crawled into the top four with a 19-0 win, but, well, they don\u2019t really do that kind of thing any more, and the final insult came when they poured a jug of hot urine all over history and tradition by somehow managing to link the new X-Men flick with tomorrow\u2019s 1990 nostalgia-fest against Crystal Palace, just to please sponsors 20th Century Fox, in a lame attempt to show that they\u2019re down with the kids. Presumably directed by Ed Woodward, in the lowest point for cinema since Threat Level Midnight hit the big screen, a clip that has been met with widespread derision features Professor Charles Xavier, played with expert weariness by James McAvoy, in conversation with Wayne Rooney, played by a robot programmed to act like Wayne Rooney, delivering a performance so wooden that Van Gaal is certain to play him up front against Palace. As a mushroom cloud appeared over Roy Keane\u2019s house, Lord Ferg\u2019s nose went an even deeper shade of purple and Eric Cantona threw a hissy fit at not being given an audition, rumours emerged that the next X-Men film will centre on mutants such as a confused, fuzzy-haired Belgian who knocks people over with his mighty pointy elbows, a wheezing Liverpudlian who can trap a ball further than most mortals can kick it, a brooding Portuguese who pokes his victims in the eye and a vengeful Dutch villain who bores his enemies to death. But they were hastily denied and instead thoughts turned to Wembley and why United couldn\u2019t just be happy doing a Cup final song, like Alan Pardew\u2019s Palace, who have earned the backing of neutrals up and down the country by releasing a revival of Glad All Over. Everything they\u2019ve built will fall? Well, quite. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cVilla Park is a very historical stadium, so we will not simply and callously destroy a club\u2019s history. We want to use Villa\u2019s history and its substantial fan base around the world to also promote Lotus Health products and services globally. The ideal scenario would be for fans to enjoy Lotus Health products at Lotus Villa Park, it would be a great advert for both brands\u201d \u2013 new Villa owner Tony Xia is definitely not simply and callously planning to destroy the club\u2019s history. Nope.     It begins. Photograph: Damir Sagolj/Reuters    FIVER LETTERS \u201cCan we just take a moment to recognise the genuinely heroic Marco Russ (yesterday\u2019s Bits and Bobs), who has been diagnosed with a tumour, but still wants to play for his team in a German promotion/relegation play-off decider. In an age where footballers regularly roll around on the floor clutching their faces because someone touched their shoelace, this man wants to give everything for his team. Whether or not he ends up playing in that match, let\u2019s hope he gets well soon\u201d \u2013 Dan Makeham.  \u201cSteven Chicken may not have wasted his life in any way by googling \u2018hard place to go\u2019 (yesterday\u2019s letters) but I wasted at least 15 seconds of mine by clicking on the link and getting a \u201curl not found\u201d message. Is this the kind of professionalism one can come to expect from a tea-timely football email? Oh, right\u201d \u2013 Jeremy Adams. \u201cSo to win the letter o\u2019 the day, you just have to send a mail about not wasting your life cataloguing \u2018tough places to go\u2019 with no actual content. I wasted my own time by googling \u2018a tough place to go\u2019, and the top result was in fact the intended content, which I actually read. I cannot get that time back\u201d \u2013 Steven Chicken.     A tough place to go. Photograph: Steven Chicken    \u201cIf Fiver readers will be as bored as me this weekend and have already read through all their polite rejections from Guardian Soulmates then perhaps they would like to spend the next two days looking at The Economist\u2019s chart of each Premier League club\u2019s performance since 1995 based on total points and clubs\u2019 wage spending as proportion of the season\u2019s average. Alternatively, if you don\u2019t have the time then just select Queens Park Rangers and give yourself a chuckle for a couple of minutes. P.S. It will try and get you to register with a pop up but just click \u2018close\u2019\u201d \u2013 Noble Francis. \u2022 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And if you\u2019ve nothing better to do you can also tweet The Fiver. Today\u2019s winner of our letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Dan Makeham. JOIN GUARDIAN SOULMATES Chances are that if you\u2019re reading this tea-timely football email, you\u2019re almost certainly single. But fear not \u2013 if you\u2019d like to find companionship or love, sign up here to view profiles of the kind of erudite, sociable and friendly folk who would never normally dream of going out with you. And don\u2019t forget, it\u2019s not the rejection that kills you, it\u2019s the hope. BITS AND BOBS Claudio Ranieri has been appointed a Grand Officer of the Italian Order of Merit, for his services to over-confident gamblers in the Leicester area.  Meanwhile, Ranieri\u2019s assistants at Leicester Craig Shakespeare and Steve Walsh have penned new contracts with the club. \u201cCraig and Steve epitomise the kind of application and commitment that has brought so much success, positivity and goodwill to our club and we\u2019re absolutely delighted that they have agreed new contracts as part of our journey,\u201d Ranieri back-slapped.  Brighton have reacted well to missing out on promotion by bundling five players \u2013 including Bobby Zamora and club captain Gordon Greer \u2013 aboard the the good ship Do One.  Arsenal are close to securing the signing of Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach\u2019s Granit Xhaka for \u00a325m, who at least has a name that sounds like he\u2019ll be the solid midfield presence they\u2019ve been missing for the best part of a decade.  Bradford City\u2019s joint-chairman Mark Lawn has labelled the Football League\u2019s proposal for four divisions and eight extra teams as \u2018ridiculous\u2019. \u2018We\u2019ve had this structure for years because it has suited the majority of clubs, so why change it?\u201d he ridiculed.  Manchester United have denied they will offer entertaining football\u2019s Louis van Gaal a new post as director of football to make room for entertaining football\u2019s Jos\u00e9 Mourinho next season.  And David Ginola is recovering in hospital after coming through a quadruple heart bypass operation. Get well soon. STILL WANT MORE? Crystal Palace defender Damien Delaney gets his chat on with Dominic Fifield and tells him why winning the FA Cup tomorrow \u201cwould be vindication for everything I\u2019ve gone through\u201d after becoming so fed up with football that he considered becoming a triathlete.  Palace\u2019s last Cup final \u2013 in 1990 \u2013 changed not just the south London club forever but, as Richard Foster writes, Manchester United and Liverpool too. Blimey. In the latest from our Golden Goal series, Daniel Harris explains why Keith Houchen\u2019s diving header for Coventry in the 1987 Cup final equals the point of everything. Does Big Vase failure make J\u00fcrgen Klopp a serial loser? Barney Ronay says no, he can do a Dortmund at Liverpool.  After showering our writers in verbal pelters for predicting Leicester would be relegated this season, it\u2019s time to turn the tables: over half of you readers also tipped a drop to the Championship, though a hat tip for the 43 (0.53%) that predicted the most unlikely of title wins.
