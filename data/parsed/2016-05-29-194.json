  "body": "Wallander 9pm, BBC1The long goodbye continues. The case pursued in Henning Mankell\u2019s final crime novel, The Troubled Man \u2013 about Linda Wallander\u2019s imposing new father-in-law \u2013 is low in the mix for now, with Kurt (Kenneth Branagh) instead trying to focus on a vanished young woman. The drama focuses on the detective\u2019s disintegrating mind. His blanks and wobbles lead to more elegant pauses than ever, in a penultimate episode so underplayed it\u2019s virtually subterranean. Jack Seale Top Gear 8pm, BBC2Chris Evans and Matt LeBlanc launch the new-look motoring magazine show, but can they manage to put their own stamp on a format that \u2013 for all its controversy \u2013 was something of a national institution? As the series kicks off, Evans heads to Nevada to take on female racing driver Sabine Schmitz, whose inclusion seems a necessary step post-Clarkson. Elsewhere, LeBlanc explores Morocco in a souped-up buggy and there\u2019s a UK v US showdown. Hannah J Davies Yeti: Myth, Man Or Beast?   8pm, Channel 4Mark Evans, presenter of Bigfoot Files, attempts to unravel the mystery of Tibet\u2019s unofficial mascot. With the help of genetic experts and mountaineer Reinhold Messner, the affable TV vet puts two theories under the microscope. Could the world\u2019s most elusive Chewbacca impersonator be a remnant of the Denisovans, a supposedly extinct human species? Or is the abominable snowman actually just a rare bear? Graeme Virtue Channel 4\u2019s Comedy Gala 2016  9pm, Channel 4The annual all-star standup bash held at London\u2019s O2 Arena returns for a seventh year, with money raised from tickets and DVD sales going to Great Ormond Street Hospital Children\u2019s Charity. This time around, those lending their talents to the cause include Aisling Bea, The Last Leg\u2019s Josh Widdicombe and Alex Brooker, Warwick Davis, Sean Lock, Seann Walsh, Shappi Khorsandi and Alan \u201cChatty Man\u201d Carr. Plus Jake Bugg will provide tunes. Jonathan Wright Damien Hirst And Jeff Koons Side By Side: The Interview  11pm, BBC4To coincide with the opening of a significant new Jeff Koons exhibition, curated by Damien Hirst at the latter\u2019s gallery in London\u2019s Vauxhall, Kirsty Wark interviews these two remarkably well-remunerated titans of modern art. While the camera dribbles over Koons\u2019s Duchamp-inspired readymades and priceless play-dough, Hirst insists he doesn\u2019t think money [in art] \u201cshould be considered a dirty word\u201d. Ali Catterall Naked And Afraid  9pm, DiscoveryMore pixelated nude survivalism, with 26-year-old Chalese, an endurance sports nut from Utah, and Steven, a cocky Robin Thicke lookalike from Florida, thrown together in the Alabama backwoods, where there are bears, deadly spiders and 50 species of snake. Soon enough, they\u2019re cuddling in the buff, clubbing creatures to death and eating still-beating snake hearts. But a storm and a few tough, snake meat-free days threaten to derail their outback existence. Ben Arnold 11.22.63 9pm, FOXThe finale of the well-presented \u201cwhat if...\u201d series about the Kennedy assassination, based on Stephen King\u2019s book. James Franco\u2019s Jake readies himself for the frantic last leg of his mission to thwart Lee Harvey Oswald at the Dallas book depository, hindered persistently by The Past. Events then take a somewhat ironic turn, as Jake is forced to contemplate what success or failure in altering the future means, not just for humanity but those closest to him. David Stubbs Film choice     Matt Damon in Good Will Hunting. Photograph: Allstar/MIRAMAX    Good Will Hunting(Gus Van Sant, 1997), 10.05pm, ITV3The film that showed hot young actors Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were more than just pretty faces: they scripted this well-crafted drama about Will Hunting (Damon), a university janitor-cum-maths whiz who is far brighter than the students. He has to learn to trust himself, and others \u2013 including Minnie Driver\u2019s loving Brit student and Oscar-winning Robin Williams\u2019s volatile shrink. Paul Howlett Grosse Pointe Blank(George Armitage, 1997), 11.40pm, BBC1At the Grosse Pointe high school reunion there are the usual types: bankers, doctors, lawyers \u2013 plus John Cusack\u2019s Martin Blank, who is a hitman. He\u2019s in town to go to the party, make up with the prom date (Minnie Driver) he jilted all those years ago, assassinate someone, and to come to an arrangement with his big rival, Dan Aykroyd\u2019s Mr Grocer. One of the smartest comedies of the 90s, it merges elements of romance and thriller into a brilliantly witty, offbeat tale.
