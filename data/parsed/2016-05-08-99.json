  "body": "If your bank hits you with what you consider to be unfair overdraft fees, or fails to notify you in a timely manner of new, higher fees \u2013 thus making it impossible for you to avoid them \u2013 you may end up losing enough money for it to be painful. But getting it back may be even more costly, too costly to make it worthwhile. That\u2019s because the small print covering your bank account, credit card and most other financial institution agreements requires you to submit to binding arbitration to resolve any disputes with your bank. Only 34% did not require binding arbitration, the Pew Charitable Trusts found in a survey last year, down from 38% in 2013. In plain English, that means you\u2019re losing your right to join together with other bank customers who have been hit by the same kind of fees and push back against the policy in a class-action lawsuit. A lawyer isn\u2019t likely to represent just you \u2013 unless you\u2019re really wealthy, in which case, the bank probably would be waiving all those fees anyway, right?  Instead, you\u2019re required to submit to a different kind of process, known as arbitration. The banks \u2013 and the many other businesses that increasingly have chosen to insist that their consumers or employees submit to arbitration and explicitly relinquish any right to sue them \u2013 argue that the process, which is binding on both sides, is more efficient.  So score one for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has proposed a new rule that \u2013 if it overcomes what is likely to be fierce objection from the big banks and credit card companies \u2013 would return to us the right to bring class-action lawsuits against those institutions.  The American Chamber of Commerce hovered on the edge of apoplexy in its response to the CFPB\u2019s announcement of the proposed new rule. The agency \u201cis proposing to give the biggest gift to plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers in a half century \u2013 at the expense of the consumers the agency is charged with protecting,\u201d the business group said in a statement. Arbitration may be efficient, but it\u2019s costly for consumers \u2013 especially for those concerned about precisely the kind of small fees that can put immense pressure on already struggling families.  It also can be a process that, while efficient, is far from equitable or just. A 2011 supreme court ruling opened the way for many companies to insist that their consumers or employees sign away their right to sue in favor of arbitration clauses. People who might have banded together as plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit \u2013 sharing the costs of fighting a large corporation or finding a lawyer willing to shoulder those costs in hopes of a share of a payout on behalf of thousands of plaintiffs, not just a single individual \u2013 must act individually in arbitration.  A team of New York Times reporters last year pointed out the abuses inherent in this system, which they described as amounting to a \u201cprivatization of the justice system\u201d, in a series of articles that were finalists for this year\u2019s Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting. Among the cases they documented were a woman working aboard a cruise ship, who, after alleging that two fellow employees had drugged her, raped her and left her unconscious in her cabin, discovered that she couldn\u2019t sue her employer for permitting an unsafe workplace to occur.     If you have shopped online, rented a car, you\u2019ve agreed to arbitration. Banks are the tip of the proverbial iceberg    There are myriad ways in which arbitration doesn\u2019t measure up to the kind of recourse that you can seek in a court, if you feel that your bank or credit card company has taken advantage of you, sought to mis-sell you a product from a mutual fund to a mortgage, that isn\u2019t in your interests, or simply overcharged you. First of all, any lawyer could hear your case (not necessarily a judge), and that lawyer could have done work (or still be working) for JP Morgan Chase or American Express while deciding your case. There\u2019s no way to appeal the outcome \u2013 remember, this is binding arbitration. The bank that you\u2019re up against gets to pay witnesses to testify on their behalf and can order its own employees to do the same. Little or none of that would be acceptable in a court of law.  And it isn\u2019t just banks that do this. If you have a mobile phone contract, you\u2019ve agreed to arbitration. If you\u2019ve signed an employment agreement, ditto. Have you shopped online? Rented a car? Signed up for cable internet? Yup, you\u2019ve signed that small print. The banks are the tip of the proverbial iceberg. The banking industry, if anything, has become worse in the way it has treated those customers least able to push back: ordinary checking account customers. The Pew Charitable Trusts\u2019 study found that \u201cthe prevalence of harmful overdraft fees and account terms showed little change or\u201d had grown worse since its prior study a few years earlier. Only 16% of banks automatically decline charges that would result in a bank customer overdrawing an account \u2013 even though most bank customers don\u2019t recall opting into overdraft service, a lucrative source of bank fees. Of the largest banks, more than a third still don\u2019t have a complete disclosure of all banking terms and fees.  Against that backdrop, there is plenty of room for problems to emerge, and forcing bank clients into arbitration just ensures that the banks will win, by default, if only because so few consumers will ever file a case. It\u2019s a few hundred dollars to do so, but if you lose, you may have to pay the bank\u2019s costs. Look for a lot of infuriated rhetoric and saber-rattling from the banks during the 90-day comment period, and before the new CFPB rule takes effect next year. Because this is the biggest constraint on their ability to make money from consumer banking in decades, and the biggest restriction imposed on their overall business since the passage of Dodd-Frank Act and the Volcker Rule, which required them to strip themselves of some of their riskier (and more profitable) businesses. Now, lumbered with the need to keep more capital on their balance sheets as a result of those post-crisis regulations, the banks already have turned to consumer banking fees as one lucrative source of income.  The disconcerting element of this reaction is the threat of punishment to be directed at precisely those small consumers, already struggling with higher banking fees. It echoes, eerily, what we\u2019ve already heard from the financial industry in the wake of the Labor Department\u2019s announcement of tougher new rules (the new \u201cfiduciary\u201d standard) requiring that financial advisers be more prudent and vigilant when it comes to managing our retirement assets. The industry has said that\u2019s going to cost them so much more in time and money that they\u2019ll simply stop working with a lot of clients altogether \u2013 of course, the smaller, less affluent clients.  Now, the infuriated bankers are warning of something similar: that consumers will find loans more costly or harder to get, because the higher costs of all the class-action lawsuits that banks expect to be hit with will have to be passed along to someone. Here\u2019s a thought. Maybe they could just stop doing stuff that leaves them liable to either class-action lawsuits or arbitration complaints? Then everyone would be happy. I know \u2013 this is planet Earth we\u2019re living on, but it\u2019s worth throwing out for discussion, before all the shouting starts.",
