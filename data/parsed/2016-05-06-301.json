They leave the Tories relieved, Labour saying it could have been worse, Ukip alive if going nowhere and the Liberal Democrats barely out of their concussion from last year\u2019s election thrashing.   Related: UK elections: Sadiq Khan ahead in London mayoral race - live updates    Jeremy Corbyn can take modest comfort from an outcome less grim than many foretold. But many foretold Armageddon. Mid-term elections are supposed to show a surge of support for opposition parties under new leaders. Labour held on to the likes of Southampton, Redditch and Crawley and should be boosted later on Friday by a win for Sadiq Khan as London\u2019s mayor. But victorious Labour councillors kept stressing their successes were \u201clocal\u201d. Nowhere was Corbyn\u2019s name the talisman of recovery. The Tories should have suffered an electoral heart attack after David Cameron\u2019s ongoing Euro-splits and budget debacles. As it is they had a not-all-bad night. The party can take strength from the continuation of Labour\u2019s horror north of the border. Scottish Labour was wiped out in Glasgow and looks certain to cede official opposition status to resurgent Tories. The merger of Scottish Labour and Scotland\u2019s nationalists must be on the horizon one day, perhaps when the present generation of former Scottish Labour MPs acknowledges reality. Scotland\u2019s politics must snap out of its tribalism and recover the conventional left-right dichotomy. The success of the impressive Tory leader, Ruth Davidson, can only hasten that day.   Related: UK elections 2016 at a glance: the key points and results    Labour has held on to governing power in Wales, where to lose would once have been as unthinkable as in Scotland. Its vote share continues to decline, with Ukip advancing strongly. Defeat in Rhondda is a historical sensation, though to lose it to Plaid Cymru\u2019s leader, Leanne Wood, is at least a special factor. The advice to Corbyn to stay aloof from Wales was probably sound \u2013 but success due to a leader\u2019s absence rather than presence is desperate. The conclusion so far is that the once monolithic character of British politics continues to fracture. Devolution to Scotland and Wales has inevitably driven them down distinctive paths. Political England too is diversifying. Mayoral elections are going with personality rather than party. The Tories should see a warning sign in their weakening in the rural south. Here, relentless cuts to local spending are demoralising local parties, while towns and counties are seething at rural planning control being ceded to developers. For the Tories, the EU referendum lies ominously ahead next month. They would be foolish to rely on Corbyn as their chief electoral asset.",
