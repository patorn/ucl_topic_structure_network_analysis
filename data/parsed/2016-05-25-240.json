We hear all the time about how the pressure to keep up with the shiny, happy people we see on Facebook is making our mental health suffer.  It can seem that everyone else\u2019s existence is all #marbs, postcoital selfies, and smug invitation acceptances. Except for my Instagram feed, which is literally just pictures of Hampstead Heath. That very sort of self-deprecation, however, is becoming a thing. A popular internet trope is now the antisocial individual, the homebody, the push back from scenesters. It\u2019s now all about revelling in singledom, jokes about therapy sessions, the terror of being an adult or putting it out there that hitting a club can actually be pretty hellish. And slumming it on the couch? Heaven.  The most popular memes on humour and pop-culture-based Instagram and Twitter accounts such as The Fat Jewish and Girl With No Job et al? Pictures of cats chilling on couches, confessions of a sub-par life and vignettes of people expressing a (sort of) joking disdain for other people. Or as one poster puts it: \u201cGod bless Uber drivers that don\u2019t attempt small talk\u201d.     A picture of a cat meme on missing out Photograph: Instagram/The Fat Jewish/@friend_of_bae    Claudia Oshry, who runs the hugely popular Girl With No Job Instagram account (2 million followers), which consists of collated memes and tweets, tells me that self-deprecating posts are the most popular because we like to feel that we\u2019re not alone in not living the perfect life. \u201cEveryone is surprised to realise that other people feel the same way about staying in and watching Netflix. Most people wouldn\u2019t admit out loud that they\u2019d prefer to binge watch TV and eat pizza instead of going out to the fanciest dinner or club. It\u2019s nice to know you\u2019re not the only one.\u201d When Caterina Fake popularised the idea of (FOMO) or the fear of missing out, she wrote that the internet itself exacerbated this anxiety, and I\u2019m sure she is right. But, in a world of constantly switched-on, ostentatious displays of popularity and people having an ostensibly TOTALLY AWESOME TIME, perhaps it isn\u2019t surprising that things would start to pitch in the opposite direction (known as JOMO, joy of missing out). Look at the popularity of down-to-earth celebs such as Jennifer Lawrence, who ordered a McDonalds from the Oscars red carpet. Or Alessia Cara\u2019s single Here.     Girl With No Job has 2 million followers. Who can\u2019t relate to this feeling? Photograph: Instagram @girlwithnojob    Also: we\u2019re increasingly comfortable with being a bit rubbish, or as the Twitter account with 350,000 followers (and now book) has it: So Sad Today. The Nailed It meme is a perfect example of this. Life isn\u2019t Goop. Real life is not Photoshopped, and life hacks almost never work. The Expectation v Reality memes continue this theme \u2013 a visual representation of what psychologists call \u201cthe incongruence gap\u201d. In short: this celeb with perfectly coiffed hair versus your matted tangled beehive when you try to copy it.      An example of the hugely popular Expectation v Reality memes Photograph: Buzzfeed    There\u2019s the sense that, and perhaps it\u2019s even stronger among millennials, we\u2019re all somewhat inadequate as adults. We\u2019re awful at cooking, we don\u2019t understand pensions, and we just wanna be left alone to watch marathons of Broad City. When we realise, as Oshry says, that other people feel this way too, we feel better.  Maggy van Eijk, the social media editor of Buzzfeed UK agrees. She explains how the process there works: \u201cWe have a group of photoshop wizards and illustrators called the distribution squad and we all create one-off memes, jokes, [and] illustrations that work as standalone pieces for Facebook, Instagram, Tumblr and Twitter. The best of them and most viral are the self-deprecating.  \u201cI think this is because it makes people either go \u2018this is so me\u2019 or they tag their best friend and go \u2018this is so you\u2019 or best-case scenario they say \u2018this is so us\u2019 and tag a bunch of their friends so it gets shared more widely.\u201d Van Eijk tells me top themes are being \u201cshit at make-up, loving dogs more than humans, eating pizza, not showering or exercising, and not going to the gym\u201d.  \u201cOne of our most recent comics that really went wild had to do with \u2018shaving your legs for summer\u2019 and how that really only means you shave your ankles because you can\u2019t be bothered with the rest, and I thought that was so telling. It\u2019s unlikely you\u2019re going to write a Facebook status that says: \u2018HEY GUYS I\u2019m only shaving my ankles because this is what I feel is the norm and the rest of me is fucking hairy get over it\u2019 but by sharing the comic they can hide behind the meme while also making a bit of statement.\u201d  The British have always been quite good at this dry sense of humour (just look at the success, for instance, of toilet books like Crap Towns) but it\u2019s perhaps surprising to see the take up in America. Or perhaps it is just that with millennials being screwed in the job and housing markets, we can\u2019t do much but laugh instead of cry online.    Related: Essena O'Neill quits Instagram claiming social media 'is not real life'    Even social media stars such Essena O\u2019Neill have revealed that their perfect online presence is just a ruse. Oshry says that the glamorous party photo pics are still popular too (\u201cthe internet has enough room for all types of content\u201d). And psychotherapist and writer Philippa Perry cautions that these posts becoming more and more popular might just be a knock-on effect of people trying to cash in on the likes. Perry tells me: \u201cPeople find [it] brave and attractive so more people experiment with being \u2018real\u2019 but I cynically suggest that perhaps rather than being \u2018real\u2019 it\u2019s just that this type of self-depreciation has been proven to be attractive so it\u2019s becoming more popular.\u201d This also crops up when I speak to the creator behind the @friend_of_bae account, who mentions that these type of dgaf posts have indeed become \u201ctrendy\u201d.  But Perry also says that she recently posted a picture with \u201cfour unwashed mugs to show how not great I am at work\u201d, which is comforting to those of us with three empty Coke cans on their desk.  Even if some posts are a facade or it is all a backlash to Rich Kids of Instagram \u2013 that it\u2019s cool to be uncool \u2013 one thing is for sure, being more and more OK with the fact we\u2019re all socially anxious animals, competing for who has the most banal life and poorest life skills is probably a damn sight more healthy (and easier) than attempting to out-glam each other or #eat the #cleanest. I declare our new love of self-deprecation to be a positive thing. Now excuse me while I brush the Doritos crumbs off my shirt, and go hang out on Hampstead Heath because I have been invited to precisely zero parties.",
