  "body": "\u2022 An interview with Stephan James, who stars in a new film about the athlete Jesse Owens, Race (\u2018Being famous didn\u2019t mean anything. Jesse Owens was still black\u2019, 27 May, page 14, G2), said that Owens\u2019 record for the 100m was 9.4\u00a0seconds. That was actually his time for the 100-yard dash; he won the 100-metre sprint at the Berlin Olympics in 1936 with a time of 10.3 seconds. \u2022 In an article reporting that 40,000 properties in London are owned by offshore companies, an increase of 9% in the past 10 months (Offshore London: secretive firms buying up the capital, 27\u00a0May, page 1), we said the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea \u201cincludes the wealthy enclaves of Fulham and Knightsbridge\u201d. The former is actually part of the neighbouring borough of Hammersmith and Fulham. \u2022 We misnamed the serial killer Aileen Wuornos as Eileen Wournos (Last night\u2019s TV, 26 May, page 21, G2). \u2022 Because of an error in a press release from Eurostar, an article about the company\u2019s new Snap fares for train services between London and Paris or Brussels said that the tickets, which cost \u00a325 each way, \u201ccan only be booked the week before travel\u201d. In fact they must be booked at least seven days before travel (Cheaper Eurostar fares for flexible travellers, 26 May, page 23).",
