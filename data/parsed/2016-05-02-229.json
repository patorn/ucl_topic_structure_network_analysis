  "body": "Related: Who ya gonna call? Why Ghostbusters is leading the charge for female buddy movies    Florence Foster Jenkins Hugh Grant and Meryl Streep have some lovely chemistry in this bittersweet sentimental comedy, based on a true story. Streep plays Florence Foster Jenkins, a wealthy 1940s socialite who believed she was a wonderful soprano despite being embarrassingly tone-deaf; Grant plays her wayward but adoring husband and manager. PB\u20226 May (all dates are UK release dates). Everybody Wants Some!! Richard Linklater, creator of the real-time masterpiece Boyhood, returns with a movie which seems rooted in the slacker world of his earlier films \u2013 with a deceptive hint of National Lampoon\u2019s Animal House. It\u2019s the 80s, and we follow a group of college students as they goof off, make out etc. Yet there\u2019s something more reflective, too. PB\u202213 May.     Student bodies \u2026 Richard Linklater\u2019s Everybody Wants Some!! Photograph: LMK    Mustang A complex, intelligent and hugely admired debut from the Turkish film-maker Deniz Gamze Erg\u00fcven, co-written with French director Alice Winocour. A quintet of orphaned teen sisters have some innocent fun on the beach with some boys, and their fierce grandma accuses them of loose morals, imprisons them in the house and orders them to prepare for marriage. It\u2019s a story from Turkey with a very European flavour. PB\u202213 May.   Related: Curtain-raisers: the best theatre of summer 2016    Whiskey Tango Foxtrot The title encodes an expression which in times of stress becomes Whiskey Tango Alpha Foxtrot. 30 Rock\u2019s Tina Fey, the empress of American comedy, plays Kim, a game but chaotic journalist covering Iraq and Afghanistan, and emotionally out of her depth. The movie is based on a memoir by the real-life war correspondent Kim Barker. PB\u202213 May.     Tina Fey in Whiskey Tango Foxtrot. Photograph: Allstar/Paramount    X-Men: Apocalypse The superhero movies just keep on coming. Bryan Singer directs this new outing for Marvel\u2019s X-Men, including Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s Mystique, who must battle a mutant, Apocalypse, played by Oscar Isaac. The film will have to reach high to match Quicksilver\u2019s wonderful slo-mo sequence, to Jim Croce\u2019s Time in a Bottle, in X-Men: Days of Future Past. PB\u202218 May.     Jennifer Lawrence, Rose Byrne, James McAvoy, Lucas Till and Nicholas Hoult in X-Men: Apocalypse. Photograph: Allstar/20th Century Fox    Sing Street Irish film-maker John Carney plucked the world\u2019s heartstrings on screen and then stage with his musical Once. Now he\u2019s back with this winningly nostalgic tale of a teenager in 1980s Dublin who dreams of being in a band. This sweet-natured movie has won comparison with The Commitments. PB\u202220 May. Love and Friendship Jane Austen adaptations are in the air, what with the Pride and Prejudice and Zombies mashup and Curtis Sittenfeld\u2019s new novel Eligible, also a reworking of P&P; now Whit Stillman releases his droll and elegant version of Austen\u2019s early novella Lady Susan, with Kate Beckinsale in the lead. PB\u202227 May. Alice Through the Looking Glass A follow-up to Tim Burton\u2019s Alice, still with Mia Wasikowska as Alice, Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter and Helena Bonham Carter as the Red Queen. Burton has ceded directorial responsibilities to British film-maker James Bobin. The 2010 film was a big hit, so this will have something to live up to. PB\u202227 May. Warcraft: The Beginning The fantasy role-playing game Warcraft \u2013 already rolled out in the form of video games, novels, comics and a myriad of collectibles \u2013 now has a movie iteration. The peaceful realm of Azeroth is threatened by an orc incursion. Duncan Jones (who made Moon and Source Code) directs. PB\u202230 May.     Warcraft: The Beginning. Photograph: Allstar/Universal Pictures    The Nice Guys Shane Black is the veteran action writer-director who gave us the cult hit Kiss Kiss Bang Bang in 2005 and hit serious paydirt with Iron Man 3. His new film is a comedy crime noir set in 70s LA, and features the mouthwatering pairing of Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling: they are a private detective and his associate who investigate the death of a porn star. PB\u20223 June.            Where to Invade Next Maybe the Obama years have caused a mellowing and a brightening in the great man, because Michael Moore\u2019s new documentary isn\u2019t an attack on American military ambitions. Actually, it\u2019s a friendly tour of other countries \u2013 an \u201cinvasion\u201d designed to cherry pick the best social welfare ideas from places such as France, Portugal and Finland. PB\u202210 June. Fire at Sea Italian film-maker Gianfranco Rosi earned a cult following for his documentary about Rome, Sacro GRA. This new movie won him the Golden Bear at Berlin. It\u2019s a powerful documentary study of Lampedusa, tracking its frontline experience of the refugee crisis over a year. PB\u202210 June.     Gianfranco Rosi\u2019s Fire at Sea    The Conjuring 2  The first chiller about the real-life 1970s paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren \u2013 who later became famous for their involvement in the Amityville affair \u2013 went over nicely at the box office. Now they are back, played again by Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga, and travelling to London to investigate a haunting. PB\u202217 June. Tale of Tales Matteo Garrone\u2019s excursion into rococo fantasy and myth is one of the most gloriously strange films of the year: fabular and fabulous. It is taken from the 16th-century Italian folk tales of Giambattista Basile, and it is bizarre, hilarious and erotic, with hints of Python and Blackadder. There is a glorious performance from Toby Jones as an eccentric king and great turns from Vincent Cassel, John C Reilly and Salma Hayek. PB\u202217 June.     Salma Hayek in Tale of Tales.    Elvis and Nixon Forget about Batman and Superman: this is the really freaky pairing: a real-life meeting in 1970, immortalised in a famously bizarre formal handshake photo. Elvis Presley had showed up unannounced at the White House, and wanted the President to swear him in as an undercover drug enforcement agent. Ironic, considering his consumption of prescription medication. Michael Shannon is Elvis and Kevin Spacey, of course, is Tricky Dicky. PB\u202224 June. Independence Day: Resurgence  Belated follow-up to the popular 1996 alien-invasion blockbuster, which featured Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum saving the planet alongside Clinton-esque prez Bill Pullman. Smith isn\u2019t returning, but a second battle feet of the same extra-terrestrial nasties apparently will be \u2013 and pretty much everyone else, including director Roland Emmerich. Liam Hemsworth is the main new addition. AP\u202224 June.   Related: Beyonc\u00e9 and beyond: the hottest sounds of summer 2016    Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie The success of The Inbetweeners Movie has given a new lease of life to British TV sitcom spin-off films, and Jennifer Saunders\u2019 PR-spoofing show follows Dad\u2019s Army into cinemas. It doesn\u2019t sound like the fruit will fall too far from the tree with this one. Saunders and Joanna Lumley will return as Edina and Patsy, with one of the show\u2019s directors, Mandie Fletcher, getting the nod for the feature. Sanders and co are clearly not afraid of the curse of the celebrity cameo: dozens have been announced, including Graham Norton, Twiggy, and Elton John. AP\u20221 July. Maggie\u2019s Plan Rebecca Miller, the writer and director of Personal Velocity and The Private Lives of Pippa Lee, has come up with a more conventional comic premise for her fifth feature: Greta Gerwig plays a woman whose plan to have a baby on her own goes awry when she meets and marries Ethan Hawke\u2019s hunky academic. The film did well at its premiere at Toronto, with Julianne Moore receiving lots of plaudits for playing Hawke\u2019s Danish-accented ex-wife. AP\u20228 July. The Legend of Tarzan The latest film about Edgar Rice Burroughs\u2019 tree-swinger features Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd as a more mature Lord Greystoke, back in central Africa years after the \u201cclassic\u201d Tarzan period. The last live-action Tarzan was 20 years ago, so perhaps we are ready for this expensive reboot. Harry Potter maestro David Yates is in charge of this one; only time will tell if he has another franchise on his hands. AP\u20228 July.       Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd in The Legend of Tarzan.    Ghostbusters The first emanation from the new \u201cGhostbusters universe\u201d is the much touted female-fronted one, with the Bridesmaids one-two of Melissa McCarthy and Kristen Wiig joined by SNL\u2019s Kate McKinnon and Leslie Jones for more ghost-busting shenanigans. This caught a bit of flak after the trailer appeared to show African American Jones confined to a non-scientist, \u201cstreet\u201d type role; though whether it will pan out like that remains to be seen. If the release goes well, though, there\u2019ll be more Ghostbusters \u2013 a male-fronted one, and a cartoon \u2013 coming down the pipe. AP\u202215 July. Star Trek Beyond The third in the latest cycle of Star Trek films (but the 13th feature version overall). With JJ Abrams otherwise occupied on the Star Wars franchise, Justin \u201cFast & Furious\u201d Lin steps into the director\u2019s role. Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto are back as Kirk and Spock, with Simon Pegg adding script duties to his regular role as Scotty. Not much has been revealed, other than that Idris Elba plays the villain Krall, and that the crew are stranded on a planet after being attacked \u201cby a powerful, unstoppable wave of unknown aliens\u201d. So it\u2019s as you were, basically. AP\u202222 July. The BFG  Roald Dahl\u2019s 1982 novel was turned into an animated film in 1989, but now Steven Spielberg has made a live-action version, and it looks like it could be summer\u2019s big family blockbuster. Man of the moment Mark Rylance is the amiable giant who kidnaps a little girl to help him defeat a tribe of menacing man-eating giants. Spielberg has cast an unknown, 11-year-old Ruby Barnhill, opposite Rylance. This sort of kids\u2019 fantasy tends to bring out Spielberg\u2019s best qualities; definitely one to look forward to. AP\u202222 July.     Mark Rylance and Ruby Barnhill in The BFG. Photograph: AP    Finding Dory Pixar\u2019s new one is a sequel to its 2003 hit Finding Nemo (you know: clownfish, lost, Willem Dafoe, sharks). Here, the focus is on Nemo\u2019s forgetful pal Dory (Ellen DeGeneres, in the original as well as this), who embarks on a quest to find her family in California. The moderate response to 2015\u2019s The Good Dinosaur took a bit of the gloss off Pixar\u2019s reputation, and Finding Dory would seem at this distance to be solid rather than inspired. But we\u2019re happy to be proved wrong. AP\u202229 July. Jason Bourne Paul Greengrass is back in the Bourne saddle for the first time since 2007\u2019s Bourne Ultimatum (after taking a break for 2012\u2019s not universally admired Bourne Legacy). This one seems to be an attempt to recalibrate the spy series as an open-ended franchise. Not a lot of info is available, other than a trailer that suggests Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is indeed back, and he\u2019s protecting former contact Nicky Parsons (Julia Stiles). Alicia Vikander is the most eye-catching new recruit to the series, playing some sort of agency aide, while Riz Ahmed is along for the ride, too. AP\u202229 July.     Matt Damon in Jason Bourne. Photograph: Allstar/Universal Pictures    Suicide Squad A supervillain match-up movie featuring the Joker, Deadshot, Boomerang et al, as part of DC Comics\u2019 belated attempt to rival Marvel\u2019s \u201cextended universe\u201d blockbusters. Having seen Batman v Superman flounder if not exactly flop, DC will be pinning a lot of hopes on this. Directed by Fury\u2019s David Ayer, it stars the likes of Will Smith, Jared Leto and Margot Robbie, and has the baddies teaming up in a task force to save the world. If this doesn\u2019t work, there\u2019s the Justice League movie just over the hill \u2026 AP\u20225 August. David Brent: Life on the Road Another TV spin-off \u2013 this time more likely to appeal to the Alpha Papa crowd rather than the Dad\u2019s Army one. Ricky Gervais dusts down his fondly remembered Office alter ego David Brent for a feature-length outing, which he wrote, directs and stars in. He seems to be trying a bit harder than most spin-offers: Brent is trying to rekindle his dreams of music-biz stardom in this one. If the trailer is anything to go by, Gervais will also be taking advantage of cinema\u2019s less restrictive morals, with some nuclear-level potty-mouthing. AP\u202219 August.     Ricky Gervais as David Brent. Photograph: Planet Photos/BBC Films/PLANET PHOTOS    Swallows and Amazons Arthur Ransome\u2019s classic kids\u2019 yarn is adapted for the screen for the first time since 1974. Inevitably, though, the much giggled-over character name Titty has been changed \u2026 to Tatty. There is a cast of biggish names \u2013 Rafe Spall, Kelly Macdonald, Harry Enfield \u2013 and a newly inserted plot strand about a suspicious-looking spy, apparently inspired by Ransome\u2019s own \u201cdiplomatic\u201d activities on both sides during his time in revolutionary Russia. Lots of splendid Lake District countryside, however, is assured. AP\u202219 August. Ben-Hur This is one of those remakes that no one had particularly asked for. But, possibly inspired by the rise of the faith film audience, the \u201ctale of the Christ\u201d is to get another workout. Boardwalk Empire\u2019s Jack Huston steps into the Charlton Heston role of the Jewish prince forced into slavery by the Romans; Toby Kebbell is Messala, the former childhood friend he takes on in a chariot race. It isn\u2019t likely, if we\u2019re honest, to match the 1959 version\u2019s 11 Oscars \u2013 but is potentially an entertaining romp all the same. AP\u202226 August.            Julieta Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s unlikely take on the work of Canadian short-story maestro Alice Munro has acquired some distracting notoriety, after the Spanish auteur and his brother were named in the Panama Papers; Almod\u00f3var promptly withdrew from press activity. Julieta, which will premiere at Cannes, features Emma Su\u00e1rez (best known for her work with Julio Medem) as a woman looking for her runaway daughter. AP\u202226 August. War Dogs Todd Phillips, king of the stoner-bromance movie, goes a tad more heavyweight here, with this arms-trading comedy (you heard that right) based on a non-fiction book called Arms and the Dudes. Miles Teller and Jonah Hill play the Miami stoners who luck into a $300m contract to supply guns to the military in Afghanistan. Producer Bradley Cooper has a supporting role as a major league arms dealer. AP\u202226 August.",
