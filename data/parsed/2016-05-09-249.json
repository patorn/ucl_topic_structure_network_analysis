  "body": "Pye Corner Audio \u2013 Perfect Secrecy Forever Audio have been making incredible records at an astounding rate for a few years now and I recommend every single one. This is from a recent split album and is classic Italo-themed psychedelic electronic music.             Sheer Mag \u2013 Fan the Flames   I finally saw this band at SXSW and they were incredible. All my friends in Glasgow got me into this record, it\u2019s loud and catchy. I can see them doing really well. Every song sounds like a hit.              Lubomyr Melnyk \u2013 Parasol   Every record I hear on Erased Tapes is tremendous but this might be the best of them all. Very unique solo piano music. Incredibly soulful and beautiful.             Mdou Moctar \u2013 Tahoultine I first heard this guy on the incredible Music from Saharan Cellphones compilation and he blew me away. I saw him play last year and was mesmerising. A total rock star.             Minor Victories\u2019 self-titled album will be released through Play It Again Sam on 3 June",
