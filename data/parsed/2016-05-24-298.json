  "body": "Robin Hanson thinks the robot takeover, when it comes, will be in the form of emulations. In his new book, The Age of Em, the economist explains: you take the best and brightest 200 human beings on the planet, you scan their brains and you get robots that to all intents and purposes are indivisible from the humans on which they are based, except a thousand times faster and better.   Related: The Guardian view on artificial intelligence: look out, it\u2019s ahead of you | Editorial    For some reason, conversationally, Hanson repeatedly calls these 200 human prototypes \u201cthe billionaires\u201d, even though having a billion in any currency would be strong evidence against your being the brightest, since you have no sense of how much is enough. But that\u2019s just a natural difference of opinion between an economist and a mediocre person who is now afraid of the future. These Ems, being superior at everything and having no material needs that couldn\u2019t be satisfied virtually, will undercut humans in the labour market, and render us totally unnecessary. We will all effectively be retired. Whether or not we are put out to a pleasant pasture or brutally exterminated will depend upon how we behave towards the Ems at their incipience. When Hanson presents his forecast in public, one question always comes up: what\u2019s to stop the Ems killing us off? \u201cWell, why don\u2019t we exterminate retirees at the moment?\u201d he asks, rhetorically, before answering: some combination of gratitude, empathy and affection between individuals, which the Ems, being modelled on us precisely, will share (unless we use real billionaires for the model). Opinion on the precise shape of the robot future remains divided: the historian Yuval Noah Harari argues, in Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow, that artificial intelligence robots will be the first to achieve world domination. This future is bleaker than Hanson\u2019s \u2013 lacking empathy, those robots wouldn\u2019t have a sentimental affection for us as their progenitors \u2013 but essentially the same. Harari predicts the rise of the useless class: humans who don\u2019t know what to study because they have no idea what skills will be needed by the time they finish, who can\u2019t work because there\u2019s always a cheaper and better robot, and spend their time taking drugs and staring at screens. These intricacies, AI versus Ems, AI versus IA (intelligence amplification, where humans aren\u2019t superseded by our technological advances but enhanced by them) fascinate futurologists. Hanson argues that AI is moving too slowly, while only three technologies need coincide to make an Em possible: faster and cheaper computers, which the world has in hand; brain scanning, which is being worked on by a much smaller but active biological community; and the modelling of the human mind, \u201cwhich is harder to predict\u201d.   Related: AI will create 'useless class' of human, predicts bestselling historian    But all the predictions lead to the same place: the obsolescence of human labour. Even if a robot takeover is some way away, this idea has already become pressing in specific sectors. Driverless cars are forecast to make up 75% of all traffic by 2040, raising the spectre not just of leagues of unemployed drivers, but also of the transformation of all the infrastructure around the job, from training to petrol stations. There is always a voice in the debate saying, we don\u2019t have to surrender to our own innovation: we don\u2019t have to automate everything just because we can. Yet history teaches us that we will, and teaches us, furthermore, that resisting invention is its own kind of failure. Fundamentally, if the big idea of a progressive future is to cling on to work for the avoidance of worklessness, we could dream up jobs that were bolder and much more fulfilling than driving. There are two big threats posed by an automated future. The first \u2013 that we will irritate the robots and they will dominate and swiftly obliterate us \u2013 is for Hollywood to worry about. There is not much apparatus we can build in advance to make ourselves less annoying. There will undoubtedly be those who believe our obliteration is so inevitable that every other anxiety is a sideshow. If you can hold your nerve against that, the critical question becomes: in a world without work, how do we distribute resources? It is a question articulated precisely by Stephen Hawking last year, when he noted: \u201cEveryone can enjoy a life of luxurious leisure if the machine-produced wealth is shared, or most people can end up miserably poor if the machine owners successfully lobby against wealth redistribution.\u201d     \u2018Driverless cars are forecast to make up 75% of all traffic by 2040.\u2019 A driverless car in Nevada.

The question of how to distribute wealth in the future curves back round to meet a conundrum raised by the past: how do we remake the social safety net so that it embodies solidarity, generosity and trust, rather than the welfare state of the present, rickety with the woodworm of mutual suspicion. The idea of a universal basic income is generally framed as a way to \u201cshift from the Beveridge principle of national insurance based on contributions and the sharing of risk, to a system of income as of right\u201d (as described in a Compass paper by Howard Reed and Stewart Lansley). In its simplest iteration, all citizens receive the same income. There is work to be done on the numbers \u2013 whether this income needs to be supplemented for housing, in what form it has its most progressive effect, whether and how it is taxed back in the higher deciles, how it can be affordable at the same time as genuinely livable. There is also work to be done on the surrounding incentives, whether a basic income would capsize the work ethic and leave the world understaffed while we await the robot takeover (a pilot scheme in Canada concluded the only groups who worked less with an income were mothers of young babies and teenagers still in education; other pilots are under way in Kenya and across Europe). Enter the future, with its possibility that many vocations will be unnecessary, and we face more existential questions: how do we find meaning without work? How do we find fellowship without status? How do we fill leisure intelligently? These mysteries possessed Bertrand Russell and John Maynard Keynes, then fell out of currency as we realised we could consume our way out of futility, and ignite our urge to earn by spending it before it arrived. Even absenting the constraints of the globe, that plan has failed. Consumption may have lent necessity to work, but it didn\u2019t confer meaning upon it. And perhaps the most profound accommodation we have to make with the future isn\u2019t whether or not we are capable of sharing, but where we will find our impetus. \u201cCan you just write,\u201d Hanson asked at the end of our conversation, \u201cthat even though I\u2019m talking about dire and dramatic things, I\u2019m a friendly guy who smiles a lot?\u201d I\u2019m not sure how much this helps. Some of his predictions are only bearable if you assume that you\u2019ll have died before they come to pass. Hanson doesn\u2019t insist that his is the only possible outcome. Rather, \u201cyou should expect that, whatever change is going to happen, it\u2019s going to happen pretty fast. Like, five years from nothing different that you\u2019d notice to a completely different world. What I want is to have people understand how urgent it is, when this thing shows up, to have made a plan.\u201d     \u2018Pepper\u2019 at Softbank headquarters in Tokyo, Japan.
