  "body": "Erin Taylor-Talcott won a fight for equality. But her reward sounds more like punishment to most people. Taylor-Talcott is a walker. Not in the sense that you might walk to the store or walk for fitness. She walks long distances \u2013 longer than women have previously walked in major competitions. The Olympic track and field program includes one women\u2019s event for every men\u2019s event \u2026 except for the 50km race walk. But Taylor-Talcott has pushed for the right to compete alongside men in the 50km walk. On 8 May, she did it, competing in the IAAF World Race Walking Team Championships in Rome. She finished 40th, the last person across the finish line, in 4 hours, 51 minutes and 8 seconds. But plenty of competitors didn\u2019t finish. And most of us wouldn\u2019t have the fitness or the will to even try a sport that gives most people instant shin splints and leaves Taylor-Talcott comparing her post-race appetite to that of a hippo. \u201cIt\u2019s a difficult endeavor,\u201d says Curt Clausen, who won a 1999 World Championship bronze medal in the 50km. \u201cIt\u2019s four hours of intensity at a heart rate higher than or equal to marathon running. The turnover rate is more akin to 800m running. The range of motion is that of a place kicker.\u201d And it\u2019s an awkward motion, befuddling people who see it for the first time. Taylor-Talcott heard plenty of comments in high school. \u201cMy dad was my coach, and he was up in the stands when three girls came up to him and asked: \u2018What\u2019s wrong with her?\u2019\u201d Taylor-Talcott said by email. \u201cHe had to explain that nothing was wrong, that I was doing that on purpose.\u201d Walking is also ripe for parody, and Clausen once assisted with the humor, training Bryan Cranston for a Malcolm in the Middle episode \u2013 Cranston learned it too well and had to be \u201cdeconstructed\u201d to make it funnier, Clausen says. In his pre-Science Guy days, Bill Nye had a recurring character as a speed-walking super hero who \u201cfights crime while maintaining strict adherence to the regulations of the International Speed Walking Association. Heel, toe, heel, toe!\u201d The \u201cInternational Speed Walking Association\u201d doesn\u2019t really exist, though an enterprising group from Knoxville claimed a Facebook page with that name five years ago. Competitive walking is under the auspices of the IAAF, track and field\u2019s organizing body. One woman can\u2019t make the IAAF add an event. But until more women are competing, Taylor-Talcott has won the right to compete alongside men in the longest track and field event. Why do something so painful? \u201cI\u2019ve always loved doing long distances,\u201d Taylor-Talcott said. \u201cI enjoy getting out there, just me and the roads.\u201d The other motivation was simple: It\u2019s a matter of equality. \u201cI pushed to be able to race the 50km internationally because I really felt it was the right and fair thing. Why were guys able to qualify for an international team and race and I wasn\u2019t, just because I\u2019m a woman? I liked the idea of getting to push myself for a 50km on the international stage.\u201d Like a lot of track and field events, the 50km is getting faster. In this case, the records don\u2019t tell the whole story. Walkers rarely get ideal conditions \u2013 Clausen figures he could\u2019ve finished the 50km in 3hr 40min with good weather, but on a hot day in Seville in 1999, his time of 3.50:55 was enough to take bronze. Now, Clausen says, he might have to go 10 minutes faster. That medal was delayed, though, thanks to one of the sport\u2019s biggest temptations \u2013 doping. Clausen was fourth across the finish line that day. But Russia\u2019s German Skurygin was stripped of his gold medal after a positive doping test for a hormone called hCG. (Skurygin, one of many Russian walkers to serve doping suspensions in the past 15 years, died of a heart attack nine years later at age 45.) Even without doping, race walking is difficult to do within the rules. Still photos often catch walkers with both feet off the ground. Clausen says that\u2019s less likely at longer distances. Besides, the IAAF rule book (Rule 230) specifies that no \u201cvisible\u201d loss of contact occurs, and it specifies, \u201cto the human eye.\u201d Walking has several judges that can warn and eventually disqualify competitors, but it\u2019s nowhere near getting replay. The USA hasn\u2019t had a lot of success in the sport, in part because the NCAA has yet to show an interest. Collegiate walking has flourished in the NAIA, which caters mostly to smaller schools. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a mixed bag,\u201d Clausen says. \u201cOn the female side, I think we\u2019re very strong. On the male side, I think we\u2019re hurting.\u201d So Taylor-Talcott\u2019s activism could be a breakthrough on several levels, perhaps opening the door for another arena in which US women are ahead of the competition. So far, only 13 women are listed on the IAAF\u2019s list of all-time 50km performances. But more may be on the way soon. \u201cI\u2019ve been contacted by quite a few women who are already planning on doing a 50km and some who are trying to figure out which one to do,\u201d Taylor-Talcott said. And they\u2019ll be asking Taylor-Talcott for plenty of advice. How to train. How to eat and hydrate. Or even what occupies someone\u2019s mind through four or five hours of maintaining form while pushing the limits. \u201cIf it\u2019s training, I will sometimes let my mind wander and just go where my thoughts take me,\u201d Taylor-Talcott said. \u201cOther times I\u2019ll focus on something specific that I\u2019m working on with my technique. \u201cIn a race I\u2019ll make sure I\u2019m staying on pace and focusing on technique. But I also like to have fun, so I will joke with the spectators and sometimes talk to friends. It\u2019s how I do best when I\u2019m racing. If I\u2019m too serious, I can get too stressed out, so I make sure to keep it fun.  \u201cAfter all, I do love doing 50ks!\u201d",
