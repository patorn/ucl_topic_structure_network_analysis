In a bid to distract from Labor\u2019s rigorous and numerous \u201cpositive policies\u201d, the government has zeroed in on their expense, costing \u2013 one assumes generously \u2013 every one to reach a total of $66bn. It\u2019s a somewhat rubbery total because we don\u2019t know what assumptions went into reaching it. Asked how much of that $66bn was the price tag attached to the party\u2019s \u201caspirational statements\u201d, official campaign spokesman Mathias Cormann said it took in spending that Labor had called for \u201cin one way or another\u201d. Malcolm Turnbull later refused to show reporters the Coalition\u2019s working (\u201cI don\u2019t think you want to see them\u201d) but said the total was ac-tu-ally $67bn. Treasurer Scott Morrison later cleared it up with a chart \u2013 sort of.    .@ScottMorrisonMP @MathiasCormann list of Labor's black hole spending. Much discussion abt where figures come from pic.twitter.com/jYpmPm63Xe\u2014 Gabrielle Chan (@gabriellechan) May 24, 2016      The chart of death. Is there a black hole in your black hole? Not at all, says @ScottMorrisonMP and @MathiasCormann pic.twitter.com/Tz6fYF3YRI\u2014 Gabrielle Chan (@gabriellechan) May 24, 2016    \u201cWorst-case scenario is $67bn, best case is a $32bn black hole,\u201d he said. Well, a margin of error of $35bn seems reasonable.   Shadow treasurer Chris Bowen said the government was putting about a \u201cfantasy\u201d, and that Labor was not about to take \u201cany pious lectures\u201d when the company tax cuts at the centre of government\u2019s budget were \u201ccompletely and totally unfunded\u201d. Tony Burke suggested this path forward: \u201cDuring the campaign, Liberal policies will be announced by the Liberal party, Labor policies will be announced by the Labor party.\u201d The Coalition hasn\u2019t publicised its election costings yet, and Turnbull demurred when asked when we might expect them, saying the \u201creal issue\u201d of the day was \u201cthe flagrant wastefulness and recklessness\u201d of Labor\u2019s spending. (Not telecommunications blackspots in the electorate of Corangamite in Victoria, where he announced $60m more in funding for mobile phone towers.) Turnbull also referred to \u201cbillion dollar Bill\u201d, which, if anything, is complimentary of a man who has been known to drive his mum\u2019s car and be disconcertingly occupied with the price and varieties of lettuce. Anyway, those who live in harbourside mansions shouldn\u2019t throw stones. Shorten, meanwhile, today said Labour would legislate to protect Medicare from privatisation, on top of lifting the rebate freeze. That was the most expensive policy announcement of the campaign so far, not just Labor\u2019s. Trailblazer Nova Peris bows out Nova Peris, Labor Indigenous senator and Julia Gillard\u2019s captain\u2019s pick, has resigned after only one term of office in the Senate. In a statement, she said she will serve her term and \u201cfully support and endorse\u201d her replacement, whoever that might be. \u201cAs the first Aboriginal female in federal politics as well as the Labor party\u2019s first Aboriginal member in federal parliament I certainly had challenges, but none that I couldn\u2019t handle or was not prepared for, having already lived a very public and documented life.\u201d Peris said she would continue to fight racism and prejudice against Aboriginal people, and commended the Labor party\u2019s commitment to \u201caffirmative action\u201d, pointing out that the party had endorsed six Aboriginal candidates for the election. She would not be commenting further on her decision, but there were reports she was seeking a job with the AFL. Penny Wong, Labor\u2019s campaign spokesman and leader of the Senate, said Peris was a \u201ctrailblazer\u201d and a \u201cchampion of change\u201d. But Trish Crossin, the former Labor senator who was bumped by Gillard in favour of Peris, declared in the Australian: \u201cThis is what happens when you override a democracy.\u201d Nothing personal there. \u201cI do believe that the first female Indigenous parliament member needed to leave a legacy. And I don\u2019t think this is the sort of legacy I\u2019m referring to.\u201d Nothing personal at all! Crossin will doubtless be pleased to learn that there\u2019ll be no captain\u2019s picks for Peris\u2019s replacement: the decision will go to the ALP national executive. Names most mentioned include Malarndirri McCarthy, a former NT assembly member and journalist, and Marion Scrymgour, a former NT minister and deputy chief minister. Sunday night is fight night Turnbull and Shorten will square off for their first formal debate of the election campaign on Sunday night. In contrast to the people\u2019s forum two weeks ago, which was broadcast on Sky to what Fairfax called \u201ca modest viewing audience\u201d, the hour-long debate at the National Press Club in Canberra will be shown live on the ABC. The leaders will be asked questions by Chris Uhlmann, the moderator and ABC political editor, as well as a panel of three journalists. One hundred uncommitted voters found Shorten to be the winner of the people\u2019s forum. An announcement of the debate is expected tomorrow, following negotiations between the two campaigns.

Exclusive polling for Fairfax Media shows two-thirds of voters say the Turnbull government is doing \u201cnot very much\u201d or \u201cnothing at all\u201d to combat climate change. \u2022 \u2018Jobs and growth\u2019 mantra faces tough test (AAP/the Australian) AAP economist Garry Shilson-Josling assesses where, er, exactly those jobs might be. \u2022 Coalition, Labor and Greens urged to halve homelessness in next decade Australia\u2019s largest homelessness service providers, including Mission Australia and St Vincent de Paul, have called on the major parties to make homelessness a priority. And also ...     Dr Peter Young said it was \u2018outrageous\u2019 the AFP had been \u2018used by the government to undertake this sort of covert surveillance\u2019. Photograph: Joel Carrett/AAP    Australian federal police investigated an immigration detention whistleblower and accessed his phone records \u2013 in part because of his criticism of asylum seeker policies. Hundreds of pages of investigative file notes and reports surrounding Dr Peter Young were compiled following reports by the ABC and the Australian newspaper in December 2014, which disclosed the medical records of Hamid Khazaei, an asylum seeker on Manus Island who died following a skin infection on his leg. Young, who is a former medical director of mental health for Australia\u2019s detention centres, urged workers from inside the system to be \u201cangry and defiant\u201d about attacks on whistleblowing. Meanwhile, in the rest of the world ... Speculation has been raging over who will fill Daniel Craig\u2019s shoes as James Bond, with Tom Hiddleston, actor and DJ Idris Elba, and Homeland star Damian Lewis among those in the running to take the role of 007. But Gillian Anderson\u2019s hint that she\u2019d accept the role, tweeting a poster showing her as \u201cJane Bond\u201d, sent social media into a frenzy over the possibilities. You\u2019ve got to admit: she looks the part.    It's Bond. Jane Bond. Thanks for all the votes!

Police said an armed robber stole cash from the AdultShop.com store on Albany Highway just before 10am, then fled. Shorten was less than 100 metres away in a medical centre, talking about Medicare. You\u2019ve got any number of songs about stealing to pick from, but the old-timey lawlessness of Adam & The Ants\u2019 Stand And Deliver appealed.
