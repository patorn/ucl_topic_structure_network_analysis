If only he had been briefed with our blagger\u2019s guide to Bollywood \u2026   Related: Can Zac Goldsmith\u2019s Hindi-Urdu-Punjabi-Bangla-Mandarin mashup woo Asian voters?    Don\u2019t confuse all Indian cinema with Bollywood Know your Satyajit Ray from your Shah Rukh Khan. \u201cBollywood\u201d refers to the mainstream Hindi film industry based in Mumbai. It is huge, producing about 800 films and selling 4bn tickets every year. \u201cGoldsmith could have gone for a major hit with an easy title, such as PK, the highest-grossing Indian film of all time,\u201d suggests Rachel Dwyer, professor of Indian cultures and cinema at Soas, University of London. \u201cOr he could have played it safe with a crossover film such as Lagaan, which was nominated for an Oscar.\u201d     Deepika Padukone and Ranbir Kapoor in Tamasha. Photograph: UTV Motion Pictures    Know your stars Ranbir Kapoor is the hot young guy, Radhika Apte the up-and-coming woman who does both independent and Bollywood films, and Amitabh Bachchan is the grandfather of Bollywood. Aishwarya Rai\u2019s star is descending, Deepika Padukone has already taken her place, and Katrina Kaif (British, dodgy Hindi accent) is officially huge. The three Khans \u2013 Shah Rukh, Salman and Aamir \u2013 still rule the box office and are members of what has come to be known as the 100 Crore Club, referring to any Hindi film that generates more than 100 crore (1bn rupees or \u00a310m) at the box office.     Pakeezah    When it comes to Bollywood history, go left field Everyone knows the big hits, such as Sholay and Bombay \u2013 but if you want to show your Bollywood stripes, pick a cult classic that has experienced a recent resurgence of interest. \u201cPakeezah is an iconic piece of 70s high camp that has been adopted by the LGBT community,\u201d says Cary Sawhney, director of the London Indian film festival. Featuring one of the most famous soundtracks in Bollywood history, a giant pink palace and a tragic backstory (it took 14 years to make and legendary actress Meena Kumari, who visibly ages through the film, died days after it was finished), it\u2019s perfect for the Tory politician and targets as many minority communities as possible. It\u2019s not all about \u2018atmosphere, colour and excitement\u2019 The Bollywood of Goldsmith\u2019s, erm, imagination \u2013 family-friendly melodramas stuffed with songs, dance sequences, action scenes, love triangles, twins separated at birth and lots of angry parents \u2013 is on the wane. For the first time in five years, Bollywood box-office revenues fell in 2015, thanks to a new generation of middle-class Indians who have grown up with satellite TV and multiplexes. They want fewer blockbusters and more \u201chindies\u201d \u2013 smaller independent films on edgier subjects. These might include Aligarh, a biopic about the suicide of a gay college professor in Uttar Pradesh, or English Vinglish, a feminist comedy that caused its leading lady, Sridevi, to be hailed as the Meryl Streep of India. \u201cThe new wave is neither arthouse nor mainstream, but upper middlebrow and the films are often sports biopics or costume dramas,\u201d says Dwyer.

A 2012 crime saga screened in two parts, it features three generations of Indian mafia and a killer soundtrack influenced by Indian folk songs. \u201cIf you want to blag it, mention it and you have instant credibility,\u201d advises Sawhney, just a little too late for Goldsmith to take note.",
