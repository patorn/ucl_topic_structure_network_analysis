  "body": "Tickled, an investigative documentary into the strange, litigious world of \u201ccompetitive endurance tickling\u201d, has proved no laughing matter for its subject and producers. The film has survived two lawsuits thus far, and it isn\u2019t even out until June. The producers and directors have been named in two defamation suits by the film\u2019s subject, David D\u2019Amato, who alleged they had damaged his character by portraying him as a \u201cdeviant\u201d. Both have been dismissed. New Zealand TV reporter David Farrier and fellow director Dylan Reeve\u2019s documentary alleges that Jane O\u2019Brien Media - which specialises in making videos wherein which young men tickle each other - is owned by D\u2019Amato, heir to the fortune amassed by famed New York insurance lawyer George D\u2019Amato. He denies \u201cassociation or ownership interest in Jane O\u2019Brien Media\u201d in one filing, a point the film-makers contended. When Farrier, co-director of Tickled and the primary defendant in both cases, began his investigation into Jane O\u2019Brien Media someone from the company declined an interview request on the grounds of Farrier\u2019s sexuality. \u201cAssociation with a homosexual journalist [presumably Farrier, who is gay] is not something we will embrace,\u201d emailed a representative from the all-male tickling league. Legal threats have dogged the movie prior to and throughout its production \u2013 links to Farrier\u2019s three-part expos\u00e9e on Jane O\u2019Brien Media have been removed from news sites. Farrier said he couldn\u2019t talk about legal aspects of the film in an email to the Guardian on Friday. D\u2019Amato\u2019s lawyers did not return a request for comment.   Related: Tickled review: fetish documentary goes from giggly to grim    D\u2019Amato \u2013 who sometimes goes by the alias Terri Tickle, according to one of multiple lawsuits \u2013 has been accused of \u201cterrorizing young men\u201d by soliciting video footage of tickling and then bullying and harassing those who tried to withdraw their footage.  In 2001, D\u2019Amato was convicted of computer fraud for spamming students at several US universities, notably James Madison University and Suffolk University, in search of young men to tickle under the name Terri Desisto, according to public documents and Wired writer Brian McWilliams\u2019 2004 book Spam Kings. At the time his apartment was raided by the FBI in 2000, the then 38-year-old D\u2019Amato was a guidance counselor at West Hempstead high school on Long Island. More recently, people from Jane O\u2019Brien Media have attended festival screenings of the documentary, which was acquired by HBO Films for a June release. \u201cSundance security told me that [a Jane O\u2019Brien staffer] was there, but I didn\u2019t want to tell the audience,\u201d Farrier told IndieWire. \u201cFrom what I understand, [during the screening] he made a lot of loud \u2018hurmph\u2019 noises and took extensive notes on a legal pad.\u201d At a festival attended by the Guardian, a man apparently attempting to take clandestine footage of the screening using a camera in a coffee cup was forcibly ejected from the proceedings.",
