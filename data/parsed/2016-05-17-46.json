  "body": "With the wound of its football team\u2019s relegation from the Premier League still raw, Newcastle had a cause for sporting celebration on Tuesday afternoon as its new, \u00a312m all-weather racecourse opened for business. Track executives, meanwhile, were delighted by the last-minute sale of 350 tickets in an infield marquee - to the players and staff of Sunderland AFC. \u201cIt\u2019s great, they just phoned up to book a few days ago, to celebrate staying up,\u201d one official said, before muttering: \u201cNot sure it would be a good idea on one of the big days, though.\u201d   Related: Newcastle\u2019s inaugural all-weather card attracts more than 100 runners    It gets very lively at Newcastle in the summer, for the historic Northumberland Plate in late June and then Ladies\u2019 Day on the last Saturday in July, when at least 20,000 spectators will pack into the enclosures. Tuesday\u2019s card, though, was different. Not so busy, a great deal less boozy, and rather more educational, as around 3,000 racegoers turned up to get a glimpse of the future at Gosforth Park. Some, no doubt, did so uneasily. Newcastle\u2019s Flat turf course was, by general consent, one of the fairest and finest stretches of racing ground in the country. It was also a track with happy memories for generations of local racegoers, and the decision to change its nature was one that some, perhaps many, would feel personally. \u201cI was very sad to see it go,\u201d Thomas Ramsbottom, a racegoer at Newcastle for 60 years, said here on Tuesday. \u201cBut there\u2019s no getting around it, there was no one here, it was very quiet during the week. It had gone down because the southern trainers wouldn\u2019t send horses up, it was the same horses time and again. \u201cI think it could go well, and we\u2019ll see soon enough, but I don\u2019t know about running the Northumberland Plate on here, not the Pitmen\u2019s Derby. When this side [of the track] was full, and the other side was full as well, that was the Pitmen\u2019s Derby. \u201cCatterick would have been the place for it [the all-weather], but I\u2019ll still come back here if there\u2019s not racing at Catterick or Sedgefield.\u201d The removal of Newcastle\u2019s turf was so controversial that it spawned an online petition and several weeks of outraged letters to the Racing Post. Trainers lined up to vent their anger. \u201cI have run many horses [at Newcastle] over the years,\u201d Luca Cumani said, \u201cbut will not if it becomes yet another all-weather track.\u201d On day one at least, Cumani was true to his word, but several leading Newmarket stables were among those to send a total of 100 horses to the meeting. The first winner at the new Newcastle, though, was Tap The Honey, trained about 60 miles away in north Yorkshire by Karl Burke, while Mark Johnston, one of the fiercest critics of the decision to take up the turf, also had a winner with his first runner at the track as Turbine took the most valuable race on the card, worth nearly \u00a313,000 to the winner.   Related: Newcastle all-weather plan praised but turf diehards will unleash scorn | Greg Wood    Eighteen months and a winner have done little to diminish Johnston\u2019s anger. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly as I expected,\u201d Johnston said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone doubted that with [former trainer] Michael Dickinson providing [the] Tapeta [surface] and a layout like this, it would be a fantastic all-weather track. The question is whether that justifies demolishing what was almost an ancient monument. It\u2019s a crime, it just shouldn\u2019t be allowed to demolish a turf track like that, because the sad thing is that I don\u2019t think we will ever see another turf track like that built again. \u201cHow can you just dig up something like that? It should be protected like a Listed building, because it\u2019s irreplaceable.\u201d There is no going back now, however, and as an eight-race card unfolded here on Tuesday, there was much to keep turnover rolling in the betting shops and online. To grab the attention of punters, racing needs to be competitive, regardless of whether the surface under the horses\u2019 hooves is green or brown. On day one at least, Newcastle passed the test with distinction, and for anyone familiar to the short run-in at Lingfield, for instance, the long home straight at Newcastle provides an extended, fluid drama as jockeys play their hand in turn. The track also claims to have the only all-weather straight mile in the world.   Related: BHA must back opposition to tearing up Flat turf track at Newcastle | Greg Wood    Northumberland Plate day will be the big test of the new course\u2019s appeal, but the field for the Pitmen\u2019s Derby will remain at 20, while there will also be a consolation race for horses that do not make the cut. That, too, is likely to have a full field. The jockeys riding at Newcastle on Tuesday had nothing but praise for the new surface, which is expected to ride a little dead and slow in its early weeks but speed up over time as it beds in. \u201cI couldn\u2019t fault the track at all,\u201d Joey Haynes, the rider of Tap The Honey, said. \u201cIt was riding lovely and fair for all of us.\u201d David Williamson, Newcastle\u2019s executive director, has other long-term plans, including a possible staging of the All-Weather Finals meeting on Good Friday, held at Lingfield since its inception three years ago. \u201cIt\u2019s a big crowd today and people have come out to see the dawn of a new era,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cWe will still have 20 runners in the Plate, and we will still be getting full fields. We\u2019ll give owners and trainers more opportunities to race their horses and keep them in training for the winter, I think it\u2019s a win-win for everybody and for British racing. \u201cWe\u2019re in discussions about the All-Weather Championships coming here, or part of it coming here, and we\u2019d do a damn good job with it.\u201d Williamson is in his second spell at Newcastle racecourse, having spent two years in a senior role at the city\u2019s football club prior to its relegation to the Championship in 2009. It is a point that would not have been lost on most, if not all, of the Sunderland party in the marquee. \u201cYes,\u201d he said with a faint air of resignation when reminded of their presence. \u201cAs it happens, I\u2019m just on my way to say hello to them all now.\u201d",
