The 27-year-old Brisbane-based singer said she gave 150% at Eurovision and had no regrets after coming second. Her entry, Sound of Silence, earned the most jury votes but fell short on the public vote, which gave the contest to Ukraine\u2019s Jamala and her song 1944. Russia\u2019s Sergey Lazarev, who had been favoured to win, came third.    Australia, time to start drinking - the contest where we have no equal. #Eurovision\u2014 Peter Taggart (@petertaggart) May 14, 2016      Enough sniping about Australia being in #Eurovision.

I vote we secede from Europe. #Eurovision\u2014 Greg Jericho (@GrogsGamut) May 14, 2016      LET'S ALL JUST TAKE A MOMENT TO REMEMBER THAT AUSTRALIA LED THE JURY VOTES AND HAD THE THIRD HIGHEST VOTER POINTS#Eurovision\u2014 Elias Jahshan (@Elias_Jahshan) May 14, 2016    Im told reporters after the show, which was seen by an estimated television audience of 200m, that her second placing may give her more opportunities to release music and tour in Europe, with her song already charting in some countries. \u201cI just loved performing tonight,\u201d she said. \u201cThe crowd was incredible. I was just enjoying the moment rather than thinking about everything else.

When asked how she would celebrate if she won: \u201cI\u2019ll go and have a lemonade with my crew.\u201d Im impressed with a powerful performance in a packed Globe arena full of flag-waving fans, including a strong cohort of Australians. Her song won the most votes from professional music juries in the 42 competing countries but lost out on the count of votes from Eurovision fans phoning in. It was a nail-biting finish with the jury counts voted first, making it look as if she might win the contest. \u201cIt was so crazy what was happening,\u201d she said. \u201cTo be honest I wasn\u2019t all that nervous. \u201cWe were like scratching the Lotto one at a time. I was enjoying it, it was so much fun.\u201d In the end Jamala took victory with 534 points over Im on 511 and Lazarev on 491.

I wasn\u2019t expecting anything that high anyway so I was so happy.\u201d She said she wanted to be an artist who made a difference in the world and to use her performing platform to help children in poverty. Im, who moved to Australia from South Korea at the age of nine, said she hoped her participation in Eurovision created a good image of Australia as a place that accepted immigrants like her. Australia was invited back to Eurovision this year after being granted a wildcard entry in 2015 when Guy Sebastian came in fifth with his song Tonight Again. Im\u2019s Sound of Silence was created by songwriting team Anthony Egizii and David Musumeci of Sydney-based DNA Songs.
