Amid violence on the streets and a three-day general strike that had brought much of the country to a halt, the embattled government pushed the legislation through parliament with the backing of its 153 MPS. Addressing the 300-seat House, prime minister Alexis Tsipras said: \u201cWe are determined to make Greece stand on its two feet at any cost.\u201d   Related: Europe's liberal illusions shatter as Greek tragedy plays on    Rioters pelted police with stones while black-clad anarchists lobbed flaming Molotov cocktails, after Athens\u2019s finance minister warned Greece could become a \u201cfailed state\u201d if it was pushed too far. The controversial bills, worth \u20ac5.4bn (\u00a34.27bn) in budget savings, were seen as the toughest reforms the thrice bailed-out nation has been forced to enact since its debt crisis began. The once firebrand Tsipras called the vote in advance of tortuous bailout negotiations being concluded in a bid to placate eurozone finance ministers ahead of Monday\u2019s meeting.  In an unprecedented step, lenders are expected to focus on the nation\u2019s staggering debt load \u2013 at over 180% of GDP the largest in Europe \u2013 with Athens keen to secure a pledge that a write-down is in the offing. But creditors are also demanding a new set of contingency measures to ensure the country achieves agreed stringent fiscal targets by 2018. Public anger against Greece\u2019s lenders is palpable. \u201cEvery day they destroy our country a little more,\u201d said Vassilis Papadopoulos, a young waiter, of the international creditors keeping the debt-stricken nation afloat.

How can a state function when over 25% of its population is unemployed?\u201d Ahead of Monday\u2019s eurogroup meeting meeting, finance minister Euclid Tskalotos warned darkly of the perils involved in demanding yet more cuts of a nation whose economy has shrunk by more than 25% in the six years since successive governments began slashing budgets in return for bailout aid. \u201cNobody should believe that another Greek crisis, leading perhaps to another failed state in the region, could be beneficial to anyone,\u201d he wrote in an unusually dramatic letter to his eurozone counterparts. \u201cThere is no way that such a package can be passed by the current government, or by any democratic government that I can imagine.\u201d  For a time, it seemed, Greece\u2019s economic woes had gone away. Eclipsed by Europe\u2019s refugee crisis, terrorist attacks and the fears engendered by Britain\u2019s forthcoming EU referendum, Athens\u2019s debt drama appeared to disappear.  But policymakers are discovering that may have been wishful thinking. The nation that last year came close to exiting the euro \u2013 triggering the continent\u2019s biggest existential crisis in decades \u2013 is once again close to the brink. Economists, politicians and investors all speak of uncertainty \u2013 an uncertainty reinforced by the wildly divergent views of creditors over how best to put the country back on its feet.

The International Monetary Fund, which believes the surplus should be no higher than 1.5%, says substantial debt relief is the only way the country can recover economically. On Friday the fund\u2019s managing director, Christine Lagarde, threatened to pull out of Greece\u2019s rescue programme altogether if Brussels failed to yield. Athens has received more than \u20ac250bn in bailout funds in what has amounted to the biggest financial rescue programme in global history. Germany\u2019s hardline finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, fearing hefty losses on the loans Berlin and other eurozone members have made, has steadfastly ruled out debt forgiveness. But Tsipras won unexpected support at the weekend from Germany\u2019s vice-chancellor, Sigmar Gabriel. In a statement to Reuters, Sigmar, who is also the economy minister, insisted debt relief was now the only way of plucking Greece out of its seemingly endless economic death spiral. \u201cThe eurogroup meeting on Monday must find a way to break the vicious circle,\u201d he wrote. \u201cEveryone knows that this debt relief will have to come at some point. It makes no sense to shirk from that time and time again.\u201d     Protesters throw flares at riot police during the demonstration. Photograph: Angelos Tzortzinis/AFP/Getty Images    The overhaul of the pension system \u2013 along with unpopular tax measures and an increase in VAT \u2013 form the central plank of a \u20ac5.4bn package of budget cuts and reforms that Tsipras has agreed to enact in exchange for rescue funds from a third, \u20ac86bn bailout the country signed up to last summer. After nine months of wrangling over the latest austerity measures, Tsipras had hoped Sunday\u2019s vote would unlock further funds. In July Greece faces \u20ac3.5bn in debt repayments. Without bailout aid, once again it confronts the spectre of default and likely ejection from the single currency. \u201cWe are, with a little less drama, back where we were last year,\u201d noted Christos Memis, a veteran political commentator now in charge of news portal Protagon.gr.  \u201cThe prime minister and his aides are a little more mature, a little wiser. They like power and I think are determined to come to an agreement with Europeans but there are hurdles not least in Syriza,\u201d he said of Tsipras\u2019 radical left coalition party.  With the UK\u2019s looming EU referendum, eurozone partners have made clear that bailout negotiations have to be wrapped up by the end of May or be put on hold until July when markets will once again be rattled by the prospect of a Greek default. Speaking to the Guardian ahead of the vote, the culture minister Aristides Baltas, said the unpopular reforms would be enforced even if no one believed in them. \u201cNobody in the government agrees with this agreement but we have signed it and have made a historical pledge to implement it,\u201d said the French-trained philosopher who played a pivotal role in drawing up the ruling Syriza\u2019s party\u2019s founding programme. \u201cWe know it will be hard for Greeks.\u201d",
