  "body": "Barcelona are champions for the sixth time in eight years after Luis Su\u00e1rez\u2019s hat-trick defeated Granada 3-0 on the final day. There were four minutes left when he scored the third, rolling in Neymar\u2019s assist to take him to 40 goals for the season and his team to the title. He, Messi and Neymar embraced, along with the rest of the side, champions once more. At the final whistle, supporters sprinted on to the pitch to join in. Europe eluded them this year but with a Copa del Rey final to come, they may still finish with a double. Ultimately, it seemed so easy, but the end of this season said otherwise. A victory would guarantee Barcelona a title that most had thought was already secure six weeks ago, but the slightest slip and Real Madrid would be champions, with them cast as the team who threw it away. Their response was emphatic, from Su\u00e1rez, especially. Five wins in five, with an aggregate score of 24-0, took them over the line.

We deserved this. People think not winning a trophy is disaster but we know how difficult it is to do. We\u2019ve won six of eight leagues; some other teams find it harder.\u201d Teams like Madrid, in other words. They have won one of those eight but came into this season hoping to make it two and ultimately pushed Barcelona to the wire. The last stop took Barcelona to Granada and Madrid to Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a, two teams with nothing to play for against two with everything to play for and no room for errors. A win would be necessary for Barcelona and any doubt about that was removed after seven minutes, when Cristiano Ronaldo put Madrid 1-0 up and temporarily top 1,000km away, while there was a brief reminder of the risk a minute later when Youssef El Arabi sprinted beyond them only to scuff his shot. But Luis Enrique\u2019s side were not keen to waste time, nor to allow nerves to take hold. No concessions were made; the ball was theirs, chances too. Piqu\u00e9\u2019s header had already been pushed away by Andr\u00e9s Fern\u00e1ndez and then Neymar lifted over, forcing a corner from which Fern\u00e1ndez again saved from Piqu\u00e9. Then, on 21 minutes, Barcelona beautifully made the opener, laying one hand on the trophy. Figuratively, at least; it will not be given to them until the start of next season. Javier Mascherano, Andr\u00e9s Iniesta, Jordi Alba and Neymar made it, a neat give-and-go leaving the full back dashing into the area and pulling back for Su\u00e1rez to nudge in his 38th goal of the season. He is one of five players to reach that figure and was soon beyond it. Up in A Coru\u00f1a, Ronaldo had made it 2-0; 13 minutes later, down in Granada, so did the Uruguayan.

There would be celebrations at Los C\u00e1rmenes. Perhaps Madrid realised that too. In Galicia, Ronaldo was removed at half-time, the title over for another season and, on 35, his bid to be top scorer too. Su\u00e1rez made it to 40, the first time the top scorer has not been either Ronaldo or Messi since 2009. The second half brought the hint of a match. Carlos Pe\u00f1aranda took the baffling decision to dive when he might have a chance and then Marc-Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen saved from Fran Rico as the Granada midfielder found himself clear on the edge of the area. There was intent about Granada now, a willingness to go forward, while tackles came too. They would continue, provoking a mass confrontation late on, but Barcelona reasserted themselves. Su\u00e1rez created for Neymar, whose shot was saved, then Fern\u00e1ndez cut out yet another Alves ball. There were still 25 minutes left and a Granada goal would alter things, but it was Barcelona who got it. And it was Su\u00e1rez again. In the stands, their fans dared to sing \u201ccampeones\u201d for the first time. No one had expected them to have to wait until the final day to do so, but they are there now. \u201cI would tell our fans to enjoy it,\u201d Luis Enrique said.",
