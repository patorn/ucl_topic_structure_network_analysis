  "body": "Joe Root has completed a clean sweep as England\u2019s Test, limited overs and supporters\u2019 player of the year but despite an outstanding 12 months with the bat, the Yorkshireman said his game remains far from perfect and that more hard work lies ahead.   Related: Steven Finn ready to channel frustration into England success against Sri Lanka    The 25-year-old collected the hat-trick of trophies on Monday at the team\u2019s annual awards dinner before the first Test against Sri Lanka at Headingley. They were his reward for a central role in Test series wins over Australia and South Africa, as well England\u2019s runners-up finish in the World Twenty20 in India. \u201cI\u2019m extremely proud. You can\u2019t win these personal awards without great people \u2013 and great team players \u2013 around you,\u201d said Root, who won the England player of the year in 2015 before it was split into Test and limited-overs awards, both of which are voted for by the cricket media. Root shone in all three formats, with his 2,228 international runs in 2015 the most by an England batsman in a calendar year, and was involved in a game of musical chairs at the top of the ICC Test rankings with Australia\u2019s Steve Smith and Kane Williamson of New Zealand. He is now second behind Smith, having gone top after his century in the decisive fourth Test against Australia at Trent Bridge and returned there, briefly, during the Test series against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates in October. Root said: \u201cIt surprised me to reach that target. I know my cricket can develop so much more. There are so many areas I have to keep working on and keep improving. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re ever happy as a batter: there as always more runs you can get and more tweaks you can make to improve. There\u2019s plenty on the horizon for me to work at.\u201d The seam bowler Anya Shrubsole was named as the England women\u2019s cricketer of the year, with Callum Flynn the disability cricketer for 2015 and the Essex batsman Daniel Lawrence picking up the development player award. David Lloyd was presented withgiven the ECB\u2019s special achievement award for a 50-year career as a player, coach, umpire and commentator.",
