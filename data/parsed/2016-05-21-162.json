  "body": "LG\u2019s new G5 phone is a curious bit of kit: essentially a workaday-looking smartphone, but one that features a weird slidey thing at the bottom to remove, and quite likely lose, your battery. LG have branded this design kink as modular and \u201ctransformative\u201d, so who better to get across this sense of transformation than Jason Statham, the hyper-versatile actor known for playing a chiselled hard man in Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels, a chiselled hard man in the Transporter series, and a chiselled hard man in Crank and its even crankier sequel Crank: High Voltage?            In fairness Stath\u2019s turn in the ad suggests that he might have a bit more range than his IMDB page. Here, he plays an entire bloody city, with his face transposed on to everyone from a hipster to a newborn baby (a sight which will require an extensive period of brain bleaching to unsee). The plot, or what there is of one, sees the city\u2019s inhabitants\u2019 crippling phone addiction, leading them to fight each other for a glimpse at a screen, setting off a bizarre sequence of events involving a motorcyclist on fire and a load of rampaging bulls. No less nonsensical than the rest of Statham\u2019s output, then.",
