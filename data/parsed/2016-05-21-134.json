  "body": "I didn\u2019t think my leaving US Vogue would be big news. I went \u2013 how do you call it \u2013 viral. That was funny. I just thought. \u2018Oh good, maybe I\u2019ll get a job now\u2019. It\u2019s scary to leave something you\u2019re comfortable doing. I had done almost 50 years at Vogue before I went freelance at the start of the year. That said, I think it\u2019s good to have a challenge, to step out of your comfort zone.  It\u2019s difficult to do projects if you\u2019re working full-time. At the beginning, I was full-time and it wasn\u2019t OK. I discussed it with Anna [Wintour]; I said it would take a while and so she was comfortable with this going ahead. It was a natural progression to go freelance but when, eventually, it happened, I decided it would be a good time to go. If you work full-time you can\u2019t do this \u2013 it\u2019s a conflict of interest.  I started working on the perfume a couple of years ago. The idea came from my friend, Gaby. She said if you ever feel like doing anything besides Vogue \u2026 We were always looking for ideas. It was her suggestion that we did something like a perfume. Editorial, designing a perfume, it\u2019s all the same. You are dealing with other people. And, in both jobs, it\u2019s the same: you have a certain amount of control and there are also things that are out of your control. You take smells and you edit them down, just as when you are doing a shoot or a campaign, you take clothes and you edit them away. It\u2019s called editing. I\u2019m not smell-orientated. I guess there\u2019s no such thing as no smell, just as there\u2019s no such thing as silence, but I like gentle smells. I really hate overwhelming perfumes. They make me feel claustrophobic. The best way to wear a perfume is to spray it in your hair. Spray the air? That way you go through more perfume. Try it. I am still pretty involved in Vogue. I have been working on other shoots, which has been interesting \u2013 advertising campaigns, things like that. It\u2019s not the same, but it\u2019s new people \u2013 which gives you a new enthusiasm. I\u2019m famously friends with all my former assistants. If you spend that time with someone, it\u2019s intense. It\u2019s like an old lover, you don\u2019t just discard them. Am I known better for loving cats or working at Vogue? I have a great love of cats and I wanted to have some sort of connection with that.  We may do a lipstick in the future. We talked about doing other beauty products. Trying to focus on two things is very hard. Right now, I\u2019ll focus on the perfume. Grace by Grace Coddington is available now at Dover Street Market",
