Early in the season, after the Islanders moved from Long Island to their new home in the Barclays Center, the future of the team in Brooklyn didn\u2019t look promising. Rumours of the team wanting out of their 25-year deal with the Barclays Center emerged and fans were quick to find faults with the new surroundings. A walk through the Barclays Center ahead of Game 3 of the Islanders second-round series against the Tampa Bay Lightning paints a different picture. After splitting the first two games in Tampa Bay, the blue and orange faithful provided a raucous welcome home for the Islanders in what was undoubtedly the biggest game of their short stint in Brooklyn. The entertaining affair ended in a 5-4 Lightning overtime win. But there have been plenty of doubt this season. The Barclays Center isn\u2019t the Islanders former home, Nassau Coliseum: the 44-year old arena may be heavy on old-world charm but the renovations reduced the seating capacity to 13,000, making it too small for NHL standards.  Still, it was slow-going for the Islanders at Barclays Center. They finished the regular season with an average attendance of 13,626, the third-lowest average attendance in the league. Their average attendance in their last season at the Nassau Coliseum was 15,334. Tuesday night\u2019s attendance was 15,795. It\u2019s a slick-looking building, the Barclays Center, even with all of its imperfections including some poor seating views. There have been other complaints, one of the largest being that the Barclays Center wasn\u2019t built for hockey and may not feel much like a hockey arena. When you\u2019re coming from a place that was home to the Islanders\u2019 four Stanley Cup-winning teams of the late 70s and early 80s however, any new home will have fairly high standards to live up to. Dominik Jansky of Lighthouse Hockey, the Islanders SB Nation blog, says that overall, fans have become open to the Barclays Center despite the obstructed seating and other issues.  \u201c[Some fans] were bitter because the move changed tradition or became too far away or because their new arena isn\u2019t the tailgate-friendly Coliseum. But people are finding the building is electric; winning definitely helps,\u201d he says. After Islanders forward Josh Bailey opened the scoring at 7:55 of the first period, the already boisterous home crowd lost their collective minds, chanting \u201cYes! Yes! Yes!\u201d repeatedly. It was cued and appears to be a standard part of the in-game entertainment, sure. But there was no doubting this crowd: if Islanders fans have any problem coming to games in Brooklyn, they certainly don\u2019t show it in these playoffs. They have since transformed the building into hostile territory for visiting teams. After the game, Lightning forward Brian Boyle, who scored the game winner, admitted that it was difficult building to play in. For the Islanders themselves, who won two of their three first-round series games at Barclays Center, the boisterous crowds offer a chance to swing the momentum of a game back in their favour. The key, of course, was to harness the energy from the crowd. \u201cYou have to use that energy in a positive way,\u201d said Islanders forward Kyle Okposo. \u201cYou can\u2019t be running around out of position.\u201d Through the first period, the Islanders played one of their best periods of hockey through the playoffs, throwing 17 shots on Ben Bishop. It wasn\u2019t always like this. The transition to a new home took its toll on the Islanders themselves. \u201cIt was a culture shock to the system with the routine and everything,\u201d said Islanders forward Cal Clutterbuck, who had a goal and an assist Tuesday. \u201cThe travel to and from, staying in day rooms for the first half of the year.\u201d Clutterbuck went on to say that playing at Barclays Center eventually began to feel normal. The crowds are now anything but normal. \u201cThe crowds in the playoffs have been great,\u201d said Clutterbuck. \u201cIt was kind of hit or miss during the season.\u201d \u201cTradition\u2019s New Home\u201d was a slogan used by the Islanders marketing campaign in this first season in Brooklyn. At first, this was a campaign that was derided. Tradition isn\u2019t something that is built overnight. And nothing will create a new tradition and legacy for the Islanders at the Barclay\u2019s Center like consistent successful seasons will. They\u2019re well on their way. Tuesday\u2019s Game 3 was the first Islanders home game in a 2nd round series in 23 years. They reached 100 points in the regular season for the second season in a row. There\u2019s a lot to like about this deep Islanders roster. Perhaps years from now the Islanders faithful will look back on this inaugural season in Brooklyn and the complaints about their new home will seem trivial. Winning can make otherwise finicky fans forget about a lot.  \u201cWhen you\u2019re looking up at the TV and you see only eight teams left and you\u2019re one of them, you\u2019re pretty proud of that,\u201d said Islanders coach Jack Capuano. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting. You want to keep playing.\u201d The real test for the Islanders\u2019 new home may be how the atmosphere pans out when the success stops.",
