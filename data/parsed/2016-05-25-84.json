  "body": "As pop music blares and cars rush past, the camera lurches into a wood at the road\u2019s edge and, through rustling foliage, reveals a strange scene: giant spanners, a discarded bike and a piano outside a primitive tin-roofed cottage. The bucolic chirp of sparrows is shattered by a gunshot. From the first moment of the cult documentary, The Moon and the Sledgehammer, we are taken into a disturbing, marginal and strangely marvellous world: the home of the Page family, who live without electricity or running water in a wood in Sussex. It is 1969 and \u201cOily\u201d Page is a theatrical septuagenarian who lives with four grown-up children in the style of 1869: they\u2019re not hippies who\u2019ve gone off grid, but the last members of an agricultural community driven to extinction by modern machines. The film has attracted a following over subsequent decades, and not just among back-to-the-land types or aficionados of the spectacular traction engines the Pages ride in their wood. A new digital version will be shown at the Brighton festival this weekend alongside a question-and-answer session with Philip Trevelyan, its director. This is just as well, because the film raises dozens of questions: where is Mrs Page? Why are the grown-up children still living with their father? What does Mr Page mean by his gnomic utterances (\u201che\u2019s like a long lane without a turning\u201d; \u201cman will invent things to destroy himself\u201d)? Is he a fool or a sage? And what do the Pages possess that we have lost?         The Moon and the Sledgehammer trailer on YouTube    When I meet Trevelyan, now 72, he has just finished pulling dock leaves on his organic farm \u2013 back-breaking work. In 1975, he and his wife Nelly sold their London flat and bought a 53-acre farm in North Yorkshire. \u201cI fell into \u2018Oily\u2019 Page work,\u201d he says, wondering aloud \u2013 in a characteristically open-ended fashion \u2013 if his career change was inspired by his encounter with the family. The son of painter Julian Trevelyan and the potter Ursula Mommens, Trevelyan grew up in rural Sussex, studied fine art and film, and was working for Granada TV when a friend met the Pages by chance at a rural auction. Trevelyan visited them and was entranced by their \u201cwonderful\u201d home surrounded by nature. He befriended the family, took stills of them and then, with producer Jimmy Vaughan, raised \u201cwell over \u00a310,000\u201d to make a film. In 1969, Trevelyan took a crew of four and they lived in an old Commer van in the Pages\u2019 wood for a month.     \u2018The more we stop doing things for ourselves, the more lifeless we become\u2019 \u2026 Trevelyan    It was in the weeks before the moon landing. \u201cWaste of time, waste of money,\u201d says Mr Page. \u201cIt\u2019s a good job the moon\u2019s well up there too, I\u2019ve got room enough to swing a sledgehammer without hitting him.\u201d Such remarks sound cryptic, but Trevelyan believes the Pages\u2019 criticism of \u201cpush-button\u201d machines (and now computers) reveal what we\u2019ve lost \u2013 not just jobs, but a kind of work that was satisfying, communal and even pleasurable. \u201cWe\u2019ve throttled our enjoyment of work by buying so many \u2018convenient\u2019 machines and different ways of not doing work,\u201d says Trevelyan. \u201cThe more we stop doing things for ourselves, the more lifeless we become. There\u2019s terrific life expressed by the family in that film \u2013 gaiety, innocence and openness.\u201d Trevelyan read and admired Akenfield, Ronald Blythe\u2019s influential portrait of a village in rural Suffolk, which was also published in 1969. Like Akenfield, The Moon and the Sledgehammer does not simply offer a sentimental view of rural ways being crushed by industrial agriculture but reveals more troubling aspects of old country life, too. Mr Page is controlling and his daughters, Nancy and Kathy, appear trapped at home. There is also a suggestion of incest in one scene, beautifully shot from inside the house. Kathy is clipping roses and her brother, Jim, sings her a love song \u2013 \u201cYou are my garden of roses\u201d \u2013 as Kathy giggles. \u201cI felt that Jim and Kathy had a relationship of some sort which was secret, but I just don\u2019t know,\u201d says Trevelyan.     The Page family\u2019s house in the Sussex woods    Trevelyan wishes he\u2019d asked more questions \u2013 he was young, and young people don\u2019t think to, he says \u2013 but he also fought his producer\u2019s desire to return to the wood and probe the tensions within the family. \u201cI didn\u2019t enjoy asking them questions about themselves,\u201d said Trevelyan. \u201cThat diverted me, and I wish it hadn\u2019t.\u201d He is consoled, however, by his ending: a shot of traffic being diverted as the Pages\u2019 magnificent traction engine steams through Horsham. \u201cThe end is a triumph of family loyalty,\u201d he says.

Trevelyan believes he once performed in the circus, such was his memory of old ditties (\u201cOf all the felt hats I felt, I never felt a felt hat like this felt hat felt\u201d). Trevelyan has always been attracted to natural performers: \u201cI\u2019m not looking at ordinary people in quite the same way as, say, Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski, who told these wonderful objective stories, recording ordinary patterns of behaviour among ordinary people in Poland under Communism.\u201d Trevelyan\u2019s other documentaries from the 1970s and early 1980s \u2013 about lambing, the life of an old pub, traditional pottery and classical musicians rehearsing \u2013 reflect his interests in people who, he says, often do practical work with their hands, unlike the rest of us who \u201care doing our best to do as little as possible, and ask machines to do it for us\u201d. Although he is still planning new films, Trevelyan devoted his life to practical work after following the Pages into farming. He recently passed his farm to his second son, but still helps out, sells ingenious hand tools and runs a flour mill. \u201cA modern drill and a modern tractor can do a wonderful job, but I\u2019ve done a good job with simple machines by taking longer with more care,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is something relentless about modern machines in farming \u2013 they aren\u2019t the problem, but the way they are used to make food an international competition to be cheap is. Nobody wants to turn back the clock, but a more sensible land economy would be a good thing, with priority given to people. Tractor drivers are committing suicide from loneliness. That\u2019s wrong. I would like people to be involved in farming again.\u201d     The family taking their steam tractor for a spin    Despite Trevelyan arguing fiercely with Vaughan over The Moon and the Sledgehammer \u2013 Trevelyan spent 18 months literally taping the film back together, frame-by-frame, after it was edited in a way that horrified him \u2013 the finished version only survived thanks to the efforts of Vaughan\u2019s former wife, Katy MacMillan, who raised funds to buy the copyright and has reissued it on DVD. Trevelyan and MacMillan have worked together to digitally regrade the original and are now raising money so the 16mm film can be shown more widely.

Mr Page did not live long, and Peter, the eldest son, died in the 1980s. \u201cThey were all very much loved by local people. When Peter died, the whole village turned out, and a steam engine covered in flowers, and people followed it,\u201d says Trevelyan. Nancy and Kathy moved into a council house together and did car boot sales; Jim lived on in the wood for a bit. Trevelyan visited 20 years or so ago but found it very run-down. He has lost touch with them now, and fears they may all be dead, but plans to call in on Kathy and Nancy\u2019s old house when he travels to Brighton for the screening. Trevelyan is \u201camazed\u201d by the ongoing interest in his film, but believes that the defiant freedom of the Pages still resonates, nearly 50 years on. \u201cWhy the audience connect with it is a very interesting question,\u201d he says. \u201cThey realise there is something free about the Pages that will never be in their lives, and perhaps should be.\u201d \u2022 The Moon and the Sledgehammer is showing at Brighton Festival, 4.30pm Sunday 29 May, complete with Q&A and traction engine.",
