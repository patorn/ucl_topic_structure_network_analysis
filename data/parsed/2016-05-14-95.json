  "body": "Just six months after Dave Lewis, the boss of Tesco, warned that UK retailers face a \u201cpotentially lethal cocktail\u201d, BHS collapsed into administration, leaving the high street with its biggest failure since the financial crisis. There are clearly unique circumstances surrounding the demise of BHS, but Lewis\u2019s warning about business rates, the national living wage and the apprenticeship levy was, without doubt, prescient. Today, he says, there are \u201csome pretty big macro challenges\u201d ahead for retailing. \u201cBusiness rates is real, the living wage for the industry will be real, the apprenticeship levy will be real.\u201d Online retailers \u2013 and the way they are taxed \u2013 present another problem. \u201cYou have got a situation that nobody likes to talk about, which is that there is a structural advantage to going digital and online if the largest single tax that we [store-based retailers] pay is a property-based rates system.\u201d This he sees as \u201ca very, very, very big challenge\u201d. The government has offered retailers an olive branch by linking the annual increase in business rates to the consumer price index instead of the higher retail price index, and has pledged to revalue properties more regularly, so that rates more accurately reflect the economic environment. But Lewis is concerned that plans to allow to councils set local business rates, rather than it being done by central government, could lead to store closures: \u201cWe don\u2019t honestly know what going local will mean. We will get different interpretations from one district to the next, which will suddenly start skewing the profitability of stores.\u201d      In January 2015, a few months after he took over as chief executive of Britain\u2019s biggest retailer, Lewis announced the closure of 43 Tesco stores  and scrapped plans to build another 49, as part of his plan to turn the group around. The former Unilever marketing man had never run a shop when he was hired to put a stop to a three-year sales slide at Tesco. As if that was not enough of a challenge, within three weeks Lewis was engulfed in the biggest crisis in the company\u2019s history when a whistleblower alerted him to an accounting scandal. Since then, the Serious Fraud Office has launched an investigation into Tesco, the company made a \u00a36.4bn annual loss for 2014 \u2013 one of the biggest in British corporate history \u2013 and Lewis has axed thousands of jobs in an attempt to cut costs. Tesco\u2019s most recent results showed signs of progress. It reported pre-tax profits of \u00a3162m for the year to 27 February, which included a 0.9% rise in like-for-like sales in the final quarter of the year in the UK. That performance is a long way from Tesco\u2019s peak profit of more than \u00a34bn in 2012, and shares in the company have fallen by a third over the past year as investors realised, after an initial burst of optimism when Lewis arrived, that the grocer still faces a very long road back to full health. Nevertheless, Lewis has been handsomely rewarded for the progress made so far. On Friday it was revealed that he had picked up a bonus of almost \u00a33m on top of his \u00a31.25m salary. Tesco\u2019s UK staff are also sharing a turnaround bonus worth \u00a3185m, or 5% of their salaries. Lewis robustly defends the work that has been done so far. \u201cIf I had told you when I joined that we would take a 5% drop in like-for-like sales and turn it into positive like-for-like growth at the end of last year with prices down by more than 4%, I don\u2019t think you would have believed me. I don\u2019t think anybody would have believed me.\u201d Admitting that there is still more work to be done, the Tesco boss denies it will take as long as five years to get the retailer back on track. \u201cBut I think this is something that probably takes more than 15 months.\u201d Lewis, who turned 50 and got married last year, just as he was trying to jump-start the Tesco juggernaut, says his focus so far has been on getting existing shoppers to spend more. \u201cEverybody was commenting on how people were no longer shopping at Tesco. But when we sat down and did the analysis, really very objectively and brutally, we found that people were not leaving Tesco, but they were changing their buying behaviour. They used to shop with us six times out of 10, and now they shopped five times out of 10. They weren\u2019t avoiding Tesco; they were just doing some of their shopping elsewhere, for whatever reason. But if you are still coming into my shop, there is an opportunity to improve what I do for you when you are in.\u201d His response was to \u201cput all of the effort back into the stores. It wasn\u2019t an advertising-led campaign; it was all about doing it better in store. The first year, everything went into the service \u2013 availability, range and price.\u201d Now that Lewis appears to have steadied the ship after an \u201cunprecedented\u201d period of change at Tesco, he is planning to become more ambitious. In a bid to take on discounters Aldi and Lidl, who have stolen trade from all the leading supermarkets over the past five years, Tesco has just launched seven new \u201cfarm brands\u201d, including Redmere Farms for vegetables and Boswell Farms for beef.     Tesco farm brand beef    Lewis says he targeted items that were up to 17% cheaper at Aldi and Lidl. \u201cIt is the most aggressive investment we have made for Tesco shoppers in the past five years,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cFor us to close that price difference is a big investment.\u201d The idea is to persuade Tesco shoppers they don\u2019t need to make those extra visits to a discounter: \u201cI am now giving you something in my store that is better, at the same price. So why do you want to go and shop with somebody else?\u201d The farm brands have caused controversy, however, because Tesco invented the farm names. Farming groups have attacked the move as misleading \u2013 in that they suggest the produce comes from British farms when some of it is imported, even though the country of origin is marked on the packs. A top Irish chef has called the brands \u201can insult to real farmers\u201d. Lewis declares himself bemused by the outrage, not least because the discounters regularly create new brands closely based on existing products. \u201cThe discussion about \u2018Does this farm exist or not?\u2019 sort of forced a wry smile from me, because, actually, customers had no problem. Customers understood that the products come from farms \u2013 that was clearly true \u2013 and that no one farm that could ever supply all of Tesco.\u201d The next item on Lewis\u2019s agenda is a review of Tesco\u2019s own-label products and of the Clubcard, the loyalty scheme that helped take the retailer to the No\u00a01 spot when it was launched by Sir Terry Leahy in the 1990s. The Clubcard has, he reckons, been used by the grocer in the wrong way for some time and needs a revamp. \u201cIt is 21 years old at the end of this year and it could probably do with being brought into the 21st century,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cWe got ourselves to a place where our pricing on shelf was not competitive, but we tried to compensate for that by giving coupons through Clubcard.\u201d That was a bad idea, according to Lewis, because most customers can\u2019t work out whether that means they are getting a good or a bad deal. Customers, he says, \u201c don\u2019t at all do that equation in their head\u201d. So he wants Clubcard to go back to its roots \u2013 as a loyalty card that is \u201ca genuine reward for loyalty \u2013 a genuine thank you, if you like\u201d. However, as the Tesco boss ploughs on with his attempts to modernise the company, the SFO investigation is still hanging over it, with the potential for hundreds of millions of pounds in fines if it is found guilty of misconduct. But he claims that prospect is not a major distraction, and he will deal with whatever the eventual outcome is. \u201cLook,\u201d he says, \u201cI think everybody is aware of the investigation. We are co-operating fully with it, but there are very few people inside the business who are actually dealing with it. On a day-to-day basis, 99.999% of our employees are not affected by it. \u201cFor sure we still don\u2019t know what will happen. We are completely waiting for that to materialise. I am sure we will get to a place where that comes back on to the public agenda. We will have to deal with that, and there will be an impact on the business as we do.\u201d He is not keen to expand on speculation that he might be seeking a deferred prosecution agreement with the SFO, which would allow the company to reach a settlement over the scandal. \u201cI have to say the people who are speculating know way more than I do. That is probably the best answer I can give you. I can\u2019t say anything. There isn\u2019t anything to say. There really isn\u2019t anything to say.\u201d The accounting scandal dragged the Tesco brand to its lowest depths when it emerged in September 2014. Lewis admits that it put \u201ca dent\u201d in Tesco\u2019s image but insists the standing of the brand can recover. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s better than it was a year ago, but not yet as well as it was in its heyday in the middle of the 2000s.\u201d But, he says, the corporate image and the shopping experience are two different things. \u201cWhen you talk to someone about their shopping experience and the people in their store, by and large it\u2019s really still positive. But their image of the corporation was driven by our relationship with our suppliers and the way our property strategy sometimes clashed with local communities.\u201d His response has been to \u201ccompletely \u2013 and I mean absolutely completely \u2013 redraw the relationship with our suppliers, and to take a completely different approach to property, in terms of not building any more stores and actually giving some sites back to the community\u201d. He doesn\u2019t mention that plans for most of the new stores were abandoned because they were uneconomic. \u201cThere is still more we have to do in rebuilding the brand, but we want to open people\u2019s minds to the idea that Tesco can be a different sort of place.\u201d",
