In his first interview with a national newspaper since his decisive election victory, the new mayor delivered a warning to his party about the importance of securing power, saying \u201cI\u2019ve achieved more in these seven days than in the last six years in opposition.\u201d Khan said that his party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, could not be blamed for general election losses in 2010 and 2015, but added Labour was failing to \u201cscore enough goals\u201d against a deeply divided Conservative party, racked with infighting over Europe.   Related: Is Cameron proud of Zac Goldsmith\u2019s toxic mayoral campaign in the capital? | Owen Jones    \u201cWe need to understand that Cameron\u2019s government is as bad as John Major\u2019s. If you compare and contrast what John Smith and Tony Blair did during that period, compared to now,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThat is the trajectory we need to be on if we want to win in 2020,\u201d he added, arguing that most psephologists would say Labour was not heading towards a general election victory at the moment. Asked what Labour MPs who were most critical of Corbyn should be doing to support their leader, Khan said: \u201cI think it is more a question of what Jeremy should be doing. If you are leader you want to use all your talents. I think politics is a team sport, and we came together as a team. I think we\u2019ve got to be united as a party. Divided parties don\u2019t win elections.\u201d In a wide-ranging interview, Khan also:  criticised the negative Conservative campaign against him, which he said had meant young, non-white people would not just think twice or three times about entering politics but \u201cthink sod it\u201d described his Conservative opponent, Zac Goldsmith, as a \u201cbad sport\u201d for failing to shake his hand after the result was declared at the end of a marathon day of counting revealed that David Cameron had phoned him to ask for help in securing a large turnout in London, where more voters are pro-EU, in June\u2019s referendum    Related: 'I'm living the dream': Sadiq Khan on his first week as London mayor    Khan said Cameron had not raised the controversy surrounding the Tory campaign for the London mayoralty, in which repeated claims about Khan\u2019s links to extremists by Goldsmith and Cameron were criticised as dog-whistle politics. \u201cIt is not for me to ask for an apology, it is for him to offer one,\u201d he said, adding that a few Conservatives had sent him messages to say they were disgusted by what had taken place. Khan said he feared that any vote for Britain to leave the EU would be devastating for the capital\u2019s economy, and that it would take London a \u201cgeneration\u201d to bounce back. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it is armageddon, we can survive, but it will take a long time to recover,\u201d he said. He also revealed that the mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, had told him on a visit \u2013 \u201conly half-jokingly\u201d \u2013 that she would \u201croll out the red carpet\u201d to welcome London-based companies to her city if Britain voted to leave. But Khan\u2019s main focus was on Labour\u2019s electability. \u201cIt is all about winning, winning for a purpose. There is no such thing as a heroic failure. We have to get back into the habit of winning elections,\u201d he told the Guardian.   Related: How London became a Labour city \u2013 and what it means for British politics    He talked about the southern attack strategy championed by former Southampton MP, John Denham, in the 1990s. He added that before 1992, his former constituency of Tooting, in London, was the furthest south that Labour held.  \u201cThe Labour party in the 1990s wasn\u2019t just looking at the Labour voters we had, it was trying to reach out and target seats. The famous toehold strategy, you win one seat in one ward as a toehold to try to win seats elsewhere,\u201d he said.  He pointed to the way in which Smith and Blair had built up support across the country, and said Corbyn should be looking to replicate that level of outreach. Corbyn was barely mentioned on the mayor\u2019s campaign literature, and did not appear alongside him at his signing-in ceremony last weekend. But Khan joined the Labour leader at last Monday\u2019s meeting of the party\u2019s MPs in Westminster, where Corbyn also conceded that while progress had been made in the local elections, \u201cwe are not yet doing enough to win in 2020\u201d. During the last week Corbyn insisted Labour had \u201can enormous tent\u201d \u2013 and in the latest evidence that Corbyn is keen to heal rifts within Labour he will give a keynote speech at the annual conference of Progress, the right-of centre Labour group. Khan said he hoped his victory would provide a \u201ctemplate\u201d to the national party about how to reach out across the political divide and persuade those who had voted for other parties, including the Tories, Ukip and SNP, to come back to Labour. He argued that wooing business had to be part of the strategy.   Related: Sadiq Khan: \u2018Ruthless? No. Decency can get you to the top in politics\u2019    \u201cMy challenge is over the next few months and years to hopefully show the rest of the country that Labour administrations can be pro-business, Labour administrations can be competent, Labour administrations can provide value for money.\u201d He said that he \u201cloved\u201d being an MP for Tooting and said as an opposition MP he could do case work to help constituents. \u201cBut can I improve the NHS, can I improve policing, can I improve schools, can I provide apprenticeships for young people in opposition? The answer: no. The MPs who remember being in government know that and I worry that some people think it is okay to be in opposition but it isn\u2019t.\u201d He said it was not appropriate for Labour to be thinking about a 10-year strategy because \u201cevery day we are out of power, people are struggling\u201d.",
