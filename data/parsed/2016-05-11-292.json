  "body": "1. Losing My Edge \u201cI\u2019m losing my edge / the kids are coming up from behind,\u201d half-mutters James Murphy, for the opening lyrics of the first track he released as LCD Soundsystem. Over the next four minutes he both predicted the shape of his own career and deflected many of the criticisms that might be levelled at it; that he\u2019s a middle-aged hipster with an overstuffed record bag into which he\u2019s only too happy to dive. He\u2019s admitting every charge against him, but qualifying his admission: \u201cDon\u2019t I have great taste?\u201d Losing My Edge was released in 2002 on a wave of rising hype for Murphy. After co-producing David Holmes\u2019 raw-sounding 2000 album Bow Down to the Exit Sign, he and former UNKLE member Tim Goldsworthy joined Jonathan Galkin in forming DFA Records, scoring an early, scuzzy hipster hit with the Rapture\u2019s House of Jealous Lovers. Recorded with longstanding collaborator Nancy Whang and Spank Rock\u2019s Alex Epton, Losing My Edge was meant to be a one-off, a reaction \u2013 as he told journalist John Doran at the time \u2013 to the fear he felt that being \u201cthe cool rock disco guy\u201d would come to a crashing end. \u201cIt became a wider thing about people who grip on to other people\u2019s creations like they are their own,\u201d he said, reflecting on his own DJ career. \u201cThere is a lot of pathos in that character, though, because it\u2019s born out of inadequacy and love.\u201d The lyric begins amid comedy, as Murphy haughtily proclaims over a skipping drum machine beat that he was at every key moment in the birth of western underground music, and ends in distorted euphoria as he bellows a litany of his key influences, from Todd Terry to Joy Division and Sun Ra to \u201cthe Sonics! The Sonics! The Sonics! The Sonics!\u201d It was some calling card.            2. Beat Connection As if to prove Losing My Edge wasn\u2019t just a one-off slice of winning introspection set to a good beat, this was on its B-side. And it\u2019s something truly special, eight minutes of taut, dramatic, perfectly controlled build-up and breakdown, as Murphy fuses disco and punk rock in the manner for which DFA became famed. Dangling on the end of a layered, rhythmic intro that takes half the song\u2019s running time to play out, it\u2019s the sound of Murphy forcing club kids and indie wallflowers together on to the floor and making them dance. \u201cEverybody here\u2019s afraid of fun / And nobody\u2019s getting any play / It\u2019s the saddest night out in the USA,\u201d he hollers, boiling down the itchy-footed insistence of (We Don\u2019t Need This) Fascist Groove Thang and the haranguing presence of Mark E Smith, filtered through the then fashionable disco-punk sound that he helped originate. 3. Yeah (Crass version) Murphy was a suburban kid from New Jersey who dropped out of his English major at New York University. He turned down the chance to write for Seinfeld and spent his 20s in a rota of unmemorable alternative groups, hitting an early peak of debatable creativity in designing the PA arrangements for dimly remembered Sub Pop signees Six Finger Satellite. (His rig was named Death From Above, which went on to give his label its title.)It\u2019s no wonder, then, that he had an array of songs ready when LCD Soundsystem started to take off. During the three-year wait between the first single and the debut album, the band released four EPs, all of which found their way on to that debut\u2019s extra disc. Much like Beat Connection, Yeah (in its \u201cCrass version\u201d; the \u201cPretentious version\u201d is a less frantic, more groove-laden thing) takes its own sweet time over its 10-minute duration, in no hurry to hit its peak of oscillating sequencers, feverishly hammered bongos, and Murphy and Whang\u2019s drowsy repetition of the title\u2019s key word. It\u2019s the other track that bred LCD Soundsystem\u2019s formidable reputation as a rock band for the clubs. 4. Daft Punk is Playing at My House            If the person in the street knows LCD Soundsystem, the chances are this is the first song they think of. In January 2005, the self-titled debut record arrived. A month later this track was released and the band moved out of the clubs, becoming as close to overground acclaim as they were ever likely to. This was their first UK top 40 single, one of only two. Having already boasted of being \u201cthe first guy playing Daft Punk to the rock kids\u201d on Losing My Edge, Murphy was back at the Parisian duo\u2019s door the year before their famed \u201cpyramid\u201d set at Coachella provided EDM\u2019s breakthrough moment in the US. The song was based on a vague and unrealised idea he had to film a Daft Punk concert in his house as though it were a big-budget live movie, and it was a rare example of an LCD Soundsystem track that relied on a developing lyrical story at its core. It also featured a bassline worthy of one of Barry Adamson\u2019s from his Magazine days and a brave and entirely convincing falsetto from Murphy. \u201cThey\u2019re a great signifier, because they manage to be genreless rather than something really specific,\u201d he told Doran about Daft Punk at the time. \u201cThey do song-style songs and techno songs; they do dark stuff and pop crossovers. It\u2019s like referring to David Bowie, who has been everything from folk to glam rock.\u201d It\u2019s important to note that every song here, and everything Murphy has recorded with LCD Soundsystem, bears roots of varying depths in Bowie\u2019s work. 5. Freak Out/Starry Eyes Given the task of picking 10 of the best from a concise career that never saw the group release a track that was less than pretty good (the debut album\u2019s bleary, Beatles-lite Never as Tired as When I\u2019m Waking Up comes closest to being a stinker), it\u2019s tempting to pick 45:33 from 2006 on a technicality. Commissioned by Nike as a soundtrack to the perfect run and inspired by Ashra guitarist Manuel Gottsching\u2019s extended, high-concept suite of Germanic electronics E2-E4 (1984), 45:33 was technically one track, which was nearly half a minute longer than the running time in the title. But a later CD issue revealed it was actually nine separate tracks and this diptych was later used as a B-side, so we\u2019ll pick it out as the highlight. Mostly instrumental, with vocals used as sampled, rhythmic motifs, Freak Out/Starry Eyes demonstrates Murphy\u2019s gift for selecting the most unlikely influential sources while infusing a track with his own gift for melody and pop hook creation. Built around an ambling but relentlessly hypnotic drumbeat and a breezily descending trumpet riff, the Freak Out section is pure Afrobeat. Starry Eyes, meanwhile, is a slice of synthpop owned by a sweetly strutting vocal from singer, actor and former Mickey Mouse Club performer Terra Deva \u2013 a fact that adds weight to the rumour that this was one of the tracks originally intended for fellow former Mouseketeer Britney Spears during Murphy\u2019s aborted recording sessions with her.       6. North American Scum The first flush of club-driven buzz that broke them on the dancefloors of Brooklyn and Europe having subsided, this was the big statement of LCD Soundsystem\u2019s overground breakthrough album Sound of Silver, a comeback single that was both a thumbed nose and a love letter to their home nation. Released in 2007, so still inhaling the last diesel fumes of George Bush\u2019s presidency, its title appeared to align itself with Eurocentric weariness at relentless displays of foreign policy muscle in the Middle East. Yet the song told a different story, primed with intent and a glistening, insistently repeated guitar riff over which Murphy and Whang positively yelped their glee at being American, warts and all. \u201cI hate the feeling when you\u2019re looking at me that way / Because we\u2019re North Americans,\u201d he hollers. \u201cYou see I love this place that I\u2019ve grown to know / And yeah, I know you wouldn\u2019t touch us with a 10-foot pole.\u201d History proved him not unreasonable. \u201cIt was kind of amazing that people started treating America like it was a different country [when Obama was elected],\u201d he told Clash magazine in 2010. \u201cLike before, it was this backward, aggro, Bush country and now it\u2019s this forward thinking, liberal country and you\u2019re like, \u2018It\u2019s the same fucking place!\u2019\u201d            7. All My Friends \u201cI kind of vowed not to make personal music,\u201d Murphy told the AV Club of the group\u2019s earliest years. \u201cYou\u2019re in a rock band singing about your life, your feelings. It seems pretty yawny in a lot of ways.\u201d By Sound of Silver this edict was out of the window, contributing to All My Friends taking its place as possibly their masterpiece. Sonically it\u2019s irresistible, a single, eager, excitable piano riff that careers through the song, joined in quick succession by a growling bassline and a serrated guitar riff that might have been played by Peter Hook and Bernard Sumner, then a Neu!-like synth wail. But it\u2019s the lyrics that really make the thing: excited for the night ahead, nostalgic for heady times past in the face of encroaching middle age, and resonating with the power of great pop music to frame a time and grant the illusion of staving off mortality. \u201cAnd if the sun comes up / And I still don\u2019t wanna stagger home,\u201d croons Murphy urgently, inspiring a hot sweat, \u201cthen it\u2019s the memory of our betters / That are keeping us on our feet.\u201d In 2013, Stereogum made it the subject of a feature entitled \u201cDeconstructing LCD Soundsystem\u2019s All My Friends and Trying to Define the Best Song of the Millennium\u201d \u2013 which was over-eager, but it wasn\u2019t hard to see where they were coming from. 8. One Touch LCD Soundsystem are best remembered for the effect they had on the dancefloor, and for contributing significantly to breaking down that now hopelessly outdated sense that analogue and electronic instruments belonged on different stages and at different times of the evenings. The third and final (so far) album, This Is Happening (2010), didn\u2019t display quite so much urgency in this regard, but where it did it demonstrated how Murphy\u2019s edge remained defiantly unlost since that debut single of eight years before. Clocking in at nearly eight minutes and composed by Murphy, Whang and Gavin Russom, One Touch is an itchy-footed acid house monster, churning with mechanical grace and almost overwhelming disdain for the fact that the group weren\u2019t megastars by this point: \u201cThere\u2019s no way that we can be pleased with this / We\u2019ve been waiting such a long time.\u201d 9. New York, I Love You But You\u2019re Bringing Me Down (live) LCD Soundsystem are a New York band informed by the outsider\u2019s perspective of New Jersey kid Murphy, a group steeped in the legends of Paradise Garage, of the no-wave scene and of Body and Soul house parties. They not only add to these legends themselves, but expand on them, documenting the early-21st-century push to fight back against the Giulianification of the city\u2019s dancing laws and club landscape with the creation of a thriving underground scene in Brooklyn. This song, a Vegas-style crooner\u2019s ballad to rank alongside Sinatra\u2019s New York, New York, closed the second album Sound of Silver (2007), but this live version from their 2011 farewell concerts at Madison Square Garden and the subsequent live album The Long Goodbye is the definitive one \u2013 the end of an era for the band and for the city itself. While someone slowly plays the Twin Peaks theme in the background, Murphy expresses his thanks, bids his farewells and gets on with it. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t everything I wanted it to be, of course,\u201d he told the Village Voice in 2007 of moving to his adopted home city, \u201cbut it\u2019s still better than everything else.\u201d 10. Throw LCD Soundsystem were skilled and thoughtful interpreters of others\u2019 work, usually on B-sides, limited releases or the live stage; you don\u2019t need to search hard to find a shoegazey take on Siouxsie and the Banshees\u2019 Slowdive, a committed but oddly Americanised version of Joy Division\u2019s No Love Lost, and recent tributes to Bowie and Prince at Coachella with \u201cHeroes\u201d and Controversy, respectively. However, the last track that the first incarnation of the group officially released \u2013 until the sweet but featherlight balladry of Christmas Will Break Your Heart heralded their comeback in December 2015 \u2013 was this cover of Carl Craig\u2019s irresistible 1994 second wave Detroit techno beat, first issued by Craig under his Paperclip People alias. A near-instrumental precisely 10 minutes long, it maintained the irresistible, train-like momentum of the original and grafted on a winningly ludicrous falsetto from Murphy towards the finale. Released as a bonus track on This Is Happening, it was awarded the ultimate kudos when Craig reissued it on his own Planet E label, placing LCD Soundsystem among a catalogue that includes such fellow North American electronic visionaries as Moodymann and Kevin Saunderson.",
