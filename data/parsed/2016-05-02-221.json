They get to see plenty of him, in a production that, before you even get in the theatre, is screaming its youthful credentials with the music blaring in the foyer. That\u2019s no bad thing, getting you pumped up for the full-frontal excesses ahead, and makes a pleasant change from most West End foyers, which resound with the tinkle of ice in G&Ts and people talking loudly about their holidays in Tuscany.   Related: Doctor Faustus review \u2013 off-with-your-kit Harington stars in Marlovian mish-mash    There is nothing in the remotest bit polite about this night at theatre, with its spraying bodily fluids and writhing bodies. Mostly it made me want to lie down quietly in a darkened room. But it\u2019s not primarily meant for me or people with a textual intimacy with Marlowe\u2019s play. Faustus, and Lloyd\u2019s similarly swaggering, campy production of The Maids \u2013 with stars from Orange Is the New Black, Fresh Meat and Downton Abbey \u2013 are part of a bold attempt to get new and younger audiences into the West End, audiences who have so far got through life very well, thank you, without knowing their Genet from their Marlowe. An audience who might go to see Book of Mormon or Mamma Mia! for a birthday treat, but who would certainly not look to 17th century drama for a big night out. An audience who know their Netflix but not their Pinter. You may not like the way he\u2019s going about it, but Lloyd is addressing a question that every theatre in the country, whether in the West End or the subsidised sector, needs to consider: how do we serve those who have never stepped inside our cultural cathedrals?  One of the concerns over his latest production, raised by some of the reviews and online commenters, has been whether audiences are not really getting to see Marlowe\u2019s Doctor Faustus. But that\u2019s unlikely to concern an audience whose familiarity with the play is minimal \u2013 so will have no idea that what they are seeing is a \u201cMarvolian mish-mash\u201d  but will certainly pick up on all the pop references in Lloyd\u2019s production and respond to the idea of Faustus as a dead-behind-the-eyes celebrity conjuror.      Fresh Meat star Zawe Ashton in The Maids. Photograph: Marc Brenner    One of my most cherished encounters in the theatre was at Headlong\u2019s The Seagull when it became apparent during the interval that the young man in the seat next to me had no idea that the play was a century old. It seemed so new-minted to him. All classics should feel like that. Likewise, many in the Faustus audience come unencumbered with any knowledge with the play\u2019s performance history. They simply take the production on its own terms. It\u2019s not a great production, not least because all the sound and fury is downright confusing and obscures the storytelling, but it does have some fine things in it: Lloyd often arranges his cast like a latter-day Bosch, Harington acquits himself pretty well and Jenna Russell\u2019s Mephistopheles is marvellously complex, a mixture of melancholy and jealousy whose post-interval rendition of Meatloaf\u2019s Bat Out of Hell is brilliant, not least in that it gives a sense that it\u2019s hellish to be constantly reminded of the Eden you\u2019ve lost. The anxiety that has surfaced in reviews \u2013 that this is more Jamie Lloyd\u2019s Faustus than Marlowe\u2019s \u2013 feeds into wider concerns about perceived dumbing down, how contemporary theatre can represent the classics for modern audiences, and how these modern audiences behave.  Most of all, it feeds into the feeling that theatres would like a younger and more diverse audience \u2013 but only on theatres\u2019 own outdated terms, and only if they can continue to churn out the same old, respectful but dusty revivals of plays with classic status.  I may not personally like what Lloyd\u2019s done with Faustus but I\u2019m delighted that he\u2019s doing it, and that it\u2019s in the West End.",
