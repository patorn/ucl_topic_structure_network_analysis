  "body": "For a brief time, in 1998, Rotherham stood proudly in the vanguard of European integration. \u201cEuro puts town on the world map,\u201d said a front-page headline in the Rotherham Advertiser in November that year. \u201cAll eyes turned on Rotherham this week as the town announced it was the first in Britain to be ready for the euro when the new currency becomes official in exactly 49 days,\u201d the paper declared. Euro notes were printed and put into limited circulation as part of a \u201ceuro ready\u201d campaign led by the chamber of commerce. Today the Rotherham euro project is long forgotten and this Labour town is, instead, a hotbed of anti-EU, pro-Brexit sentiment in the heart of South\u00a0Yorkshire. Research released this month by Chris Hanretty, reader in politics at the University of East Anglia, showed Rotherham had one the highest proportions of Brexit supporters of any constituency in the country: 49% of people backed leaving the EU and only 25% wanted to stay in. Pro-EU Labour may remain dominant on the council but this is no longer a \u201cone-party state\u201d. At the local elections on 5 May, Labour won 48 seats but Ukip strengthened its grip, taking 14. A visit to the town centre quickly yields clues as to why much of the population has turned against Europe and why Ukip is making strides. If anti-EU feeling was once a preserve of Conservative heartlands mainly in the south of England, Rotherham is proof that it is now deeply embedded in many former industrial communities in the north, too. The many foreign languages \u2013 Polish, Czech, Slovak, Urdu \u2013 spoken by shoppers are evidence of a rich multiracial, multicultural mix. David Kcak, who came over to Rotherham from the Czech Republic 10 years ago to work as a printer, is shopping with his wife Lucia. They say the town was attractive to them and many eastern Europeans after their countries joined the EU because property prices and the cost of living were low, and there was work if you looked for it. They have had two children in Rotherham, who are happily installed in local schools. \u201cWe are happy here, yes. There were no jobs at home,\u201d says David. \u201cBut not everybody likes the immigrant population.\u201d The hostility is not immediately obvious but many older people resent the change that has happened in their midst, without their asking for it. Good jobs that once existed in the coal mines have all gone and now the existence of the local Tata steelworks is under threat. Last year, Tata announced the loss of 720 British jobs in Rotherham, saying it was unable to compete against cheap foreign imports. Now the few thousand that are left may go too. A retired builder, who did not want to give his name, says the good jobs in coal and steel have been replaced by low-wage ones that eastern Europeans have taken up. Those are the hard-working ones, he says, but others just come to claim benefits and have filled up council houses and left schools overcrowded in the process. He says his town has changed beyond recognition and blames \u201cthe politicians in Europe\u201d for everything, including the loss of his bus service. \u201cEnoch Powell had it right: send \u2019em home,\u201d he says. He believes most people in Rotherham \u2013 bar the immigrants who will back a European Union that enables them to move around \u2013 will vote for Brexit.

Photograph: Rex Shutterstock    Trevor Travis, 68, a former haulage contractor, blames the EU for the demise of the steel industry and the influx of cheap Chinese imports. \u201cThe EU doesn\u2019t allow steel to be subsidised in this country. It is all Chinese now. How can that be?\u201d he asks. \u201cWe have to get out of the EU. Why do we obey all these EU rules, which on the continent they just ignore? We have to get back control for ourselves.\u201d Of course, not everyone in Rotherham is anti-EU. The manager of Eden Mobility in the town centre, Alan Bray, says he and many others don\u2019t know what to think. \u201cYou get one lot of intelligent people telling you to stay in and another lot saying vote to leave. It is difficult to know which way to go. I think I will vote to stay in because of the economic uncertainty of being on our own.\u201d His seems a minority view. Since 2012, anti-immigrant feeling has deepened as a result of the scandal of the sexual abuse of young children by gangs of predominantly Pakistani heritage in Rotherham. The scandal eroded confidence not just in the Labour council and police but in authority in general. Ukip councillors in Rotherham claim that the Labour-run council has compounded what they say was the town\u2019s already serious immigration overload by welcoming thousands of Roma over the last few years. The Roma put further strain on health services, housing and schools. Ukip councillor Peter Short says: \u201cThe teachers where they live don\u2019t speak Romanian and the children don\u2019t speak English. I feel sorry for the immigrants. They just want to get on and you can\u2019t blame them for that, but a lot of them haven\u2019t got work and they fill the schools and doctors\u2019 surgeries. Where is the joined-up thinking in that? It is ridiculous.\u201d Businessman John Turner, also a Ukip councillor, says he believes Labour councillors deliberately invited the Roma in large numbers and gave them homes believing that they would then vote Labour and keep the party in power. But he thinks more and more people have turned against Labour and the EU as a result. \u201cThere is no denying that there is a movement away from Labour, as well as hostility to the EU,\u201d he says. Andrew Mosley, editor of the Rotherham Advertiser, says feelings have moved from bitterness to anger and he senses that local people are engaging with the EU referendum as a potential means to effect real change. \u201cRotherham is a not a racist place,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have had the BNP and the EDL [English Defence League] holding marches and events here, but people in Rotherham did not want to vote for extreme parties. But they do want something new to look to.\u201d Rotherham is a proud community but one that has lost faith in those in charge, including those in the councils of Europe. \u201cI have worked on newspapers in other towns in the north and I have never known so many letters in the paper about Europe,\u201d says Mosley. \u201cIt is a big issue here.\u201d",
