  "body": "Related: Billboard music awards 2016: Madonna performs Prince tribute \u2013 as it happened    Madonna is a controversial choice to perform a Prince tribute Madonna, clad in regency-era ruffles and a purple suit in a tribute to Prince\u2019s Purple Rain video, provided the climax to the three-hour ceremony. Perhaps wary of going the route of Lady Gaga\u2019s crazed David Bowie tribute at the Grammys, Madonna instead performed Nothing Compares 2U (written by Prince but made famous by Sinead O\u2019Connor), then brought Stevie Wonder on stage for a quick blast of Purple Rain. There was nothing wrong with her performance, but it didn\u2019t quite hit the musical g-spot that a soul singer would have done. Then again, as the last woman standing of the 80s superstar triumvirate born in the US midwest in the summer of 1958 (the other, of course, being Michael Jackson), perhaps Madonna really was Prince\u2019s only true peer, though The Black Entertainment Network certainly didn\u2019t think so, promoting their own Prince tribute with the tweet \u201cYeah, we saw that. Don\u2019t worry. We got you.\u201d           Madonna and Stevie Wonder pay tribute to Prince at Billboard Music Awards    Kesha shall be released First she was going to perform, and then Dr Luke \u2013 the producer she is currently suing \u2013 said she couldn\u2019t. Presumably after some pretty heavy legal assurances that she wouldn\u2019t allude to the case in any way, a white-suited Kesha instead performed an understated cover of Bob Dylan\u2019s It Ain\u2019t Me Babe with Ben Folds. Subtle and introspective, then cutting loose at the end, her performance earned a deserved standing ovation, but where does she go from here?      Kesha performs at the Billboard music awards.

She\u2019s got a while before she catches up with the champ though \u2013 Maria Carey, who has spent 79 weeks at No 1. To mark this momentous statistic, Rihanna scooped a fan-voted award for \u201cchart achievement\u201d and performed Love on the Brain swathed in a green fur, on a set festooned with giant cobwebs.

Vegas stalwart Britney Spears opened with a medley of hits performed in red burlesque attire, and later on Celine Dion \u2013 another Vegas veteran \u2013 accepted the icon award. Her performance melded showbiz with raw emotion: she sang Queen\u2019s The Show Must Go On in memory of her husband and manager Ren\u00e9 Ang\u00e9lil, who died four months ago, and burst into tears when her son Ren\u00e9-Charles came on to present her with the award.

Instead, she scooped five awards including top artist, and even got her new video played in full, despite the fact that rather than being a Bad Blood-style extravaganza, it contained little more than Adele moving a floral-patterned skirt around. Now that\u2019s power.      Hello from the other side: Adele accepts her award from Kate Beckinsale. Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP    Pink really likes to fly  The night\u2019s other new song was Pink\u2019s tune Just Like Fire, from the film Alice Through the Looking Glass. Starting her performance looking belligerent in a black tutu and vinyl gauntlets, Pink was hoisted on a rope and swung from one end of the arena to the other, concluding her song getting astride the hands of a clock, the face of which then burst into flames. The frantic activity was memorable. The song \u2026 not so much.     Pink: way of the exploding clock. Photograph: Chris Pizzello/Invision/AP    Justin Bieber\u2019s Sorry is still a tune Justin Bieber got the most teen-hysterical response of the night and took home two awards, including best male artist and top social media artist. His performance of Company and Sorry started off as a son-et-lumi\u00e8re extravaganza, with lights playing over a semi-transparent curtain, behind which Bieber danced, but soon settled into a pretty straightforward version of Sorry, with the newly-shorn singer offering a few Michael Jackson-style crotch grabs to cheer it up. Fortunately, the song is good enough to need little adornment \u2013 even after months of ubiquitous airplay.

The Weeknd took home eight awards in total for his depraved, Michael Jackson-influenced perv pop. Tesfaye didn\u2019t perform, but accepted his award for Top 100 artist with a choked-up tribute to Prince, saying: \u201cI didn\u2019t know him but he was very close to me.\u201d     The Weeknd with his Billboard awards.

Maybe it was the 5am rave synth sound, maybe it was the dancers\u2019 leather sweaters, but more likely it was the sight of a young pop star visibly growing in confidence of her own creativity.      Ariana Grande steals the show.
