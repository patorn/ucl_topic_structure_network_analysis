  "body": "Owen Farrell is hoping to emulate Dan Carter\u2019s coolness under pressure when he comes face to face with New Zealand\u2019s World Cup winner in the Champions\u2019 Cup final between Saracens and Racing\u00a092 on Saturday. Otherwise the England fly-half insists he will treat his All Black counterpart like any normal player, and he refuses to see their looming contest in Lyon as any kind of personal duel. Carter is bidding to complete a clean sweep of rugby\u2019s major titles, having helped the All Blacks to win the Webb Ellis Cup and enjoyed four Super Rugby triumphs with the Crusaders, while Farrell has just shared in England\u2019s Six Nations grand slam triumph. The two goal-kickers will undoubtedly play significant roles in Lyon but Farrell insists it is wrong to bill it as a direct shootout.

It\u2019s not about trying to outdo the person in front of you, it\u2019s broader than that. We\u2019ve definitely looked at him and we\u2019ll continue to analyse but at the same time we need to make sure we concentrate on ourselves.\u201d Mark McCall, Saracens\u2019 director of rugby, has also warned against putting Carter on a pedestal and he believes the responsibility for subduing him is a collective one. \u201cIt\u2019s a big, big mistake to think you\u2019re going to go and get Dan Carter,\u201d McCall said. \u201cDan Carter\u2019s been doing this for a very long time so we\u2019ve got to make sure his influence in the game isn\u2019t huge or unbelievably significant. If we can do that it means our pack have got on top in the scrum and in the lineout. It means we\u2019ve put a little bit more pressure on him than he\u2019s experienced before. But if you run down his channel and think you\u2019re going to shake him up, you\u2019re not going to.\u201d Instead Farrell is hoping to take a leaf out of Carter\u2019s book by staying as calm as possible amid the weekend tumult. \u201cYou learn a lot from the best players who play the game and he\u2019s definitely one of them,\u201d Farrell said. \u201cHe\u2019s a classy player that holds himself in a classy way. I admire how calm he is and how much he is in control of what he does. It\u2019s something I\u2019m always trying to do. The more you\u2019re calm, the more you\u2019re thinking about the right things. That\u2019s definitely something I\u2019ve taken into account.\u201d Saracens have an injury doubt over the scrum-half Neil de Kock, who tweaked a hamstring against Worcester, but are otherwise at full strength as they seek to secure their first European Cup title. Farrell, who was banned for two weeks for the tackle that floored Wasps\u2019 Dan Robson in the semi-final, is predicting another tough encounter. \u201cRugby is a physical game and you have to play in a physical way. You can\u2019t be hesitant in what you do. \u201cThe collision that you\u2019re talking about was unfortunate but you have to be decisive. You can\u2019t sit there and think about it for too long. Hopefully your instincts are the right ones.\u201d",
