  "body": "Hi Gene! Hello! I am Gene Simmons. Great. Your summer tour is called the Freedom to Rock tour. Is freedom to rock a right or a privilege? You\u2019d like to think it\u2019s a right, but it really is a privilege. We can say here in western culture that it\u2019s a right, but that doesn\u2019t mean anything in North Korea, Iran or other places. So, do I think it\u2019s an inalienable human right? Of course. Does it exist like that as a fait accompli? No. You\u2019ve got to fight for it. When we last spoke, 10 years ago, you told me you were a fan of Keane because they were bringing melody back to music. Do you still like Keane? I really liked Keane, I thought the guy\u2019s voice was really great. You have to remember Keane came before Coldplay, as far as I understand it. (1) Good songs are good songs, whether it\u2019s Abba, Keane or Mot\u00f6rhead. So, yes, I really liked Keane, but the masses didn\u2019t grab on to them, did they? They were quite big in the UK. No, I think you\u2019re misunderstanding. The word \u201cbig\u201d has some value: you can\u2019t apply it to \u201cbig in Leicester\u201d or \u201cbig in Sheffield\u201d. You\u2019re either big worldwide or you\u2019re not big. Otherwise you devalue the word \u201cbig\u201d. U2 are big. I would have said \u201chuge\u201d is a possible next step up from \u201cbig\u201d. U2 are huge, Keane were big. You know, you\u2019re right. These are semantics. But I\u2019m not anti-semantic. You used that exact same joke when we spoke 10 years ago. I only know five things, and I repeat them.   Related: Gene Simmons says NWA in Rock & Roll Hall of Fame is like Led Zep in Rap Hall of Fame    What are the other four things? How about \u201cyou\u2019re a powerful and attractive man\u201d? You said that to a writer from Vice last week.  You know, what I\u2019m shocked at is that you remember what I said to you 10 years ago. Don\u2019t you have a hobby or something? That\u2019s fascinating. Why haven\u2019t Kiss had a platinum record since the 80s? (2) It is what it is; the people speak. That\u2019s the beginning and end of it. I will say that I think, in hindsight, we never spent enough time in the studio. We\u2019ve always been more of a live band. Personally, I don\u2019t have the patience to be in the studio. I admire bands like Pink Floyd and the Beatles who\u2019d spend enormous amounts of time honing their craft, but I don\u2019t have that DNA in my system. Some bands are more about being live. You want to get in there, bang it out and go out and play. Speaking of which, there\u2019s a Kiss live film coming to cinemas. (3) What happens in it? We were going to try some new technology for our show and we planned to rehearse in Vegas and set up the stage, then we figured, if we have the place for 10 days, why don\u2019t we do 10 concerts in front of a live audience? We tried descending on a flying saucer thing from the back of the hall. There was no net; if you fall, you die. We only did that once or twice. I still fly up to the top of the rafters and spit fire \u2013 there\u2019s enough life-threatening stuff during the show without adding something else. Some of your recent comments suggest you\u2019re planning to vote for Donald Trump. Is that right? (4) That\u2019s totally inaccurate. I\u2019ve known the man over the years, but that doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m going to vote for him. To be quite honest, I wish celebrities would shut up: I don\u2019t like the idea of celebrities announcing who they\u2019re for and not for, because a number of their fans will be voting just because their favourite band said to do so. That takes away the honesty of the democratic process. I\u2019m totally against advertising who I want to vote for, and I haven\u2019t made up my mind, quite honestly. Celebrities should shut up and keep it private. (5)   Related: Gene Simmons apologises after calling Prince's death 'pathetic'    Do you think there\u2019s a place for artists to speak up over issues such as North Carolina\u2019s discrimination law? I do \u2013 but that\u2019s not a political issue, that\u2019s a human rights issue. Discrimination of any kind ... Well, I don\u2019t agree with Donald Trump on his views on, say, Mexico \u2013 I would certainly speak up over the border. Do you ever consider the circumstances of your own death? I suppose it won\u2019t matter, will it? Once you\u2019re gone, you\u2019re gone. But I\u2019d like to think on my tombstone it\u2019s going to say: \u201cThank you and goodnight.\u201d Rather than \u201cCoulda, woulda, shoulda.\u201d If I look back on my life so far, I\u2019m pretty proud of the decisions I\u2019ve made. (6) Are there any surprises in your will? I\u2019m very corny, I\u2019m giving a lot of it away to causes and ideas that I believe are important. Most of it will not go to the inheritors. We all do what we think we should do. Mostly, I think, not to be too corny, we should all try to leave this place a bit better than when we came into it. Thanks Gene. Next time we speak, let\u2019s have some new jokes. Yes, sir. I\u2019ve got some visual jokes \u2013 we\u2019ll have to meet in person and I\u2019ll show you those. Footnotes 1) Gene\u2019s right and wrong. Keane formed in 1995, but released their first single in 2000; Coldplay formed in 1996 and released their first EP in 1998. 2) 1987\u2019s Crazy Nights, which had Crazy Nights on it, went platinum in Canada. 3) Kiss Rocks Vegas will be in cinemas for one night only on Wednesday 25 May. 4) Gene told Rolling Stone that Trump was \u201cthe truest political animal I\u2019ve ever seen onstage\u201d. 5) Let\u2019s take that as a yes, then. 6) On 31 December 1973, Gene set his hair on fire for the first time.",
