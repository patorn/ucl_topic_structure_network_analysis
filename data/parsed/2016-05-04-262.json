  "body": "Amnesty International has accused the first minister of Northern Ireland, Arlene Foster, of delaying justice by blocking funds for a series of inquests into Troubles-related killings. Foster, the leader of the Democratic Unionist party (DUP), confirmed she had used her influence in the devolved power-sharing executive to hold back finance for a backlog of inquests connected to the conflict.  Patrick Corrigan, Amnesty\u2019s director in Northern Ireland, said: \u201cJustice delayed is justice denied.\u201d The inquests are in the main connected to killings mostly involving the security forces rather than paramilitaries, including the Ballymurphy massacre of 1971, when British soldiers shot dead 11 civilians. However, the delayed inquests do include the 1976 IRA massacre of 10 Protestant civilians in South Armagh. Northern Ireland\u2019s lord chief justice, Declan Morgan, signed off a request for funding for the inquests, which cover about 80 deaths, but this request was blocked due to DUP opposition on the executive.  Corrigan criticised that decision. \u201cHere we have scores of families who have been denied even inquests for decades now into the deaths of their loved ones,\u201d he said. \u201cThey deserve those inquests, have a right to them, and such rights shouldn\u2019t become bargaining chips in some kind of political game and that seems to be what\u2019s going on,\u201d Corrigan added. Speaking on Tuesday night on the last major television debate before Thursday\u2019s Northern Ireland assembly elections, Foster defended the decision to block the cash for the inquests.  \u201cUnfortunately a lot of innocent victims feel that their voice has not been heard recently and there has been an imbalance in relation to state killings as opposed to paramilitary killings,\u201d the first minister said. Foster said she was surprised that the business in the Northern Ireland executive was being discussed in the news. \u201cI wanted the opportunity to discuss further with the lord chief justice around the issues with innocent victims and how we can deal with their issues and I make no apologies for that. I think the rights of innocent victims are very key in this and I will not allow any process to rewrite the past.\u201d",
