  "body": "Sarah Palin on Sunday joined the war gripping the Republican party, promising to do \u201cwhatever I can\u201d for the primary opponent of House speaker Paul Ryan, who is up for re-election in November.   Related: Sarah Palin backs Donald Trump as Clinton focuses her fire \u2013 campaign live    On Thursday, Ryan, whose Republican vice-presidential nomination in 2012 followed Palin\u2019s in 2008, said he could not yet support this year\u2019s presumptive presidential pick, Donald Trump. After senior figures across the party expressed their unease and distaste regarding a Trump candidacy, the two men arranged a meeting this week. \u201cIt\u2019s time for a change,\u201d Palin wrote on a Facebook post on Sunday. \u201c Paul Ryan abandoned the district he was to represent as special interests dictated his legislative priorities. Without ever having a real job outside of politics, it seems he disconnected himself from the people, thus easily disrespected the will of the people.\u201d She then promised her support to \u201cthe independent conservative businessman, Paul Nehlen\u201d, whom she called \u201cthe worthy challenger\u201d to Ryan. Palin was also interviewed on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, where she said she would support Ryan\u2019s primary opponent. \u201cI think Paul Ryan is soon to be \u2018Cantored\u2019, as in Eric Cantor,\u201d she said, alluding to the former Republican House leader who was knocked out of his seat in 2014 by a more conservative candidate. \u201cHis political career is over but for a miracle because he has so disrespected the will of the people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd yeah, as the leader of the GOP, the convention, certainly he is to remain neutral. And for him to already come out and say who he will not support is not a wise decision of his. \u201cIf the GOP were to win [the general election] now, that wouldn\u2019t bode well for his chances in 2020, and that\u2019s what he\u2019s shooting for,\u201d she said, adding that Ryan\u2019s decision \u201ckinda screws his chances for the 2020 bid\u201d.    We worked so hard to get Paul Ryan in there and so many other quote-unquote conservatives, and look what they have done  Sarah Palin     Asked whether she would support the man challenging Ryan in a primary race in Wisconsin this fall, Palin said she would.  \u201cI will do whatever I can for Paul Nehlen,\u201d she said. \u201cThis man is a hard-working guy, so in touch with the people. Nehlen has said he will support Trump as the nominee, because \u201cit will have been the will of the voters that got him there\u201d. Palin said that Republicans in Congress, in contrast to Nehlen, have stopped listening to those voters. \u201cPaul Ryan and his ilk, their problem is they have become so disconnected by the people whom they are elected to represent,\u201d she said. She added that Republicans like Ryan feel \u201cfeel so threatened at this point that their power, their prestige, their purse will be adversely affected by the change that is coming with Trump and with someone like Paul Nehlen, that they\u2019re not thinking straight right now. \u201cWe worked so hard to get Paul Ryan in there and so many other quote-unquote conservatives, and look what they have done.\u201d Asked if she would be interested in running for vice-president again, this time with Trump, Palin said: \u201cI think I\u2019m pretty much as vetted as anybody in the country could be vetted, already.\u201d   Related: Clinton-Trump election could 'scramble' traditional electoral map, experts say    The former Alaska governor retreated from an expression of interest, though. \u201cThey already know who I am, what I stand for. They wouldn\u2019t be in for any surprises. I wanna help and not hurt,\u201d she said. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to be a burden on the ticket, and I recognize that in many, many eyes I would be. \u201cI just want the guy to win. I want America to win.\u201d Asked about her former running mate, Senator John McCain, who was caught on tape this week saying Trump had turned McCain\u2019s own re-election in Arizona into \u201cthe race of [his] life\u201d by denigrating Hispanic people, Palin said: \u201cI sure wish that politicians wouldn\u2019t worry about these racial divides that are for the most part made up. \u201cJohn McCain and I have gone through a lot of battles, separately and together, and I really respect the man,\u201d she added. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have any more to worry about with Latinos than he would have explaining his record to the general populace in Arizona.\u201d",
