  "body": "Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s remote, tranquil stable is the perfect place to induce calmness in racehorses and on Monday it would also have been the place to soothe fretful fans of his US Army Ranger following an unimpressive Derby trial last week. The colt scrambled home by a short-head in the Chester Vase, beating a tenderly ridden stablemate who was carrying more weight, but O\u2019Brien was ready here with a list of reasons to be cheerful about that outcome.   Related: Derby favourite US Army Ranger just beats stablemate in Chester Vase    \u201cEveryone is knocking this horse but they shouldn\u2019t,\u201d the trainer said quietly as he watched US Army Ranger floating up the gallops with an unraced lead horse. \u201cI was very happy.\u201d One of the main reasons for that response is a change in the way O\u2019Brien approaches this fortnight of prep-races, the emphasis having shifted from winning to learning. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of horses that won the trials and were disappointing in the Derby. If we have them in a way that they go for the trials and they bolt in, they don\u2019t improve. I would always rather get beat, knowing that the horse is going to improve and knowing something tactically about the horse.\u201d Learning is of particular importance in the case of US Army Ranger, who did not race as a two-year-old and has a lot of catching up to do. O\u2019Brien calls him babyish and reports that he was whinnying almost immediately after the Chester race. \u201cThe poor horse was so green. He was kind of saying: \u2018What\u2019s after happening to me?\u2019\u201d A symptom of that greenness, which O\u2019Brien also referred to as \u201cstage fright\u201d, was that the colt apparently did\u00a0not change his leading leg after being\u00a0switched to challenge up the inside rail in the final quarter-mile, with the result that \u201che never really got racing,\u201d according to the trainer. The colt, we are told, was too busy looking at the crowd on one side and his stablemate on the other to do the professional thing, switch his leading leg and quicken. Whether such a horse can progress enough to make the most of his chance in the Derby three weeks on Saturday is a fair question. He is having an easy week or so before his preparation is quickly ramped up once more and O\u2019Brien says he will see the evidence, at that stage, of how much US Army Ranger has learned from Chester. The Irishman does not deny that the 11-2 shot is his main hope of a sixth Derby success but there are others. Idaho, Shogun and Port Douglas appear to have done enough to earn their places. Deauville and Black Sea may yet do so in York\u2019s Dante Stakes on Thursday.

The main issue is not the expected one, that his Coolmore employers would much rather win the race with a colt, but the trainer\u2019s doubts about her stamina, which would be less thoroughly tested in the Oaks. \u201cMy experience with the lads, as they get older, the commercial thing doesn\u2019t matter as much as when I came here 20 years ago. They want to run in the big races and have the best chance of winning. But you can\u2019t say for sure that Minding will get a mile and a half. \u201cBecause there has to be a question mark about stamina with her, I would imagine, just thinking the way the lads think, they would prefer to go gently, gently, finding out about that and go against the fillies first and then go on, if she proves it, and go against the colts later on.\u201d But O\u2019Brien is, as ever, anxious that you should not interpret his words as indicating a final decision has been made. \u201cNothing\u2019s written in stone and they reserve the right to change their mind in five minutes,\u201d he adds.   Related: Midterm passes his Derby Trial examination at Sandown    On the face of it, the value of O\u2019Brien\u2019s two Dante runners will lie mostly in giving him an idea of how his horses compare with the likes of Midterm, the Sir Michael Stoute-trained Dante favourite. He describes Deauville as \u201ca very solid horse\u201d who may have had one run too many when well beaten in the Racing Post Trophy. He has little to say about Black Sea but notes that Ryan Moore \u201cgave him a very good ride\u201d when he narrowly won a Listed contest last time. Perhaps this Derby, like the last one, will not contain an O\u2019Brien colt quite good enough to fight out the finish but his stable seems, as ever, to be heaving with talent. Near the top of the list is Found, a Breeders\u2019 Cup winner who could take in the Coronation Cup at Epsom or the Prince of Wales\u2019s Stakes at Royal Ascot next month. There is also Vancouver, a hefty sprinter who won a Grade One in Australia and will soon make his Irish debut as a prep for Ascot. A size bigger again is De Coronado, a three-year-old brother to Zenyatta who is some way off being ready to make his racecourse debut. O\u2019Brien calls him \u201cthe biggest horse we\u2019ve had here\u201d. A notable absentee is O\u2019Brien\u2019s son, Joseph, who is on day one of the course run by the Irish Turf Club that will lead to him having a licence in his own name. In the meantime, Joseph\u2019s horses are running in his father\u2019s name. \u201cI\u2019m having a great time,\u201d O\u2019Brien Sr says. \u201cI\u2019m getting winners all over the place.\u201d",
