  "body": "Last year, absenteeism (days of work lost due to stress, illness, anxiety or depression) grew by 25%, according to figures from the Labour Force Survey, that\u2019s 17 billion working days. While we are being given more options to fit work around our outside responsibilities \u2013 since June 2014 all workers have had the right, by law, to request flexible working after 26 weeks, there is a suggestion that stability could be preferable. A small US survey found unpredictability to be the biggest factor contributing to workplace stress. So could a role that is more predictable, and which allows for a better work-life balance, offer greater job satisfaction?  Take Ricky Rusby: Monday to Friday, his alarm goes off at 4am. Shortly afterwards he cycles to Westminster, London. By 6am he\u2019s joined his two teammates on a refuse collection truck, clearing the city streets of the bags and bins that have piled up over the previous day. Fifty-year-old Rusby\u2019s routine has changed fairly little during his 30 years as a refuse collector for Westminster council and, more recently, Veolia, a waste, water and energy management company. He enjoys the sense of routine.  Dr Gail Kinman, professor of occupational health psychology at the University of Bedfordshire, says: \u201cWork-life conflict is one of the main causes of upset and stress, of lack of time with family, and of a failure to enjoy your social life.\u201d She adds that a more predictable job where you have go into work at set times, take breaks (rather than eating lunch while working) and have time to interact with your workmates could make you happier.  Claire Oliver, who is a team leader for Bright and Beautiful domestic cleaning services near Margate in Kent, enjoys the sense of camaraderie among her colleagues \u2013 they also work to a strict schedule.  The 44-year-old single mum took on the job part-time to fund her MA in English. She says of her teammates: \u201cWe are all women, most of us are single parents, or at least have had children. So there\u2019s quite a deep understanding of how life can be as a working mother.\u201d Dr Luke Sullivan, a clinical psychologist and an ambassador for the Minds at Work campaign, agrees strong ties with colleagues can add value to your job. \u201cThose relationships are very much what sustain people within the workplace. The number one benefit of working is that we have contact with other people.\u201d Meanwhile, Kinman says work that is physically demanding, but less emotionally or mentally draining, could also be beneficial for relationships outside of work. This is true for Rusby who enjoys time off with his wife \u2013 the couple have been together for 30 years and take regular holidays including to the US, Australia, Singapore and South America. They also designate a weekend, at least a couple of times a month, to enjoy London, whether it\u2019s visiting an exhibition or trying out a new restaurant.  Kurt Neumann, 32, has also been in the same industry for a significant time \u2013 he is now in his sixth year as a waiter. He enjoys providing good customer service. \u201cIf people go away and they\u2019re happy, and say \u2018I\u2019ve had a good time, a great meal and great service\u2019, that lifts my day.\u201d While customers can have a positive influence on Neumann\u2019s job, they are occasionally the worst part. \u201cSometimes you get people that come along, order six beers and get completely hammered. I have to go over to them and be like, \u2018Come on guys, it\u2019s 6pm. You don\u2019t need to swear, calm down\u2019. Some are great about it and others give you lip and then your job gets really awkward\u201d However, Neumann and his colleagues back one another up in such situations. The variety of people he meets at work is a positive. \u201cIn hospitality there\u2019s a high staff turnover, so you meet a lot of people that you\u2019d never meet anywhere else, except maybe in school \u2013 working in a team is my favourite part of the job.\u201d    Related: How to deal with stress at work    Focusing on the upsides can be a good approach to being happy at work. Kinman says: \u201cIf you hate your job and you\u2019re seen to hate it you\u2019ll give the impression you think you\u2019re too good. Your co-workers are not going to like you, so you\u2019re not going to get their support.\u201d  Kinman adds that while in the long-term no one can survive working 40 hours a week in a job they hate, making small changes can alter your perception of a job you don\u2019t enjoy. If it is becoming too routine for your liking she suggests talking to your manager and discussing ways to make the job your own \u2013 playing to your strengths and interests. For Oliver, job satisfaction comes, in part, from creating time and space for customers in stressful situations. \u201cWe\u2019ve got an old couple we clean for and the guy is really poorly. Everytime that I go in [to clean] they are very kind to us, very sweet, very grateful. There\u2019s that human touch I think, that feeling you\u2019re doing something to help people.\u201d Kinman suggests a couple of other tactics if you\u2019ve lost motivation at work \u2013 or are feeling overwhelmed. You could try setting yourself short-term goals. For every unfavourable task you complete, or tough project you round up, give yourself a small reward. And short-term goals can work alongside long-term ambitions. If your job is not something you see as part of your long-term career plans, but will help you in terms of experience or building up savings, consider how it could benefit you in the future \u2013 perhaps build up an itinerary for an exciting year or two in the future.  Lastly, Kinman says: \u201cTry to find somebody you can use as a bit of a coach. Somebody that understands your long-term goals \u2013 a friend you can let off steam to.\u201d Looking for a job?
