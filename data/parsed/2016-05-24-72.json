  "body": "Black Grape \u2013 Big Day in the North Big Day in the North is one of my favourite tracks. It also kicks off the Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe movie Virtuosity, and, if I say so myself, it looks and sounds great.            Echo and the Bunnymen \u2013 The Killing Moon This track takes me back to the early to mid 1980s. Ocean Rain \u2013 what an album. I like The Cutter, too. The Bunnymen are one of my favourite bands.              Cast \u2013 Fine Time I think all of Cast\u2019s singles are great, especially this one from their album All Change. Looking forward to seeing them live.             Bentley Rhythm Ace \u2013 Bentley\u2019s Gonna Sort You Out I remember hearing this song a lot in the 90s \u2013 what a tune!            The House of Love \u2013 Shine On One of the releases from the early years of Creation records, from the late 80s. Another good song and with a pretty apt title for Shiiine On festival\u2019s playlist!",
