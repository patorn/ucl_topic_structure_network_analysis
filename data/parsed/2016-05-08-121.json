And on Monday we were reminded of the great rapper\u2019s absence once again when his mother Afeni Shakur, died in her northern California home  aged 69. Though it feels as though, with her death, our last notable connection to the rap great has been severed, Afeni wasn\u2019t simply a mother to Tupac and his sister Sekyiwa. She was a former member of the Black Panther Party, an activist and philanthropist. She was also a savvy businesswoman, establishing a trust to ensure that Tupac\u2019s work will always be protected.  Partly due to this attention to his legacy, Tupac\u2019s fans embraced Afeni. She already had a public profile thanks to Tupac\u2019s 1995 single Dear Mama, the nearest thing hip-hop has to a Mother\u2019s Day anthem. The track was a poignant peek into a complicated, but loving and relatable bond with his mother:   When I was young me and my mama had beef / 17 years old kicked out on the streets / Though back at the time I never thought I\u2019d see her face / Ain\u2019t a woman alive that could take my mama\u2019s place.             Afeni\u2019s fostering and nurturing of her son\u2019s talent set the foundation for his impact in music. She wasn\u2019t always physically by his side, but she was his support system playing co-pilot as he navigated his way through fame. Though Tupac was shot dead aged just 25, Afeni reminded us that a mother\u2019s love is eternal. She kept the rapper\u2019s memory alive carefully, curating the releases of a massive selection of writings, recordings and memorabilia. In 1997, she launched the Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation aimed at encouraging and empowering young people aspiring to work in the arts. Afeni Shakur is a prime example of the role some mothers have played in hip-hop culture. Her work in maintaining her son\u2019s legacy is not uncommon, especially when some of hip-hop\u2019s most pioneering figures have tended to die young. Maureen Yancey, affectionately known as Ma Dukes, is the mother of producer J Dilla who died of a blood disease in 2006. In the years following his untimely death, Ma Dukes has coordinated the annual Dilla Day Weekend celebration in his honor.  Voletta Wallace, mother of the Notorious BIG, launched the Christopher Wallace Memorial Foundation after he was shot dead in 1997. The organization provides scholarships and grants for students, and supplies schools and community centers with necessary teaching materials. Wallace also attempted a wrongful death lawsuit against the LAPD in hopes of seeking answers and accountability for her son\u2019s still unsolved murder. The lawsuit was dismissed. And it\u2019s not just the deceased whose mothers become known in hip-hop. Drake\u2019s relationship with his mom Sandi Graham has been the forefront of many of his most emotional songs. Deb Antney, mother of Waka Flocka Flame, is also his manager. Big Sean credits his mother, Myra Anderson, with giving him the courage to trust his instincts, while Diddy routinely thanks his mother, Janice Combs, who raised him on her own after his father was murdered.  Ludacris\u2019s mother, Roberta Shields, runs his charity organization devoted to \u201chelping youth help themselves\u201d. The same goes for Jay Z\u2019s mother, Gloria Carter, who in 2003 co-founded the Sean Carter Foundation, an organization that provides scholarships, college tours, counseling and other programs to empower youth on the quest for higher education. Then there are the mothers who didn\u2019t live to see the full extent of their children\u2019s success. Donda West, mother to Kanye, died in 2007 after undergoing cosmetic surgery. West was hands-on in her son\u2019s career, working as his manager. At the launch of his The Life of Pablo album, Kanye previewed a computer game which showed her entering the gates of heaven, which if nothing else once again revealed his deep feelings of loss.  Were it not for their mothers, our favorite hip-hop artists literally wouldn\u2019t exist. Sometimes their toughest critics and strongest defenders, fans are grateful for mothers like Afeni Shakur and what she meant to the genre.",
