  "body": "Darren Clarke has revealed J\u00fcrgen Klopp will be among those he will approach for advice before the Ryder Cup battle with the United States at Hazeltine later this year. The captain is looking to continue a terrific run of European success in the biennial event. During the last Ryder Cup at Gleneagles, Paul McGinley asked Sir Alex Ferguson to inspire the home players. Clarke, whose footballing allegiance is with the red half of Merseyside, will continue that alliance but has also earmarked Klopp as a valuable sounding board. \u201cJ\u00fcrgen Klopp is definitely one of the guys I want to speak to, especially as a Liverpool fan myself,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cHe\u2019s an absolute livewire isn\u2019t he? He\u2019s a bundle of energy and that sort of thing can be infectious. He\u2019s obviously very passionate and a terrific motivator so I want to pick his brains a bit.

Sir Alex Ferguson was such an inspirational figure at Gleneagles that I\u2019d love to have him on board again. I\u2019ll look into whether he\u2019s free that week, and check out the possibility of flying him over with us. \u201cBut I\u2019ll be talking to a bunch of people over a whole range of sports. Clive Woodward is another guy who would be very interesting on the team dynamic and the former Ireland and Lions captain Paul O\u2019Connell is another one.\u201d Clarke hosted two dinners with those looking to make his team during Players Championship week. During them, he pressed home one of his key messages as taken from the Ireland rugby team\u2019s adopted pre-match anthems. \u201cI want to use Shoulder to Shoulder as a sort of team mantra for this Ryder Cup,\u201d Clarke said. \u201cI don\u2019t want our players huddling together before we tee off but I do want to stress the fact we are all in this together, we\u2019re a united force, and we\u2019re much stronger together.\u201d",
