  "body": "They could not match Bayern Munich for class or quality or resources \u2013 but when has that ever stopped them? Because the remarkable story of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid and Diego Simeone is a tale of heart and guts and togetherness; of a group of players who possess an unshakeable belief in their manager; a manager who knows how to drag something visceral and primal out of his players. What they lack in beauty is made up for by the intensity of their passion, the emotion of their football and the delight they take in bloodying the noses of Europe\u2019s super clubs. Even when they look beaten, they find a way to win.   Related: Antoine Griezmann fires Atl\u00e9tico Madrid into final at Bayern\u2019s expense    Atl\u00e9tico have knocked out Barcelona and now they have beaten Bayern \u2013 an achievement akin to Stan Wawrinka beating Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal on the way to winning the Australian Open in 2014 \u2013 and it is guaranteed they will give Manchester City or Real Madrid one hell of a game in the final at San Siro on 28 May. They defied the odds once again. The first temptation was to identify flaws in Pep Guardiola\u2019s style after the Bayern manager endured a third semi-final defeat against Spanish opposition in as many years. After three seasons, Guardiola will leave Germany without coming close to winning the Champions League and those afflicted with the jerkiest knees in English football will question whether City have chosen the right man to replace Manuel Pellegrini. Yet Lionel Messi, Luis Su\u00e1rez and Neymar could not rescue Barcelona against Atl\u00e9tico in the previous round. There are unsavoury aspects to Simeone\u2019s character \u2013 he is serving a three-match touchline ban domestically and it is not always easy to warm to his team\u2019s antics \u2013 but it took a supreme effort from Atl\u00e9tico to reach their second Champions League final in three seasons. They were collectively outstanding in both legs and there were vital individual contributions as well. Sa\u00fal \u00d1\u00edguez provided the inspiration in the first leg with his splendid solo winner and the tie hinged on Jan Oblak\u2019s penalty save from Thomas M\u00fcller moments after Xabi Alonso had levelled it on aggregate after 30 minutes of the second leg, before the outstanding Antoine Griezmann stunned Bayern by scoring the decisive away goal eight minutes into the second half. Bayern were briefly teased with a glimpse of vulnerability. M\u00fcller, the man with ice running through his veins, was ready to finish off Atl\u00e9tico. The narrative was set. The man whose absence in the Vicente Calder\u00f3n had caused such a stir in Germany had been presented with a glorious opportunity to underline his importance to Bayern \u2013 and surely there was no chance that the scorer of 36 goals for club and country this season would fail to score from 12 yards. M\u00fcller stuttered, he looked and he tried to kid Oblak. And he failed. It was a poor penalty from one of the deadliest strikers in the world, struck far too close to the Atl\u00e9tico goalkeeper. Bayern could have been forgiven for accepting their fate at that point. The fear for them had been a night of sterile domination, despite Guardiola restoring M\u00fcller to the attack in place of Kingsley Coman. They knew the numbers: Atl\u00e9tico had not conceded a goal in 602 minutes and had shipped five goals in 11 Champions League matches this season. And Diego God\u00edn, the leader of their defence, was fit again after missing last week\u2019s game with a minor injury. Yet as soon as Cuneyt Cakir blew his whistle, it was clear this was going to be different. Atl\u00e9tico kicked off but Bayern won possession with barely 10 seconds gone, setting the tone for a frenetic first-half performance in which they deservedly levelled the tie on aggregate. The visitors began with the intention of trying to test Bayern\u2019s back four but it was not long before they were retreating into ultra-defensive mode. For once, Simeone \u2013 a prowling menace in his black coat, black shirt and black tie \u2013 was struggling for answers on the touchline as he grimly watched his players strain to repel wave after wave of wave of Bayern attacks.

Photograph: Matthias Hangst/Bongarts/Getty Images    For a Guardiola side, Bayern were surprisingly direct. David Alaba and Philipp Lahm never seemed to stop making runs on the overlap, Douglas Costa and Franck Rib\u00e9ry were quick to fling high crosses towards Robert Lewandowski and M\u00fcller, and Atletico were unable to pick their way through the first line of Bayern\u2019s pressing. Openings appeared; more than even Bayern might have anticipated. M\u00fcller volleyed wide in the 16th minute, Lahm fizzed a shot over, Arturo Vidal went close and Oblak had to react smartly to stop the ball getting to Lewandowski for an easy tap-in.

Jos\u00e9 Gim\u00e9nez fouled Alaba on the edge of the area and Alonso\u2019s low free-kick beat Oblak, thanks to a deflection. Bayern had smashed their way through the Atl\u00e9tico wall and now there was a danger it was about to fall to pieces. Within minutes, Gim\u00e9nez had panicked again, hauling Javi Mart\u00ednez to the ground at a Bayern corner. Up stepped M\u00fcller, the ideal man in a pressure situation. Or so we thought. Oblak\u2019s heroics kept the tie in the balance, allowing Simeone to make adjustments during the break. He reacted decisively, making an attacking substitution by bringing on Yannick Carrasco for Gabi Fern\u00e1ndez, and he was rewarded for his positivity when a rare Atl\u00e9tico counterattack ended with Griezmann scoring the goal that put them 2-1 up on aggregate. Fernando Torres, rejuvenated despite squandering a late penalty, exposed Bayern\u2019s high line by slipping Griezmann through on goal, the flag stayed down and the French forward showed why he is coveted by the richest clubs in Europe by coolly stroking his finish past Manuel Neuer. Now Bayern needed to score two more goals against the meanest defence in Europe. Lewandowski managed one, heading in from close range but Oblak would not be beaten again, despite incessant late pressure, and there will be no grand ending for Guardiola\u2019s Bayern. Instead, a first European Cup beckons for Atl\u00e9tico.",
