  "body": "1) Leicester City 4-2 Sunderland, 8 August 2015   Odds   City are meant to be reeling from Nigel Pearson\u2019s exit \u2013 but instead just pick up where they left off in May. They reach the break three up via Jamie Vardy and two from Riyad Mahrez; in truth it could have been six. Marc Albrighton hits the fourth in the second half. Claudio Ranieri\u2019s debut as Leicester manager is as breathtaking as it is unexpected \u2013 but he shrugs it off. \u201cI just asked my players: \u2018You finished well last season and I want to see you restart at the same level.\u2019 The first half was outstanding, the second we made mistakes. But it is OK.\u201d 1. Leicester City P1 Pts32.

Photograph: Matthew Lewis/Getty Images    2) West Ham 1-2 Leicester City, 15 August   Odds   Two games in, and the relegation predictions are already looking shaky. Ranieri\u2019s side play chests-out football at Upton Park, full of cohesion and belief. Shinji Okazaki, set up by Vardy, gives Leicester the lead in the 27th minute, and 11 minutes later Mahrez hits his third of the season. \u201cFirst half we played well,\u201d says Ranieri. \u201cWe surprised West Ham. Then I watched my players suffer and fight together. But I want to maintain a low profile. We can\u2019t think we are top of the league. We have six points, that is all that\u2019s important.\u201d 1. Leicester City P2 Pts62. Manchester United P2 Pts63. Everton P2 Pts44. Swansea P2 Pts45. Manchester City P1 Pts36.

Photograph: Adam Davy/PA    3) Leicester City 1-1 Tottenham, 22 August    Odds   For 25 seconds it looks as though City are about to be punished for their first flat display of the season \u2013 Dele Alli\u2019s header nine minutes from time putting Spurs in front. But the goal just sparks a Leicester onslaught, an almost instant equaliser from the irrepressible Mahrez and, soon after, nearly a winner, as Hugo Lloris makes a late save to thwart Wes Morgan. \u201cThis was the perfect example of our spirit,\u201d says Ranieri. \u201cNow we have seven points and we look to achieve 40 points very soon. This is our first target.\u201d 1. Leicester City P3 Pts72. Manchester United P3 Pts73. Manchester City P2 Pts64. Crystal Palace P3 Pts6     Riyad Mahrez strikes against Tottenham.

But the relentlessness that saved them last season keeps their points tally ticking over again, via a late Vardy penalty. \u201cYou can lose in football but you have to fight in every moment,\u201d Ranieri says. \u201cIt\u2019s not important if Bournemouth score the second or third. It\u2019s important how you leave the pitch at the end of the match.\u201d 1. Manchester City P4 Pts122. Crystal Palace P4 Pts93. Leicester City P4 Pts84.

Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images    5) Leicester City 3-2 Aston Villa, 13 September   Odds   With 70 minutes played Villa are two up. It looks as if Leicester\u2019s wheels have come off \u2013 until another blistering recovery. Ritchie De Laet pulls one back on 72 minutes, Vardy hits the equaliser on 82 and Nathan Dyer finds a winner with one minute left. Fans are euphoric; Ranieri plays it cool. \u201cWe have to stay focused,\u201d he says. \u201cOur goal is to stay in the Premier League. It\u2019s not March or April, it\u2019s only September. Afterwards we can dream, but not now.\u201d 1. Manchester City P5 Pts152. Leicester City P5 Pts113. Manchester United P5 Pts104. Arsenal P5 Pts10     Nathan Dyer beats Brad Guzan to score the third. Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images    6) Stoke City 2-2 Leicester City, 19 September   Odds   Another week, another comeback. Two goals down away from home, Ranieri\u2019s side salvage an unlikely draw via a Mahrez penalty and Vardy\u2019s opportunistic 69th-minute leveller. The manager admits his side have to stop putting themselves under such pressure. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to do this all the time. But we said in the dressing room at half-time, if we get the next goal, everything is possible. It\u2019s important to show good spirit, good character and a good reaction.\u201d The unbeaten start goes on. 1. Manchester City P6 Pts152. West Ham P6 Pts123. Leicester City P6 Pts124.

Photograph: Plumb Images/Leicester City FC via Getty Images    7) Leicester City 2-5 Arsenal, 26 September    Odds   This time, though, there is no escape. It looks like a reality check as Alexis S\u00e1nchez hits three in a devastating Arsenal display. Vardy scores both Leicester\u2019s goals. Asked to describe his side\u2019s relentless style in the opening few games, Ranieri chooses one word: \u201cWhoosh\u201d. He adds: \u201cWe are sad now because we wanted to continue to be unbeaten. But when you play against Arsenal, United, Chelsea, City, it\u2019s extra. It is important to learn. For now we feel down, but our spirit must stay very high.\u201d The defeat leaves them sixth. 1.

Photograph: Stuart MacFarlane/Arsenal FC via Getty Images    8) Norwich City 1-2 Leicester City, 3 October   Odds   But not for long. The Foxes surge straight back into the top four \u2013 and deservedly so. Vardy scores for the fifth match in a row and takes his season\u2019s total to seven; Jeff Schlupp hits the second. Leicester then hold off a late Norwich fightback to secure the points and go level with the season\u2019s other surprise package so far, third-placed Palace. Ranieri praises his players\u2019 recovery from their Arsenal experience. \u201cWe were very, very determined today. At the end, it was a big battle, a good English period \u2013 I love this kind of period. Every match in England, it\u2019s never finished, you have to fight until the 96th minute.\u201d 1.

Photograph: Harry Engels/Getty Images    9) Southampton 2-2 Leicester City, 17 October   Odds   More resilience, more staying power, more spirit. After a flat first-half performance, which allows Jos\u00e9 Fonte and Virgil van Dijk to put Southampton two up, Vardy scores twice to secure what had appeared an unlikely point. \u201cJamie is important for us,\u201d Ranieri says. \u201cIf I was a player I\u2019d always think: \u2018Oh, Jamie can score, Jamie can score\u2019 and this is important for the rest of the team. He\u2019s got good stamina, and it\u2019s good for us to think during the match: \u2018Jamie can score.\u2019 I think only of Leicester, but if Roy Hodgson wants him [at Euro 2016] it\u2019s good for him, good for Jamie, good for Leicester, good for everybody.\u201d City slip to fifth. 1.

Photograph: Jordan Mansfield/Getty Images    10) Leicester City 1-0 Crystal Palace, 24 October   Odds   Vardy celebrates scoring for the 10th time this season by counting all his fingers, and Ranieri agrees to fulfil his pledge to take the squad out for a pizza \u2013 a reward for their first clean sheet of the season. \u201cYou saw how we defended at the end, great resilience,\u201d says Vardy. \u201cThe pizzas are on the gaffer. He\u2019s been saying he wants to buy us them so I\u2019ll make sure he does.\u201d Ranieri: \u201cThis was a tactical match, more Italian than English. Until the last 10 minutes \u2013 then it was just a big battle.\u201d 1. Arsenal P10 Pts222. Manchester City P9 Pts213. West Ham P10 Pts204. Manchester United P9 Pts195.

Photograph: Nigel French/PA    11) West Brom 2-3 Leicester City, 31 October   Odds   Mahrez turns the game with two goals in seven minutes, then Vardy continues his remarkable run \u2013 making it 11 goals for the season by scoring in his eighth successive match. Still unbeaten away, Leicester climb to third. \u201cJamie is just starting his career now,\u201d says Ranieri. \u201cHe comes from non-league but for him it is not too late to arrive at a high, high level. I wish all the best for him. I have a very good feeling now, not only with the strikers or only with Vardy. I feel very good here with the chairman, with the family of the chairman, with all my staff, with all our players, all our fans. It is fantastic, there is a good electricity. I\u2019m a lucky man.\u201d 1. Manchester City P11 Pts252. Arsenal P11 Pts253. Leicester City P11 Pts224. Manchester United P11 Pts21     Mahrez fires past Boaz Myhill at the Hawthorns. Photograph: Plumb Images/Getty Images    12) Leicester City 2-1 Watford, 7 November   Odds   N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 opens the scoring via a farcical mistake from Watford keeper Heurelho Gomes before Vardy\u2019s 12th of the season helps Leicester edge a slow-burner. It leaves Ranieri\u2019s side level on points with Manchester City and Arsenal at the top. \u201cWe could not have imagined this, but it is only November,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not May. We still have to achieve 40 points first. It is important to continue the momentum. It\u2019s not easy for us, but we are very ambitious.\u201d 1. Manchester City P11 Pts252. Arsenal P11 Pts253.

Photograph: Nigel French/PA    13) Newcastle United 0-3 Leicester City, 21 November   Odds   Vardy equals Ruud van Nistelrooy\u2019s feat of scoring in 10 successive Premier League games \u2013 striking the first in a 3-0 romp, with Leonardo Ulloa and Okazaki also on the scoresheet as City go top. \u201cI\u2019m very happy for Jamie,\u201d says Ranieiri. \u201cIt\u2019s a great achievement, not easy to do but the team made a fantastic performance. Jamie said thank you to everybody in the dressing room afterwards. He\u2019s a nice boy.\u201d 1. Leicester City P13 Pts282. Manchester United P13 Pts273. Manchester City P13 Pts264. Arsenal P13 Pts26      Vardy celebrates his goal at Newcastle. Photograph: Lindsey Parnaby/AFP/Getty Images    14) Leicester City 1-1 Manchester United, 28 November   Odds   The nice boy does it again, opening the scoring to break the record \u2013 but Leicester are unable to match his bravado, held to a draw by Bastian Schweinsteiger. \u201cLittle by little,\u201d says Ranieri. \u201cI told the players to win and try and help Jamie break the record. I am really pleased he has done, we can all be very proud about it and I hope he carries on, but the real target this season is 40 points and now we have 11 to go. That is our project, and we are getting there.\u201d 1. Manchester City P14 Pts292. Leicester City P14 Pts293. Manchester United P14 Pts284.

Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images    15) Swansea City 0-3 Leicester City, 5 December   Odds   For once, Vardy is not the story. He fails to equal Jimmy Dunne\u2019s top-flight record of scoring in a dozen consecutive games. Instead, Mahrez steps up, reaching double figures for the season with a clinical hat-trick as a dazzling counterattacking display returns Ranieri\u2019s team to the top. \u201cWe played like a team, helped each other,\u201d says the manager. \u201cEverybody was looking for Jamie to score again, but I was so pleased when he could have shot but passed to Mahrez for the hat-trick.\u201d 1.

Photograph: Plumb Images/Leicester City FC via Getty Images    16) Leicester City 2-1 Chelsea, 14 December   Odds   Ranieri adds to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s misery \u2013 making it five defeats in seven for Chelsea. While Mourinho accuses his players of \u201cbetrayal\u201d, Ranieri greets another brilliant performance \u2013 with goals from Mahrez and Vardy \u2013 by trying to keep the focus on his own side\u2019s fight for survival. Reporters aren\u2019t buying it. \u201cWe need another five points. Don\u2019t laugh. It\u2019s true. I don\u2019t know when we can achieve these five points. Now there is Everton away, Liverpool away, Manchester City at home and Bournemouth, who are a fantastic team, at home \u2013 four very tough games. Let me achieve 40 points, then I\u2019ll think about what is the next goal. But until 40 I think only 40.\u201d 1. Leicester City P16 Pts352. Arsenal P16 Pts333. Manchester City P16 Pts324.

Photograph: Plumb Images/Leicester City FC via Getty Images    17) Everton 2-3 Leicester City, 19 December   Odds   On Christmas Day 2014 Leicester were looking up at the rest of the Premier League having failed to win in 12. This time they will be peering down on the elite. Another hard-fought, spirited three points are wrapped up by two Mahrez penalties and a fine finish from the recalled Okazaki. \u201cFootball is crazy and if it is crazy in this way, I am very happy,\u201d Ranieri tells the press conference afterwards. \u201cToday was a difficult, difficult, difficult match, but I will now enjoy my Christmas with the turkey, not lasagne \u2013 too heavy. Merry Christmas to you and your families.\u201d  1. Leicester City P17 Pts382. Arsenal P16 Pts333. Manchester City P16 Pts324.

Christian Benteke emerges from the bench to give Liverpool a first win in five and condemn subdued Leicester to a first league defeat since 26 September. \u201cSooner or later we had to lose and it\u2019s OK,\u201d says Ranieri. \u201cLiverpool deserved to win but we only started to play when we fell behind and I don\u2019t know why. We were too nervous and anxious before that. I really don\u2019t know why. It is important we recover now mentally. We shouldn\u2019t lose confidence.\u201d 1. Leicester City P18 Pts382.

Photograph: Chris Brunskill/Getty Images    19) Leicester City 0-0 Manchester City, 29 December   Odds   A measure of how far Leicester have come in the past year: a goalless draw against a team of ultra-expensive Premier League all-stars is seen as a disappointment. Vardy misses a fine first-half chance. \u201cWe made some good opportunities,\u201d says Ranieri. \u201cI wanted to see how my players responded after the Liverpool defeat and they responded well. But this league is very crazy \u2026 It\u2019s not easy for us but we want to fight with everybody. We\u2019re the basement and the other teams are a villa with a swimming pool. It\u2019s a miracle what we\u2019re doing.\u201d Arsenal take the lead. 1. Arsenal P19 Pts392. Leicester City P19 Pts393. Manchester City P19 Pts364.

Photograph: Mike Egerton/PA    20) Leicester City 0-0 Bournemouth, 2 January 2016   Odds   After the feast, the famine: Leicester fail to score for a third successive match. Vardy is denied by the woodwork, Morgan files a contender for miss of the season and Mahrez misses from the spot. \u201cWhen you play at a high intensity you can make mistakes \u2013 we were too anxious to score a goal,\u201d says Ranieri, before returning to his favourite theme. \u201cBut it\u2019s OK, 40 points, clean sheet, champagne for my players.\u201d 1.

Photograph: Ed Sykes/Reuters    21) Tottenham 0-1 Leicester City, 13 January   Odds   Just when the bubble looks like bursting, a real statement of intent. Spurs are fired up, but Robert Huth, unmarked inside the area, directs a firm header back inside the near top corner of Hugo Lloris\u2019s net to win it. The visiting fans sing: \u201cWe are staying up,\u201d then, in the next breath: \u201cWe\u2019re gonna win the league.\u201d \u201cTottenham started very well and put us under pressure,\u201d says Ranieri, \u201cbut we didn\u2019t lose our confidence or shape and it was difficult for them. Unfortunately it\u2019s January, not May. There\u2019s so much work to do. We have to remain calm.\u201d 1. Arsenal P21 Pts432. Leicester City P21 Pts433. Manchester City P21 Pts404.

Mahrez misses a first-half penalty \u2013 a chance to put the visitors two goals up following Okazaki\u2019s opener. Villa keeper Mark Bunn\u2019s save spurs the home side to a mini-revival, with Rudy Gestede scoring a deserved equaliser 15 minutes from time. \u201cWe lost two points,\u201d says Ranieri. \u201cAfter the missed penalty the Aston Villa players took on a new energy. We are very sad. It\u2019s one point, it\u2019s OK, it\u2019s a derby \u2013 but we are disappointed.\u201d The point, though, sends them top. 1. Leicester City P22 Pts442.

Photograph: Darren Staples/Reuters    23) Leicester City 3-0 Stoke City, 23 January   Odds   Everything clicks into place. Vardy scores for the first time in eight matches, Mahrez is back to his best and Danny Drinkwater stars in, and scores from, midfield. Ulloa hits the third with three minutes left. \u201cIt was very important to be top at the end of January because now comes a very tough February, with Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City to come,\u201d says Ranieri. \u201cIt is all unbelievable but it is good. We are ready to fight. This league, for us, is very exciting.\u201d 1. Leicester City P23 Pts472. Manchester City P23 Pts443. Arsenal P22 Pts 444.

The 25-yard volley that leaves Simon Mignolet clutching at thin air takes Vardy\u2019s tally to 18 league goals. \u201cIt was unbelievable what Vardy did,\u201d says Ranieri. \u201cHe watched the ball arriving, watched the opponent and watched the keeper. He looked at the keeper out of the goal and hit it. It was unbelievable, amazing, fantastic. All of us today, we made a fantastic performance.\u201d 1. Leicester City P24 Pts502.

Sergio Ag\u00fcero\u2019s late consolation flatters the home side as the visitors, inspired by Huth\u2019s third-minute opener, totally dominate. \u201cScoring so early gave us confidence,\u201d says Ranieri. \u201cThat allowed us to close down the space.\u201d Two minutes after the break, using Vardy in the centre as a decoy, Mahrez runs brilliantly at the home defence and beats Joe Hart with a confident finish \u2013 and Huth adds a third on the hour. \u201cWe play without pressure,\u201d says Ranieri. \u201cWe must enjoy it. This is a fantastic moment for the Premier League \u2013 nobody knows who can win it.\u201d His side go five points clear. 1. Leicester City P25 Pts 532. Tottenham P25 Pts 483.

One-nil up at the Emirates through a Vardy penalty, Leicester are undone by Danny Simpson\u2019s 54th-minute red card. Arsenal pile on the pressure, Theo Walcott equalising before Danny Welbeck\u2019s injury-time winner. \u201cThe referee was too severe with the sending-off,\u201d says Ranieri. \u201cThese were two normal fouls, not yellow cards; 11 v 11, I\u2019m sure we win. The match was full of fouls so why send off a player? Come on. But we are still top, with two points more \u2013 we must carry on and smile. We lost to our opponents \u2013 we must say well done.\u201d 1. Leicester City P26 P532. Tottenham P26 P513. Arsenal P26 P514.

Substitute Ulloa\u2019s dramatic last-gasp winner \u2013 cruel on Norwich \u2013 takes the roof off, and earns praise for Ranieri\u2019s late tinkering. \u201cI just tried to make some changes to spread out the front line,\u201d says the manager. \u201cWe cannot always play well, but it was important to restart after the defeat at Arsenal. We lost that game in the final seconds and won this one in the last minute. That\u2019s football, but I want to say well done to Norwich \u2013 they gave us the battle we were expecting.\u201d 1.

But Craig Gardner\u2019s equaliser and some resolute, breathless West Brom defending leaves them frustrated \u2013 with just four points from their last three games. Ranieri: \u201cI look at the performance first. And the performance was fantastic.\u201d 1. Leicester City P28 Pts572. Tottenham P27 Pts543. Arsenal P27 Pts514.

Ranieri, again, shrugs off talk of the title \u2013 or of mounting pressure. \u201cFive points are nothing. We know there will be another nine battles \u2013 but not just for us, for everybody. Nobody can say who will win. But we aren\u2019t nervous, our job is done. The others spent a lot of money to win the title \u2013 we just have to enjoy an amazing season.\u201d 1.

But Leicester show the stubbornness to keep Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s Newcastle out, holding on to their sixth clean sheet in seven home games. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the best but we showed spirit,\u201d says Ranieri. \u201cI feel now that I am just concentrating on the next game against Crystal Palace. We are so strong, we think only one game at a time. Step by step, that is our philosophy.\u201d 1. Leicester City P30 Pts632. Tottenham P30 Pts 583. Arsenal P29 Pts524.

Mahrez stars in the first half, and scores on 34 minutes \u2013 Vardy pulling out to the left, dancing away from Joel Ward and crossing low for his team-mate to slot into the corner. Ranieri is asked about the gap at the top \u2013 and the away crowd\u2019s rapture. \u201cIt sounds good, our fans are singing a very good song about that but we are to stay calm because you don\u2019t know what will happen. Maybe in the next two matches I can say something more.\u201d 1. Leicester City P31 Pts662. Tottenham P30 Pts 583. Arsenal P30 Pts 554.

Morgan scores his first goal since May to deliver a seven-point cushion with six matches to play \u2013 a year ago to the day that Leicester had languished the same number of points adrift of safety at the foot of the table. Ranieri finally dares to dream out loud. \u201cWe believe this is a magical season. We know next season it won\u2019t be the same so we try to do our best. The fans must believe and be happy, but we must have our feet on the ground. All our final matches are tough.\u201d 1. Leicester City P32 Pts692. Tottenham P32 Pts623. Arsenal P31 Pts584.

By the end Ranieri is in tears, overwhelmed by his side\u2019s achievements. Two Vardy goals send Sunderland deeper into trouble and preserve Leicester\u2019s formidable lead over Spurs. Sam Allardyce pays tribute. \u201cLeicester are unique. They don\u2019t have to be pretty. Fans of bigger clubs might moan about the way they play but their fans love it. And each of their players is playing better and with more consistency than they\u2019ve ever done in their life. That\u2019s the beauty of it; that\u2019s what confidence gives you.\u201d Ranieri tells the press: \u201cYou do this job for the emotion you feel inside.\u201d 1. Leicester City P33 Pts722.

Photograph: Dan Mari/Twitter    34) Leicester City 2-2 West Ham, 17 April   Odds   A game changer? Referee Jon Moss sends off Vardy and awards a penalty apiece, leaving both sets of players up in arms. One-nil up via Vardy\u2019s 18th-minute goal, Leicester\u2019s plan unravels with his second yellow, for diving, on 57 minutes. The visitors score twice, in the 84th and 86th minutes, and look to have it won \u2013 only for Moss to hand Leicester the softest of penalties in stoppage time. Ulloa saves the point. \u201cI never speak about the decision of the referee,\u201d says Ranieri. \u201cTwo yellow cards, that\u2019s it. But our performance 11 v 11 and 10 v 11 was fantastic.\u201d 1. Leicester City P34 Pts732. Tottenham P33 Pts653. Manchester City P33 Pts604.

Home fans sing: \u201cBarcelona, we\u2019re coming for you.\u201d Ranieri\u2019s player look nerveless as Vardy\u2019s replacement, Ulloa, scores twice. Mahrez and Marc Albrighton hit the others, and Drinkwater and Kant\u00e9 are typically immense in midfield. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic. Without Jamie Vardy everyone gave something more,\u201d says the manager. \u201cWe knew we had some difficulties but with the fight of everybody we had a good match. We know it will be tough because Tottenham are a good team \u2013 but we will fight until the end.\u201d 1. Leicester City P35 Pts762. Tottenham P34 Pts683. Manchester City P35 Pts644.

United start brightly and go ahead through Anthony Martial, only for Leicester to summon an impressive response and level courtesy of a Morgan header. Leicester look the brighter team for long periods thereafter but cannot find the breakthrough and their hopes effectively end when Danny Drinkwater is sent off. \u201cI know in the city there are fireworks, all the city is blue, but we must continue to concentrate without listening to those fireworks,\u201d says Ranieri, who reveals he will not be watching Tottenham\u2019s game at Chelsea the next day because he will be travelling back from visiting his mother in Italy. \u201cShe is 96 years old and I\u2019d like to go to have lunch with her.\u201d  1.

Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian    One day later \u2026 Leicester win the Premier League Tottenham travel to Stamford Bridge knowing they must win to remain in the title race and get off to the perfect start thanks to first-half goals from Harry Kane and Son Heung-min. But Chelsea strike back after the break through Gary Cahill and, seven minutes from time, Eden Hazard. Spurs\u2019 championship dreams are shattered in an increasingly heated match that sees three home and nine visiting players booked, as well as a major scuffle by the tunnel after the full-time whistle. Up in the east Midlands, however, it is party time. The miracle is complete, Leicester are champions.  1. Leicester City P36 Pts772. Tottenham P36 Pts703. Arsenal P36 Pts674.
