  "body": "The composer Charles Wilfred Orr once said of\u00a0AE Housman that \u201che wrote verse that was (a) beautiful, (b) scanned, (c) rhymed, and (d) made sense. He\u00a0is, I\u00a0think, to English songwriters very much what Heine was\u00a0to German and Verlaine to French composers.\u201d Heine is one of the most \u2013\u00a0and most successfully \u2013 set of all German poets, and Verlaine has inspired some of the greatest songs in the history of the m\u00e9lodie. Housman, like Heine, suffered from unrequited love, and developed a simple, direct poetic style, writing lyrically about nature and ironically about humankind. There are more than 160 song cycles based on A Shropshire Lad, and while Housman was unmusical, he always gave permission to composers to use his poems \u201cin the hope of becoming immortal somehow\u201d. Directness of utterance in a poem is\u00a0almost a prerequisite for a song composer \u2013 and explains why Shakespeare, Herrick, Blake, Burns, Byron, Housman and De la Mare have been set so often; and why composers have tended to be put off by Donne\u2019s metaphysical conceits, Browning\u2019s convoluted syntax and Dante Gabriel Rossetti\u2019s overly rich and cloying style. Rossetti could have learned a thing or two from his sister Christina, whose short lines and subtly varied rhythms have proved more popular with composers; and Tennyson\u2019s remark about Browning\u2019s Sordello was naughty but telling: he claimed that of\u00a0its many thousands of lines, he could understand only two \u2013 the first (\u201cWho will, may hear Sordello\u2019s story told\u201d) and the last (\u201cWho would has heard Sordello\u2019s story told\u201d) \u2013 and that both were lies.            All the aforementioned authors wrote verse of impeccable pedigree, but composers often choose to set minor poets. As Auden states in The Poet\u2019s Tongue: \u201cWe do not want to read \u2018great\u2019 poetry all the time, and a good anthology should contain poems for every mood.\u201d He also pointed out, in\u00a0an attempt to define \u201cmajor\u201d and \u201cminor\u201d poets, that it was not simply \u201ca\u00a0matter of the pleasure the poet gives an individual reader: I cannot enjoy one poem by Shelley and am delighted by every line of William Barnes, but I\u00a0know perfectly well that Shelley is a\u00a0major poet and Barnes a minor one.\u201d A\u00a0toast, then, to the many composers who fashioned immortal music out of\u00a0minor verse: Edward Elgar (AC Benson\u2019s \u201cLand of Hope and Glory\u201d); Ralph Vaughan Williams (Barnes\u2019s \u201cLinden Lea\u201d); John Ireland (John Masefield\u2019s \u201cSea-fever\u201d); William H Monk (Henry Francis Lyte\u2019s \u201cAbide with me\u201d); Charles Dibdin (\u201cTom Bowling\u201d); Thomas Arne (James Thomson\u2019s \u201cRule, Britannia!\u201d); Hubert Parry (Blake\u2019s \u201cJerusalem\u201d) and Henry Gauntlett (Cecil Frances Alexander\u2019s \u201cOnce in Royal David\u2019s City\u201d). These songs are embedded in the national consciousness, and illustrate how words and music together can be greater than their constituent parts.     Embedded in the national consciousness \u2026 Sir Edward Elgar. Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images    In a letter to Joseph Gregor, the librettist of Daphne, Richard Strauss once described how he would often search for a poem to fit a fine melody that already existed. Many composers, however, choose a poem because of\u00a0its\u00a0autobiographical significance. Think, for example, of Britten\u2019s setting of\u00a0Francis Quarles\u2019s \u201cMy Beloved Is Mine\u201d, which is a veiled expression of Britten\u2019s love for Peter Pears; or of his choice of such poems as \u201cTit for Tat\u201d (De la Mare) and \u201cWho Are These Children?\u201d (William Soutar) that allowed him to give vent to his abhorrence of blood sports. In addition to poems about landscape, love, death, grief, religion \u2013 those timeless themes that affect us all \u2013 national sentiment and politics have also produced some of the most enduring songs in our language. It\u2019s interesting to see how poems such as Thomson\u2019s \u201cRule, Britannia!\u201d and Thomas Moore\u2019s \u201cThe Last Rose of Summer\u201d have inspired such different music. The subversive theme of \u201cThe Last Rose of Summer\u201d, which masquerades as a flower poem, is the slaughter of many young Irish people in their struggle against the English \u2013 wonderfully suggested by\u00a0Britten in the jarring chords and lugubrious harmonies of the accompaniment; Arne\u2019s jingoistic \u201cRule, Britannia!\u201d, on the other hand, was sold on the streets in broadsides, sung in theatres by both actors and audience and bawled by Nelson\u2019s sailors on board battleships.    A composer has to destroy a poem's natural rhythm, to recreate its atmosphere and feeling in the language of music    Choosing a poem to compose is fraught with difficulty, as Lennox Berkeley explained: \u201cOne has only to think what a composer has to do to a\u00a0poem: he has to destroy or at best modify its natural rhythm. He cannot possibly adhere to its actual metre. He\u00a0then has to translate it into another medium. His only excuse for doing such a thing is that he feels he can recreate its atmosphere and feeling in the language of music. And here he can, if he\u2019s a good enough composer, heighten its emotional impact. He may even be able to bring out and stress certain rhymes and assonances that will enhance the actual words, but it remains a risky undertaking on which one hesitates to embark.\u201d            Composers, however, have rarely hesitated. Nor have they hesitated to treat their poets in cavalier fashion: changing titles, altering words, omitting or repeating lines or whole stanzas. Of course, poems have become known across the globe, carried by the power of music. But when Vaughan Williams left out two verses from his setting of Housman\u2019s \u201cIs My Team Ploughing?\u201d, the poet\u2019s retort was understandable: \u201cI wonder how he would like me to cut two bars out of his music.\u201d \u2022 Richard Stokes\u2019s The Penguin Book of English Song: Seven Centuries of Poetry from Chaucer to Auden is\u00a0published by Penguin Classics. A selection of songs will be performed by Sarah Connolly at Wigmore Hall, London W1, on 28 May at 1pm. wigmore-hall.org.uk.",
