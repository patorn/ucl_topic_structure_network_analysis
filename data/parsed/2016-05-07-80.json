At his signing-in ceremony at Southwark Cathedral, backed by a secular choir, the Labour mayor said he wanted the moment to herald the start of a City Hall run for all Londoners and all communities. He said he hoped to \u201c put aside party-political differences\u201d.    Related: Sadiq Khan officially takes over as London mayor - live    His official swearing-in as mayor came hours after two senior Conservative figures appeared openly divided on their judgement of Goldsmith\u2019s failed mayoral campaign. Michael Fallon, the defence secretary, defended attempts to link Khan to extremism as the \u201crough and tumble of politics\u201d. Meanwhile, the leader of the Conservative Muslim Forum, Mohammed Amin, said he was \u201cdisgusted\u201d by Goldsmith\u2019s approach.  The ceremony was attended by the former Labour leader Ed Miliband and Britain\u2019s most senior ranking police officer, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, but not Jeremy Corbyn. The Labour leader instead chose to visit Bristol, where Labour secured a comfortable victory in the city\u2019s own mayoral race. Khan, who has kept a safe distance from the leader during his campaign, later said he did not know why Corbyn was not there to see him signed in. \u201cIt is an open invite, I\u2019m not sure Jeremy was doing today, we\u2019ll have to find out what he was doing,\u201d he told the BBC. Later on Saturday afternoon, Corbyn arrived in Bristol to congratulate the city\u2019s new Labour mayor, Marvin Rees. Though Khan said he now had bigger problems than Goldsmith\u2019s losing campaign, he said he was concerned about the dozens of Muslims who had written to him saying they did not want their children to get involved in politics having seen how he was treated.

The venue, which has been a site of Christian worship for more than 1,000 years, filled up with supporters and London dignitaries. After a brief introduction from Doreen Lawrence, mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence, Khan stepped up to the so-called crossing of the cathedral under the central tower to rapturous applause and a standing ovation. Standing beneath an ornate 17th-century chandelier, a self-assured Khan declared: \u201cMy name is Sadiq Khan and I\u2019m the mayor of London.\u201dHe said he wanted the ceremony to take place in the cathedral as a reflection of his intent to represent \u201cevery single community\u201d as a \u201cmayor for all Londoners\u201d. Miliband, who employed Khan as shadow justice secretary when he was the party\u2019s leader, was on the front row of the nave. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic win and sends a message all round the world about the kind of place London is,\u201d Miliband said.

Sadiq ran a positive campaign about the issues and I think Zac Goldsmith ran a very nasty, divisive campaign and I think that has been roundly rejected.\u201d  Asked to comment on the wider local elections results, which saw Labour fall to third behind the SNP and the Tories in Scotland, lose seats in Wales and become the first opposition party to fail to gain council seats in mid-term elections since 1985, Miliband said: \u201cToday\u2019s a day for celebrating Sadiq.\u201d After a children\u2019s choir from St Bonaventure\u2019s school in Forest Gate performed, the gathering moved outside to the churchyard for refreshments and to seize a chance to congratulate the newly elected mayor.

He said he wanted to move on from discussions over the way the Conservative party campaign against him was conducted. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed by the negative, desperate, divisive campaign that the Tories have run,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a positive campaign throughout. I\u2019m quite clear that I\u2019ll work with anybody when it\u2019s in London\u2019s interests. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to working with the prime minister when it comes to us remaining in the EU, when it comes to infrastructure and investment, when it comes to all sorts of issues and what\u2019s important to put aside the past, put aside party-political differences and put London first.\u201d He announced his intention to step down as MP for Tooting, south London, and in an apparent swipe to parting London mayor Boris Johnson, added: \u201cI think what you need if you\u2019re a mayor is to be a full-time mayor \u2013 no second jobs.\u201d McKellen, star of the Lord of the Rings and X-Men movie franchises, said having a Muslim mayor was \u201cpreferable to me to any alternative regardless of the politics\u201d. \u201cI hope it\u2019s an image that will go round the world as representing a new sort of England that\u2019s at peace with itself regardless of race and so on. That\u2019s the beauty of it.\u201d Congratulations came in throughout the day, from Conservatives Lady Sayeeda Warsi and Sajid Javid, who, like Khan, are also the children of Pakistani bus drivers. Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential candidate, also tweeted her congratulations. There has been no word so far from her Republican rival Donald Trump, who has previously said he would like to ban all Muslims from entering the US.",
