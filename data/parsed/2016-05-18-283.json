The Queensland premier\u2019s move highlights a new level of civic opposition to the controversial program, which has left SBS racing to secure locations for a second series after councils in Brisbane and Melbourne denied producers filming permits.  The first series of Struggle Street, set in Mount Druitt west of Sydney, was labelled \u201cpoverty porn\u201d by critics last year after a sensationalist promo showing a participant farting loudly was screened by SBS.           Struggle Street reality TV series promo lands SBS in hot water     Related: The 'stars' of Struggle Street shouldn't be made to pay for their trust | Jon Owen    Produced by KEO Films Australia for SBS, Struggle Street featured several families in the underprivileged area coping with various mental health, housing and drug issues.  The mayor of Blacktown, Stephen Bali, campaigned for the program to be taken off air, organised a garbage truck blockade and claimed the producers falsified scenes and provided inducements including food and drinks for the participants. In April SBS announced the second six-part series, to be aired in 2017, would focus on social and economic disadvantage on a national scale and would be filmed in both Queensland and Victoria. The series has financial backing from Screen Australia and Film Victoria which both claim it provokes an important discussion of the issues. However, Brisbane council and Brimbank council, in Melbourne\u2019s south, have both rejected applications for filming permits over fears the suburbs of Inala and Sunshine will be tarnished with negative stereotypes. The producers would still be able to shoot the series on private properties, as the permits are only needed to film on council land. The Brisbane lord mayor, Graham Quirk, wrote to KEO\u2019s production manager on Tuesday to refuse a permit amid his \u201cgrave concerns\u201d that the community of Inala would receive the same treatment as Mount Druitt. Administrators of Brimbank council announced the same day they had refused KEO\u2019s application over similar concerns. Palaszczuk, who represents the seat of Inala, said she backed Quirk \u201c100%\u201d and the \u201clast thing\u201d the suburb needed was \u201cto see a SBS show in there that takes the mickey out of people\u201d. Palaszczuk told reporters on Wednesday she had been \u201cspeaking to producers at length\u201d to try to dissuade them from filming in Inala. \u201cThey want to go ahead with it obviously, but we don\u2019t want it to go ahead,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is a very clear, firm view, the lord mayor doesn\u2019t want it to go ahead, as the local member and as premier of this state, I don\u2019t want to see it go ahead \u2013 we don\u2019t want to see families ridiculed on national television.\u201d Palaszczuk, whose grandparents settled in Inala as post-war Polish migrants, said: \u201cOut in Inala we are a very proud people.\u201d The director of programs for Keo Films, David Galloway, said Struggle Street was candid and powerful. \u201cWe anticipate stories of resilience, community support and family love in what will be compelling and insightful storytelling that doesn\u2019t shy away from the realities of hardship faced by millions of people across the country,\u201d Galloway said when the second series was announced.  KEO still planned to film the second series in Queensland and Victoria exploring, through personal stories, challenges such as industry downturn and transition, unemployment and other socail issues. However, Quirk wrote in his letter to KEO that the first series tainted the people of Mount Druitt \u201cwith the stigma of poverty, drugs, abuse and dysfunction\u201d.  \u201cI believe an informed and balanced assessment of social and economic disadvantage is in the public interest, however targeting a particular suburb in the manner you did in series 1 of Struggle Street is not,\u201d he said. Quirk said that while council \u201ccannot interfere with your right to deal with individuals on their own property, we will not actively assist you with your production in council owned or controlled locations\u201d. John Watson, the chair of administrators of Brimbank city council, said it was \u201cbitterly disappointed\u201d the production company had chosen the area to film. \u201cBased on the previous program we don\u2019t believe that they will accurately reflect our community,\u201d he said.    A spokeswoman for SBS said that \u201cStruggle Street was not a series about specific areas of the country\u201d.    \u201cThe areas that we will film in are areas where challenges reflect universal socioeconomic issues and where we can get first-hand stories that help audiences to engage with the broader issues. \u201cWe are still in the early stages of production. Series two filming will take place in several locations in Queensland and Victoria. Brimbank is just one of a number of councils we\u2019ve approached for filming permits.\u201d  After episode one aired there was a largely positive response as well as a record audience for SBS. Episode one of Struggle Street was the No 1 show in Sydney and the network\u2019s most popular program since the football world cup in 2014.",
