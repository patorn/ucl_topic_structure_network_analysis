  "body": "The local police investigation into the death of Prince is being beefed up with staff from the US attorney\u2019s office and the Drug Enforcement Administration, as a California doctor who specializes in prescription drug addiction revealed the singer\u2019s representatives reached out for urgent help the day before he died. Associates of Prince contacted Dr Howard Kornfeld, a California-based addiction specialist, on 20 April on behalf of the star who \u201cwas dealing with a grave medical emergency\u201d, said William Mauzy, Kornfeld\u2019s lawyer, on Wednesday. Kornfeld\u2019s treatment center, Recovery Without Walls, offers mainly outpatient care for those battling chronic pain and resulting drug addictions.    Related: Prince's final days: few clues pointed to secret behind star's untimely death    Kornfeld wasn\u2019t immediately available to travel to Minnesota, so he sent son Andrew, 26, a pre-med student, on an overnight flight in his place to immediately examine the singer. \u201cThe plan was to quickly evaluate his health and devise a treatment plan,\u201d said Mauzy at a press conference in Minnesota. \u201cThe doctor was planning on a lifesaving mission.\u201d Andrew carried buprenorphine, a drug to help fight opioid addiction, and Kornfeld arranged for a local doctor to visit Prince on 21 April, explained Mauzy. However, when Kornfeld\u2019s son arrived at Prince\u2019s Paisley Park home in Minneapolis on the morning of 21 April, the singer was nowhere to be found. Minutes later his dead body was discovered in an elevator.  Andrew made the 911 call to authorities, Mauzy said. \u201cWe\u2019re at Prince\u2019s house,\u201d he told the operator, unsure of the address. \u201cThe people are just distraught ... We\u2019re in Minneapolis, Minnesota and we are at the home of Prince.\u201d \u201cOK, do we know how the person died?\u201d asked the operator, according to a police transcript.  \u201cI don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t know,\u201d the younger Kornfeld replied. Now the Carver County sheriff\u2019s office, which is leading the investigation, is looking to see if prescription drug addiction caused Prince\u2019s death. \u201cThe DEA and US Attorney\u2019s Office are able to augment this local investigation with federal resources and expertise about prescription drug diversion,\u201d said the US attorney\u2019s office in a statement. The DEA investigates wrongdoing involving prescription medications. \u201cWe issue DEA numbers to physicians that prescribe controlled substance and we monitor that program and in the event that there\u2019s some indication that something has transpired or something that needs to be investigated with the prescription of a controlled substance, we\u2019ll enter in that capacity,\u201d said a DEA official, noting that he was speaking generally about the DEA\u2019s involvement in investigations and not specifically in relation to Prince\u2019s death. If a doctor has been found to have violated federal rules for prescribing drugs, \u201cit is punishable, it is a federal crime\u201d, said the DEA official. \u201cRight now it\u2019s an open investigation \u2026 We\u2019re just seeing if there is or is not wrongdoing.\u201d",
