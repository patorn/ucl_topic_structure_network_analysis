  "body": "By far the most powerful episode in Tahmima Anam\u2019s new novel first appeared in the April 2013 issue of Granta, which showcased the magazine\u2019s once-a-decade roll call of Britain\u2019s best young novelists. In Anwar Gets Everything \u2013 a nerve-shredding excerpt from The Bones of Grace \u2013 a Bengali labourer is ordered to wash the windows of a Dubai high-rise without proper safety precautions. Anyone who extrapolated from this a protest novel about the blood behind Emirati bling might be surprised. Anwar\u2019s story turns out to be only one element buried deep within a wider-roaming saga of star-crossed Ivy League academics. Most of the novel is narrated by Zubaida, a marine palaeontologist from Dhaka, whose fieldwork (in Pakistan, where she\u2019s hunting an ancient whale skeleton) gets caught in the crossfire of sectarian violence. During her graduate study at Harvard, she falls for blue-eyed Elijah, a\u00a0philosopher who hopes that she\u2019ll break off her engagement back home. But \u201chome\u201d is moot anyway: Zubaida is haunted by the knowledge that, as a baby, she was adopted, and that her biological parents left no trace of\u00a0themselves. Zubaida addresses an imaginary Elijah, recounting how they met and her turmoil on returning to Bangladesh. How the novel\u2019s disparate strands come together is a perpetual tease. On page 125 there\u2019s a tip-off: Anwar is \u201ccarrying his secret, which is also my secret\u201d. But 50 pages later, we\u2019re hardly wiser: \u201cDon\u2019t blame me for parsing out the story slowly, Elijah. These things take time.\u201d   Related: Tahmima Anam: \u2018I have a complicated relationship with Bangladesh\u2019    While the characters need no convincing of their feelings for each other, we do, and the book\u2019s structure makes this tricky: Zubaida has to write for us as well as for Elijah. Their coded correspondence once she returns to Bangladesh, in text messages consisting only of song titles \u2013 off-the-peg emotion \u2013 feels like Anam\u2019s workaround as much as theirs. Zubaida\u2019s heritage, or the lack of it, does a lot of heavy lifting: \u201cI was a person whose life began with her own life, and not, like you, with a family tree that stretched back generations \u2026 What would you do with this messy history, Elijah? Your chamomile-scented home, your overfed cat, lemonade in the refrigerator, and that family tree, so august, no mystery blood, no revolutions\u2026\u201d Almost all the book unfolds in this tone, wounded and puffed-up. Zubaida implies that her fiance might understand her better by reading Tolstoy, which \u2013 like that whale hunt \u2013 suggests the lofty company Anam wants to keep. Yet there are hints that she\u2019s not wholly happy with how this (at times superlative) novel knits together. With the plot speeding up, someone says \u201cit\u2019s too much randomness\u201d, and even Zubaida calls her story \u201cnonsensical\u201d. It isn\u2019t, but when she says Anwar\u2019s world \u201cmade everything else shrink \u2013 my little quest to find my origins, even the wound of your absence\u201d, it all but pops the ballo\u200bo\u200bn she\u2019s spent 350 pages blowing up.
