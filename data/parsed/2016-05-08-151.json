  "body": "The BBC\u2019s recent hit drama The Night Manager, a thriller about a spy who infiltrates an arms dealer\u2019s network, is the sort of show that\u2019s sometimes described as \u201caspirational\u201d \u2013 not because most people aspire to hang out with the kind of foreign despots liable to gas their own people, but because it\u2019s the sort of world that features private jets and five-star hotels and characters called things like \u201cDickie Onslow Roper\u201d and \u201cLord Langbourne\u201d and the kind of long-necked women who drape themselves languidly over business tycoons\u2019 arms. It is, to use another piece of shorthand, posh; a world of money and privilege \u2013 and apart from two overworked civil servants trying to bring them to heel from a dingy London office, one of whom is Olivia Colman, the BBC\u2019s resident everywoman \u2013 almost the entire cast comes from what used to be called the \u201cofficer class\u201d. So it\u2019s not exactly a surprise when, just after the final episode is broadcast, the Guardian runs a story about where the three male leads went to school. Because for the past 18 months or so, the papers have been full of stories about how increasingly rarefied acting is becoming. How difficult it is for anyone from any normal background to break into it. How some of the great actors of the past 30 years simply wouldn\u2019t make it today. The story is not that the three stars \u2013 Hugh Laurie, Tom Hiddleston and Tom Hollander \u2013 are all privately educated. That would surprise no one. The story is that they all went to the same private school: the Dragon School, a small prep school in Oxford with fees of up to \u00a328,000 a year that also educated Emma Watson, Jack Davenport and Jack Whitehall, among others. From there, Laurie and Hiddleston both went on to Eton, the launchpad for what are some of the hottest actors of the moment, alma mater to Eddie Redmayne, Damien Lewis and Dominic West.    Our national psychodramas are being acted out by graduates of our most expensive public schools    What unites Laurie, Hiddleston and Hollander most, of course, is talent. They all give standout, highly praised performances. And, arguably, it\u2019s anecdotal evidence of nothing very much; commenting on it reveals nothing more than a certain leftwing chippiness on the part of the commentator. Certainly, the issues at stake have little to do with Laurie, Hiddleston or Hollander. It\u2019s far bigger than any of them. But it\u2019s also not posh-bashing for the sake of posh-bashing. There\u2019s now evidence of an inequality that runs like a seam through the entire profession and which goes far beyond the anecdotal. This year, academics from the London School of Economics and Goldsmiths College, in a peer-reviewed study, found that only 27% of actors come from a working-class background and that the profession is \u201cheavily skewed towards the privileged\u201d. In February this year, the Sutton Trust, a thinktank dedicated to social mobility, included acting for the first time in its survey of leading professions, and found, among other things, that 67% of British Oscar winners and 42% of Bafta winners went to a private school. Countless stars have spoken out about it, including Julie Walters, who\u2019s said that \u201cpeople like me wouldn\u2019t get the chance today\u201d and Judi Dench, who gets letters \u201ccountless times a week asking for help to get through drama school\u201d. And, in this light, The Night Manager starts to seem more like a parable. Because it depicts a world that is run by and for a rich, privileged elite. And it turns out, that\u2019s true not just within the dramatic confines of the story, but outside it too. That there\u2019s a tiny, well-born cohort who seem to be getting all the plum roles.

Photograph: Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for AMC    The bigger question is whether it matters. Acting is structurally unfair anyway, especially for women \u2013 so much is based on looks, on having the kind of languid limbs that can be draped over a business tycoon\u2019s arms. Does it really matter if this tiny elite is dominated by Etonians? Or by the 7% who are privately educated rather than the 93% who aren\u2019t? There are so many inequalities in Britain today that in some ways this feels like the least of them. But it\u2019s part of a much bigger picture. Because what has happened in acting and therefore what we see on our screens is intimately connected to what is happening in Britain. Acting, culture, identity, representation and politics are all inextricably entwined. The actors on our screens, the dramas that are commissioned, the way we view ourselves, the politicians we vote for, our ability to empathise with people from other parts of our culture, are all of a piece. Can it really be just a coincidence that the upper echelons of acting and government are dominated by Old Etonians? The Liverpool-based screenwriter Frank Cottrell Boyce, who wrote the story for the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games, tells me that he believes actors are like everyone else, just more visible. \u201cThe shortage of working-class actors is simply a mirror of what\u2019s going on everywhere: a shortage of working-class academics, engineers and politicians. I\u2019m much more concerned about the broader picture because it\u2019s a beacon, an indicator, of a much deeper problem.\u201d Actors are simply the most visible, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue simply because we\u2019ve noticed it but it\u2019s going on everywhere, in every profession. It\u2019s about access to education and being able to take a risk. That\u2019s the nursery of innovation not just in the arts but in science, in business. What\u2019s happening to the dramatic arts, should be a warning to people that this is happening everywhere. Actors are simply the end of the process. University or college or art school used to be where you\u2019d go to meet your contemporaries and start something off. But they\u2019ve been completely monetised. Universities are transaction service providers, students are service users, it\u2019s not a creative space or an intellectual space any more, it\u2019s a service where you get a piece of paper in exchange for your student loan. And it\u2019s completely changed the nature of it.\u201d  Because now it\u2019s about money. And there\u2019s simply not enough of it go around. Every week, he says, he is inundated with letters. \u201c\u2018Can you give me \u00a3500?\u2019 I get them week in, week out, and everybody else does too.\u201d Acting has changed because Britain has changed. And money, and its Great British handmaidens \u2013 inequality, privilege, class \u2013 is at the heart of it. Nina Gold, one of the most influential casting directors in Britain, goes to the showcases that the drama schools hold every year for the graduating class and has seen the shift at first hand. She says: \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a big homogenous load of middle-class actors all quite similar to each other. It\u2019s not just class-wise, there just seem to be fewer characters, people who don\u2019t conform to the ideal look, people who are overweight, or funny-looking. I really miss that.     Julie Walters in the film adaptation of Educating Rita. The actor says that \u201cpeople like me wouldn\u2019t get the chance today\u201d. Photograph: Rex    \u201cIt\u2019s not like the 1980s when all the exciting, big names were people like Gary Oldman, Tim Roth, Pete Postlethwaite. When you think of all the fabulous actors of the moment, you think of Eddie Redmayne, Tom Hiddleston, Dominic West, Benedict Cumberbatch. There\u2019s Michael Fassbender. But he\u2019s Irish and German so goes right by the whole class distinction.\u201d  There are brilliant and successful working-class actors out there \u2013 Gold cast Peckham-born John Boyega in Star Wars: The Force Awakens and she found him (initially for the film Attack the Block) by \u201clooking really hard\u201d outside the usual drama schools \u2013 but the change has been dramatic. \u201cWhat I want to get across is that I really, really want there to be more working-class actors and it needs to happen. Because it\u2019s got nothing to do with talent, ability or intelligence. It\u2019s to do with money. And it\u2019s a reflection of how society is working. It\u2019s very much a mirror of the way it is in real life.\u201d  It\u2019s always been tough, of course. Getting in to drama school is tough. And making it once you\u2019ve got out is tougher still. \u201cEven in the best-case scenario, you\u2019re getting rejected left, right and centre,\u201d says Nina Gold. \u201cEven if you\u2019re successful. And then if you do become really famous, that\u2019s a whole hell of its own. My son wants to do drama A-level and I find myself thinking, please, God, let him never, ever want to become an actor.\u201d And even someone as successful and patently talented as Maxine Peake tells me how she was turned down by Manchester Metropolitan University\u2019s theatre school three times and Guildhall School of Music and Drama three times before finally being accepted by Rada. \u201cThen, at the final workshop, they said to me, how are you going to pay for it if you do get in? And I said, \u2018I can\u2019t. There\u2019s no way. I\u2019m from a single-parent family, My mum works part-time. We\u2019re skint.\u2019\u201d Rada helped her get a scholarship and she went straight from there to the late Victoria Wood\u2019s Dinner Ladies and the rest is history. As a rags-to-riches, Cinders-you-shall-go-to-the-ball fairytale, it\u2019s a great story. And it does still \u2013 on rare occasions \u2013 happen. In Rada\u2019s elegant 1931 building in Bloomsbury, central London, I meet Yasmin Taheri, 22. She\u2019s from Mirfield near Huddersfield, and like Peake, she grew up in a one-parent family. She tells me how she applied to dozens of drama schools and how she supported herself to pay for it. The process costs hundreds, if not thousands of pounds. It\u2019s anywhere between \u00a350 and \u00a380 to audition for each round at each drama school, not to mention the travel. \u201cI worked in McDonald\u2019s and as a care assistant, as a medical secretary, as a receptionist, in an Italian restaurant, as a Spanish au pair\u2026\u201d And Taheri didn\u2019t apply once or twice, she carried on for five years, and then, eventually, miraculously, got in. What was that like, I ask her. \u201cOh my God!\u201d she says and even today looks like she still can\u2019t quite believe it. And Rada has helped her, as it did Maxine Peake, find a scholarship which now covers her maintenance. The fairytales do still happen. It\u2019s in Rada\u2019s DNA. Royalties from Pygmalion, George Bernard Shaw\u2019s play about a flower girl who learns to act like a duchess (which later became the musical My Fair Lady), helped pay for the founding of the school. But, it\u2019s getting rarer and rarer. In just a few years the whole landscape has changed. It used to be hard for everyone. Whereas now, it\u2019s still hard for everyone but it\u2019s a whole lot harder, quantifiably harder, if you happen to come from anything other than money and privilege.

Photograph: Richard Kendal/Barcroft Media    Because for every Taheri, there are hundreds, maybe thousands more Tom Stockses. I meet 23-year-old Stocks in Canary Wharf in a break from his job in a call centre. It\u2019s known informally as \u201cthe actors\u2019 call centre\u201d and \u201cis three floors of out-of-work actors who just come and go all the time\u201d. Stocks has written the kind of letters that Judi Dench and Frank Cottrell Boyce have received, as well as emailing hundreds of agents. Do you ever hear back? \u201cNever.\u201d And he\u2019s applied to all the drama schools \u201cand I paid the ridiculous audition fees for all of them\u201d. And then he won a place at the well respected East 15 Acting School in Loughton, Essex. It was an amazing piece of good fortune. And yet \u2013 it wasn\u2019t quite amazing enough. \u201cI was quite naive, thinking OK, it\u2019s 12 grand but I can borrow that from the government,\u201d he says. And you can\u2019t? \u201cNo. The only way you can fund it is with a career-development loan which isn\u2019t like a student loan. You have to pay back \u00a3200 a month for the next five years come what may.\u201d  It\u2019s possible to get student loans to study drama, if the course is affiliated to Ucas, and if it\u2019s your first degree. But Stocks, like many actors before him, had already been to university \u2013 a performing arts course at the University of South Wales in Newport, where he did three jobs to pay his maintenance. At East 15, he would get a showcase, a crucial first step if you want to make it as an actor. It\u2019s just that he can\u2019t figure out how to pay for it. He grew up in Bolton and his father is a chef, his mother a school dinner lady. \u201cI decided to defer for a year and get a job and try and save the money. But I didn\u2019t have nearly enough so I thought, I\u2019m going to go all in and just borrow it. But then my dad sat me down and said, you\u2019ve already got all your student loans from university and \u00a3200 a month is such a big commitment and there\u2019s no loopholes. And in the end, I just couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d He deferred for another year and \u201cthen it came to Christmas and it came to a point where I was chasing a dream. I was just never going to get the finances. My parents couldn\u2019t pay for it. And I was so deluded to think I could get this money on my own. A bunch of actors writing to private sponsors. It was never going to happen.\u201d     Line of Duty actor Daniel Mays has criticised \u2018the Downton effect\u2019 on British television. Photograph: Richard Saker for the Observer    He shrugs. There was nothing to be done. So, he\u2019s moved to London and is attending open auditions and has launched something called Actor Awareness, a campaign for greater diversity and representation in the industry. He\u2019s had messages of support from the cast of This Is England and John Challis (Boycie from Only Fools and Horses), and an \u201canonymous\u201d \u00a31,000 donation that arrived just hours after he told Sir Ian McKellen about it. He\u2019s impressively upbeat and dynamic and determined to get on and do something. \u201cPeople thought I was just whining initially but I\u2019ve really put my money where my mouth is.\u201d But later I ask Nina Gold what her advice would be to someone from a working-class background, and I can\u2019t help thinking of Stocks. \u201cIf you can somehow find a way to get to drama school, go,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not the only way but you learn a lot, you get to act a lot, all day, every day, and you get seen by the industry.\u201d It\u2019s just a brutal fact of life that Stocks can\u2019t afford it. And his place will go to someone else who can. If good drama reflects us back at ourselves, what does it mean that the version of ourselves that we see on screen is so often male and Etonian? That we\u2019re living in a Britain where our national psychodramas are being acted out by graduates of our most expensive public schools? Daniel Mays, giving an interview to the Radio Times to publicise his leading role in Line of Duty recently, spoke about how British TV is \u201cawash with the Downton effect\u201d. Period dramas \u201chave a place\u201d, he said, \u201cbut there are a lot of public-school actors and writers about at the moment\u201d. The great, starring roles of recent times, the ones that go to Cumberbatch and Hiddleston and Lewis and Redmayne, the roles that have propelled them into the big time, are not great working-class heroes. They\u2019re not the kind of roles that Daniel Mays \u2013 currently on stage as Aston in Harold Pinter\u2019s The Caretaker \u2013 gets. Nina Gold mentions him when I ask her about the standout stars she\u2019d seen at drama schools. \u201cYou really thought, my God, he\u2019s brilliant.\u201d But then, class, she says, is one of the hardest things to cast against type. \u201cLike Eddie Redmayne, who is genuinely, totally brilliant, we even cast him to play a woman. Why would you cast him to play a working-class character? What\u2019s the advantage? Though from his point of view, it\u2019s probably fun to do.\u201d And what, you can\u2019t help wondering, is our obsession with period drama all about? Downton, suggests Josie Long, comedian and co-founder of the charity Arts Emergency, \u201cspeaks to that certain weird thing that is going on in the UK. Something very repressive that is reflected in our art.\u201d It\u2019s what happens, she thinks, \u201cwhen you don\u2019t have different voices coming through\u201d. And \u201cposh fetishisation\u2026 posh as aspiration\u201d becomes a defining feature of our culture. Posh is at the very heart of mainstream viewing, a cornerstone of all TV schedules and a guaranteed seller abroad. The Night Manager is currently being broadcast in America on the cable channel AMC, which contributed a large part of its \u00a318m budget. It\u2019s a vision of Britain that sells.    It\u2019s about young people from working-class backgrounds not being able to get on the first rung  David Morrissey     And at the other end of the social scale is\u2026 well, what? In his 2011 book, Chavs, the journalist and activist Owen Jones argued that the artistic representation of the working classes has all but disappeared from our screens. And in its place is an underclass to be feared and despised. There\u2019s been no modern austerity equivalent of the great, epoch-defining Alan Bleasdale drama, Boys from the Blackstuff, a series that seemed to signal the high-water mark of Thatcherism. If you were alive in the 80s, you followed Yosser Hughes\u2019s tragic efforts to find work and hang on to his family. It elicited huge public sympathy for him, and crucially, others like him. What\u2019s the defining programme on poverty during George Osborne\u2019s reign as chancellor? Benefits Street. Five years ago, when I wrote about Jones\u2019s book, I rang Phil Redmond, the creator of Brookside and Grange Hill to ask him what he thought, and when I ring him again, he says it\u2019s the same, only worse, and launches into a vivid monologue about how the TV industry works. \u201cYou might have somebody saying, well the prime minister has all these plans to regenerate sink estates, why don\u2019t we do a drama about a sink estate? And they\u2019ll say, good idea! Who would make that? It reminds me of a very good idea somebody had about garden cities in the 1930s, between the wars, with these great historical social forces at work. Fascinating stuff. What\u2019s Dominic doing at the moment?\u201d David Morrissey, another actor who has spoken out on the subject, points out that \u201cfor every Downton, there\u2019s a Happy Valley\u201d. Almost everyone I talk to mentions Happy Valley, the brilliant Sally Wainwright BBC drama set in the Calder valley, as the counter-example to Downton and The Night Manager, but it\u2019s perhaps pretty damning that portraying ordinary working people with warmth and humanity is, in 2016, seen as a revolutionary artistic act.     Sarah Lancashire in Sally Wainwright\u2019s police drama Happy Valley, set in west Yorkshire. Photograph: Ben Blackall/BBC    For Morrissey, though, it\u2019s not about the kinds of drama being made, it\u2019s simply about access. \u201cIt\u2019s about young people from working-class backgrounds not being able to get on the first rung. Not being able to take a risk. The creativity that comes from suburban bedrooms. That world has gone and that has enormous consequences for our nation. If you look at how important the creative industries are to Britain, how much things like the Beatles and Harry Potter have formed our national identity, it\u2019s like we\u2019re going around tarmac-ing over the oil wells.\u201d And it\u2019s not just acting, he says. \u201cYoung people are being asked to work for very little money and so it\u2019s becoming a de facto middle-class profession. We\u2019re not looking after them in our industry and I\u2019d say that\u2019s true of your profession too.\u201d It\u2019s a good point. But it\u2019s striking in journalism how this affects content \u2013 local London stories being treated as topics of national interest, Port Talbot being viewed as somewhere just outside Mars, an awful lot of quinoa \u2013 so it seems improbable that it doesn\u2019t in TV and film too. Or as Edward Kemp, the artistic director of Rada, who describes himself as having \u201cthe classic British director training of an English degree from Oxford University\u201d, says: \u201cI think the fact that our gatekeepers, of whom I\u2019m one, all look rather like me and have my background, must have an impact. I can\u2019t see how it can\u2019t.\u201d  We\u2019re talking in his office, in Rada\u2019s elegant Bloomsbury building with its photos of eminent alumni in the lobby, dozens of them, the great and the good, the stars of British stage and screen for more than a century. In the 50s, he tells me, a man called John Fernald took over as principal. He had served with men from all backgrounds during the war and encouraged students to celebrate their roots and keep their accents. \u201cSheila Hancock is very sharp on this because she caught the end of the previous era and speaks RP whereas her husband, John Thaw, was part of this new generation that came through. It meant that when there were writers and directors ready to make movies in which Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay and all those people starred, there was a generation of actors who were able to make that happen.\u201d It\u2019s all connected. In the 60s, the first working-class actors with working-class voices were part of a wider phenomenon, the great explosion of social mobility and cultural blossoming that expanded our ideas about what is and isn\u2019t a fit subject for art. David Morrissey tells me he was inspired to become an actor after seeing the film, Kes, the first time he\u2019d seen his life reflected on screen. I feel a bit the same way about Phil Redmond\u2019s Grange Hill. I just hadn\u2019t realised at the time that it was the kind of gritty social realism that would subsequently vanish.     David Bradley in Ken Loach\u2019s film Kes, the movie that inspired David Morrrissey to act. Photograph: Rex    But what now? Now that this whole process is in reverse? Already, the dramatist Jimmy McGovern has said how hard it is to even find working-class actors to play his roles. Is it the start of a great cultural contraction? Are our ideas about what is dramatically interesting diminishing? Will we reach the stage that Julie Walters fears, where it\u2019ll be \u201cmiddle-class people playing working-class people, like it used to be\u201d. Rada, in fairness, is doing its best to keep the traditions of the 60s alive, but it\u2019s getting harder and harder. \u201cWe get defensive about diversity because actually 40% of our students come from family backgrounds with an income of less than \u00a325,000 and 60% of our students are getting some kind of bursary from us,\u201d says Kemp. Rada is lucky because its alumni are often rich and many of them want to give back and it\u2019s able to help a significant number of its students. \u201cBut the real challenge for the actor starting out is how do you survive afterwards,\u201d says Kemp. The rep [repertory theatre] system which provided full-time employment for actors has all but disappeared. \u201cAnd how do you sustain a career with an expectation that you\u2019ll live within reach of London because that\u2019s where the industry is largely based? At that point the bank of mum and dad is incredibly useful.\u201d Kemp\u2019s conclusion, like Frank Cottrell Boyce\u2019s and Nina Gold\u2019s, is that it isn\u2019t about acting. It\u2019s about money. It\u2019s about what we\u2019ve done to our education system. \u201cI would love it to be the world that Julie Walters came from, where it was free, but I would love that for everything in higher education,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just drama schools. It\u2019s an issue about how we pay for higher education.\u201d The third and final part of the puzzle is schools. Last year, Jessica Hynes won a Bafta for her role in W1A and used the occasion to make an impassioned speech about how children from low-income families were being driven out of the arts. She\u2019s spent the last year visiting schools, talking to headteachers and learning about what is happening to drama. \u201cThe worst thing is the academy system,\u201d she says, \u201cwhich has monetised all subjects and schools simply don\u2019t receive any money from arts subjects, so they\u2019ve become incredibly difficult to justify.\u201d John Baugh, the head of the Dragon School, also points to the stresses and strains that state schools operate under. \u201cThere\u2019s an obsession with Sats which seem to be the only measure of whether a school is deemed to be successful or not.\u201d But drama, says Hynes, \u201cis not prancing around or finding the next Orlando Bloom. It\u2019s about how you build confidence, how you connect with other people. It\u2019s about coming into a class where you feel different. Where you feel able to express yourself in another way. And it affects all other subjects. There\u2019s so much focus on Stem [science, technology, engineering and maths] subjects, but don\u2019t you think engineers need confidence and presentation and teamwork skills? \u201cWait a moment, I\u2019m going to tell you what Eton says on this\u2026\u201d She stomps off to retrieve a piece of paper. \u201cThis is from the Eton website,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is what they say about drama. \u2018The aim is to provide the boys with a safe and stimulating environment in which to develop skills not easily learned in the schoolroom: physical and vocal self-confidence; the social disciplines of group work; imaginative spontaneity and the disciplines required to channel it; an extended emotional range; the power of their own creativity and a respect for that of others.\u2019 \u201cDon\u2019t all children deserve that? Not just Etonians?\u201d     Jessica Hynes used her awards success in W1A to speak out about inequality of opportunity in the arts. Photograph: Jack Barnes/BBC    In her Bafta speech, Hynes, who grew up in a single-parent family in Brighton, urged people to support Arts Emergency, founded by the comedian Josie Long and her friend Neil Griffith, which campaigns to create opportunities for young people from low income backgrounds. \u201cAnd it crashed their website. I\u2019m very proud of that. They got 20,000 hits.\u201d Arts Emergency pairs up mentors and mentees \u2013 young people trying to find a crack into the sort of professions that rely heavily on contacts and networks and a certain savvy knowhow. Julie Hesmondhalgh, the Accrington-born actor, who played transgender Hayley Cropper in Coronation Street and was recently in Happy Valley, is one of the latest mentors to volunteer. She tells me about a young woman from Burnley called Lisa-Marie Ashworth whom she\u2019s been trying to help for the past year or so and whose life has been genuinely turned around by drama. \u201cI were quite disruptive at school,\u201d Ashworth tells me, though this sounds like something of an understatement. She was repeatedly excluded, and was on track to leave school with no qualifications whatsoever. \u201cShe\u2019s this classic girl. Stunningly beautiful. Proper working-class. And absolutely primed to become a statistic,\u201d says Julie Hesmondhaulgh. \u201cNobody could contain her. And then on a whim she auditioned for the school play and just blew them away. It was like Miles Davies picking up a trumpet.\u201d  When I talk to Ashworth, she\u2019s still on tenterhooks waiting to hear if she\u2019s got a place at drama school next year. \u201cShe\u2019s not someone who wants to be rich and famous,\u201d says Hesmondhalgh. \u201cShe\u2019s hungry for theatre. And she really turned it around. She went back to school, retook her GCSEs. It would just be amazing if she could break out of the life that\u2019s been mapped out for her.\u201d A couple of weeks later, Ashworth emails me the good news: she might just do that; she\u2019s been offered a place at East 15. Later, I look up Eton\u2019s website and marvel at its facilities: not one but two professionally staffed theatres including \u201ca flying system, orchestra pit and revolving stage\u201d. (Frank Cottrell Boyce says: \u201cThey\u2019ve got a classical stage and a TV studio. Honestly, you could train a monkey. It would be a disgrace to leave there and not be a brilliant actor.\u201d) But the skills required to become an Oscar-winner will also help you become prime minister, or mayor of London, or chief executive of a leading company. Or win a lead role in The Night Manager. Olivia Colman gets her man in the end. Because the TV version of The Night Manager is a morality tale that sees the billionaires brought to book. Colman brings Dickie Roper to heel and the monied elite who think they can get away with it, don\u2019t. But life is not like that. Just ask Tom Stocks. You probably won\u2019t see him interviewed in the Radio Times any time soon, but ring up customer service at Virgin Wines and you might get him on the end of the line. His latest campaign is to get drama schools to abolish their audition fees. \u201cIt just annoys me. You\u2019re up against it already. Surely everyone deserves a level start? You can\u2019t win a race if you\u2019re already 100 metres behind.\u201d Britain has changed so quickly, the gains of 40 years of social progress undone in half a generation, that most of us are still struggling to compute it, but the evidence is right there in front of us, on our cinema and television screens. It\u2019s not posh-bashing to say this is a problem. Laurence Fox, the son of James Fox, suggested the likes of Julie Walters banging on about it should \u201cshut up\u201d. But maybe we should be taking more notice not less.
