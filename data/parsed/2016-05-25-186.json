  "body": "Be gone 5:2, paleo, and #eatclean; this summer, everything\u2019s coming up vegan. New research by Ipsos Mori revealed there are now over half a million vegans in Britain \u2013 a jump of 350% in the last decade. Google searches for \u201cvegan\u201d have doubled in the last five years, and the number of vegan-friendly products in the UK grew by 134% between 2012 and 2015. The numbers are rising, and while fashion and the \u201clifestyle\u201d version of healthy eating plays its part (last we heard, J-Lo was still struggling bravely on without butter), for many people, the link between meat consumption and greenhouse gas emissions is increasingly difficult to ignore.  Having a plant-based diet isn\u2019t as difficult - or joyless - as the old jokes imply. If you have the time and inclination to cook, you can create thousands of tasty, healthy and exciting dishes with inspiration from Indian, Italian and Middle Eastern cuisines (to name a few). But cooking from scratch isn\u2019t always practical. Whether you\u2019re coming home from work late, are off to a barbecue, fancy a guilty treat, or if you\u2019re just not a natural star in the kitchen, there ought to be good options for prepared vegan food. Our panel \u2013 a hardcore vegan, a recent vegetarian-to-vegan convert, and omnivorous cookery columnist Felicity Cloake, who recently went vegan for the week \u2013 joined forces to give the market a thorough testing.  Once a grim and limited sector, vegan products are improving in range and quality, and some actually trumped the animal-derived originals. But some categories are better than others. Unsurprisingly, meats were the most challenging foodstuff to mimic (some vegans do want to recreate the texture or \u2013 dare I say it \u2013 taste of meat, without the exploitation of the animal in question). Meat alternatives often tasted highly processed, salty and sinisterly similar. Vegan bacon and steak didn\u2019t fare well (\u201cvegans should just admit we\u2019ll never get our steak,\u201d said one tester), but vegan cheeses were largely better than expected. The vegan egg was the biggest disappointment, its jaunty carton revealing a sad packet of yellow powder that cooked up to become something with the texture of eggs, but none of their flavour. Desserts were the most successful \u2013 there were so many top-scoring ice-creams and sweet treats that we can\u2019t mention them all. These producers are setting an example to the rest. Just one comment \u2013 calm down with the coconut!   Related: Felicity Cloake: my week as a vegan    The panel Jill Wooster has been vegan for 20 years, and was vegetarian before that. Her motivation is mainly animal welfare; the benefit to the environment, she says, is a bonus. She alternates between home-cooked meals and occasional manufactured foods. Saoirse Christopherson has been vegan for six months, and was vegetarian for three years. She stopped eating meat for environmental reasons, but adds that \u201cyou become increasingly aware that consuming eggs but not chicken, and cheese but not beef is hypocrisy\u201d. She cooks almost all meals from scratch.  Felicity Cloake went vegan for one week after being forced to do so by her editor. She cooks daily, if not hourly.  Meat alternatives Linda McCartney vegetarian quarter-pounder burgers, \u00a32     Firm texture \u2026 Linda McCartney veggie burgers. Photograph: PR    \u201cNot only did its slightly smoky, savoury flavour make a nice change from the generic mix of dried herbs and spices so puzzlingly common in meat substitutes,\u201d Felicity says, \u201cbut it had a good, firm texture, too. Pretty delicious, actually.\u201d\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Tofurky slow-roasted chick\u2019n, \u00a33.44     BBQ-friendly \u2026 Tofurkey Photograph: Tofurkey    Jill appreciated the \u201cdelicate flavour\u201d of the lightly seasoned version, which was good in salads, but she got really excited about the barbecue style. Saoirse agrees. \u201cIt would satisfy lingering meat cravings, she says, and was \u201cideal as a vegan option at summer barbecues.\u201d\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Wheaty vegan kebab, \u00a33.49 This passed the post-pint test for Saoirse. \u201cMeaty texture, salty flavour and a welcome change to the vegan staple of falafel kebab. Obviously, it\u2019s missing the fatty flavour and texture of meat, but it\u2019s crisp on the outside and gives plenty of salty juice on the inside. Great in a pitta or on a typical kebab salad.\u201d\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Mighty Bee coconut jerky strips, \u00a31.80 \u201cThis has a good texture and a nice strong flavour, but it\u2019s not overpowering,\u201d says Saoirse of the teriyaki flavour. The spicy BBQ version was also well-balanced between salt and sweet. \u201cChow down with a pint.\u201d\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Wheaty organic vegan merguez sausage, \u00a33.25     Wheaty vegan merguez sausages Photograph: Wheaty    \u201cWarm, spicy sausage with nice texture, flavour and a hot afterkick,\u201d says Jill. Of all the \u201ccharcuterie\u201d on trial, this was the least objectionable for Felicity, who praised its strong North African spicing. \u201cThat sets it apart from most of the other products, which taste sinisterly similar\u201d.\u2605\u2605\u2605  Ready meals Amy\u2019s Kitchen gluten-free dairy-free mac & cheese, \u00a33.29     Amy\u2019s Kitchen gluten-free dairy-free mac & cheese Photograph: PR    Jill tried the lasagne ready meal and had this to say: \u201cOut of the box, this didn\u2019t look great, I microwaved it with low expectations \u2026 but it was truly delicious. For a frozen, ready-made meal, I couldn\u2019t have asked for more.\u201d Felicity roadtested the macaroni cheese pictured above (3/5): \u201cIt\u2019s gloopy, salty and orange ... What I imagine Kraft Mac & Cheese to be like. It tastes like junk food, and I don\u2019t mean that in an entirely negative way: if I was drunk, or tired, I have little doubt that I\u2019d polish the lot off. It\u2019s the vegan version of a guilty pleasure.\u201d\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Clive\u2019s organic creamy mushroom pie, \u00a32.99 This is what Saoirse wants from a pie: \u201cTraditional \u2018meaty\u2019 filling and strong flavour.\u201d She was slightly disappointed by crumbly wholemeal crusts that fell apart in the oven. \u201cIf you\u2019re eating a pie, you know what you\u2019re getting yourself into,\u201d she says. \u201cA wholemeal crust doesn\u2019t make it a healthy meal.\u201d \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605  Cheeses and dairy alternatives The cheeses caused the most division, with each tester championing a different type. Vegusto No-Moo herb cheese, \u00a34.99 \u201cGood texture. It\u2019s not trying to be overpoweringly cheesy, so it\u2019s versatile for cooking,\u201d says Saoirse. \u201cGood if you want a creamy or sticky cheese texture.\u201d Felicity (who scored it just 2/5) was less enthusiastic: \u201cThere\u2019s quite a strong herb flavour, which hides a multitude of sins.\u201d\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Wilmersburger cheese wedges, \u00a34.99     Wilmersburger cheese wedges    \u201cThis \u2018hearty\u2019 flavour is the best vegan cheese in town so far,\u201d decided Jill, whose experience of fake cheeses goes back some way. \u201cCreamy texture, great taste, smoky. I would eat on its own or in sandwich\u201d. Felicity (2/5) disagreed: \u201cYuck. It\u2019s got an overpowering flavour of artificial smoke. Horrid.\u201d She prefers the brand\u2019s cheddar flavour for meltability and saltiness. \u201cIt\u2019s not hugely cheesy, but it works on a burger.\u201d\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Violife parmesan flavour Prosociano, \u00a35.50  \u201cSurprisingly, it\u2019s not far off a young version of the real thing,\u201d says Felicity, \u201cthough the faint taste of coconut is a bit disconcerting.\u201d While she wouldn\u2019t eat it by the slice, she says it would be fine grated over pasta. Saoirse, on the other hand, thinks it\u2019s only suitable for those with a foot fetish.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Follow Your Heart Vegenaise, \u00a33.50     Follow Your Heart Vegenais    \u201cUnlike other vegan mayonnaise, this is spreadably thick, great on sandwiches and has a nice flavour,\u201d says Saoirse. In Felicity\u2019s view, it\u2019s far better than Hellman\u2019s and other branded versions: \u201cI can\u2019t stand jarred mayonnaise, normally. I\u2019d buy this, though. It\u2019s nice and light and not too vinegary.\u201d\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Follow Your Heart vegan bleu cheese dressing, \u00a34.50 \u201cReally rich, thick and creamy,\u201d enthuses Jill. \u201cGreat on a salad, but slightly tricky to extricate from the bottle.\u201d The company\u2019s Caesar dressing didn\u2019t impress her, though: \u201cIt\u2019s thin, watery and acidic.\u201d\u2605\u2605\u2605 Oatly creamy oat organic cream alternative, 75p     Oatly creamy oat organic cream alternative    \u201cI tried this in everything from semolina to a White Russian,\u201d Felicity reports, \u201cand it\u2019s good. Slightly thicker than single cream, with a mild oaty flavour, it\u2019s really versatile stuff.\u201d She also liked the \u201cBarista\u201d offering by the same company, which has about the same fat content as whole cow\u2019s milk \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s great frothed up in coffee.\u201d\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 CoYo natural coconut milk yoghurt, \u00a32     CoYo natural coconut milk yoghurt    \u201cRich, creamy and delicious,\u201d says Saoirse, \u201cwith a thicker texture than normal yogurt. One spoon and you\u2019re hooked.\u201d Not so for Jill, who describes it as \u201chorror in a mouthful\u201d. Felicity is somewhere in the middle.\u2605\u2605\u2605 Desserts Sainsbury\u2019s vanilla, chocolate, strawberry, \u00a33  \u201cAbsolutely smashed all the others in both texture and flavour,\u201d yells ice-cream lover Saoirse. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t know they\u2019re vegan.\u201d High praise indeed. Felicity is equally enthusiastic: \u201cSweet and creamy, these would definitely be crowd-pleasers.\u201d Hitting stores from June.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Tesco free-from toffee and vanilla cones, \u00a32 These cheap and cheerful options went down well with Jill. \u201cWow, these are a definite treat! They taste like all the wonderful synthetic things from childhood that are probably really bad for you. Nostalgic bliss, especially the toffee one.\u201d\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Coconut Collaborative dairy-free milk chocolate ganache pots, \u00a32.99 These little pots are a \u201cbrow-wiggling sensation\u201d, says Jill. \u201cGreat-textured chocolatey goodness in just the right portion size.\u201d For Saoirse, it\u2019s reminiscent of a mousse \u2013 \u201cit\u2019s not intensely chocolatey, and it has a nice soft texture.\u201d Felicity is keen, too \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s rich and not overpoweringly coconutty. I\u2019d eat this again.\u201d Full marks all round.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605   Related: Fit, macho, sexy: the reinvention of vegans    Ms Cupcake chocolate vegan cupcake, \u00a33.29 \u201cProbably one of the best cupcakes I\u2019ve ever had \u2013 vegan or otherwise,\u201d says Saoirse. \u201cLike a giant Ferrero Rocher on top of a little cake.\u201d Who can argue with that?\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Ananda gelatine-free wagon wheels, \u00a32.50 \u201cPretty awesome,\u201d says Saoirse. \u201cThe gooey consistency of the marshmallow inside and soft biscuit casing would make it an ideal candidate to warm on a campfire.\u201d Felicity is also keen: \u201cReally nice. An improvement on the original, actually.\u201d The company\u2019s raspberry and vanilla marshmallows also found fans in all three testers.\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Booja-Booja truffles \u00a33.99     Booja-Booja truffles    These square truffles come with a traditional chocolate dusting on the outside. Saoirse found them \u201crich and surprisingly creamy \u2013 as good as any I can remember.\u201d\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Biona organic Cocobella chocolate coconut butter, \u00a34.99 \u201cIt\u2019s like eating a spreadable Bounty! This is a really great alternative to Nutella,\u201d raves Saoirse. \u201cIn fact,\u201cit\u2019s better. It\u2019s not massively chocolatey and it\u2019s a bit thick, but it tastes amazing. I want this with vanilla ice-cream.\u201d\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 Loving Earth organic salted-caramel chocolate, \u00a31.39 \u201cAlthough I\u2019m relieved vegans can find decent dark chocolate, occasionally we all yearn for something sweeter and richer \u2013 and this makes a pretty great substitute for milk chocolate,\u201d says Felicity. \u201cOutrageously buttery, with a faint coconut flavour, it\u2019s addictive stuff. I\u2019m impressed.\u201d\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605",
