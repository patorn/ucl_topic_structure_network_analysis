Whipping a pistol from a holster, another teen shoots rapidly at man-shaped targets that pop from behind barrels.  These are scenes shown in online videos from specialized summer camps around the country where children as young as nine years old fire assault-style guns and ammunition as they learn practical shooting, a controversial sport that mimics combat situations. Target shooting, in which participants fire low-caliber guns at round paper targets, has long been a staple of American summer camps. Unlike regular target shooting, however, practical shooters fire semi-automatic assault rifles, high capacity pistols and shotguns, often at human-shaped targets.

The sport\u2019s largest governing body in this country, the United States Practical Shooting Association (USPSA), counts more than 25,000 members and matches are held regularly around the world. The group\u2019s membership has increased from about 19,000 members in 2010. The USPSA has been offering scholarships for the summer shooting camps for the last three years as part of an effort to attract younger members. \u201cThere is a real organizational need to revitalize and grow USPSA membership within a younger demographic,\u201d the USPSA leadership wrote in an internal memo available online. Mike Foley, president of the USPSA, declined to comment. Some gun control advocates say combat-style shooting sports, including practical shooting, are too violent for children at a time when US gun violence and mass shootings are on the rise. \u201cThe lesson you are teaching children is that guns are the solutions to problems,\u201d said Ladd Everitt, the director of communications for the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. He said that his group is opposed to anyone under age 18 participating in practical shooting. \u201cThere are plenty of other healthy sports that don\u2019t involve the risk of accidental injury that practical shooting does and don\u2019t involve teaching violence.\u201d Practical shooting advocates say that teaching children about guns makes them safer in a country where there are more than 200 million firearms owned by civilians. \u201cIf my kids came upon a situation at their school where the teacher lay down a firearm on the desk they would be the first to guard it and not touch it,\u201d said David Power, one of the organizers of the 2A Heritage Junior Camps.  Aside from teaching shooting skills, the camps are intended to get more children interested in guns. Applicants to the MGM camp must write an essay about \u201chow the second amendment to the US constitution applies to you today, to this training class\u201d. Those who want to attend the camp for a second year must complete 40 hours of community service. One camper completed his community service by attending rallies in support of gun rights, said Rhonda Gibson, coordinator of the MGM Sports Junior Camp. Every year, outside speakers lecture the campers on a variety of a topics. During a previous camp, a local sheriff came to speak to the children to urge them to lobby for gun rights.  \u201cChildren are the future of shooting,\u201d Gibson said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t get more kids out there shooting we are going to lose our second amendment rights.\u201d Camp organizers say the sessions offer children valuable life lessons. Gibson cited as an example a boy who came to a previous camp \u201cwearing droopy pants, long hair, a hoody, a stocking cap and a bad attitude\u201d. But after the three-day camp \u201chis whole personality changed. The next year he came to camp clean cut and respectful,\u201d Gilbson said.     Aside from teaching shooting skills, the camps are intended to get more children interested in guns.

Now when I get a penalty I am a lot more relaxed.\u201d The MGM camp accepts about 60 participants each year who are organized into groups called squads. Participants train in pistol shooting and also a variant of practical shooting called 3-Gun or multi-gun shooting in which participants use a combination of rifles, handguns and shotguns. Each day, campers fire thousands of rounds of ammunition under the eye of instructors, while socializing with pizza parties and games at night. Campers are required to follow strict safety rules including that guns are unloaded when not in use. \u201cOnly one person is shooting at a time and the instructors are standing right there,\u201d Gibson said. Power said he has taught his own children ages 12 and 16 practical shooting and said that he has seen them benefit from the sport.  \u201cThere are so many distractions for kids today as everything is so instantaneous with the internet and cell phones,\u201d Power said. \u201cThey really learn how to concentrate on one thing when they are dealing with live ammunition.\u201d He began teaching his daughter to shoot at the age of six. \u201cWe would go Sunday afternoon after church without even changing out of our church clothes,\u201d Power said. \u201cMy daughter would be on the range in her little Sunday dress helping me change magazines.\u201d While many participants in practical shooting describe the pursuit as merely a sport, Power and others say it also teaches their kids self-defense. And the emphasis on real-world situations is clear. \u201cSo-called practical shooting is almost the complete opposite of traditional target shooting sports,\u201d according to a report by the Violence Policy Center. \u201cCompetitors conduct their activities over a \u2018run-and-gun\u2019 obstacle course where they face a variety of \u2018real-world\u2019 or \u2018practical\u2019 shoot/don\u2019t shoot situations, such as firing at the human silhouette of a \u2018hostage-taker\u2019 while sparing the \u2018hostage\u2019.\u201d Jim Ryan\u2019s 17-year-old daughter Casey attended a practical shooting camp in Idaho last year. Casey has competed in practical shooting competitions. But Ryan said that he also wanted his daughter \u201cto be adept with a gun for self defense reasons because as a young lady she\u2019s vulnerable\u201d.",
