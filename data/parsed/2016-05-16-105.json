  "body": "Higher education experts have spent the day decoding the long-awaited white paper on university reform. Key points include:  Universities will be allowed to increase fees in line with inflation if they meet the basic standards set out in the Teaching Excellence Framework (Tef) in 2017-18 and 2018-19, before differentiated caps are introduced in 2019-20. The Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce) will be merged with the Office for Students, within which fair access to education will be handled. Universities will be able to charge up to \u00a39,000 (rather than \u00a36,000) in fees if they have implemented an access agreement. Research councils and bodies will be brought under the umbrella of the newly created UK Research and Innovation, while maintaining the principle of \u201cdual support\u201d whereby block grants and research funding are provided from both higher education funding institutions and research councils, allowing researchers to pick and choose. Assessment of universities will be based on measures including National Student Satisfaction (NSS) survey scores. Minimum student requirement reduced to allow smaller institutions to class themselves as universities.  New providers to offer their own degrees immediately, on a probationary basis (subject to ongoing monitoring and annual reviews).  Here\u2019s how the sector responded:  \u2018Warnings have been ignored\u2019 University College Union general secretary Sally Hunt  On new providers: \u201cDespite repeated warnings from UCU about the danger of opening up UK higher education to private, for-profit providers, the government is setting out on a clear course to privatise higher education. We have already seen too many scandals involving alternative providers in the UK and the US, so if we are to protect the global reputation enjoyed by our universities, lessons must be learned and rigorous quality measures applied before any new provider is allowed to access either degree awarding powers or state funding.\u201d On the Tef: \u201cIt is hard to see how many of the measures which have been proposed for the teaching excellence framework (Tef) will either measure quality or improve it. UCU believes a critical weakness of our current system is the precarious employment of university teachers, 49% of whom are on insecure contracts.\u201d On widening access: \u201cThe government must do more to address the persistent barriers to higher education for those from the most disadvantaged backgrounds. We need tougher action on universities who are missing access targets, better support for part-time and mature study, and a national inquiry on our broken admissions system.\u201d    We\u2019ll now end up with innovative providers charging most, locking out pupils from socially deprived backgrounds from HE. Again #HEwhitepaper\u2014 Becca Wright (@_beccawright) May 16, 2016    \u2018We need to ensure students aren\u2019t ripped off\u2019 National Union of Students vice president (higher education) Sorana Vieru On increasing fees: \u201cStudents will understandably be outraged at any suggestion universities could be allowed to put fees up even higher in order to improve teaching quality \u2013 it was only four years ago that tuition fees were trebled. \u201cThe proposed teaching excellence framework should not be linked to any rise in fees \u2013 the government should urgently reflect on this and drop this muddled proposal. On access: \u201cWe have consistently seen dramatic cuts to support for the most disadvantaged students, with the abolition of maintenance grants in universities only this year \u2013 the government certainly has a lot to do to prove it takes this work seriously.\u201d On new providers: \u201cThe government has serious questions to answer before it can make it easier for new providers to enter the sector. We need to know what protections they will be required to give to students, to ensure they are not left in the lurch and ripped off by institutions that may be focused on shareholders rather than students\u2019 interests.\u201d    By my calculations, #HEWhitePaper and BIS confirmation of RPI as inflation measure could mean \u00a310,000 fees by 2020-21.\u2014 David Morris (@dgmorris295) May 16, 2016    \u2018The government needs to ensure that student interests aren\u2019t at risk\u2019 Chief executive of Million+ group of universities Pam Tatlow On degree-awarding powers: \u201cThe white paper\u2019s proposals to make it easier to gain a university title and degree-awarding powers will need to be carefully considered to ensure that the interests of students are not put at risk.\u201d  On the new Office for Students: \u201cWill the OfS be independent from government or reduced to the role of a regulator like Ofcom, bearing in mind that, unlike Hefce, it will no longer be funded by BIS but from subscriptions paid by universities and other HE providers?\u201d    Useful diagram showing how far away \"Office for students\" is from students#HEWhitepaper https://t.co/I3a8nekx6T\u2014 Peter Broks (@peterbroks) May 16, 2016    \u2018We\u2019re disappointed that the government has dropped proposals\u2019 Chairman of the Sutton Trust Sir Peter Lampl On diversity: \u201cWhile we welcome the focus on access, we are disappointed that the government has apparently dropped proposals to give the director of fair access more powers to set inclusion targets. This softening of the original proposal is likely to make it harder to increase the participation of disadvantaged students.\u201d \u2018The government should be careful\u2019 Russell Group director-general Dr Wendy Piatt On the merging of research councils: \u201cThe government should be careful about making any substantial changes to a successful system. Allowing the research councils and Innovate UK to retain their identities and budgets is a step in the right direction, but we urge them to proceed with caution.\u201d \u2018There\u2019s a willingness to make it work\u2019 Wonkhe founder, editor and director Mark Leach \u201cThe white paper is a much more sturdy and coherent document than the green paper that went before it and if it doesn\u2019t feel particularly radical, remember your expectations have been managed perfectly over a long period of time. However, there were few big shocks and the government has at least been fairly consistent over the last year in setting an overall direction, sticking to it, and fleshing out details over time.\u201d  \u201cThere are plenty of challenges to the sector but I sense a general willingness to make it all work. Particularly as we now have a regulatory framework and a coherent policy star to guide our course (whether you like the ideas or not) \u2013 something we have been missing since the politics battles of 2010 and 2011.\u201d \u2018Dual support system best way to ensure competition\u2019 University Alliance chief executive Maddalaine Ansell On the Tef: \u201cIt is sensible to implement the Teaching Excellence Framework steadily and over time. It must offer the right incentives for universities to strive to offer excellent teaching and to achieve positive outcomes for all students.\u201d On the research funding system: \u201cThe dual support system is the best way to ensure UK research remains dynamic and globally competitive. The recognition that Innovate UK should be a business-facing organisation with its own protected budget, but integrated within UK Research and Innovation, is also very welcome.\u201d    The 'is there anything wrong with this page?' link at the bottom of gov press releases is for website errors only, right? :/ #HEWhitePaper\u2014 Sarah Elizabeth Cox (@spookyjulie) May 16, 2016    \u2018A commitment to diverse and world-leading higher education\u2019 Hefce chair Tim Melville-Ross On dual support: \u201cWe welcome the government\u2019s continuing commitment to dual support. UK higher education research is internationally recognised, and produces ground-breaking work for the benefit of the economy and society.\u201d  On Hefce\u2019s new role after replacement by the OfS: \u201cHefce will collaborate with government, students, the sector and others to ensure a smooth transition as the reforms are implemented, subject to parliamentary approval.\u201d Join the higher education network for more comment, analysis and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.
