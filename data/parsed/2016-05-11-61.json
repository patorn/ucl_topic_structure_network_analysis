  "body": "The defence secretary, Michael Fallon, has apologised to a Muslim cleric who was accused of supporting Islamic State during the London mayoral contest, raising the pressure on the prime minister, who made the same allegation in the House of Commons. Suliman Gani is suing the defence secretary, for accusing him of backing the extremist group. Gani, who was previously the imam at the Tooting Islamic Centre, found himself at the heart of a Conservative attack on Sadiq Khan, Labour\u2019s mayoral candidate.  Khan subsequently won the election and is now mayor of London. The Tory candidate, Zac Goldsmith, and David Cameron said Khan had shown poor judgment by sharing a platform with Gani nine times.   Related: David Cameron apologises after saying ex-imam 'supported Islamic State'    The prime minister, speaking in the House of Commons under parliamentary privilege, said Gani supported Isis and held questionable views about women and gay people. A spokesman for Cameron conceded after prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday that Gani had supported \u201cthe creation of an Islamic state\u201d rather than backing the extremist organisation, but insisted Cameron would not apologise. He said the prime minister had engaged in a positive phone conversation with Khan, who won a convincing victory over his Conservative rival, but added: \u201cKeep going on about the campaign for the next four years: that\u2019s fine; but we\u2019re focused on the future. We\u2019re focused on jobs, policing and housing.\u201d Asked by the Liberal Democrat leader, Tim Farron, to apologise for the tone of the Goldsmith campaign, which wasseen as divisive by many observers, including some senior Conservatives, Cameron refused. LBC radio revealed on Wednesday that lawyers acting for Gani had sent a defamation claim to Fallon after he repeated the remarks about him outside the Commons and specifically referred to Daesh, another name for Isis.      Michael Fallon says he was quoting a BBC presenter when he made his claim. Photograph: Steve Back/Barcroft Images    They want an on-air apology from Fallon and for the prime minister\u2019s retraction to be noted in Hansard, the daily record of what takes place in parliament.  Following the interview, Fallon said he had quoted the BBC presenter Andrew Neil.  A spokesman for Fallon said: \u201cMichael made clear he was quoting a claim by Andrew Neil on a BBC mayoral debate programme. He was unaware of the clarification and apology that the BBC had issued on Neil\u2019s claim. \u201cHad he been aware, he would not of course have quoted him and, as soon as he became aware, he put the record straight. He naturally apologises for this inadvertent error.\u201d   Related: How London became a Labour city \u2013 and what it means for British politics    According to LBC, the lawyers acting for Gani, who has faced attacks in his local community, believe he could be in line for damages. Gani told LBC that he feared for his life as well as those of his family and children. He said he was \u201cdeeply shocked and greatly disheartened\u201d that instead of getting an apology from the prime minister, Fallon reiterated the comments \u201cwithout any shred of evidence\u201d. He added: \u201cIt is really stressful, my family are upset. I am utterly shocked that someone of such a high-ranking position, the defence secretary, can make such a preposterous statement.\u201d Gani said the use of the word Daesh made clear what the allegation was, adding that he had no choice but to take legal action.  \u201cI need to take this matter as far as I can stretch it and unless I get a retraction I don\u2019t think I can continue living peacefully among so many people who don\u2019t know me.\u201d He said he was very concerned about the safety and security of his family because people might use the prime minister\u2019s statement to attack him.  Gani said he had been unable to eat because of stress, and added: \u201cI have been treated very badly.\u201d",
