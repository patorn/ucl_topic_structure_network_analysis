  "body": "A live video feed of the Mariana trench \u2013 the deepest place on Earth \u2013 is proving engrossing viewing for those above sea level. The Mariana trench plunges about 11km (seven miles) deep under the Pacific \u2013 further down than the summit of Mount Everest is above sea level. Because of the difficulties in reaching such depths, little is known about the area.           World\u2019s deepest fish filmed eight kilometres down in the Mariana Trench     Related: James Cameron dives into the Mariana Trench \u2013 in pictures    The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s (NOAA) exploration vessel Okeanos Explorer has been conducting a deepwater exploration of the Marianas since 20 April. Video footage from its deep sea remotely-operated vehicle is being live-streamed on YouTube and the NOAA\u2019s website. The vehicle is currently scouring the seafloor of the Mariana trench marine national monument, 3,685m deep, just east of the Philippines. Commentary is provided by scientists identified only as \u201cChris\u201d, \u201cKelley\u201d and others, some shore-based, some aboard the Okeanos Explorer.

In 20 minutes\u2019 viewing, scientists pointed out a starfish, two sponges, a holothurian sea cucumber of \u201cincredible colour\u201d, up to three different kinds of anemones, some kind of \u201csediment-dweller\u201d, a tripod fish without tripods, and \u201cour second cusk-eel\u201d.

Updates from each dive are posted daily on the NOAA website, as are highlight videos and images. For the most committed followers, there is a mobile app that promises \u201cto bring the excitement of ocean discovery directly to your smartphone or tablet\u201d. In December 2014 scientists at the University of Aberdeen filmed a new type of snailfish at a depth of 8,145m in the Mariana trench setting a new record for the world\u2019s deepest fish. In 2012 filmmaker James Cameron returned safely from a one-man mission nearly 11km into the trench in his 12-tonne, lime green submarine Deepsea Challenger.",
