  "body": "A fun game to kick off the weekend, ladies! Guess which year the following\u00a0quotations about your dating prospects are from: 1 \u201cAs bad as things may be for a single 38-year-old woman now, it\u2019s going to be a bloodbath when today\u2019s single, twentysomething women turn 38.\u201d 2 \u201cA lady\u2019s imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment.\u201d 3 \u201cMen don\u2019t have to commit, so they pursue a\u00a0short-term mating strategy\u2026 and women are forced to go along with it in order to mate at all.\u201d 4 \u201cGirls of gentleness and refinement do not care to be courted upon the open highway, nor\u00a0in\u00a0public parks, and thus the world is filling with spinsters.\u201d What, all from the 19th century you say? Not quite. Only numbers two and four pre-date the 21st century, coming from, respectively, Pride And Prejudice and an article in the New York Times published a century ago. Numbers one and three were published within the last year, in a\u00a0British national newspaper and Vanity Fair magazine respectively. But don\u2019t feel bad \u2013 because feeling bad causes wrinkles which will damage your marriage prospects even more. It is fascinating how little the narrative of the single woman has changed since, well, for ever. Two centuries after Jane Austen\u2019s death, the only acceptable happy ending to a fictional story about a single woman is one involving marriage. In real life, expectations remain equally retrograde, underpinned by an assumption of women\u2019s \u2013 and\u00a0only women\u2019s \u2013 obsession with matrimony: \u201cBag that man whatever the cost, gals!\u201d, delivered in a\u00a0\u201cjust tellin\u2019 it like it is\u201d tone. Sure, you might be doing more with your days than churning butter and evading smallpox, much of the media narrative goes, but you modern women are, if anything, even more screwed than you were 250 years ago when it comes to Catching A Man. Feminism\u2019s all well and good, but you can\u2019t argue with biology. Certain sections of the media love few things more than an article telling women that they have doomed themselves to loneliness with their 21st-century ways. Bonus points if that article is written by a woman \u2013 preferably one too young to realise that this article has been written every five years since women were allowed to write. For all future writers of these pieces, consider this your\u00a0template: the scene opens with you and\u00a0your\u00a0bafflingly single female friends at a\u00a0glittering dinner party, or a witty picnic; talk about how women are now out-achieving men and this is why you are so much worse off in the dating game than any other woman, ever; tap-dance in some literary references; follow with a reference to an au courant issue \u2013 Tinder, say, or online porn; insist you know (of course!) there is nothing wrong with being single, while whispering out the side of your mouth that obviously everything is wrong with it. Pose for mournful photo. Press send. Leaving aside the way these articles always depict men as such idiotic hound dogs you wonder why any woman would want one within a\u00a050-yard radius of her, the real question is: \u200bhow much longer will some \u200bwomen fall for this outdated narrative, when all evidence in their lives disproves it? Discussions of single women copy and paste Austen\u2019s anachronistic depiction of the sexes \u2013 helplessly passive women versus mysteriously evasive men \u2013 without seeing her wider point, which is that dating has always been a drag, for women and men. Finding someone is hard. And yet the human race continues to perpetuate, and no amount of gender generalisations (women all want to settle down!) and biological essentialism (men need to spread their seed!) can refute that.   Related: Hadley Freeman: the trouble with Caitlyn Jenner    The truly unique thing about western women\u2019s current situation is not how Tinder (maybe) affected their Friday night, but that they have more control over their lives than ever, choosing to start families later, if at all, to pursue their careers and their lives. Lizzy Bennet could only dream of\u00a0these freedoms, but too many women waste this liberty\u00a0by falling for the misogynistic line that not to be married at 30 is\u00a0a\u00a0crisis.\u00a0Speaking as someone who was single for most of my 20s and had children at 37, to have a bit of independence and life under your belt before being subsumed into domesticity is not exactly a disaster. In this regard, things are pretty great now for women. True, this inconvenient fact can\u2019t be spun into yet another scaremongering article designed to annoy readers. But then, as we are constantly told, we gals can\u2019t have everything.",
