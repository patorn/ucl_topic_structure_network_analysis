  "body": "When he had to mark Willy Roy, Milwaukee Bavarians center-back Bob Gansler realized he was poised for an epic battle with the Chicago Hansa center-forward. \u201cWe locked horns all the time,\u201d Gansler said. \u201cHe was a handful. He was strong, he was fast. His balance was very good. You couldn\u2019t knock him off the ball and all of that was immense. \u201cWhat put him beyond people was that \u2026 it wasn\u2019t just physical. He had a drive. He was very confident. He never used up all of the humility that was apportioned to him. But that\u2019s good because goalscorers need to be confident and he was that. He worked and he worked hard.\u201d In other words, Roy was relentless, all 6ft and 172lbs of him. You\u2019re not familiar with the name Willy Roy? Well, before there was Landon Donovan (57 goals), Clint Dempsey (49), Eric Wynalda (34) and Jozy Altidore (33), there was Roy, who set a couple of US national team goal standards back in the day, some four and five decades ago. Roy was a standout when the US national team was nowhere near being the Concacaf power and respected side it is today as it struggled during World Cup qualifying. Yet that never deterred the German-born forward, who scored nine times in 20 international matches from 1965 to 1973. That\u2019s a 45% strike rate, outstanding production at any level. Roy was the team\u2019s all-time scoring leader when he retired internationally.     Roy\u2019s nine goals in 20 games was a USA record \u2013 at least for a time. Photograph: Courtesy of Willy Roy    Roy remembered some words of wisdom from Alan Rogers, his first professional coach on the Chicago Spurs in the old National Professional Soccer League, forerunner of the North American Soccer League. \u201cHe told me: \u2018If you\u2019re going to score goals you\u2019re going to start. If you didn\u2019t score you\u2019re going to sit on the bench,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t have much of a choice. I worked pretty hard and tried to help the team by scoring goals and saying on the field.\u201d In marked contrast to today, where there is a pool of players performing in Major League Soccer and overseas, the USA had to look under rocks for talent. Roy was \u201cdiscovered\u201d while playing for his semi-pro Hansa team during the 1965 Lamar Hunt/US Open Cup, helping his side overcome the Milwaukee Bavarians and LA Kickers before losing to the New York Ukrainians in the final. \u201cI guess that\u2019s when people started to notice I was scoring goals,\u201d said Roy, who was invited to national team tryouts. Those tryouts were several games between teams from the midwest, far west and east. Roy continued what he did best and was named to the team. US Soccer wasn\u2019t as organized or rolling in money in those days. Any sort of training camps prior to matches were rare, though there was one in Bermuda before 1966 World Cup qualifying. \u201cBut after that it was pretty much a lot of the same guys. We would get a phone call a couple of weeks before the game,\u201d Roy said. \u201cAre you in shape? Are you ready to go? That was basically it.\u201d Roy was placed on the fast track to obtain his US citizenship papers. \u201cThen my mom was kind of ticked off,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018Why did you renounce your German citizenship papers.\u2019 I said: \u2018Mom, I want to play for the US national team. It\u2019s such an honor.\u2019\u201d For a time in 1965, the USA had not one but two men at the coaching helm. \u201cWe had a former bus driver from Chicago, George Meyer. He was named the coach,\u201d Roy said. \u201cWe also had Geza Henni. He was from New York. He was named the coach. When we went to Bermuda, George said: \u2018OK, let\u2019s start jogging at the first practice session.\u2019 Geza said: \u2018No, no, we\u2019re going to walk.\u2019 They forgot to tell either one of these guys who the head coach was. It was kind of comical, actually.\u201d In Estadio Olimpico in Mexico City on 12 March 12 1965, 22-year-old Willy Roy had the honor of putting on the US jersey for the first time as a member of the starting XI in what turned into a 2-0 World Cup qualifying defeat by Mexico. Roy claimed he scored two goals. \u201cFor some stupid reason that I still don\u2019t understand, on one I had a breakaway and I scored,\u201d he said. \u201cSuddenly the whistle [blew] and somebody said I was offside. The whistle should have blown early so I didn\u2019t have to make that 50-, 60-yard run for nothing.\u201d He finally had a reason to celebrate during a 3-3 draw against Israel at Yankee Stadium on 15 September 1968, connecting on his first international to start a three-goal, second-half comeback. Roy remembered that game for a different reason. \u201cIt was at the old Yankee Stadium,\u201d he said. \u201cI was somewhat of a baseball fan and when you talked about Mickey Mantle, you talked about Babe Ruth, you talked about all the icons that used to change in that same dressing room, it was kind of cool.\u201d The next time Roy returned to Yankee Stadium, he on his way to NPSL rookie of the year honors while finishing second in scoring (17 goals, five assists) in 1967. The next time Roy returned to Mexico City in 1972, he made history, becoming the first US player to score at Azteca Stadium \u2013 off a header \u2013 in a 3-1 WCQ loss to the Mexicans on 3 September 1972. \u201dThe only unfortunate thing, it was again on the honor system. We did have a couple of guys who reported to the game and they were injured,\u201d he said. \u201cIt didn\u2019t help the cause at all. \u201cIf we had some preparation, if we played an exhibition game before that, and get the team together \u2026 who knows how much better our team would have done? It seemed that every time a World Cup qualifier came there were different guys you never played with and they never saw you play. I give credit to my teammates, just coming in kind of cold, saying, \u2018Hello, how are you? OK, let\u2019s put on the uniforms and let\u2019s go play.\u2019 \u201cIt was easier playing with your club team, because you played with them, you practiced with them, which we didn\u2019t do. The reason was probably the United States Soccer Federation at that time really didn\u2019t have any money. It was pretty much try to get these games in and hope for the best.\u201d The Mexican match was the middle of a three-game span over 13 days in which Roy tallied qualifying goals. He scored in a 2-2 draw with Canada on 29 August and again vs El Tri in a 2-1 loss in Los Angeles on 10 September. That standard lasted until 2000, when Cobi Jones tallied in three successive qualifiers. Roy admitted he didn\u2019t realize he had set a record. \u201cIt never really dawned on me,\u201d Roy said. \u201cI didn\u2019t really keep track of that at all.\u201d His toughness as a striker might probably was forged when he grew. Roy and his family did not have it easy. He was born in Treuberg, East Prussia, which is now Germany, on 3 February 1943, in the middle of the second world war. Two years later, Roy\u2019s family was uprooted from its farm during the Soviet Union advance. His family wound up living in small huts on an island for four years before his father, a member of the Germany army, was released from PoW camp. \u201cHe was one of the lucky ones stationed in Italy, so when the war was over, he was actually released,\u201d Roy said. \u201cThat was the good part.\u201d His family emigrated to the USA in 1956 and settled in Chicago. \u201cBecause my dad was in the German army, they probably did a total background check probably five times or 10 times to make sure he was not involved in the Hitler movement,\u201d Roy said. But even a decade later there was anti-Nazi sentiment as Roy fought with other school children who called him \u201cLittle Nazi\u201d or \u201cLittle Hitler.\u201d \u201dThere were some ringleaders in the school who thought it was kind of fun [to bully me] until I straightened out the ringleader \u2013 and from that point on I was kind of like their best buddy.\u201d Roy took up another sport that hasn\u2019t been associated with the beautiful game \u2013 wrestling. His high school did not have a soccer team as Roy began playing at the club level when he was 15. He won a state wrestling championship and earned a scholarship to the University of Illinois, where he secured Big Ten and All-American honors. \u201cI also screwed up my knee,\u201d he said. \u201cI had water on my both of knees that came back consistently. When they drained your knee, the doctors probably used needles that they used for horses and elephants. It really bothered me. I started looking more to club soccer.\u201d That\u2019s when Roy joined Hansa and staged those epic battles with Gansler, who etched his name into the history books decades later, directing the USA to its first World Cup for the first time in 40 years in 1990. \u201cIn the box, he would find a way to get a shot to get a goal,\u201d Gansler said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have a 36-inch vertical, but he got the headed balls. He was strong and he was quick and he was relentless. \u201cWilly never made a bad play and that\u2019s a good attribute for a goalscorer. If you pined on the fact that you skied one and killed the birds in the trees behind the goal, Willy didn\u2019t have that problem. Willy just went on to the next one. You got to have it going for you that you have a short memory.\u201d Roy said: \u201cI just enjoyed scoring goals. Wrestling helped me with my aggressiveness that I really was not afraid in a duel to try to outjump two, three defenders when it came to scoring goals via a head ball.\u201d But nothing lasts forever, and age and injuries finally caught up to Roy, who eventually became coach of the Chicago Sting. He guided the club to a pair of NASL titles, besting the Cosmos in a shootout win in 1981 before the Sting captured the league\u2019s final crown in 1984 before the original incarnation of the league closed up shop. \u201cThe Cosmos had 10 times the size of our budget,\u201d he said. The 1981 Sting scored a league-high 84 goals, boasting the likes of Karl-Heinz Granitza (19 goals, 17 assists), Arno Steffenhagen (17 goals, 10 assists) and Pato Margetic (eight goals, 17 assists). \u201cMy philosophy was very simple,\u201d Roy said. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to make mistakes, let\u2019s make mistakes in front of our opponent\u2019s goal. Let\u2019s not make them in front of our goal. Maybe because I had played striker. It\u2019s a lot more exciting to see 20 shots on goal instead of three. I was able to get the players who could actually do that. Defensively we were pretty much a solid team, as New York found out.\u201d Roy, now 73, received deserved recognition for his accomplishments in 1989, when he was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame. \u201cAt least I was there when I was inducted. When you think of players, like Ron Santo with the [Chicago] Cubs, who was inducted [into baseball\u2019s Hall of Fame] after he died, that wouldn\u2019t have much of a meaning, except for the family members that are still alive,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that part was really enjoyable. It was very cool.\u201d",
