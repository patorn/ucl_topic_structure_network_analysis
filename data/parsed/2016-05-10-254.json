  "body": "Sadiq Khan, the new mayor of London, has rebuffed Donald Trump\u2019s suggestion that he could be an exception to Trump\u2019s proposed policy to ban all Muslims from travelling to the United States. Khan, the capital\u2019s first Muslim mayor, said the call by the presumptive Republican nominee for president for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the US was something that directly affected those closest to him, and said making an exception for him was not the answer. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just about me \u2013 it\u2019s about my friends, my family and everyone who comes from a background similar to mine, anywhere in the world,\u201d Khan said.           New London mayor slams Donald Trump: \u2018I think he has ignorant views\u2019     \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s ignorant view of Islam could make both our countries less safe \u2013 it risks alienating mainstream Muslims around the world and plays into the hands of the extremists. Donald Trump and those around him think that western liberal values are incompatible with mainstream Islam \u2013 London has proved him wrong.\u201d Trump told the New York Times on Monday that he was happy to see Khan elected as mayor of London last week. \u201cThere will always be exceptions,\u201d he said of his proposed temporary ban on Muslims.   Related: Donald Trump: ban all Muslims entering US    Of Khan\u2019s election, he said: \u201cI think it\u2019s a very good thing, and I hope he does a very good job because frankly that would be very, very good. Because I think if he does a great job, it will really \u2014 you lead by example, always lead by example. If he does a good job and frankly if he does a great job, that would be a terrific thing.\u201d Khan has disparaged Trump\u2019s racially charged campaign, comparing it to the much-criticised tactics of his defeated Conservative rival Zac Goldsmith, who sought to draw attention to platforms Khan had shared with Muslim extremists.  He told the Observer: \u201cThey used fear and innuendo to try to turn different ethnic and religious groups against each other \u2013 something straight out of the Donald Trump playbook.\u201d Trump\u2019s proposed ban on Muslim visitors to the US, posed in the wake of the Islamist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino last year, was roundly condemned by both US and world leaders, with his then-Republican rival Jeb Bush calling it \u201cunhinged\u201d and David Cameron calling the real estate mogul \u201cdivisive, stupid and wrong\u201d.           Friend to foe: Trump\u2019s ugly descent into anti-Muslim rhetoric    Khan said this week he wanted to go to the US to share ideas with Bill de Blasio, the mayor of New York and a fellow affordable housing advocate, and Rahm Emanuel, Barack Obama\u2019s former chief of staff who is now mayor of Chicago, but quipped that he would have to visit before January in case Trump won the election. \u201cIf Donald Trump becomes the president I\u2019ll be stopped from going there by virtue of my faith, which means I can\u2019t engage with American mayors and swap ideas,\u201d he told Time magazine. He may expect a warmer reception if Trump\u2019s Democrat rival, Hillary Clinton, is elected. The former secretary of state was one of the first world leaders to congratulate Khan on his victory last week, tweeting: \u201cSon of a Pakistani bus driver, champion of workers\u2019 rights and human rights, and now Mayor of London. Congrats Sadiq Khan.\u201d    Son of a Pakistani bus driver, champion of workers' rights and human rights, and now Mayor of London. Congrats, @SadiqKhan. -H\u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) May 7, 2016",
