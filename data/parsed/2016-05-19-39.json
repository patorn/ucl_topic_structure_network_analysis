His electorate of Dickson on the northern fringe of Brisbane, which spans outer suburban \u201caspirational\u201d areas such as Strathpine to the well-to-do semi-rural retreat of Samford Valley, has the distinction of boasting one of the lowest levels of voter engagement in all of Queensland, according to past internal Labor polling. Dutton is on the national media radar after saying refugees were often not \u201cnumerate or literate in their own language, let alone English\u201d and would \u201clanguish on unemployment queues\u201d or take \u201cAustralian jobs\u201d. But despite coming under attack from quarters including the TV personality Karl Stefanovic, who branded Dutton\u2019s comments \u201cun-Australian\u201d, name recognition remains low in Dickson.

He seems like a normal guy.\u201d Dutton is often seen buying his flowers and coffee in Samford Valley but his electorate office is in Strathpine. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a visible office at all,\u201d says local barber shop owner Marty Flanegan. \u201cNot that I want to see or hear of them anyway. \u201cThe only time I pick up his name on the side of the building is when I slow down in traffic. What\u2019s he minister of anyway? OK. Right. Nah, I didn\u2019t even know that.\u201d Dickson was identified early in the campaign by a team of political scientists at Griffith university as a key marginal in a suite of Queensland seats which could decide the election outcome. Despite Dutton being \u201cat risk\u201d, making comments which come under spirited attack from a TV host commanding some of the best ratings in the country doesn\u2019t make him any more so. Not when it\u2019s on border protection, and not in Dickson, according to Sara Davies, an associate professor at the university who specialises in asylum policy, and lives in the electorate. Davies assesses Dutton as a \u201cweak performer\u201d in public debates and \u201cnot the sort of person you would have door-knocking all over the place\u201d. But there\u2019s little chance of Dutton\u2019 remarks costing him votes in a conservative stronghold like Samford, in part because of that lack of voter engagement.   Related: Fact check: was Peter Dutton right about 'illiterate' refugees 'taking jobs'?    But the swinging centre which will decide Dickson are mostly over in the more \u201caspirational\u201d suburbs around Strathpine, where border protection has previously rated highly among voter concerns and where such rhetoric could hit the mark, Davies says, and is a risk worth taking. If Dickson eludes Dutton\u2019s grasp \u2013 and he\u2019s narrowly escaped defeat before \u2013 it won\u2019t be perceived \u201cdog whistles\u201d that call his constituents\u2019 tune. \u201cWell, he\u2019s right,\u201d says Ron, a retired soldier who opposes accepting more refugees.   \u201cIf they haven\u2019t been to school before they come here, they haven\u2019t got education in their own language. Where they are in the detention centres, they\u2019re not going to get a decent education anyway because they don\u2019t want to. As far as taking jobs away from Australians, the best person for the job is the right one.\u201d Offshore detention for asylum seekers who arrive by boat \u2013 the guts of both Coalition and Labor policies \u2013 is \u201cas good as it can get at this stage\u201d, he says. Not that people he knows think about it much, Ron says, and then \u201conly when it\u2019s splashed over the news\u201d. But it\u2019s something else that bugs Ron about Dutton.

This guy, I\u2019ve seen him once, and as soon as he was finished speaking he was gone,\u2019 Ron says. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me who I\u2019m going to vote for. It\u2019ll be a flip of a coin and hopefully it will stand on its edge.\u201d Cindy, a social worker from Warner, knows who Dutton is \u2013 she works two doors down from his office. She knows his portfolio, too, and says this seems to divert his concerns from his own backyard. \u201cI don\u2019t see him doing too much about the issues in this area. Employment matters, and we need more public housing and housing affordability,\u201d she says. And Cindy, who is Indigenous, had heard the refugee comments. \u201cI just think it\u2019s ignorant and scaremongering,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve recently been to uni with a lot of people who are refugees and they\u2019ve got degrees from their own country that aren\u2019t accepted here, so they\u2019re going back to study. I don\u2019t see many illiterate people.\u201d Cindy is comfortable with lifting refugee intake \u201cbut we have to do it in a way that makes it inclusive \u2013 we don\u2019t want to just dump them in an area and say \u2018fend for yourselves\u2019,\u201d she says. Flanegan, the barber, says Dutton\u2019s refugee comments will \u201cdefinitely get a mixed response\u201d in the area, but he has no idea what people think about offshore detention. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop people coming in but they\u2019ve got to come in through the appropriate channels like everyone else,\u201d he says, adding that he liked the willingness of new Australians to do jobs that others would not. The things on his mind include the empty shopfronts up and down the main drag leading from his shop to Dutton\u2019s office. And things that a small business like his \u201cdoesn\u2019t need\u201d, such as provisional tax, and that annoying thing known as multinational corporate tax avoidance.  He\u2019d also like to hire a second apprentice and get a decent holiday sometime, noting that while the Liberal-National Coalition is the traditional party for small business, they have indulged in \u201cthe big switcheroo\u201d in prime ministers just like Labor before it, inspiring confidence in neither.

Blake, a small business owner in Samford Valley, does not immediately recall the name of his local MP. But he observes he\u2019s surrounded by not a very disparate group of nationalities and a lot of rusted-on LNP supporters who will not be disturbed by Dutton\u2019s comments about refugees. He sees the link between such comments and the cultivation of racism. \u201cPeople that say refugees are taking their jobs, I know they don\u2019t intentionally mean it, but they actually breed a bit of racism,\u201d he says. \u201cIf people really think they are good at their job, they shouldn\u2019t have to worry about their job being taken away. It\u2019s a bit of a call for us to raise our game.\u201d Blake says his main view on politics is that both Labor and the LNP are guaranteed to disappoint in office. \u201cI just think that these days people need to start taking things into their own hands and that includes the education system and their own health,\u201d he says. It\u2019s the language of retreat from politics and lots of people in Dickson speak it, even as they hold the fate of one of the Turnbull government\u2019s most contentious figures in their hands.
