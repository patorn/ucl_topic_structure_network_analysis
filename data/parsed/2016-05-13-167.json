  "body": "Kezia Dugdale has challenged the Scottish National party to make the positive case for Europe as she formally launched the Labour In for Scotland campaign with its UK chair, Alan Johnson. Speaking with Dugdale in Edinburgh, Johnson said he had never known such solidarity on a single issue, saying: \u201cScottish Labour, Welsh Labour and UK Labour, the leader, the shadow cabinet, the parliamentary party, to the affiliated unions, to the constituency parties, to the campaigners on the doorstep \u2013 we speak with one voice.\u201d     The Labour In for Britain chair, Alan Johnson, with Kezia Dugdale at the campaign launch. Photograph: Danny Lawson/PA    The Scottish Labour leader suggested that Scots had more of a responsibility to drive the message home, saying: \u201cIf we believe that we are, as a nation in Scotland, more pro-European than our neighbours across the United Kingdom, then perhaps there\u2019s a greater responsibility on us in Scotland to make the positive case for Europe. \u201cI wish the SNP would do more of this because all I\u2019ve heard them do so far is be really negative about how the campaign has been rather than set out the arguments from their perspective about why we should remain part of the European Union. I think there\u2019s a challenge to the SNP with the strength of the public will that they have behind them to make the case for Europe in Scotland and across the UK.\u201d Dugdale told the gathering of party activists there was no room for complacency and that the referendum campaign gave party activists an opportunity to stand up for what they believe in after last week\u2019s \u201cpainful defeat\u201d in the Holyrood election. \u201cDon\u2019t listen to those who say that Scotland is going to vote overwhelmingly to remain in the EU on 23 June,\u201d she said. \u201cWe may be weary as a nation after three national campaigns in as many years, but we need to do it all over again in the next few weeks.\u201d Referring to \u201ceerie echoes\u201d of the independence referendum campaign in the current arguments around EU membership, she said lessons should be learned. \u201cSo in this debate we must win the arguments that appeal to the head, but remember that they have to be combined with a story that reaches people\u2019s hearts,\u201d she said. Stressing the importance of workers\u2019 rights gained from EU membership, Johnson said: \u201cThe Brexiteers are not looking to come out of Europe to prevent workers\u2019 exploitation. They talk about red tape and never say what it means but they mean workers\u2019 rights.\u201d He said an exit vote \u201cwill fire the starting gun on a race to the bottom: a Britain of low wages, unsafe workplaces and a bonfire of workers\u2019 rights\u201d.  However, Sturgeon immediately responded to Dugdale\u2019s challenge on Twitter, insisting her party was already making a positive case for the EU.       At her monthly press conferences at Bute House on Tuesday, Sturgeon was asked whether the SNP\u2019s campaign would be stepped up now that the Holyrood election was over. She said: \u201cWe will set out over the course of the remaining weeks of the campaign the reasons \u2013 not just the economic and business reasons, important though they are, but the social and employment and cultural reasons why I think it\u2019s right that Scotland remains a member of the European Union.\u201d She would not say when the Scottish government\u2019s promised pamphlets and analysis of the case for voting to remain would be published. The official remain campaign, Scotland Stronger In, is pragmatic about how important Scotland\u2019s larger pro-EU vote could be if English votes weighed against remain.",
