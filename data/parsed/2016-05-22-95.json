  "body": "David Cameron has in effect accused leave campaigners, including his own defence minister, Penny Mordaunt, of lying about the prospect of Turkey joining the EU.  The prime minister said his Conservative colleague had made \u201ca very misleading claim\u201d when she said Britain would not be able to stop the accession of new countries into the EU. \u201cShe is absolutely wrong. Let me be clear, Britain and every other country in the EU has a veto on another country joining. That is a fact,\u201d said Cameron, in an interview on ITV\u2019s Peston on Sunday. \u201cThe fact that the leave campaign are getting things as straightforward as this wrong should call into judgment the bigger argument about leaving the EU.\u201d He said out campaigners were trying to persuade people to vote for Brexit solely on the back of an issue \u201cthat is not true\u201d.      Penny Mordaunt on BBC1\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show. Photograph: Jeff Overs/BBC/PA    His comments followed an interview with Mordaunt on The Andrew Marr Show, in which she said the way the migrant crisis was being handled was speeding up the accession of Turkey, in particular, but other countries as well. Asked if Britain had a veto on the issue, Mordaunt replied: \u201cNo it doesn\u2019t.\u201d She then argued: \u201cI do not think that the EU is going to keep Turkey out. I think it is going to join. I think the migrant crisis is pushing it more that way.\u201d She argued that if the expansion policy was being pursued then Britain needed the \u201ctools to protect our national security\u201d, which were not currently available. And in an attack that appeared to be aimed at Cameron, she agreed when asked if the remain campaign was \u201can establishment stitch-up\u201d.   Related: Vote Leave embroiled in race row over Turkey security threat claims    \u201cI think the public are seeing through this and I think that at moments in our history \u2013 1939, 1982 \u2013 we have gone against the orthodoxy of the establishment. We have stood up and said no, we are not going to be a nation of followers, we are going to be a nation of leaders and that\u2019s what we need to happen in this referendum.\u201d She accused her opponents of scaremongering and said it was a \u201cshame that there are a lot of people who want us to be frightened right now\u201d.  Cameron hit back, arguing that Mordaunt was doing a good job in the Ministry of Defence, \u201cbut on this question of whether or not we have a veto, the leave campaign are wrong\u201d. \u201cIt is not remotely on the cards that Turkey is going to join the EU any time soon. They applied in 1987. At the current rate of progress, they will probably get round to joining in about the year 3000.\u201d Leave campaigners pointed out that in recent years the prime minister had made positive arguments in favour of Turkey\u2019s accession, including during a visit to the country in 2010.  Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Vote Leave, said: \u201cDavid Cameron has said he wants to pave the road to Ankara and has repeatedly confirmed it is government policy for Turkey to join the EU. The EU is speeding up the process of Turkey joining and we are paying nearly \u00a32bn to help make it happen. If it isn\u2019t on the cards why are taxpayers footing the bill for it already?\u201d David Owen, the former foreign secretary, added: \u201cOnly nine weeks ago David Cameron committed the country at the European council to re-energise the accession process of Turkey into the EU. The EU is continuing the preparatory work for Turkey at an accelerating pace with all of this going forward in parallel.\u201d Asked about the pressure the battle was putting on the Conservative party, and in particular Boris Johnson calling his points \u201cdemented\u201d, Cameron said he was remaining focused on the arguments. \u201cBoris is hugely capable in lots of ways but I\u2019m not going to go into Boris today,\u201d said the prime minister. Cameron said he believed the government and Conservative party would reunite at the end of the campaign and focus on its legislation agenda but admitted that the result of the June referendum was high stakes. \u201cWhat is a more important decision \u2013 a general election or this Europe vote? Actually the Europe vote is more important because if you don\u2019t like the government, you can always get rid of them in five years\u2019 time. \u201cWhereas if we make this decision to leave the EU, and get out of the single market and hit our economy and hit jobs it would be very, very difficult if not impossible to reverse that decision.\u201d Asked about Conservative succession and whether George Osborne should be the next leader, Cameron said: \u201cWe have been working together for the last 11 years. I think he is a man of great talent. I am not going to pick my successor. The Conservative party will do that. But George is hugely talented, a brilliant chancellor of the exchequer. In politics you have to have partnerships, you have to have teamwork. Prime ministers do not do this on their own.\u201d    Great to join @HarrietHarman at @Asda in Hayes. We are clear - prices will rise if we leave the EU. #StrongerIn. pic.twitter.com/78vPDrnL4L\u2014 David Cameron (@David_Cameron) May 22, 2016    The interview came after Cameron appeared at an event at a west London Asda with Labour\u2019s Harriet Harman, in order to warn that Brexit could push up the price of people\u2019s grocery shopping.  The Guardian\u2019s Gaby Hinsliff pointed out that the prime minister\u2019s tweet \u2013 \u201cgreat to join @harrietharman at @Asda in Hayes\u201d \u2013 was probably something he had never imagined saying.  Cameron and Harman claimed that family shopping could rise by \u00a3220 a year after a vote to leave, as a result of a fall in sterling.  The finding will be included in a Treasury report to be published on Monday, which also shows a potential decline in house prices. \u201cIndependent studies show that a vote to leave would hit the value of the pound, making imports more expensive and raising prices in the shops,\u201d said the prime minister. Andy Clarke, the Asda president, agreed that there would be uncertainty for prices, which is why the supermarket was calling for a vote to remain.  Former chief executive of Waitrose, Mark Price, said: \u201cWhile retailers make individual decisions on pricing in their stores, there is an established link between the sterling exchange rate and prices in shops.\u201d The potential of higher tariffs post Brexit could have an additional effect, he added. In the interview, Cameron rejected the claim that the Treasury could not possibly forecast the level of detail on issues such as house prices and food bills. \u201cThe reason why our economy would be less well off is relatively straightforward \u2013 we are part of a market of 500 million, the leave campaign want us to come out of that market \u2026 that will make us poorer as a country,\u201d he said, adding that it would clearly impact on sterling. He said leave campaigners had in effect concluded that the economic hit was a price worth paying, something they reject.",
