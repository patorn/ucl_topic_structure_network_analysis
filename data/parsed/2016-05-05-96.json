  "body": "Last year, Stephen Frears had\u00a0a man round for tea. His name was Simon Helberg, and Frears had just cast him as an accompanist in his new film, about a howlingly awful operatic soprano in 1940s New York who somehow still managed to sell out Carniege Hall faster than Frank Sinatra. Frears needed someone who could play\u00a0piano as well as act \u2013 his composer, Alexandre Desplat, tipped him off about Helberg. A happy meeting with the film\u2019s star, Meryl Streep (\u201cI just think he fell from heaven,\u201d she explains), cemented the deal. Anyway, after tea, Frears took his young protege for a stroll round Notting Hill. \u201cPeople came out of their houses just to stare at him,\u201d the director remembers. \u201cThey were wide-eyed. They couldn\u2019t believe he was here. It was then I thought: \u2018That show really is\u00a0popular \u2026\u2019\u201d That show is The Big Bang Theory, the long-running US sitcom about science nerds that is watched by about 15 million people each week \u2013 few of them of an age to be the target market for Florence Foster Jenkins.           Stephen Frears on Florence Foster Jenkins: \u2018Killed by critics! A feeling I know well\u2019    Frears may not have known it, but shooting those 200-plus episodes had trained Helberg to be something of a secret comedy weapon \u2013 and a virtuoso scene-stealer. Florence Foster Jenkins may feature Streep being lowered bleating from the ceiling dressed as \u201ca\u00a0very naughty Walkyrie\u201d, and a career-best performance from Hugh Grant as her husband, St Clair Bayfield, an ex-thesp who promotes her questionable success. But it is Helberg \u2013 as Cosm\u00e9 McMoon, witness to multiple musical massacres \u2013 who hoovers up the laughs. Why? Because he plays McMoon as a walking, goggling exclamation mark, a cartoon made flesh, a fabulously expressive face wobbling atop a skinny frame (McMoon was an unlikely weightlifter). That Frears and his editor fill their film with quite so many reaction shots \u2013 Cosm\u00e9 aghast, Cosm\u00e9 wincing, Cosm\u00e9 wrestling with the prospect of intense embarrassment to come \u2013 is testimony to Helberg\u2019s talent, and their good taste. \u201cThe flop-sweat was very natural,\u201d says Helberg, on a sofa, with the hint of a giggle. \u201cThat feeling of being out of my element, scared and in awe. All I really do in the movie is watch what series of notes she\u2019s going to butcher; try to guess how\u00a0she\u2019s going to tumble down that mountain.\u201d His biggest movie role to date was as the ineffectual junior rabbi in the Coen brothers\u2019 A Serious Man. In\u00a0Florence Foster Jenkins, he seems to\u00a0have channelled his quivering consciousness of the career boost straight on to set.     Helberg as Cosm\u00e9 McMoon and Hugh Grant as St Clair Bayfield in Florence Foster Jenkins    Grant confirms this edginess. \u201cI\u00a0didn\u2019t think it was humanly possible to\u00a0be more neurotic as an actor than me,\u201d he says. \u201cSimon proved me wrong. I introduced him to my panic bag \u2013 pills, inhalers, unguents.\u201d But Helberg proves much less antic and camp than anticipated. He is restrained, frontless company: clever, composed, serious even, behind the fine beak and popping eyes. The film is an ethical tangle as well as easy entertainment. We laugh at the leading lady \u2013 a vainglorious socialite with scant self-consciousness whose godawful wailing became one of the first examples of ironic appreciation by the public \u2013 yet we must also like her and those enabling her delusion. Helberg flags the tightrope the film dances, and is eager to stress its affection.   Related: Silver-screen underdogs: why cinema loves a loser    \u201cAll of our intentions were to celebrate the life of this person, the passion of [this] amateur. That idea of dreaming big and failing bigger. Sometimes there\u2019s success in those passionate failures.\u201d Yet Florence\u2019s self-identification as an artist, despite her lack of talent, surely smacks of the dregs of America\u2019s Got Talent. Not really, says Helberg. His preferred adjectives are \u201cpure\u201d and \u201cjoyous\u201d. \u201cPeople lose too much of that along the way. It\u2019s something we see in children: doing something because you love it, before there\u2019s any judgment from other people, when it\u2019s coming from some place of honesty. And I think that\u2019s why people did like her: that purity. She sang to the heavens.\u201d Surely living with such delusion isn\u2019t healthy? Helberg\u2019s not convinced. \u201cYou see a little kid belt out a song from Rent or perform a little monologue. They usually don\u2019t ask how it was, because they\u2019re doing it for the joy. And Florence didn\u2019t really ask anybody because she wasn\u2019t really interested. And it was real \u2013 it wasn\u2019t a joke or a hidden-camera prank. It would have been different if at the end somebody had sat her down and said: \u2018You fool! No one likes you.\u2019\u201d     The perfect accompanist: Helberg at the piano in Florence Foster Jenkins    That no one did was not only down to love, however. Critics\u2019 tickets came with banknotes. Jenkins\u2019s philanthropy meant it was beneficial for everyone, husband included, to stay in her favour. \u201cShe spoils us all, doesn\u2019t she,\u201d one conductor pointedly remarks to St Clair. Again, Helberg leaps to cheerlead for his diva. \u201cIf it was purely selfish, opportunistic exploitation, I think it would be unacceptable and unwatchable. I also don\u2019t think it was only money. Bowie named her in his top 25 albums. The audience were swinging from the chandeliers. Everyone around her benefitted.\u201d And, in fact, one man did give it to her straight: a reviewer, played by Christian McKay, who refused to be bought off. The spectacle of seeing her sing, he says, is \u201cunforgivable\u201d, not just because it risks her humiliation but because it mocks music itself. I had watched the film feeling him to be the one man of honour \u2013 this, it turns out, was more projection than intent. McKay\u2019s character was, says Frears, at best \u201cinappropriate\u201d and at worst \u201chorrible\u201d. Helberg thinks it\u2019s \u201cmore noble to stand up on the stage than write about it\u201d \u2013 whatever it is that you write. Anyway, critics, schmitics, right? \u201cWith art, it\u2019s not an empirical truth,\u201d Helberg nods. \u201cIt\u2019s just people\u2019s perceptions.\u201d But then he backtracks: \u201cIf I\u2019m awful, don\u2019t ever tell me.\u201d Truth is, he envies Florence\u2019s attitude. \u201cI\u2019m deeply insecure. I ask my wife all the time: \u2018Was that OK? Are people lying?\u2019 I\u2019m not as happily oblivious as I\u2019d like.\u201d Helberg was born in California 35 years ago, the son of an actor and a casting director. Not only has he been in the business almost as long as he has been alive, he has always been in the business of comedy: sketches as a young man, bit parts in broad farces through his 20s. A couple of years ago he made and starred in We\u2019ll Never Have Paris, a\u00a0bouncy, low-budget romcom about a\u00a0botched marriage proposal. He co-directed, too, alongside his wife, Jocelyn, with whom he has two young children (the film was their story).     Helberg (centre) as Howard Wolowitz in The Big Bang Theory. Photograph: Channel 4    Other parts, he says, have been harder to secure; hence him writing his own. How much Howard Wolowitz, the tight-fitting geek with whom he is \u2013 for everyone under 30 \u2013 now inextricably associated, will dominate his career is yet to be seen. Might he be The Big Bang Theory\u2019s Courteney Cox, failing to fully emerge from its shadow, or its Jennifer Aniston, enjoying A-list status ever since? So far, the show\u2019s legacy has been to make him a stern defender of populist entertainment in the face of what he sees as an upsurge in \u201chaughtiness\u201d \u2013 a very Florence calling, that. Added to which, he is a megastar to millennials, who must navigate false flattery in a way Florence failed to do. \u201cIt becomes addictive and toxic. It throws the axis off.\u201d It has also made him the target of the sort of remorseless online abuse that means a phenomenon such as Florence would be impossible today. These days, he is dormant on Twitter because it \u201ctriggered too much\u201d, made him feel like he was back in high school, too much of an \u201copen wound\u201d, at the mercy of those who \u201cget off on the power of being able to affect someone who seems impenetrable. They put celebrity on a pedestal and all of a sudden they have access to you \u2013 that\u2019s a confusing thing.\u201d He perches further forward on the couch. He and his wife like it here, and in France, he says, because people don\u2019t start by asking your occupation. \u201cIn America, the first thing people say is: \u2018What do you do?\u2019 Here it seems sort of rude. It\u2019s the question that allows someone to define you and know your wealth status and, therefore, level of import.\u201d Social media is the same: it\u2019s self-definition, virtual validation, constant bean-counting of your own worth. \u201cHow many likes did I get for that video of my dog? Three?! It\u2019s the cutest thing he\u2019s ever done! So nobody gives a fuck about my dog. I\u2019ll have to put it to sleep.\u201d Small wonder Helberg is evangelical about a time when the etiquette was to\u00a0be polite about performing animals, no matter how mediocre their tricks. Small wonder he so adores a woman who barely cared. Florence Foster Jenkins is released in the UK on 6 May and in the US on 31 August.",
