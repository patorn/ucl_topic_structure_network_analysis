Their London-based contributing editor was drafted in, the better to elucidate the importance of Pugh, Pugh and Barney McGrew, as was the son-in-law of the show\u2019s 96-year-old creator, whose solitary quote \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not aware of anything\u201d \u2013 winningly suggested a man quite keen to get the bloke from Pitchfork off the phone.  Elsewhere, parallels were drawn between Trumpton and what might become of America were Donald Trump to become president, which feels like rather a harsh judgment on the seemingly benign regime of the mayor and Mr Troop the town clerk.   Related: What do you think of Radiohead's new album? Share your reviews    This all happened because Radiohead had premiered a video based on Trumpton\u2019s stop-frame animation for a compelling mesh of chattering high-maintenance strings and ominous bass and drum thunder called Burn The Witch, the first track to be released from their ninth studio album, A Moon Shaped Pool.  You could possibly accuse the Pitchfork piece of over-thinking things a bit \u2013 it may well be that the band and director Chris Hopewell chose to depict Trumpton-ites immolating a bowler-hatted outsider in a wicker man as \u201ca pointed critique of nativism-embracing leaders across the UK and Europe\u201d, but there\u2019s also the chance they just thought it was funny \u2013 but the fact that it exists at all tells you something about the unique position Radiohead continue to hold.  Artistically at least, these are supposed to be thin times for rock music, particularly rock of the stadium-filling variety. The really important, epochal, provocative stuff \u2013 the music that, to use a ghastly phrase, carries the conversation \u2013 is clearly happening in hip hop and R&B. With one exception: alone among their commercial peers, Radiohead are held to not just release albums but make grand artistic statements worth dissecting and poring over in the same way as the output of Kendrick Lamar or Beyonce. Certainly, no one\u2019s falling over themselves to decode the politics of Coldplay\u2019s releases. Listening to A Moon Shaped Pool, you can see why. However much their style bears certain hallmarks \u2013 Thom Yorke\u2019s keening vocal shiver and what you might charitably describe as a fairly glum bearing among them \u2013 Radiohead have always sounded like a band in constant motion: every album has seemed like an agitated shift from the last, as if they were too neurotic to rest on their laurels even if they wanted to.  Certainly, A Moon Shaped Pool is noticeably different to its predecessor, 2011\u2019s patchy King Of Limbs. You\u2019d hesitate to call it more poppy \u2013 this is still an album on which standard verse-chorus structures are very much subject to subsidence, and on which the instruments buried deep in the mix frequently seem to be playing an entirely different song to those in the foreground \u2013 but it\u2019s certainly sharper and more focused. There\u2019s nothing as slippery and unclear as King Of Limbs\u2019 Bloom or Feral. They seem as fascinated by sonic textures as they do by actual songwriting \u2013 the weirdly uplifting moment towards the end of Ful Stop (sic), when the song\u2019s muffled sound suddenly becomes bright and trebly, as if a DJ has turned the eq knob on his mixer to the right \u2013 but it\u2019s not an album that feels lost in experimentation. The abundance of sonic intrigue is matched by the quantity of beautiful tunes: the fact that True Love Waits, a track that dates back to the less knotty era of their 1995 album The Bends, fits perfectly in the line-up of songs tells you something about their unabashed melodic richness.  There\u2019s something pretty dazzling about the way Tinker Tailor Soldier Sailor combines two of what you might call Radiohead\u2019s extracurricular interests, Jonny Greenwood\u2019s soundtrack work and the electronica Thom Yorke plays when DJing \u2013 soft explosions of white noise and a distorted keyboard line are slowly overwhelmed by a luscious string arrangement \u2013 but there\u2019s something equally dazzling about the plaintively lovely tune that floats over folky acoustic guitar picking and a vaguely Latin shuffle beat on Present Tense.  The simple prettiness of the piano figure that runs through Daydreaming battles it out with unsettling scrapes of backwards vocal that sometimes sound like oblique harmonies, but more often like someone struggling for breath. Identikit, meanwhile, wrongfoots the listener entirely: it initially sounds like a studio jam session that made it on to the album through some kind of clerical error \u2013 snatches of vocal and scrabbling guitar, drums treated with dub reggae effects \u2013 before suddenly pulling into focus: a hook that immediately brands itself on to your brain, an agitated, thrilling guitar solo. It is tempting to say that all this fidgety invention comes as a welcome distraction from the suffocating gloom of the lyrics, cursed as the latter are with a worldview that frequently sees any kind of personal happiness as merely the result of ignorance, wilful or otherwise: \u201cdreamers they never learn\u201d, \u201cwe are helpless to resist\u201d, \u201cI\u2019ll drown my beliefs to your babies\u201d, \u201cwe are happy just to serve\u201d, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing left inside that we all can love \u2026 I don\u2019t want to know\u201d.  That said, you do find yourself wondering if Radiohead\u2019s collective tongue might not occasionally be wedged in their collective cheek, if, as with the video for Burn The Witch, they might not sometimes be parodying their austere image as rock\u2019s premier harbingers of doom.  \u201cDon\u2019t get heavy, keep it light\u201d, offers Present Tense. The introduction to Glass Eyes is a thing of beauty and unalloyed pleasure, played on a piano treated with digital effects until it sounds like it\u2019s been submerged beneath rippling water, at least until Yorke slopes into view, his face like the proverbial slapped arse. \u201cHey, it\u2019s me,\u201d he mournfully intones and immediately you think: uh-oh, here we go. And so it proves: \u201ca frightening place, faces are concrete grey \u2026 panic is coming on strong\u201d.     A scene from the Radiohead video Burn the Witch. Photograph: Radiohead/Youtube    If the thought of Radiohead occasionally playing it for LOLs is too mind-blowing to bear, you\u2019ll have to content yourself with the occasional chinks of light amid the murk.  There\u2019s Desert Island Disk with its suggestion that \u201cdifferent types of love are possible\u201d and The Numbers, which is also that rarest of things, a Radiohead track that doesn\u2019t just vaguely resemble another artist\u2019s work (anyone still intent on depicting Radiohead as a latterday Pink Floyd might feel their ears prick up at Decks Dark\u2019s burst of Atom Heart Mother-ish choral vocals) but actually seems to be a direct and obvious homage to something else, or possibly two things: the resemblance of the tumbling piano parts to those on John Martyn\u2019s 1971 instrumental Glistening Glyndebourne might be purely coincidental, but the similarity of the intense orchestration, circling bassline and loose-limbed funk rhythm to Melody, the opening track of Serge Gainsbourg\u2019s 1970 Historie De Melody Nelson, definitely is not. They\u2019re certainly not the first people to mine that song\u2019s arrangement for inspiration, but it says something about Radiohead\u2019s inventiveness that they can warp music already plundered by everyone from Beck to Belle and Sebastian into something that sounds entirely their own. Moreover, the high-drama swells of strings fit the lyrical message. Radiohead\u2019s previous attempts at creating a rousing call to arms have been hobbled by their innate pessimism, as exemplified by 2001\u2019s You and Whose Army?, on which Thom Yorke somehow contrived to sound utterly deflated while offering Tony Blair out for a punch-up in time-honoured \u201ccome on then\u201d style. Here, however, the stuff about how the future is inside us and people have the power sounds authentically stirring. It also sounds like Radiohead achieving something they\u2019ve never achieved before, a quarter of a century into their career: long may their neuroses keep them in constant motion.",
