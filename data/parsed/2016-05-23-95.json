With all 15 performance sold out, it seems they may have found the formula for box-office success: it is directed by the Oscar\u00ad-winning film-maker Sofia Coppola, making her opera directorial debut, and the costumes are by Valentino. Verdi\u2019s opera, which centres on the fate of the tragic courtesan Violetta, was considered a good fit for Coppola, whose films have often been concerned with psychologically isolated women. Indeed, the sugary Versailles seen in her 2006 movie Marie Antoinette might have inspired a refreshing take on this oft\u00ad-performed opera. But Coppola\u2019s torpid and traditional reading of La Traviata has little to distinguish it from any routine production to be found in any provincial theatre. Set designs are courtesy of Nathan Crowley, who created sprawling sets for two Batman films, but here he seems wasted. Act two\u2019s summerhouse setting is unimaginatively twee and the projected rural backdrop upon which dark clouds gather as the plot becomes gloomier is too subtle to make much impact. A floating faux\u00ad marble staircase serves as a runway for Violetta on several occasions but otherwise has little practical function and merely looks incongruous. Valentino\u2019s dresses for Violetta, however, are spectacular, from a black gown with long peacock trail to a shimmying white number. But they only rise above catwalk status to carry dramatic punch in the party scene, when the designer\u2019s trademark \u201cValentino red\u201d contrasts against swarms of black-\u00adclad partygoers.     Dramatic punch \u2026 Coppola\u2019s La Traviata, with trademark costumes by Valentino. Photograph: Yasuko Kageyama/Teatro dell'Opera di Roma    The evening\u2019s biggest disappointment comes from Coppola\u2019s hands\u00ad-off direction. This might create a distinctive naturalism in her films, but here, on the big stage, it has produced park-and-bark renditions. The production is littered with enduring Traviata cliches, from Violetta gripping a bottle of champagne during her hymn to hedonism, to Alfredo clumsily bolting offstage when he hastens to Paris.  A predominantly younger cast provides saving graces. Francesca Dotto\u2019s Violetta evoked pathos in the closing moments and Antonio Poli\u2019s rolling tenor compensated for ill-defined characterisation. But it is the dual presence of Valentino and Coppola that will continue to draw the designer-clad crowds.",
