  "body": "Ramy Alshakarji was still coming to terms with the idea that at last he was safe \u2013 he was leaving Lesbos after all, one of 11 refugees rescued by the pope last month \u2013 when he found himself at the centre of an improbable security crisis. Ramy must have thought he had a broad and visceral understanding of the meaning of security after five years in Syria during which he and his family had been \u201cready to die at any moment, constantly moving because there was constant bombardment\u201d. But at the airport, as he and his wife and their three children passed through the scanners, a panicked flurry broke around them. \u201cIt was our falafel mould,\u201d Ramy smiles. They had brought the metal falafel maker with them from their home in Deir ez-Zor. \u201cBut the Greeks wouldn\u2019t let us take it on the plane. But we were going on the pope\u2019s plane! The Vatican officials told them it had to come \u2026 The Greeks said no. There was a conflict between Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, a diplomatic rift between the Greeks and the Italians. All over our falafel mould.\u201d The Vatican prevailed and the mould has become for the family a more consequential object than Ramy\u2019s wife, Suhila Ayiad, thought when she packed her bag long ago, and her eyes alighted on the small metal instrument tucked inside a package of scissors, needles, thread, \u201call the things I\u2019d need\u201d. For a moment she weighed the space the mould occupied in the bag against its future usefulness. \u201cI thought, \u2018Well, I\u2019ll leave it in there.\u2019\u201d \u201cTo remember,\u201d Ramy says.

Photograph: Filippo Monteforte/AFP/Getty Images    Behind a pair of heavy metal gates in Rome\u2019s Trastevere quarter, where an old hospital sign has faded into the stone wall, lies a language school run by the church of Sant\u2019Egidio. Since its opening in 1982, 60,000 new arrivals to Rome have passed through. It is here that Ramy, 51, and Suhila and their three children, and the pope\u2019s other refugees, come to learn Italian \u2013 \u201cthe key to integration\u201d, according to the Sant\u2019Egidio community \u2013 and where Ramy and Suhila are reliving the airport incident, sitting on a bench while their seven-year-old daughter, Quds, dances around them. The three families have been in Rome for one month, and I speak to two of them. Contrary to some reports, none has spent a night inside the Vatican and live, instead, in a refuge run by Sant\u2019Egidio, a few streets from the school. How are they settling? \u201cWell, actually, it\u2019s been OK,\u201d says Suhila. They eat eastern food \u2013 aubergine for lunch \u2013 they have found the mosque, pray at home, take the kids to school each day, \u201cand the weather is similar to the weather in our country\u201d. Quds has made friends with the Italian daughter of one of the volunteers. \u201cWe have started to feel ourselves adjusting. The world is smiling at us.\u201d \u201cWe just really want to be stable, to resettle. It\u2019s been five years and we haven\u2019t felt ourselves normal,\u201d Ramy says. \u201cIn Syria, for a long time we couldn\u2019t even stand in the window, let alone look out of the window, because you didn\u2019t know where a bullet was coming from.\u201d   Related: Pope Francis takes refugees to Rome after Lesbos visit    Nour Essa, 30, and her husband Hasan Zaheda, 31, were also rescued from Lesbos by the pope, and have a window in the same building as Ramy and Suhila. It\u2019s a palazzo in the square of Santa Maria di Trastevere, to which thousands of tourists daily flock. But when Nour and Hasan stand there \u201cevery day, every day\u201d, and look out at the fountain, listen to the musicians, what they see is their \u201cwhole life in Syria before the war\u201d. The smells are the same, Hasan says. Maybe it is the sweetness of jasmine that is in flower all over the apricot walls in this part of Rome. Or maybe it is because Sant\u2019Egidio reminds him of a church in Bab Touma, Damascus. \u201cIt\u2019s a city full of life. Like Damascus was before,\u201d Nour says. Inside, however, when they step back from the window, the civilisation is very different to the one they knew. Their house in Wadi Barada, 30km outside Damascus, was 120 square metres, with three bedrooms and a small garden. In Trastevere, they live with their two-year-old son Riad in a single room with a double bed. \u201cThe most difficult thing is to have a child in a common home, as you\u2019ve lost somehow control of him, as he is raised with other children,\u201d Nour says. Kitchen and bathroom are shared with neighbours, not all of them refugees, ushered into Rome through the Sant\u2019Egidio charity\u2019s \u201chumanitarian corridor\u201d (donate here), but also Italians in need.

Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi for the Guardian    Unlike Ramy and Suhila, Nour and Hasan brought no treasured object from home, no equivalent of the falafel mould. They left in a hurry after Hasan was called up to fight. Their bags were stuffed with nappies and milk for Riad, who is busily crayoning and crawling under the table while they talk. Beyond underwear, they took only the clothes they were wearing when the emergency vehicle pulled up outside their home one night last December, to carry them on the first leg of their $3,000 smuggled journey. As the pope\u2019s refugees, it would be easy to assume that life for Nour and Hasan \u2013 and the others who boarded the papal plane \u2013 had been instantly solved. But of course it hasn\u2019t. Piece by piece, they are beginning the long job of assembling a new life. Some of the pieces are small and firm and, in time, achievable. Spoons, for instance, Nour says. She has a whole list in her head. \u201cKnives, frying pan, glasses. You have your own kitchen in Damascus. Now you have to buy something to cook in. Clothes. And maybe after that we could buy a laptop.\u201d But other pieces are harder to name and harder to find. In Syria, Nour was a student of microbiology, Hasan a landscape designer. \u201cWe hope to find the same thing here,\u201d Nour says. Aided by the Sant\u2019Egidio community, they have filed their papers requesting refugee status and when \u2013 perhaps in a few months \u2013 they are awarded it (surely a formality, given the papal connection), they will be able to work. But while unemployment has fallen in Italy this year, it remains above 11%. The busiest days at the Sant\u2019Egidio language school are Thursday afternoons and Sundays, when the shops are shut \u2013 because that\u2019s the sort of work most of the school\u2019s attendees do.   Related: Pope Francis hailed as saviour by Syrian refugees taken in by Vatican    \u201cWe haven\u2019t thought about that yet,\u201d Nour says. \u201cBut we in all cases integrate. Because we have a child, and he has needs. You must adapt to the new life, and you must start from zero.\u201d \u201cWe hope we can find the same job as we had in Syria,\u201d Hasan interjects. \u201cBecause we were interested in those jobs. I worked on a lot of landscape projects and I am interested in those projects, and for her, I think she was also interested in her studies.\u201d On a church-organised trip to Reggia di Caserta, with its formal gardens, Hasan\u2019s old job loomed before him. Again and again, he and Nour say that the first thing they must do is learn Italian. They have downloaded videos and books, they go to the school, use Duolingo, studying for an hour or two a day \u2013 the best they can manage with Riad. And all the while, what they most crave, both agree, is \u201cfree time\u201d. On paper, this is the one thing they do have \u2013 with no jobs and a child between two of them \u2013 but that only makes their wish more poignant, because their heads are busy with appalling memories and an uncertain future, and no amount of time right now would feel free. In particular, they don\u2019t know when or where they will have an apartment. The Sant\u2019Egidio community was asked by the Vatican to provide \u201ca first welcome\u201d to the Lesbos families, and it hosts and teaches them freely. But even the Sant\u2019Egidio officials are unsure whether the families will be housed inside the Vatican, in a Vatican property outside the state\u2019s walls, or somewhere else altogether. The Vatican provides the families with living expenses, in the region of \u20ac30 (\u00a323) \u201cnow and then\u201d, according to a charity spokesperson, who describes the families as \u201cguests of the pope\u201d. \u201cNow there is another journey,\u201d Nour says.     Pope Francis welcomes the refugees after landing at Ciampino airport in Rome. Photograph: Reuters    She has not seen the pope since they touched down, but she hopes to meet him again. She wants to thank him, even though she thanked him each time she met him \u2013 shaking hands at the airport, on the plane, on the asphalt when they landed. \u201cHe was smiling and he blessed my son. He caressed him. He was a very kind man. He was a very \u2026 real human being.\u201d When the pope passed to the back of the plane to take questions from journalists, Nour listened. \u201cSomeone, I remember, asked him, we were Muslim families, why did he save us? And he answered that he saved us because we were human beings and we were suffering and we must be saved.\u201d Nour and Hasan and Ramy and Suhila knew quite a lot about the pope before they left Syria. Pope John Paul II had visited Damascus in 2001. They followed the election of Francis in 2013. \u201cIt was all over the television in Syria,\u201d Nour says. \u201cIt was so famous.\u201d In Damascus, they lived alongside people of different faiths. \u201cWe are open-minded to other religions,\u201d she says, and maybe something in her experience has blended her sense of them. \u201cI asked the pope to pray for us, because he was the first Muslim\u201d \u2013 she uses the Italian word Musulman before correcting herself and continuing. \u201cHe was better than the other Arabic leaders, because they didn\u2019t make the same gesture, although we shared the same religion.\u201d She describes the pope\u2019s act of taking the families to Rome as \u201clike a miracle\u201d. Like a particular miracle, in fact: \u201cWhen our prophet Muhammad is hiding in a cave with his friend Abu Bakr, and the non-believers are following them. The God makes a miracle.\u201d A spider spins its web across the cave opening, \u201cand the non-believers can\u2019t see Muhammad\u201d. Perhaps it is the sense of protection the pope gave that made Nour think of the spider. In any case, what has happened to her family, the pope\u2019s saving of them, she says, \u201chas strengthened my faith in God and in destiny. The God is always with you in every place. Maybe you don\u2019t get the things you want faster \u2026 But you discover that the God is hiding something for you.\u201d Of course Italy brings challenges. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit unstable, but surely, surely, it\u2019s better than living in the war.\u201d Like so many who have swapped all they know for safety, she and Hasan teeter in double-edged relief: there is joy at being free of danger, but they feel lost themselves in all they have left behind. Their families remain in Syria. For Ramy and Suhila, only yesterday Facebook brought news of two more friends\u2019 sons who had died, one in a bomb blast, another beheaded by Isis. But still there is so much to miss. \u201cIt\u2019s like a tree,\u201d Ramy says. \u201cThe body of the tree might go into the neighbours\u2019 garden, but the roots are still where it was planted.\u201d Can they be happy in Italy? \u201cMaybe,\u201d Hasan says. \u201cI think we could be safe here,\u201d Nour nods. \u201cWe could be stable here. We could live in peace here.\u201d And be happy? \u201cSomehow,\u201d she says. She and Hasan, like Ramy and Suhila, have stopped at some of Rome\u2019s sites: St Peter\u2019s, the Colosseum, the Caracalla baths. It must be strange to step out of the refuge each day into the piazza\u2019s throng of tourists \u2013 travellers themselves, or not travellers now, but new arrivals. Do they feel like locals or visitors? Hasan laughs. Nour lets out a long sigh. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d she says. \u201cVisiting. Visiting but \u2026\u201d \u201cMaybe next time,\u201d Hasan suggests. Nour turns to him, as if she has just remembered something. \u201cWell. We are here now.\u201d \u201cYes. We are here. Just we are only thinking about the language.\u201d Nour nods. \u201cIt is the first obstacle for us. But the most important thing is that he\u2019s safe and that my child is safe.\u201d She lays a hand on Hasan\u2019s arm. In the meantime, Ramy and Suhila keep their falafel mould safe. One day, they will have a grinder and the other utensils they need for it to be put to use at last, to earn its space in the bag. \u201cWhen we have a house,\u201d Ramy says. \u201cThen we will make falafel.\u201d",
