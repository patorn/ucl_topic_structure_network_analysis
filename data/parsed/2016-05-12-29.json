  "body": "The angst Jordan Spieth suffered by virtue of closing his opening round at the Players Championship with a seven, the one number that may bring him out in a cold sweat, surely intensified with a glance towards one of the his playing partners. Jason Day, who has succeeded Spieth as the world No1, endorsed his status once more with a course record-equalling 63. Day had birdie putts at all 18 holes. As Day tapped in for birdie at the 9th, their 18th, Spieth was about to three putt for a double bogey. Spieth\u2019s frustration at a 72 on a day of generally excellent scoring was compounded by that seven; the same scorecard aberration that fatally undermined his hopes of defending the Masters, owing to a capitulation at Augusta National\u2019s 12th hole. Spieth later insisted his Thursday score did not appropriately represent his performance. \u201cI really only had two bad swings today,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m hitting the ball great.\u201d Day has considerably more reason for positivity. The Australian is in prime position to win what would be his third tournament of 2016. He is the fifth player to shoot 63, nine-under par, at Sawgrass; two of the previous four claimed the title the same week. Day explained that he was drawing upon motivation from 2015. \u201cI shot 81 the last time I played here,\u201d he said. \u201cI was really displeased with how I played last year considering I was coming into that week feeling pretty good about my game. I can\u2019t really recall that I have hit the ball as well as I did today and then also putting as well as I did. Everything just clicked.\u201d Nobody was more surprised by Shane Lowry\u2019s seven-under 65 than the Irishman himself. Lowry is now a record holder, with his back nine of 29 the finest in the history of the Players at this venue. Lowry has therefore brilliantly started a crucial spell, not least for his hopes of Ryder Cup participation, which includes his native open at The K Club next week. \u201cI had no real confidence coming in here,\u201d Lowry admitted. \u201cMy game felt poor last week, felt OK at the start of the week but I kind of had a bit of a meltdown in the middle of the back nine of practice yesterday. I almost wasn\u2019t looking forward to the week. \u201cI was losing the head. I was thinking: \u2018What\u2019s the point being here,\u2019 because I felt like I was playing poorly and I was struggling on the greens. But I had a chat with my coach, I picked some good targets out there and hit some good shots then managed to hole a few putts, which is key for me and something I haven\u2019t been doing recently. So it was nice. \u201cI kind of was coming out today thinking: \u2018If I can just get four rounds in here it will be a big help for next week.\u2019 So, I\u2019m on my way to getting four rounds in anyhow.\u201d Justin Rose hit 18 greens in regulation as he matched Lowry\u2019s score with Danny Willett, in his first outing since winning the Masters, signing for a two-under 70. Rory McIlroy\u2019s uncomfortable relationship with the front nine at Sawgrass continued as he reached the turn in 37. McIlroy recovered thereafter, in testing afternoon conditions, by closing on 72 but gives the impression he has more enjoyable stops on the PGA Tour. McIlroy\u2019s highlight was a tee shot to within six feet at the iconic 17th, from where he converted for birdie. He needs more of the same on Friday. Adam Scott was moving along nicely at three under par \u2013 and hadn\u2019t dropped a shot \u2013 before taking eight at the 18th. At one over, he suddenly faces a battle to make the cut. Rickie Fowler, the defending champion, is a stroke better off than Scott. Ernie Els was delighted with a six-under 66. \u201cI haven\u2019t treated this course very well and it hasn\u2019t treated me very well in the past,\u201d said the South African. \u201cI loved it from the first time I played it but you\u2019ve got to play it properly. You can\u2019t just go out there and have a go.\u201d Unless your name is Jason Day, it would appear.",
