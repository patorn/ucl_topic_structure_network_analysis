  "body": "Related: Facebook denies censoring conservative stories from trending topics    There\u2019s a conceit that says everything at Facebook is run by data, not people. And we prefer it that way.  For the site\u2019s billion users, believing there\u2019s no human puppet master behind the scenes makes its growing control over life more palatable. It\u2019s just a clever machine, reflecting our desires better and better with every interaction, right? For news producers, we have to believe that the platform treats everyone equally: that it\u2019s a publisher not an editor.  In retrospect, this was always naive. A conservative whistleblower at Facebook yesterday claimed in a report that the influential \u201ctrending news\u201d tab was deliberately biased toward liberal news \u2013 something the social network denies.  \u201cI\u2019d come on shift and I\u2019d discover that CPAC [Conservative Political Action Conference] or Mitt Romney or Glenn Beck or popular conservative topics wouldn\u2019t be trending because either the curator didn\u2019t recognize the news topic or it was like they had a bias against Ted Cruz,\u201d the former news curator told the tech blog Gizmodo. Silicon Valley loves using the word algorithm to cover the word judgment, but any platform built by humans is always political. The engineers building the products want to skew them toward \u201cquality\u201d content, but it\u2019s hard to determine what quality is, exactly, without making a choice influenced by values. When I read suggestions that Facebook might be skewing its trending bar, my first reaction, as a San Francisco liberal, was to be slightly pleased (any help we can get against Trump, right?). But what if the tables were turned?  \u201cI wonder what the psychological effects of it are,\u201d said Vince Coglianese, editor of the conservative news site The Daily Caller. \u201cMillions of Facebook users now have no idea that the things they\u2019re concerned about are the concerns of a lot of people. It\u2019s scary to think Facebook\u2019s intentionally isolating vast swaths of the country.\u201d   Related: Facebook reveals news feed experiment to control emotions    \u201cThe middle man matters in news consumption,\u201d Coglianese said. Facebook\u2019s in a tricky spot because curation is necessary. Truly viral news content tends to be terrible. The front page of Reddit\u2019s \u2018\u201dhot\u201d section, an imperfect but useful barometer for the viral stories of the day, currently has headlines like: \u201cChameleon unsure bug is food or not\u201d and \u201cThese condoms are around 60 years old. (found in my basement)\u201d. Meanwhile my Facebook trending bar has: \u201cFederal Trade Commission: Judge Rules Against Agency\u2019s Bid to Block Health Care Systems Merger\u201d. It\u2019s probably fair to assume that the FTC news was not going as viral as that old condom, but a Facebook employee decided it was more important.  Facebook is the dominant player in the media today. As news websites lose relevance to readers who find content socially, and as stories are published directly onto Facebook as Instant articles, the company\u2019s power will only grow. To turn Facebook\u2019s trending bar into a Reddit page is not the answer. But Facebook has to be more honest about how it operates as an editor.  \u201cJust be transparent about how the words on the screen are getting there,\u201d Coglianese said. If there\u2019s one thing Silicon Valley loves more than the conceit of an amoral algorithm, it is secrecy. And as a social network with a newsfeed of vacation pictures, Facebook could get away with being secretive about their curation.  As the most powerful publisher and now editor in the world today, Facebook owes it to its billion users to be clear about how the site plans on distributing news.",
