  "body": "The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, has touted his party\u2019s education record by committing to invest $37bn in the sector over the next 10 years and declaring that the coming federal polls could be the \u201ceducation election\u201d. Shorten was campaigning in Brisbane while speaking at an education rally on Saturday, the day after the first peoples\u2019 debate, in which hewon the audience vote on the night.  He said that over the next 10 years Labor would invest $37bn \u201cto guarantee that every school in every postcode receives fair funding on the basis of need\u201d and would deliver on David Gonski\u2019s higher education reforms. \u201cAustralia does not have to choose between a growing economy and great schools. We cannot have a growing economy without great schools,\u201d he said.   Related: Bill Shorten makes education a priority as Labor 'underdogs' hit campaign trail    \u201cFriends, this can be the education election. A referendum on the future of education in our country.\u201d Shorten delivered a stinging riposte to the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, over his attitude to Gonski\u2019s school reform program. \u201cMr Turnbull thinks the fact that he went to school with his friend David Gonski is the same as delivering Gonski to our schools,\u201d he said. \u201cNamedropping is not an education policy, is it? If you really believe in needs-based funding, then you have to deliver the funding to meet those needs.\u201d His speech was briefly interrupted when a protester began questioning him about Labor\u2019s asylum-seeker policies and its largely bipartisan position on immigration matters. The Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, also addressed reporters on Saturday, after the party had been excluded from the debate. He said there would be a \u201cgreen tide\u201d coming for the election. Turnbull\u2019s news conference later on Saturday continued to focus on the Coalition\u2019s economic leadership and the tax cuts set out by the government. \u201cWe\u2019re providing enterprise tax cuts which will support all of these businesses ... everything we\u2019re doing is calculated, designed to drive economic growth and more jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have an economic plan. As we know, our opponents only have a spending plan.\u201d He also hit back on issues surrounding national security and said it was \u201cthe same old Labor. They can\u2019t be trusted with economic security any more than they can be with national security.\u201d   Related: Good slogan, Malcolm Turnbull, but growth in what kind of jobs? | Van Badham    Turnbull also faced questions about his personal wealth and Shorten\u2019s suggestion that he was out of touch. He responded: \u201cLet me just say to you ... Lucy and I have been very lucky in our lives. We know that, we know there are many people who have worked harder that have not been so fortunate. We count our blessings. That\u2019s something that we recognise. \u201cI can understand why Mr Shorten wants to make an issue of this. But I think that most Australians understand that our nation is built on opportunity and aspiration, and that all of us are entitled to aspire to achieve great things for our families.\u201d",
