  "body": "Dan Brown\u2019s publisher has announced that this autumn it is going to release a new, abridged version of the Da Vinci Code aimed at the lucrative YA market. The implication I took from this news is that The Da Vinci Code is about to be dumbed down. Even further. The fear that then gripped me then was far greater than that of my own death. I saw a future filled with too many ellipses, overly complex descriptions and arbitrary races against time. Suddenly, despite all the laws of reason and the many rules relating to logic \u2026 Penguin Random House \u2026 one of the last few publishing houses and the sole guardian of the UK rights of one of the most successful novels written in the last 20 years \u2026 were reissuing a rip-roaringly simple book, made even simpler? Alongside my attractive sidekick, I summoned all my faculties and strength as I began to realise that the time for bad Dan Brown parodies was almost over \u2026 I had to \u2026 try \u2026 to think \u2026 like a normal person again\u2026    Related: Dan Brown still can't write, but he deserves some respect | Alan Yuhas    Leaving Brown\u2019s style aside (for now), the publishers have suggested that their main adjustment will be to make a few judicious trims. (I\u2019ll leave it to you to come up with your own jokes about how that may actually improve the text.) If they remove the words \u201cthen\u201d and \u201cwhen\u201d and all the pointless present participles Brown uses to start his sentences, this venture might actually result in a Da Vinci Code that fits into an agreeably-sized pamphlet. The ruthless part of me has to admit that the plan makes sense. I object to the idea that the 13+ age group that the publisher aims to attract with this \u201cnew\u201d outing might not be able to cope with a full adult book (let alone Dan Brown\u2019s bestseller). But I can see how his addictive blend of scary albino monks, square-jawed professors, gifted French cryptologists and sadomasochism might just appeal to a teenage audience. (Especially if the publishers emphasise the sadomasochism.) It\u2019s also worth remembering the enduring power of The Da Vinci Code. Success with teenagers would be no more surprising than the fact that The Da Vinci Code has sold 82m copies, a healthy 81.9m more books than I\u2019ve ever sold. It equates to one copy for every man, woman and child in the UK \u2013 with enough left over to also supply the entire populations of Greece and Sweden. But 82 million people can be wrong. Really wrong. It\u2019s perfectly possible to speculate on how many of those millions of buyers actually read, enjoyed and finished the book. Given that during the years he was most prolific, Brown was the most donated author in Oxfam bookstores multiple years in a row, people seem keen to forget they ever owned the damn books. And I\u2019m really in no position to cast aspersions: I read it myself. All of it. I hated myself. I hated Robert Langdon. I hated the guff about \u201corgiastic rituals\u201d and Opus Dei. But I still had to know what happened. I still tore through the pages, not ripping them. So I won\u2019t be all that surprised if plenty more teenagers do the same and this whole sorry venture does exactly what it means to do: make money. Part of me wants to set down extravagant warnings. I want to tell those teen readers of the future to go elsewhere. But there\u2019s no point.  The truth is that \u2013 to borrow one of Brown\u2019s famously inept images \u2013 \u201cPandora is out of her box\u201d. The author hit a winning formula. Literary snobs like me may love to mock \u2013 but there\u2019s no way that we can stop him. In fact, the sooner the kids get any version of The Da Vinci Code out of their systems \u2013 it\u2019s due out in September \u2013 and start moving on to other books, the better.",
