  "body": "Stuart Broad sees a lot of himself in England\u2019s latest fast-bowling call-up, Jake Ball, but plans to keep the advice to a minimum should his Nottinghamshire team-mate be granted his Test debut against Sri Lanka at Headingley next Thursday.   Related: Nick Compton survives in England squad but there is plenty to play for | Mike Selvey    As one of two uncapped players in the squad named on Thursday, along with the Hampshire batsman James Vince, Ball\u2019s rise has been sharp. The 25-year-old fast bowler impressed with England Lions over the winter and has started the season in rich form with 19 wickets in his side\u2019s first four County Championship matches. It was at Trent Bridge at the start of this month, against Yorkshire in a match televised by Sky, where Ball truly grabbed his chance, with his four wickets in the champions\u2019 first innings including Test batsmen Adam Lyth, Joe Root and Gary Ballance. His county colleague Broad, the world\u2019s No1 bowler in Test cricket at present, likens the 6ft 2in right-armer\u2019s methods to his own and while Steven Finn is the incumbent third seamer, having played the first three Tests against South Africa in the winter prior to injury, Ball\u2019s early-season form will see him pushed hard. \u201cJake is a player I\u2019ve seen a lot of and he\u2019s developed so quickly,\u201d said Broad. \u201cHe is similar to me in height and what he tries to do with the ball. He gets good pace, moves the ball both away and into the right-hander, and away from the left-handers. The selectors have done well to pick a guy in form. \u201cWe\u2019re friends and I can talk him through things, but the way he\u2019s bowling at the minute, I would just let him go. The quickest way to learn is through your own experience. In international cricket you have got to learn quickly and those that last do that. \u201cDiscussions and learning comes when we go to India [in the winter], where he\u2019s never played. But right now I won\u2019t be going to him too much because he just needs to stay in the great rhythm he\u2019s in. I don\u2019t want to be the man to disrupt that.\u201d The former Sri Lanka batsman Kumar Sangakkara was one of Ball\u2019s victims in Nottinghamshire\u2019s opening win at home to Surrey, edging behind to a delivery that climbed and moved off the straight, and he believes the bowler should be fast-tracked into England\u2019s Test side during his hot streak. \u201cI think he\u2019s very impressive from start to finish,\u201d said the 38-year-old during the pre-series launch at the head office of the sponsor Investec. \u201cHe\u2019s not express quick but he bowls a heavy ball. When you have bowlers in form you need to pick them at the right time so it\u2019s better that he gets his chance now. Sangakarra is pessimistic about his country\u2019s chances. He and Mahela Jayawardene have etired and both featured in the 1-0 Test series win by Sri Lanka over England in 2014. Sangakarra said this series is \u201cthe first tough step in a journey that will last one to two years\u201d for the captain Angelo Mathews\u2019 side. Broad praised the selectors for showing faith in the bulk of the side that won 2-1 in South Africa, with Vince the only enforced change due to James Taylor\u2019s retirement and Nick Compton continuing at No3 on the ground where his previous spell in the team came to an end in 2013, amid a disagreement with the then-head coach Andy Flower over a rib injury. Finn, Compton\u2019s Middlesex team-mate, claims the 32-year-old is in a good place mentally despite speculation about his place and a highest score of just 44 this season. \u201cI think Compo as a guy is a lot more level than the last time he was in the England team and that is an excellent thing,\u201d the fast bowler said. \u201cI\u2019ve not seen a difference or dip in him over the last few weeks even though there has been speculation. He batted at No3 in a successful tour against the No1 Test team, averaged 30 \u2013 which I don\u2019t think is a disgrace there \u2013 and set up the innings to allow others to play aggressively. The right decision has been made.\u201d",
