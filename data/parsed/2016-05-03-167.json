Or through the point-scoring manoeuvres of the UK and Scottish governments who need each other to help keep Labour down? Me too. So let\u2019s look at the bigger picture, where voting will also take place in 124 English councils, including 32 of the 36 metropolitan boroughs and where police and crime commissioners (remember them?) will be up for election in 40 authorities in England and Wales. Let\u2019s hope for a higher turnout than the 10-20% achieved when the first batch of commissioners was elected in chilly November 2012. Here\u2019s a handy overview.  Last, but far from least, are the devolved authority elections. They include directly elected mayors in Bristol, Liverpool and Salford \u2013 the shape of things to come under George Osborne\u2019s \u201cpowerhouse\u201d packages \u2013 as well as post-Boris London\u2019s contest which Emma Thompson\u2019s backing for theWomen\u2019s Equality party in Tuesday\u2019s Guardian has just made a bit more uncertain.  And, of course, Scotland, which will return another SNP majority to Holyrood, something designed to be as impossible as a Leicester City Premier League title. Scotland grabs a lot of UK media attention, but Northern Ireland\u2019s Stormont election is pretty important, delicately balanced in the centrifugal Sinn F\u00e9in/DUP coalition that finds it hard to agree urgent reforms.   Political instability across the Irish border after this year\u2019s indecisive election does not help. But Irish voters in all 32 counties could say the same about their bigger neighbour this year with the UK\u2019s EU referendum looming. A Brexit vote would seriously damage them all, not that the self-styled internationalists in the Brexit camp care. The DUP shares with Ukip the distinction of being the only significant Brexit party.  Did I forget Wales? Of course not. The Whites are from Cornwall and my only grandparent not buried in Barnoon cemetery above Porthmeor beach in St Ives is buried in Cardiff.  The London media usually neglects Wales, except when David Cameron is taking cheap potshots at the troubles of NHS Wales (to deflect attention from NHS England\u2019s own) or when there\u2019s a problem, such as teenage suicides in Bridgend or the threatened Port Talbot steel closure. So, three cheers for the Guardian\u2019s regional correspondent Steven Morris for keeping us informed, as does the BBC (how could Huw Edwards not!). Here\u2019s Steve\u2019s latest report from the Welsh elections, explaining how Welsh politicians, from the first minister, Carwyn Jones, down, feel local priorities are overshadowed by UK affairs (not least because indigenous Welsh media is not strong).  Here\u2019s Steve\u2019s report on why Jeremy Corbyn (or was it First Minister Jones?) decided not to campaign in Wales, though he did go to stricken Port Talbot. Plaid Cymru\u2019s Leanne Wood is the most popular Welsh leader, Steve says here.   The Welsh Tories had been expecting to make gains at Labour\u2019s expense before Port Talbot and Sajid Javid\u2019s disappearance to Australia revived old fears. It hoped to do so with policies such as these. Ukip, which Steve Morris expects to do quite well on Thursday, is promising to make St David\u2019s day a bank holiday. Here\u2019s Labour\u2019s offer launched by Jones on the seafront at Barry Island \u2013 Gavin and Stacey country \u2013 where 2016\u2019s rare April sun even shone on him.  What are the issues? I haven\u2019t visited this year. Here\u2019s a BBC manifesto summary. But when I recently spoke with Plaid\u2019s Wood in London (we had a coffee at Paddington station before she took the train home) she made the unanswerable point that Labour had been in uninterrupted power at the Welsh assembly in Cardiff Bay from the start of devolution in 1999.   That\u2019s 17 years, sometimes in coalition with the Lib Dems or Plaid, currently alone with 30 assembly members (AMs) out of 60. Any party gets tired after eight to 10 years, just look at Margaret Thatcher or Tony Blair\u2019s regime. Quietly competent Carwyn Jones has been first minister since taking over from Rhodri Morgan (he left office with high popularity ratings) in 2009, but it\u2019s not very healthy.  Talking of which, concern about Welsh health is not confined to David Cameron, most of whose life has been spent around the east end of the M4 corridor to Wales. Congestion around Newport damages the south-east Wales economy, the important bit, and Andrew RT Davies, the Tory leader in Cardiff Bay, is making its improvement a priority. But in the last party leaders\u2019 debate \u2013 here\u2019s a BBC account \u2013 disquiet over health and education featured strongly.  Complaints about both will be familiar to non-Welsh ears \u2013 waiting times, including diagnostics and cancer outcomes, are disturbing, and Welsh pupils have scored badly in the international Pisa results \u2013 but the problems are intensified in Wales, where doctors are harder to retain and underlying levels of poverty higher. All Welsh politicians would like the level of Barnett formula for public spending that Scotland gets, 120% of UK average to Wales\u2019s 108%. Belfast? Don\u2019t ask.   Some people think \u2013 as George Osborne seems to \u2013 that devolution of powers to Cardiff or Manchester is an answer in itself. It may lead to better decision-making on locally controlled matters. But it doesn\u2019t of itself cure poverty or lack of investment funds and spending power. The fate of Port Talbot is a global matter way beyond Cardiff\u2019s control, though Cardiff has been right to say that the UK government was too slow and casual in its response.  Nationalism in Wales, integrated into the governance system of England since 1536, is more cultural in character , lacking some of the legal, educational and other features that have preserved and enhanced Scottish political identity since the 1707 union. But the Wales Act of 2014 is giving Welsh politicians greater powers, not least over taxation.The suspicion is they will be cautious about using new tax powers, as Nicola Sturgeon is in Scotland. As the old saying goes, politicians campaign in poetry but usually govern in prose.   So who will win under the PR form of voting which \u201ctops up\u201d unbalanced constituency results with \u201clist\u201d candidates? Here\u2019s Wikipedia\u2019s backgrounder, including polling data. Labour is expected to lose some ground from its 42% of the vote in 2011 (four AMs up on 2007). Will the Tories with 14 AMs (and 25% of the vote) gain? Will Plaid (11 AMs and 19% of the vote) overtake them with help from Labour defectors fed up with the NHS or with Jeremy Corbyn? Will the Lib Dems under Kirsty Williams fall back further from 5 AMs and 10%.  What about Ukip, which hopes for a breakthrough for all the usual reasons? Don\u2019t laugh, but Neil Hamilton (yes, that Neil Hamilton) heads the regional list in Mid and West Wales, where the disgraced former Tory minister grew up. Mark Reckless, Tory to Ukip defector heads the party list in South Wales East. He hails from further up the M4, Marlborough College and Oxford.  Plaid\u2019s list includes Adam Price, a clever, charismatic former MP and always a man to watch. Labour\u2019s also includes ex-MP Huw Irranca-Davies in Ogmore, the man some tip to take over from Carwyn Jones when Jones decides, perhaps quite soon (at 49 he\u2019s the same age as Cameron), that it\u2019s time to go. Plaid and the Lib Dems being wary of coalition government in Cardiff (and Westminster, Nick?), the assumption seems to be that Labour will carry on as a minority regime with informal support on key votes.  But you can\u2019t safely predict results in such volatile times, can you? On a summer\u2019s evening years ago I tagged around behind Rhodri Morgan canvassing a posh corner of Cardiff. The then first minister came down a path to report in his puzzled way: \u201cI\u2019ve just discovered my first BNP voter in Wales.\u201d   Equally unpredictably, but more cheerfully, the Welsh secretary, Stephen Crabb, has just been promoted to Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s old job at Westminster, work and pensions. Remember, Wales may be neglected, but it produced two of the very few giants of British 20th-century politics, David Lloyd George (yes, I know he was Manchester-born) and Aneurin Bevan.   Those dazzling Tudors, they were Welsh too, as were their formidable Cecil henchmen, who sit in cabinets in London to this day.",
