It was the summer of 1966 when Chen Yanrong became one of the first victims of Chairman Mao\u2019s Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a cataclysmic political upheaval that started 50 years ago this month.

What mistake did we make? What did we do?\u2019,\u201d Chen Shuxiang recalls. Half a century on, Chen, now 73, is sitting in a Beijing community centre for the elderly just a few kilometres away from the secondary school where his father was murdered, his eyes moist as he ponders his feelings towards the perpetrators. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say to them inside my heart. I can\u2019t forgive them,\u201d he says of the teenage fanatics who beat the life out of his 37-year-old father. \u201cMy father was a human being, not an animal. He wasn\u2019t a cat or a dog. He was a person. They beat him to death in just a few hours.\u201d     Retired teacher Chen Shuxiang. \u2018My father was a human being, not an animal,\u2019 he says. Photograph: Tom Phillips for the Guardian    Fifty years after the ruinous political movement began on 16 May 1966, those robbed of their loved ones are reflecting on their losses and on how \u2013 even today \u2013 there has been no comprehensive reckoning of what became known as Mao\u2019s last revolution. Andrew Walder, the author of China Under Mao: A Revolution Derailed, says the Communist party did show \u201can incredible openness\u201d about the damage caused by the Cultural Revolution in the years immediately after it ended in 1976 with the death of Mao Zedong. Victims of persecution were rehabilitated and in some cases compensated. Perpetrators were jailed. Party-run newspapers filled with semi-fictionalised accounts of the suffering and the Cultural Revolution was officially labelled a \u201cgrave blunder\u201d. But the party\u2019s willingness to delve into past errors came to an abrupt halt in the 1980s as a surge in student dissent spooked its leaders. \u201cOnce it appeared, as the 80s went on, that young people in particular were restive about the lack of democracy and reform in China, they decided pretty quickly that they had had enough of that and that they would move on,\u201d says Walder, a sociologist at Stanford University. \u201c[China\u2019s leaders] saw what happened in eastern Europe and they drew the obvious, somewhat self-serving conclusion that if we are going to hold on to power we\u2019d better stop dwelling on the past and concentrate on improving the lives of people and move forward.\u201d Three decades on and discussion of the evils committed during that decade remains largely taboo. Since president Xi Jinping came to power in 2012, there has been a push to further curtail criticism of Chairman Mao\u2019s reign. \u201cTo lose the banner of Mao Zedong thought would mean a negation of the party\u2019s glorious history,\u201d Xi said at the 120th anniversary of Mao\u2019s birth.

None at all,\u201d says Chen, a retired secondary school teacher whose father had worked at the Beijing institute of iron and steel engineering. \u201cWhat could I possibly say?\u201d he adds. \u201cThat you were young? That you knew nothing? That you were wrong?\u201d Yao Shuping, whose mother was killed by Red Guards in early August 1966 and whose father took his own life two years later, says she could forgive those responsible only if they come forward to apologise. \u201cThey were not the masterminds, they were the tools,\u201d Yao, 77, tells the Guardian from her home in Boston, where she has lived since the 1990s. \u201cThey were a group of high-school students. They didn\u2019t know anything at that age. They were afraid of others saying that they were not waging revolution.\u201d China has seen a series of controversial Red Guard apologies in recent years, including one from Song Binbin, a former Red Guard who shot to fame in the summer of 1966 when she was pictured pinning a red armband to Chairman Mao\u2019s uniform during a mass rally in Beijing\u2019s Tiananmen Square. \u201cI hope that all those who did wrong during the Cultural Revolution and hurt teachers and classmates will face up to themselves and do soul searching in order to seek forgiveness and achieve reconciliation,\u201d Song told a Chinese newspaper in 2014, prompting a mix of praise and condemnation from those who claimed she had tried to downplay her role in the violence. Roderick MacFarquhar, the author of Mao\u2019s Last Revolution, says such apologies are long overdue. \u201cThat is the kind of thing that should have been done on a nationwide scale, in towns and villages even, up and down the country,\u201d the Harvard University academic says. \u201cOf course that would have been a vast project and no government would want to do that. But I think it would have been very salutary. \u201cPeople want it to be acknowledged that they were targeted and that they were brutally treated,\u201d MacFarquhar adds. \u201cI don\u2019t think they want to parade their individual shame in front of the broad masses but \u2026 some kind of expiation by the party, a unilateral truth and reconciliation document. \u201cBut it\u2019s not going to happen because it will simply revive the memories of how terrible Mao\u2019s last years were and that is what Xi Jinping doesn\u2019t want.\u201d Only the most cursory of investigations appears to have been carried out into Chen Yanrong\u2019s premature death. In 1971, as the Cultural Revolution entered its final phase and normality began to return, his murder was ruled an \u201caccidental death\u201d, a conclusion his relatives reject.

In February 1979, party officials also issued relatives with a brief \u201cpolitical verdict\u201d on the killing. It made no mention of those directly responsible for Chen\u2019s savage murder but instead blamed it on the so-called Gang of Four, a group of Communist leaders that included Mao Zedong\u2019s wife Jiang Qing. \u201cChen Yanrong was persecuted to death by [Marshal] Lin Biao and the Gang of Four counter-revolutionary clique,\u201d reads the crumpled one-page ruling, which Chen keeps inside a broken picture frame along with a trove of documents about his father\u2019s case. In the absence of a deeper government inquiry into how his father came to be chained to a radiator and killed, Chen has compiled a dossier of his own so future generations can understand the suffering unleashed by Mao. \u201cIt took me 10 years to write,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was so hard for me. Each time I tried to remember my father, I couldn\u2019t help but cry.\u201d The 134-page turquoise brochure contains details of how, at about 4pm on the afternoon of 27 August 1966, Red Guards appeared at the family\u2019s home and abducted his mother and father. That evening they were loaded on to a truck and taken to two local secondary schools, the Tsinghua University high school and then the affiliated high school of Peking University. It was in the second location that Chen Yanrong is believed to have died, some time between 2am and 3am, having been deprived of water and savagely beaten with belts, rope and and an iron bar. The next morning, Chen says, his badly battered mother returned to home to break the news. \u201cShe was covered in blood; it was all over her face and her body,\u201d he recalls. \u201cShe didn\u2019t look like a human being.\u201d Tears streaking her face, she described Chen Yanrong\u2019s final hours to her son. \u201c[She] told me my father had been beaten until he was lying flat on the floor. \u201cThe Red Guards were supposed to destroy the Four Olds and the Five Categories of disgraced people, but we didn\u2019t belong to those categories. So why did our family suffer this?\u201d Adding insult to injury, Chen\u2019s Red Guard executioners then demanded that his relatives pay 28 yuan to have his disfigured body cremated. His corpse was never recovered. Fifty years after the murder, Chen weeps as he says he does not even have a photograph to remember his father. \u201cIn the 1950s and 60s taking a photo was a luxury,\u201d he says. Wang Youqin, a University of Chicago academic who has spent nearly 30 years investigating Red Guard killings, says victims of the Cultural Revolution are struggling to shake off the emotional burden, even half a century on. \u201cPsychological pain is not like a scar on your skin, it\u2019s not visible. But if you talk to them you can feel it deeply,\u201d says Wang, who witnessed some of the Cultural Revolution\u2019s violence as a Beijing schoolgirl and now logs her research about its victims on a website. MacFarquhar says Beijing\u2019s refusal to allow a truth commission like those undertaken in Argentina, Chile, South Africa and Uruguay, has left the door open to further violence. \u201cThey haven\u2019t done the heart-searching that is necessary if you are going to put it behind you for ever. \u201cIf I\u2019m right in thinking that the cruelty by Chinese against other Chinese was the most terrible aspect of [the Cultural Revolution] \u2026 then I think that if one doesn\u2019t face up to that, it could happen again.\u201d Chen is determined such atrocities will not repeat themselves and vows to use his final years to shed light upon the tragedy through his father\u2019s story. Once his 12-year-old grandson is old enough, he will tell him the details of how his great-grandfather died. \u201cNothing like this had happened before in all the 5,000 years of Chinese civilisation,\u201d he says. \u201cIt can\u2019t be allowed to happen again.\u201d Chen has no plans to commemorate the 50th anniversary of his father\u2019s death but will not forget the generosity of the man who brought him up. \u201cWe don\u2019t know where you are, but you will be in our hearts for ever,\u201d he says, addressing his absent father. \u201cYou are an honest man, genuine, kind \u2026 We will always miss you.\u201d Additional reporting by Christy Yao",
