Over half a million US troops suffer from PTSD, yet, according to the David Lynch Foundation\u2019s research, only 20% will receive adequate care due for the disorder. Through Operation Warrior Wellness, the Foundation teaches transcendental meditation to help relieve symptoms of PTSD, major depression, and help soldiers and their families learn greater resilience to stress. They aren\u2019t alone in their beliefs in TM\u2019s healing power, either. The National Institute of Health has found that TM can improve heart health and other studies have found decreased blood pressure and increased psychological well being. But when you can\u2019t meditate your woes away, laughter is a good alternative.  To prove this maxim, the David Lynch Foundation brought together some of the funniest comedians around \u2013 Gaffigan, Saturday Night Live star Vanessa Bayer, Gilbert Gottfried and Louis CK for a night of jokes with some fundraising on the side. David Lynch was unable to join the festivities in person, as he was in Paris recuperating after filming the forthcoming return of Twin Peaks. Instead, Lynch greeted the audience via a pre-recorded message, which was suitably odd for the man who just spent weeks in the town of Twin Peaks (and directing a cast of 217 must be exhausting).  The first star to take the stage in corporeal form was Bayer, who has been an avid practitioner of meditation for the last two years. \u201cIt helps me to be able to focus and be more creative and calm. It helps me handle things in a more deliberate way,\u201d she said on the red carpet. While Bayer is not known for her standup, she got the crowd on her side with a slough of brilliant impressions, including her SNL character Jacob the Bar Mitzvah Boy. She then acted out an entirely fantasized episode of Friends, in which she starred as Ross\u2019s love interest and delivered on-point impersonations of both Rachel and Monica.            Bayer was followed by comic\u2019s comic Gottfried who is not a meditator, but merely in it for the swag. \u201cI would work a fundraiser for Isis if they were giving free lunch,\u201d Gottfried said on the red carpet.  \u201cLaughter is a good medicine,\u201d Gottfried said, \u201cbut penicillin is a little stronger. If I needed medicine, I would ask the doctor to list all the available medicine and give me those first, and then after that he could tell me a joke.\u201d Gottfried was a last-minute addition to the show, stepping in for Russell Brand. On stage, he delivered a raucous and raunchy set that had the decidedly liberal New York audience laughing uproariously at very un-politically correct jokes. Gottfried\u2019s half-hour set of groan-worthy ethnic jokes had the audience in stitches due primarily to its sheer relentlessness.  Following in Gottfried\u2019s vulgar footsteps was Gaffigan, a comic who notoriously works \u201cclean\u201d. Gaffigan had the crowd of 2,000 people belly laughing over his stories of accidentally smuggling doughnuts through airport security and his aversion to viewing the fall foliage: \u201cIt\u2019s leaf hospice!\u201d he announced. His set ranged from coast to coast, noting that Pacific Northwest residents dress \u201clike a hike could break out at any minute\u201d and that local news channel NY 1 is like \u201cwatching a friend in a play\u201d pretending to be a newscaster.  To close out the show, Louis CK delivered a half-hour set of what seemed like mostly new material, much of which was on the topic of parenthood. One particularly entertaining bit was a riff on the Greek myth of Achilles whose mother (\u201cthe Goddess of Grip\u201d) dipped her son into the River Styx by his heel. Other material included his uncomfortable love of Matthew McConaughey\u2019s character in Magic Mike, a movie he refuses to see, the dominance of Christianity, and his own interest in peace on earth: \u201cTwo human babies have never fought,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if they had, I would know, because I Google it occasionally.\u201d  If a war ever breaks out between infants, transcendental meditation could help. And if that doesn\u2019t work, there\u2019s always laughter.",
