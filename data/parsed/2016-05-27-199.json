This is true, but it is also true that I don\u2019t think I have ever really hit my stride with bread. But over the past year, I have been trying to better understand it. In one of his books, my Californian friend Chad Robertson of Tartine Bakery claims that \u201cdough is dough\u201d \u2013 if you can make one loaf, then you can make another. Surely the same applies to all baking? Whether you\u2019re making a delicate cake or a chewy loaf, it\u2019s essentially the same alchemy taking place. Which leaves me out of excuses. Brioche is yeasted bread enriched with eggs and plenty of butter. (It is not dissimilar to the doughnut dough I shared with you last week, and could absolutely be fried if you were so inclined.) I suppose it is the cake-maker\u2019s bread and a good place to start my journey.     You will need a stand mixer to make this, because it is important to keep the butter from melting as it is mixed into the dough.

Makes 2 loaves200g unsalted butter550g whole milk24g dried yeast150g caster sugar1kg strong flour2 tsp salt3 large eggs2 egg yolks, for the wash4 tbsp double cream 1 Cut 150g of the butter into 1cm cubes, then leave to soften to room temperature. Use the remaining 50g of butter to generously butter a large mixing bowl, as well as two 18cm x 11.5cm x 7cm loaf tins. 2 Warm the milk in a small saucepan over a medium heat until lukewarm. Stir the yeast and caster sugar into the milk, and let the yeast bloom. 3 In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, weigh the flour and salt. Add your yeast mixture to the dry ingredients and mix until a dough forms (about 5 minutes). Now add your eggs, one by one, mixing fully after each addition. Mix on a medium speed for 5-10 minutes, until the dough comes away from the sides and is starting to get elastic. 4 At this point you can start adding the soft butter, one piece at a time. Continue until all of it has been fully incorporated into the dough. It will feel slightly sticky. Turn into the butter-lined bowl, loosely cover with clingfilm, and leave to double in volume (about 2 hours). 5 Knock back the dough, and cover tightly with clingfilm. Chill for at least 6 hours, or overnight. This makes the butter in the dough firmer, which allows you to shape it. 6 Take your chilled dough from the fridge and divide into six pieces. Shape each piece into a ball, seam-side down. Neatly tuck three balls snugly into each buttered loaf tin. Leave to rise for 45 minutes. 7 Whisk together the yolks and cream, then brush over the loaves. Heat your oven to 200C/400F/gas mark 6. Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until you can tap the loaves and they sound hollow. Strawberry brioche bread pudding Serves 4-6500g stale brioche, sliced into 15-20mm slices100g currants100g unsalted butter1 large egg3 egg yolks200g milk 500g sour cream 2 tsp vanilla extract Zest of 1 orange 50g caster sugar\u00bc tsp salt50g flaked almonds2 tbsp demerara sugar500g strawberries \u00bd vanilla pod150g golden caster sugarDouble cream, to serve 1 Butter a large loaf tin and have ready a roasting dish large enough to place the loaf tin inside it. Also line another small roasting tin with baking paper, for the strawberries.

Slice off bits of butter and press them between the layers of bread. No need to spread them as they will melt in the baking. 3 In a bowl, whisk together the egg, egg yolks, sour cream, milk, vanilla and orange zest. Stir in the sugar and salt, then pour over the bread. Prod with a fork and soak for 45 minutes. Use the back of a fork to press any unsoaked bits of bread down under the custard, being careful not to let it overflow. 4 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Sprinkle the mix with the flaked almonds and demerara sugar and put the tin in the roasting dish. Pour water into the roasting dish so that it comes at least 2cm up the side of the loaf tin. Put in the oven to bake for 40-45 minutes, or until set. 5 Meanwhile, hull and quarter your strawberries. Put them in your paper-lined roasting tin, add the scraped vanilla pod and sprinkle with sugar. Roast for 25 minutes. When the pudding is ready to serve, cover with the strawberries and all their juices and put great big scoops into serving bowls with plenty of cold double cream.
