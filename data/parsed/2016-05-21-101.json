  "body": "Andy Murray is looking for his 11th coach, but how have his previous coaches raised his game? Few people are a better judge than Nick Bollettieri, a former paratrooper and self-taught tennis coach, who helped discover Andre Agassi, Monica Seles and Maria Sharapova and then turned them into world beaters. Among the most respected coaches on the Tour, the American first spotted Murray when he was 13 and has followed his career ever since. \u201cAndy\u2019s had 10 coaches,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I was introduced at the International Tennis Hall of Fame as the best coach, I said \u2018no, I\u2019m not the best coach, I may be one of them\u2019, but I hold the undisputed title of having eight wives. Andy holds the title of the most coaches.\u201d   Related: Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo: Andy Murray\u2019s on-court behaviour played part in split    The early years Judy Murray, Leon Smith and Pato \u00c1lvarez  Murray credits his mother, Judy, with developing the fundamentals of his game and some of his variety. Judy brought in Smith from 1998 and then later sent her son to Spain in 2002 where he met \u00c1lvarez. \u201cI believe in the beginning it was very important for Andy to keep the ball in play because I think [it suited] his temperament,\u201d Bollettieri says. \u201cIf he had tried to be a big hitter in the beginning, he probably would have quit tennis. That Spanish way of keeping the ball in play and grinding it out was good to a certain extent but it\u2019s very difficult to become a champion like that today. But Judy, she\u2019s a winner.\u201d June 2005 - April 2006 Mark Petchey  The former British Davis Cup player acted as something of a mentor. Under Petchey, Murray won his first ATP Tour title in San Jose and moved into the top 50. Unfortunately Petchey wasn\u2019t in San Jose as he was on holiday and Murray moved on in the summer of 2006. \u201cHe missed that San Jose win \u2013 if I was working with Andy, I\u2019d say, if you fire me, you have to pay me alimony,\u201d says Bollettieri. July 2006 - November 2007 Brad Gilbert  Former world No4 Gilbert coached Agassi to world No1 and his hefty pay demands were met by the LTA for the majority of his time with Murray. \u201cBrad was certainly very different,\u201d says Bollettieri. \u201cThe thing about Brad is that even though his strokes were ugly, as he admits, he knew how to win by getting into people\u2019s minds. That\u2019s what made Gilbert a good player and a good coach.\u201d 2007 - 2011 Miles Maclagan and \u00c0lex Corretja  Murray hired another former British Davis Cup player in the mild-mannered but astute Maclagan, with whom he reached his career-high ranking of No2 and made his first grand slam final at the 2008 US Open. Maclagan was part of the first \u201cTeam Murray\u201d, which included a physio and two fitness trainers and later the former world No2 Corretja. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you can reach the top of the banana tree in anything in life without a team,\u201d Bollettieri says. \u201cThe team must devote their life to the mission and everybody\u2019s got to do their part. It has worked for Andy.\u201d January 2012 - March 2014 Ivan Lendl  At the end of 2011, Murray announced that former world No1 Lendl would be his new coach. The first of the so-called \u201csuper coaches\u201d, his arrival brought Olympic gold in London, quickly followed by a first grand slam title at the US Open in 2012 and then the holy grail of a Wimbledon title in 2013. \u201cI believe that Lendl brought discipline,\u201d says Bollettieri. \u201cHe was basically telling Andy: \u2018bullshit, go out and do it now, I don\u2019t want to hear it\u2019. There\u2019s only one way that Lendl plays, to win. If a person is in front of the net, he\u2019s going to knock their head off, that\u2019s it, period. That\u2019s Lendl, no monkey business \u2013 I don\u2019t care if the crowd like me or don\u2019t like me, I don\u2019t give a shit, it\u2019s all about winning.\u201d June 2014 - May 2016 Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo  Murray continued to set new trends with the appointment of former women\u2019s world No1 Mauresmo in the summer of 2014. Mauresmo helped Murray recover his form after back surgery (accompanied occasionally by Sweden\u2019s Jonas Bjorkman), winning seven titles, reaching two grand slam finals and regaining the world No2 ranking. \u201cI think Mauresmo brought calmness,\u201d Bollettieri says. \u201cAm\u00e9lie filled a great gap and she brought maybe a little more tenderness.\u201d March 2016 - Jamie Delgado  Murray hired Delgado, another former Davis Cup player for Britain, to accompany him for 40 weeks a year, a constant as Mauresmo juggled with motherhood. After splitting with Mauresmo, Murray promptly won the title in Rome with some of his best ever form, helped by a vastly-improved second serve. \u201cThat might be a combination of both Delgado and Mauresmo,\u201d Bollettieri says. \u201cThe second serve sat up and he was always on the defence. Right now, he\u2019s getting a lot more wrist-snap. He had to go for it. If he didn\u2019t, there\u2019s no way Andy would be doing what he\u2019s doing now.\u201d And finally \u2026 Bollettieri\u2019s advice for Murray\u2019s next coach \u201cI\u2019m telling you if they come out and screw around with his technique and movement, it\u2019s going to hurt him. He has worked his backside off physically, he\u2019s gotten better mentally and strokes-wise, not too much [should] be done to that, in my opinion. Murray fights. Once in a while he\u2019ll look up and give you the fist, but that\u2019s him, man.\u201d",
