The plane was carrying 56 passengers and 10 crew, including 30 Egyptian and 15 French nationals, as well as three Egyptian security officials. Though the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, and Greek officials have said the plane appears to have crashed, Egypt\u2019s prime minister, Sherif Ismail, said it was too early to rule out any explanation for the incident, including terrorism.  The 12-year-old Airbus A320\u2019s last communication was at its cruising altitude of 37,000 ft about 2.30am local time. It was 10 miles into Egyptian airspace when it vanished from radar without any distress signal. Ismail said search operations are under way in the area where it is believed to have lost contact.  EgyptAir flight MS804 goes missing between Paris and Cairo \u2013 live updates The Age of Trump Ben Jacobs considers whether Trump, or Trump-ism, is about to unleash a flood of mini-Trumps \u2013 or ideological lookalikes \u2013 on to the national stage.  Meanwhile, in a compelling Long Read, The Guardian\u2019s Jonathan Freedland says whether Donald Trump wins the presidency or not, his rise reveals a growing attraction to political demagogues \u2013 and points to a wider crisis of democracy. But why is Trump so effective? The reason, Freedland suggests, is part showbiz: \u201cTrump understood that people will always tune in to watch a taboo being broken\u201d; and part humour: \u201cHis flamboyant self-love is funny, his mocking of his enemies is funny.\u201d But the most powerful is the thrill Trump generates in the room, and in the audience watching on TV, when he dares reject the rules of the game \u2026\u201d   Welcome to the age of Trump United in disunity  Dan Roberts writes that it\u2019s the Democratic party\u2019s turn to face an identity crisis after the turmoil at the Nevada convention, and wonders if supporters of Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton will be able to unite. \u201cThe unapologetic reaction of leaders on both sides of the dispute suggests the angry scenes in Nevada were not an isolated incident, and point to a degree of animosity that will not be easy to heal.\u201d Meanwhile, Jessica Valenti considers Trump\u2019s women issue, but, she asks, will anyone care? Democrats face their own unity crisis amid Nevada convention fallout Boston parishioners evicted Boston\u2019s St Frances Xavier Cabrini church has been occupied continuously for 12 years by parishioners determined to prevent its sale by the archdiocese of Boston to raise compensation funds for survivors of sexual abuse. But after the supreme court this week declined to hear an appeal against an earlier court ruling, the parishioners must now vacate.  A final farewell service is planned for 29 May, writes the Guardian\u2019s religion correspondent, Harriet Sherwood, but the defiant, 100-strong occupying congregation is determined to stick together. Boston church\u2019s parishioners evicted after 12-year occupation Pizzly or grolar bear? Climate change is behind the emergence of a new grizzly-polar hybrid that looks like a throwback to the era 150,000 years ago when polar bears evolved from brown bears. A bear shot in northern Canada is believed to be a hybrid \u2013 and a consequence of the increasing interactions between the two bear species as grizzlies move north as their environment warms and into polar bear territory. Hunter Didji Ishalook photographed the bear near the small community of Arviat, located on Hudson Bay within Canada\u2019s Arctic region. \u201cIt looks like a polar bear but it\u2019s got brown paws and big claws like a grizzly,\u201d Ishalook reported. \u201cAnd the shape of a grizzly head.\u201d Pizzly or grolar bear: grizzly-polar hybrid is a new result of climate change Venezuela president under pressure The Venezuelan president, Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, has maintained his country will not be the next to collapse. But, writes Latin America correspondent Jonathan Watts, he may not have much choice. Set against ongoing social unrest triggered by the world\u2019s highest inflation rate, falling oil prices, severe recession and dire shortages of food, medicine and electricity, Maduro is increasingly relying on repression to maintain control. In the latest clashes between opposition protesters and riot police on Wednesday, it became apparent that it\u2019s no longer just the middle class taking to the streets but the poor. Embattled Venezuela president turns to repression Mixed-up confusion A new study finds disruptive services like Uber and Airbnb aren\u2019t just overturning conventions of transportation and accommodation, they\u2019re turning traditional views on regulation upside down. A Pew Research poll \u2013 the first major survey on shared, collaborative and on-demand services \u2013 finds that liberals love Uber and Airbnb so much, they\u2019re embracing conservative values when it comes to regulating them.  Left-leaning users veer right on regulating Uber and Airbnb, study finds Free speech for everyone.  President Obama started it at a Rutgers University commencement address on Saturday, then came Harry Potter author JK Rowling. Here writer Andrew Solomon, president of PEN America, continues the theme: we must welcome dissent because if you have to silence the other side, your own arguments can\u2019t be very strong. To quote Voltaire, he writes: \u201cThe supposed right of intolerance is absurd and barbaric.\u201d JK Rowling was right: free speech is for everyone, not just your friends Fort McMurray residents face long wait More than 88,000 residents evacuated during the Alberta wildfire must wait until June to return home even as the blaze continues to rage out of control in remote forested areas. Over the past 24 hours, the relentless fire has expanded by 68,000 hectares in the past day, making it more than six times the size of Toronto; earlier this week, it consumed one oil sands camp but firefighters have succeeded in protecting others. As Alberta wildfire rages, thousands who fled must wait weeks to go home Sexy and funny or funny and sexy? Dean Burnett wonders if you make a woman laugh, is she more likely to sleep with you? Answer: if she laughs at you once you\u2019re naked, he predicts, things could be going wrong. Still, there\u2019s a certain evidence, or at least a theory, that the ability to make jokes and amuse people is a sign of psychological health and fitness. On the flipside, Burnett writes, \u201cthere\u2019s evidence to suggest that many people see excessive humour as a sign that someone is psychologically unwell, hence the whole \u2018tears of a clown\u2019 cliche\u201d. Are funny people sexy \u2026 or are sexy people funny? And another thing \u2026  Chinese bureaucrats in the mood for love A Chinese couple has spent their wedding night assiduously copying out the 17,000-word communist constitution. This was part of a national campaign designed to raise awareness of the party\u2019s rules. Li Yunpeng and his bride, Chen Xuanchi \u2013 both civil servants from the eastern province of Jiangxi \u2013 said the undertaking was a way of creating \u201cbeautiful memories\u201d. Less romantically, the state-run Global Times said the transcription session was part of a Beijing-backed campaign called Copy the Chinese Communist party constitution for 100 days.
