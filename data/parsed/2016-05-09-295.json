  "body": "A blog post by a private school headteacher claiming reading fantasy such as Harry Potter and The Hunger Games can damage children\u2019s brains has set the internet ablaze. Here\u2019s a nice long quote from it:   Related: Neil Gaiman: 'my parents didn\u2019t have any kind of rules about what I couldn\u2019t read'     I want children to read literature that is conducive to their age and leave those mystical and frightening texts for when they can discern reality, and when they have first learned to love beauty. Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Game of Thrones, The Hunger Games, and Terry Pratchett, to mention only a few of the modern world\u2019s \u2018must-haves\u2019, contain deeply insensitive and addictive material which I am certain encourages difficult behaviour in children; yet they can be bought without a special licence, and can damage the sensitive subconscious brains of young children, many of whom may be added to the current statistics of mentally ill young children. For young adults, this literature, when it can be understood for what it is, is the choice of many! Buying sensational books is like feeding your child with spoons of added sugar, heaps of it, and when the child becomes addicted it will seek more and more, which if related to books, fills the bank vaults of those who write un-sensitive books for young children! \u2013 Graeme Whiting    Related: Alex Wheatle: I was mesmerised by Tolkien\u2019s inventiveness of language    And now fantasy writer Samantha Shannon tells us why she thinks Graeme Whiting is wrong, so wrong: It\u2019s difficult to isolate the strangest part of a recent blog post by a headteacher in Gloucester, entitled \u2018The Imagination of the Child\u2019. That anyone could seriously believe that books like Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings cause mental illness, and could feel comfortable making that claim without a shred of evidence; that anyone could seriously consider Shakespeare, of all people, more suitable for children; that anyone could wonder at why people are allowed to buy fantasy books without a \u201cspecial licence\u201d; that an educator could write any of these things on a school\u2019s website.     Samantha Shannon: I cherish my freedom to write and read whatever I choose, and how grateful I am that my parents and teachers only ever encouraged me to do so when I was still at school. Photograph: Tal Cohen/REX    As an author of dystopian fiction, my senses tingle when anyone \u2013 educators and politicians most of all \u2013 launch into these sorts of attacks on popular books. Having said that, I\u2019m not here to convert anyone to the unhallowed ways of us fantasy lovers, or call for an apology. What I am going to do is try to ascertain the difference between what Mr Whiting calls the \u201cold-fashioned values of traditional literature\u201d and the \u201cdark, demonic literature\u201d that drips from every corner of our modern world.   Related: Women in fantasy \u2013 the children's books podcast    Let\u2019s take Shakespeare as our main example. If you\u2019re not familiar with Titus Andronicus, one of the Bard\u2019s earliest plays, you should know that in it, Lavinia, daughter of Titus, is brutally raped. To ensure that she can betray her rapists\u2019 identities to no living soul, they take her hands and tongue. Her rapists mock the silence they inflicted: \u201cSo, now go tell, an if thy tongue can speak, / Who \u2018twas that cut thy tongue and ravish\u2019d thee\u201d. She is eventually able to name them only by gripping a stick in her mouth, steadying it with the stumps of her arms, and scratching their names in the dirt. She lives long enough to see them murdered by her father \u2013 who then murders her, in turn, out of shame that she was raped. Titus then has the rapists baked into a pie. If that\u2019s not going to damage the \u201csensitive subconscious brains of young children\u201d, nothing will. When I tried to think of an instance of similar grotesqueness in Harry Potter, the closest I could remember with was the scene in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire in which Wormtail slices off his own hand, providing the necessary \u201cflesh of the servant\u201d to resurrect Voldemort. Grim, yes \u2013 but let\u2019s face it, it\u2019s not quite in the same league as the image of the silent, violated, mutilated Lavinia. Does Titus Andronicus push the \u201cold-fashioned values of traditional literature\u201d \u2013 and if so, what exactly are they? I\u2019ll be generous: perhaps Mr Whiting was referring to a different Shakespeare play, like A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream or The Tempest \u2013 but surely they\u2019re as \u201ccarefully sprinkled with ideas of magic\u201d as Harry Potter, and could lead our fragile children down the path of the occult? Prospero is a sorcerer, after all.  I\u2019d be here all day if I were to continue plucking examples of fantasy from Shakespeare, but it\u2019s worth noting that some of Mr Whiting\u2019s other alternatives to the darkness of sensational literature include Keats and Shelley. (I\u2019m going to assume he doesn\u2019t mean Mary Shelley, because her fiction is, you know, quite dark.) I\u2019m no Keats scholar, but I have read \u2018Lamia\u2019, and good luck trying to explain the story behind that one to a nine-year-old. The problem here is selective perception about how many writers have made use of fantastical and magical ingredients in their work over the centuries. They are as inescapable in the classics as they are today. I\u2019ll leave you with this quote from Mr Whiting\u2019s blog post:         \u201cImagination is so rich and important that I cannot understand why any parent would not actively prevent exposure to modern-world electronic gadgets, screens, films and literature that will encumber the minds and especially the imagination of their children.\u201d I will treasure this piece of writing. I\u2019d like it framed to remind me of how much I cherish my freedom to write and read whatever I choose, and how grateful I am that my parents and teachers only ever encouraged me to do so when I was still at school. The logic of dictators and book-burners throughout history, crystallised in all its nonsensical glory: that imagination can only flourish when it\u2019s kept inside a cage.
