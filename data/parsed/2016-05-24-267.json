  "body": "Memphis Depay has shrugged off Louis van Gaal\u2019s departure from Manchester United and suggested that playing for Jos\u00e9 Mourinho would be \u201ca nice prospect\u201d. Depay was left out of the matchday squad for the FA Cup final victory over Crystal Palace on Saturday despite becoming Van Gaal\u2019s first signing at Old Trafford. The 64-year-old was finally informed he would be leaving his post as manager on Sunday night by Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman, with Mourinho now expected to succeed him.   Related: Jos\u00e9 Mourinho to Manchester United not the best fit but unlikely to be dull | Barney Ronay    Depay, who insisted that he would succeed at United after joining them for \u00a325m from PSV Eindhoven last summer, admitted things had not exactly gone to plan. \u201cI said this because I believe in myself. A love-hate relationship [with Van Gaal]? I do not know. And now he leaves \u2013 this is how things go in football and in life. You learn and you become stronger,\u201d he told De Telegraaf. \u201cIf the arrival of Mourinho becomes official, I\u2019ll ask Wesley Sneijder what kind of man he is. That\u2019s interesting. It all sounds so, but it is not yet official.\u201d De Telegraaf then reminded Depay that the former Internazionale midfielder Sneijder said Mourinho was the best coach he has ever worked under, to which the 22-year-old replied: \u201cThat\u2019s a nice prospect.\u201d Daley Blind was more sympathetic to his compatriot\u2019s plight. The defender, who was signed from Ajax in August 2014, admitted he felt the club could have handled Van Gaal\u2019s departure better. \u201cA manager at a big club in the Premier League will always be under pressure. But in the case of Van Gaal he has not been treated fairly over the last six months,\u201d he said. \u201cI think a manager with the status of Van Gaal, who has achieved so much in his career, deserved more respect. No matter what was said or written about him as a manager, he never stopped protecting us as players. \u201cHe has defended us under any kind of circumstances, he was always taking the stick instead of us. I think I can say that the whole squad is grateful for that, for what he has done in that respect for us as players.\u201d Blind added: \u201cAs players we kept believing in each other and we also kept believing in our manager, which was part of the reason we were able to win the FA Cup. We achieved this as a group, including the manager. In the end, this was a successful season in our eyes. \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed working with the manager so much. I would have liked to have carried on for a long while.\u201d",
