Unveiling its new four-year plan, the quango\u2019s chief executive, Jennie Price, said it would invest around a quarter of its annual budget on targeting inactivity, in response to a new government strategy published in December.   Related: Sports minister sets goals for a fitter nation after Olympic legacy stagnates    The move sees a lurch away from the earlier strategy, which was set before the London 2012 Olympics and was focused on getting more people to play more sport with only mixed results. \u201cThe heart of it is the government statement about needing to rebalance investment from people who would do this anyway to people who don\u2019t do it at all or don\u2019t do it very often,\u201d said Price. She said Sport England, which currently channels more than \u00a3450m into governing bodies over each four-year funding cycles, said that those who already played sport were now a third priority behind those who did no activity at all and those who do some exercise. Price said she was not prejudging where the organisation\u2019s money would go but that there would inevitably be less for governing bodies. \u201cWe are not looking at this through the lens of ringfencing money for types of organisations. It\u2019s not who you are, it\u2019s what you can do,\u201d said Price. \u201cSome NGBs have been brilliant at working with the mass market, starting to run, starting to play some of the more recreational sports. The policy direction is really clear that the core market needs to be funded at lower public subsidy.\u201d She said that Sport England, which will now target its investment at children and young people from the age of five rather than the current threshold of 14, would also seek to learn the lessons of its award-winning consumer campaign, This Girl Can. \u201cHow can the public money that we\u2019re responsible for make more difference. If tackling inactivity is the biggest priority, how do we do that?\u201d She said that more than a quarter of the population were officially defined as inactive because they did less than 30 minutes of activity per week, including walking. Pilot projects will be established in 10 areas \u2013 a mixture of cities, towns and rural locations \u2013 to explore new ways of working with local authorities and local health schemes and \u00a330m earmarked for a new volunteering strategy.",
