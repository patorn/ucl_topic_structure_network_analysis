  "body": "Picture this, you attend a wedding of a former colleague only to be contacted later because the newyweds feel (horror of horrors) that the gift you gave was not generous enough. It\u2019s a situation that an unnamed guest has claimed to have been in, posting the story to a forum on Mumsnet asking for advice after she was told the \u00a3100 cheque she provided wasn\u2019t enough.   Related: Bride and groom write to guest demanding 'adjustment' to \u00a3100 gift    It\u2019s caused much discussion, with many saying that the person should cancel their cheque immediately. While the details of this case are patchy (and we are only hearing one side of this story) it has prompted an interesting debate: how much should you spend on a wedding gift? We want to hear from our readers. What\u2019s the most or least you\u2019ve ever given? What gift is appropriate for a former colleague compared to a life-long friend? Has wedding gift etiquette changed over time? Have you found yourself in a similar situation to the person from Mumsnet?  Tell us your stories via the form below.",
