Written by Moran and her sister Caz, Raised by Wolves is a reimagining of the pair\u2019s childhood and set on a Wolverhampton council estate.

Her later credits include Jennifer\u2019s Body, Young Adult, and Showtime series United States of Tara.   Related: Raised by Wolves review \u2013 a heartwarming tale of Black Country folk    The Moran sisters\u2019 comedy is expected to be transferred from the English midlands to midwest America for its US adaptation but will keep many of the original\u2019s characters and tropes. It is being made by Warner Bros-based Berlanti Productions and co-executive produced by Greg Berlanti whose credits include Supergirl and The Flash. Several US broadcasters are understood to have chased the show when it first aired on Channel 4. Its UK producers Big Talk went ahead with the Cody adaptation after meetings with various writers and producers in the US. Cody has also been in touch with Moran, the writer and Times columnist, about the show and how it will be reinvented in the US. It is understood that discussions about a possible US adaptation began about a year ago.  Other executive producers on the show include Caitlin Moran, Caz Moran and Big Talk\u2019s Kenton Allen, along with Matthew Justice, Caroline Leddy and Berlanti Productions\u2019 Sarah Schechter. Berlanti and Big Talk are represented by William Morris Endeavour.",
