Just 10 days after taking office, the planning minister, Romero Juc\u00e1, announced that he would \u201cgo on leave\u201d following the release of a secretly taped telephone conversation in which he said Rousseff needed to be removed to quash a vast corruption investigation that implicated him and other members of the country\u2019s political elite. It is unlikely to be the last blow for the interim president, Michel Temer, whose centre-right cabinet includes seven ministers implicated by the Lava Jato (Car Wash) investigation into kickbacks and money laundering at the state-run oil company Petrobras.   Related: Brazil turns right as old elite wastes no time erasing Workers' party influence    Temer took power earlier this month after the senate initiated an impeachment trial of Rousseff, who is suspended for up to six months pending the upper house\u2019s verdict on allegations that she manipulated government accounts before the last election.  Supporters of the Workers\u2019 party leader say the charges are a pretext for a \u201ccoup\u201d. Temer\u2019s allies counter that the impeachment was constitutional and necessary to address political paralysis and the worst recession in decades. But the dubious motives and machiavellian nature of the plot to remove Rousseff are apparent in the transcript of a phone conversation between Juc\u00e1 \u2013 a powerful ally of Temer\u2019s in the Brazilian Democratic Movement party (PMDB) \u2013 and S\u00e9rgio Machado, a former senator who until recently was the president of another state oil company, Transpetro. After discussing how they are both targeted by Lava Jato prosecutors, Juc\u00e1 says the way out is political: \u201cWe have to stop this shit,\u201d he says of the investigation. \u201cWe have to change the government to be able to stop this bleeding.\u201d  Machado concurs: \u201cThe easiest solution would be to put in Michel [Temer].\u201d The conversation took place just weeks before the lower house voted to impeach Rousseff, according to the Folha de S\u00e3o Paulo newspaper, which published the transcript.  At one point, Juc\u00e1 appears to mock the Lava Jato investigators for their high-mindedness and determination to tackle all corrupt senators and congressmen. \u201c[They want to] put an end to this political class so [a new one] can rise, to build a new breed [that will be] pure.\u201d  He then says the \u201cpenny has dropped\u201d on this threat not just for him, but for the leaders of the Social Democratic party, such as former presidential candidate A\u00e9cio Neves, Senator Aloysio Neves, Jos\u00e9 Serra and Tasso Jereissati \u2013 all of whom are now either in the cabinet of the interim government or key supporters of the coalition. Later in the conversation, Juca says he talked about his plans to supreme court justices, who told him the \u201cshit\u201d (referring to the corruption investigation and its media coverage) would never stop as long as Rousseff remained in power. He also said he received \u201cguarantees\u201d from military commanders that they could prevent disturbances from radical leftwing groups such as the Landless Workers Movement. Juc\u00e1 \u2013 who took the influential post of planning minister in the interim government \u2013 admitted on Monday that the conversation had taken place, but he said his words were taken out of context. He argued that he was referring to economic losses when he talked about \u201cthe bleeding\u201d. His lawyer, Almeida Castro, reiterated this: \u201cAt no time was Juc\u00e1 speaking against Lava Jato or seeking to interfere with the operation.\u201d  But Machado, who was the source of the recording, is already reportedly negotiating a plea bargain with prosecutors. According to reports in local media, Juc\u00e1 has said he will stay on leave until prosecutors decide whether he has committed any crime.           Dilma Rousseff: the impeached Brazilian president    During the Lava Jato investigation, Juc\u00e1 was named in a plea bargain by former senator Delc\u00eddio Amaral as a beneficiary in a 30m reais (\u00a35.7m) kickback scheme from inflated contracts for the Belo Monte hydroelectric dam in the Amazon. He has denied the charges, which are being considered by the supreme court. The Workers\u2019 party has also been deeply implicated in this and other wrongdoing, though Rousseff \u2013 who has not been charged with any crimes \u2013 allowed the Lava Jato investigation to continue while she was in charge. Temer has insisted that he too would not interfere. But many fear his new justice minister, Alexandre de Moraes, will reduce the scope of federal police activities. Moraes has previously been a defence lawyer for Eduardo Cunha, the suspended lower house speaker who is a chief target of Lava Jato investigators.  In an interview with the Guardian last month, Juc\u00e1 denied that he, Cunha, Temer and other members of the PMDB were planning to rein back the Lava Jato investigation for the sake of stability.  \u201cOn the contrary, I think it\u2019s necessary to accelerate Lava Jato,\u201d he said. \u201cYou need to separate the wheat from the chaff, separate the guilty from the innocent. Political stability will be created by the innocent and by the credibility of politics for society. Today, credibility is low and the level of representability of politicians and parties is very low. We have to recover politics, which is an instrument to diminish conflicts and set a direction for the country.\u201d  But the interim administration he helped to create has shown little sign of reducing tension or restoring credibility. The all-male, all-white cabinet has been heavily criticised as unrepresentative of the country, its austerity policies are unpopular and its leader has already backed down on removing the ministerial status of the culture ministry in the face of protests by leading artists, musicians and film-makers.",
