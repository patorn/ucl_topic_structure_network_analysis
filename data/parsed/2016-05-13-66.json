  "body": "\u201cI wanted to see what I would do if\u00a0I came up against something like that,\u201d says Sarah Quinn. \u201cMy heart was racing and you go into panic mode, thinking: \u2018What do I do?\u2019 I\u00a0slung\u00a0tables and chairs on top of me and hid underneath. My thought was that if there\u2019s less body on show, the less they could shoot me. At one point, I was dragged along the floor by two men, because they saw my injuries and thought that was the best way to react.\u201d Quinn, who works for\u00a0the probation service, has been a\u00a0volunteer with the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service for a couple of\u00a0months, and that is why she found herself in Manchester\u2019s Trafford Centre in the early hours of Tuesday morning, cowering under a table with a gash to the head, glass in her arm and gunshots echoing around the shopping mall. She was taking part in a drill to test the skills and capabilities of the police, counter-terrorism units, fire and ambulance services in the\u00a0north of England in the event of a terrorist attack \u2013 in this case, involving a\u00a0suicide bombing and masked gunmen. A video clip shows a bomb going off outside a burger restaurant, which leaves dozens of people lying \u201ckilled\u201d or \u201cinjured\u201d on the ground, while others run off screaming. Quinn arrived at the shopping centre at 8pm to get her makeup done \u2013 blood on her face and fake glass in her arm. \u201cThere were actors for the main parts so they had the worst makeup, but we had cuts and bruises. It looked really real. When someone came back from makeup, you thought: \u2018That looks like a\u00a0right good beating.\u2019\u201d If you could ignore the ear defenders and safety goggles. And when the explosion happened, and the gunfire was cracking, it felt real, she says. \u201cIt was a case of: \u2018Where should I run?\u2019 The explosion and gunfire was echoing and you couldn\u2019t tell where you needed to run. You could have run straight into something. It was scary. Even though you knew it wasn\u2019t real, it really felt real.\u201d The aftermath was also rehearsed: ambulance crew checked her out and the police took a statement.           Mock terror attack staged at Manchester\u2019s Trafford Centre    The police had been planning the exercise since last autumn, says assistant chief constable Rebekah Sutcliffe. Hundreds of people were involved, as well as a huge range of organisations, from the Home Office, military and counter-terrorism network to the Trafford Centre owners. Senior officers were also being trained. \u201cI was involved as a commander, and you\u00a0do forget it\u2019s not real at times,\u201d she\u00a0says. \u201cYou\u2019ve got that element of knowing it\u2019s\u00a0an exercise but you\u2019re under pressure \u2013 it\u2019s a quick-moving exercise, so you feel that reality.\u201d What they are testing, she says, is not just an individual\u2019s ability or preparedness for an event such as this, \u201cyou\u2019re also testing how long it takes to turn out a particular capability.So if you need somebody to come from Merseyside to Manchester to be part of the control room \u2013 how long does that take them, and have you got the communications systems you need? You\u2019re testing all of the infrastructure that supports your response and identifying what works well and what works less well.\u201d What didn\u2019t work so well, it became clear, was attention to cultural sensitivity and the idea that not all terrorists are Islamic extremists \u2013 someone shouted the phrase \u201cAllahu Akbar\u201d as the bomb detonated, for which the police have been heavily criticised. \u201cClearly we\u2019ve had problems with the use of the phrase, which has been really unfortunate, and we\u2019ve given an apology for that, quite rightly,\u201d says Sutcliffe. \u201cBut in terms of the exercise objective and training we needed to get out of it, it has\u00a0been a huge success.\u201d The police have said they need to be more culturally aware in future. \u201cIf you were wielding a sword or a firearm in an exercise in the Trafford Centre, they would have made sure [to make it safe],\u201d says Francesca Hunt, co-director of immersive security roleplay company CrisisCast. \u201cWhat they were doing was wielding an emotional phrase without the equivalent care and expertise.\u201d     \u2018It\u2019s not what we call jazz-hands acting\u2019 \u2026 actors taking part in the drill at the Trafford Centre. Photograph: Sean Hansford/MEN/AFP/Getty    CrisisCast was founded by Hunt and Brian Mitchell \u2013 both are actors and have worked in film production, and brought this knowledge to disaster and crisis management training. They can create a 20-car pile-up, or recreate an incident in a nuclear power station; later this year they will be staging a plane crash at an airport, complete with wrecked fuselage, to test the capabilities of the airport fire service. They use smoke, prosthetics and medically trained makeup artists who, says Mitchell, \u201cknow what a bullet hole really looks like, and the colour of blood. On some exercises you\u2019ll see very pink blood, but blood is more coffee-coloured. It\u2019s dark when it comes out.\u201d   Related: Police apologise for 'Allahu Akbar' use in mock Manchester attack    Their 400 actors have also been trained by a psychologist so they know how they should react in a traumatic situation. \u201cIt\u2019s not what we call jazz-hands acting,\u201d says Hunt. \u201cIt\u2019s not about trying to do a big show and doing a great Lady Macbeth bit \u2013 \u2018Oh my god, I\u2019ve got blood on my hands.\u2019 It\u2019s to do with making sure the person you\u2019re dealing with gets caught in the realism.\u201d And it is very real, says another member of the team, Mick Massey, who spent 30 years with the London fire brigade. \u201cIt\u2019s as real as you can get without it actually happening,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s about developing muscle memory. The only way, sadly, I learned that was from real incidents.\u201d As a young fireman, his\u00a0first major incident was the blast at the Olympia exhibition centre in west London in 1976, blamed on a breakaway IRA group; he was also at the 7/7 attacks and the Paddington rail disaster. \u201cThe more realism you put in, the more comfortable you feel \u2013 if you can feel comfortable \u2013 when it happens for real.\u201d",
