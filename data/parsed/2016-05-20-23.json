Variety reports that the film is now the fourth Marvel movie to make over $1bn, having taken $314m in America, after 14 days in cinemas, and $677m in the rest of the world, where it has been out for 23 days.   Related: Marvel's hulking haul: studio's films have grossed $10bn since 2008    Starring a bevy of superheroes played by actors including Paul Rudd, Robert Downey Jr, Scarlett Johansson, Don Cheadle and Tom Holland, the Captain America franchise has helped propel Marvel to a $10bn gross since the studio was relaunched in 2008 with a new raft of superhero movies, largely masterminded by producer Kevin Feige.  Captain America: Civil War still has some distance to go before it beats Marvel\u2019s champion The Avengers, which in 2012 became the first of the studio\u2019s movies to gross over $1bn. It went on to earn $1.5bn at the global box office and is the fifth-highest grossing film of all time. The No1 remains Avatar, which grossed $2.8bn.",
