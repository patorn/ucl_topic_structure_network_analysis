  "body": "Louis van Gaal has indicated his reign as Manchester United\u2019s manager has finished. The Dutchman said \u201cit\u2019s over\u201d as he left the Manchester United hotel on Sunday morning following his side\u2019s 2-1 extra-time victory over Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final on Saturday.   Related: Louis van Gaal: from Iron Tulip to muddled thinker at Manchester United    With intense speculation that he is to be replaced by the former Chelsea manager Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Van Gaal was asked by a Sky Sports reporter if he would stop to speak. He refused but said: \u201cIt\u2019s over.\u201d Should Van Gaal leave the post he assumed following David Moyes\u2019s sacking in 2014, he will depart after two seasons in charge, with United finishing fourth in the league in his first campaign and fifth this season. Though he won the FA Cup on Saturday, his side went out in the group stage of the Champions League and were then eliminated by Liverpool in the Europa League. Van Gaal turned up at the post-match press conference at Wembley with the FA Cup in his hands, and placed it on the table in front of him. \u201cI show you the Cup, I don\u2019t discuss my future with the media,\u201d he said defiantly. \u201cSome of you have had me sacked already.\u201d However, on Sunday morning, he appeared to confirm he is to no longer to remain the Manchester United manager.

Mourinho has already agreed a salary and has discussed transfer targets with the club and is likely to be presented as the new manager once his agent, Jorge Mendes, has finalised the finer details of the contract.",
