  "body": "J\u00fcrgen Klopp performed a U-turn at Anfield but only in respect of his invitation to Liverpool fans to flock en\u00a0masse to Basel for the Europa League final. His team\u2019s momentum on home soil remains consistent. There was little between Watford and a much-changed Liverpool pursuing a sixth-place finish in the Premier League aside from an end product \u2013 a significant difference, admittedly, and one that explains why Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores was again left defending his position and achievement this season after an encouraging display yielded zero return. Liverpool gave his players a lesson in execution. Joe Allen and the substitute Roberto Firmino punished two defensive lapses to extend Liverpool\u2019s unbeaten run at Anfield to 12 matches in all competitions, the Brazilian becoming the team\u2019s first player to 10 league goals this season in the process.

There was only one concern \u2013 his advice to those without tickets for the final to travel to Switzerland for the showdown with Sevilla on 18\u00a0May. Unprompted, Klopp opened his post-match press conference by saying: \u201cI just learned this is my 49th game \u2013 you usually need one and a half years for that \u2013 and that\u2019s about 5,000 press conferences. I\u2019ve said lot of things in these press conferences and the last time I spoke, about Basel, I spoke like a supporter. I do that sometimes because I like this game. \u201cI invited all Liverpool fans to Basel and that was not too smart, to be honest. It is a nice city but it\u2019s not ready for us and that was my mistake. So I have to take back my invitation to the fans. Please, only people with tickets should go there, because otherwise everything else will be chaos. If you cannot be there, then stay at home or come to Liverpool and watch the game with your friends and let\u2019s have a party afterwards. It\u2019s really, really important you listen. It\u2019s important we only send the team and the 10,000 fans.\u201d Liverpool\u2019s penultimate Premier League game at Anfield unfolded at a pedestrian pace on a sweltering Merseyside day. Watford were content to sit deep with two banks of four and hit Klopp\u2019s team on the counterattack, an approach that might have paid dividends but for late interventions by Liverpool defenders and hesitancy in front of Simon Mignolet\u2019s goal. Odion Ighalo broke through a makeshift central defensive pairing of Martin Skrtel and Lucas Leiva from the visitors\u2019 first break and was taking aim when Alberto Moreno dived in to Liverpool\u2019s rescue. A misplaced pass from Allen offered Ighalo opportunity to chip Mignolet from over 30 yards, the effort sailing just wide, and Almen Abdi volleyed over from Ikechi Anya\u2019s break down the left. Flores\u2019s side cut through Liverpool\u2019s rearguard too easily in the first half, although the defence received little protection in midfield. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Jurado had time and space to float an inviting ball over Skrtel for Ighalo to break into the area. Once again, just as the striker shaped to connect, a Liverpool defender\u2019s boot intervened. Skrtel nicked the ball from Ighalo and made another block from Abdi\u2019s goalbound drive at the resulting corner. Despite the best endeavours of Sheyi Ojo, Liverpool\u2019s dominance in possession did not yield many clear-cut openings but they were far more clinical with the chances that did arrive. Watford were handed a punishing lesson in the cost of losing concentration in the Premier League.

There was no defender near Christian Benteke when Coutinho\u2019s cross picked out the recalled striker inside the Watford area. Benteke cushioned a header towards the penalty spot where the unmarked Allen steered the ball under the hesitant Gomes. Ighalo thought he had drawn Watford level when Troy Deeney\u2019s touch released him inside the area and, having stepped away from Moreno\u2019s challenge, his shot was destined for the top corner only for Mignolet to produce a superb finger-tip save. Liverpool made the game safe when Anya\u2019s attempted clearance was charged down by Ojo and rebounded to Firmino. The Brazilian was given a free run at goal as Watford\u2019s defenders backed off and his low shot took a slight deflection before sailing through Gomes\u2019s unconvincing guard. \u201cSpeculation in football is normal,\u201d said Flores amid uncertainty over his position at Vicarage Road. \u201cYou need to live with this kind of talk but sometimes life is ridiculous. I\u2019m really proud of the players and how Watford have played during the season. It is important to be realistic and to enjoy the moment we are living with Watford. I can be sad if people around me are not enjoying the experience. I suffer that but not for me.\u201d Man of the match Joe Allen (Liverpool)",
