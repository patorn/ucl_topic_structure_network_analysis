  "body": "GO WEST Big Paper first mentioned the site in 1901. \u201cBoleyn Castle, an ancient building in East London, for some years the home of Anne Boleyn before her ill-fated marriage with Henry VIII, has been purchased for conversion into a chapel and industrial school, and will form the religious centre of the Canning Town and Barking Roman Catholic Mission,\u201d we reported. \u201cThe castle and grounds have very often attracted the attention of the speculative builder, but all his overtures have been refused. It is confidently hoped that under the care of its new guardians many of the historic characteristics of the place will be preserved.\u201d   Related: 'Something irreplaceable is being lost': West Ham fans pay tribute to Upton Park    Reader, the naivety! Three years later West Ham moved into those very grounds, and the Castle was left to go to ruin before eventually being demolished in the 1950s. The football club\u2019s commitment to preserving \u201cthe historic characteristics of the place\u201d amounted to little more than supergluing some plastic facsimile turrets to the bit of stadium nearest the car park half a century later, showing the same disregard for historical verisimilitude that Sam Allardyce later displayed for the club\u2019s footballing traditions, only without the furious supporters\u2019 backlash. Anyway, fast forward a few years and absolutely nobody was refusing the overtures of speculative builders in 2014, shortly after they won the right to occupy the Olympic Stadium down the road, when the Hammers agreed to sell the site \u2013 long since snaffled on a freehold basis \u2013 to the Gaillard Group, who plan to rapidly construct an \u201cEast End Village\u201d including 700 homes. Boleyn Castle, Boleyn Ground, Upton Park \u2013 whatever you call it, you won\u2019t have to for long (Boleyn Ground, suddenly de rigueur, is a strange kind of semi-neologism that was spectacularly rare until very recently; it only got into double figures for all-time Guardian mentions in 1991). On Tuesday night, Manchester United visit for the final home league fixture before the Hammers relocate and the redevelopers move in. As it happens, the first time Big Paper mentioned the Boleyn Ground by that particular name was in the build-up to a visit from the very same club in 1911. \u201cThe Boleyn Ground, which owes its name to the fact that it is practically on the site of what it is said used to be Anne Boleyn\u2019s house, is rather small, with railings very near the touchline,\u201d we wrote. \u201cBut it is unlikely that the Manchester men will be severely handicapped by the absence of space. Men of their skill and experience should be able to overcome these dangers.\u201d Later that year we wrote that \u201cthe compactness of the Boleyn Castle ground brings everything so close to the spectators as to almost exaggerate the tenseness of a struggle\u201d.

Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images    No longer so compact, it will at least be packed for the visit of Louis van Gaal\u2019s crew. The tenseness of Tuesday\u2019s struggle comes from the fact that United would steal into the Premier League\u2019s top four should they win, would have their current fifth place imperilled should they lose, and would be guaranteed at least that position should they draw. \u201cThe Upton Park stadium was [warning: historical inaccuracy alert \u2013 Fiver Ed] a first home,\u201d sniffed current coach Slaven Bilic of the club\u2019s imminent farewell. \u201cNo matter where you move after that \u2013 if you move to a fancy apartment, a big house or to a mansion \u2013 your favourite one is always the first.\u201d As far as Tuesday\u2019s entertainment is concerned \u2013 and you\u2019ll have to find your own way to deal with this paradox \u2013 the final whistle won\u2019t sound until some time after the final whistle has sounded. That\u2019s because the Hammers have planned a \u00a3250,000 post-match ceremony, featuring \u201cspectacular lighting, music and big screen video to match the scale and emotion of the evening\u201d. This sounds to The Fiver very much like a cunning but at least potentially diverting ruse to stop supporters running on to the pitch and generally causing havoc by taking for nothing the things the club plan to sell them for loads of money in the very near future. \u201cAny incursions on to the pitch will certainly mean cancelling the current squad\u2019s richly-deserved lap of appreciation and denying some of our greatest ever players the chance to take the field for the final time,\u201d warned Gollivan, who plan to offer season-ticket holders the chance to keep forever the seats they\u2019ve already paid for and are no longer needed for just the additional \u00a350. \u201cThis would be a tragedy, for them and the Boleyn Ground.\u201d And perhaps for West Ham\u2019s bank account, which like its owners\u2019 soon-to-be-ex-home, may not be immune from some speculative building.

FIVER LETTERS \u201cManuel Pellegrini is indeed charming and in his first season in charge was \u2013 as you point out (yesterday\u2019s Fiver) \u2013 pretty darn good, winning two out of three domestic trophies. Of course, that didn\u2019t stop bozo sportswriters awarding Manager of the Season to Brendan Rodgers, who was neither charming nor successful. But that\u2019s journalists for you. No offence\u201d \u2013 John Caley. \u201cLack of investment up front is what is costing Norwich this season, says the manager who spent \u00a38.5m on Steven Naismith, who averaged one goal in every four games for the Pope\u2019s O\u2019Rangers (when they were competing with the Queen\u2019s Celtic in the SPL), one goal in every five games for Everton and one goal in every seven games for Scotland\u201d \u2013 Noble Francis. \u201cIt was some years ago now that I jumped ship from my inbox of spam to avoid the daily grind of trying to find The Fiver email buried between invitations to increase certain parts of my anatomy and Labour Party emails from Jeremy Corbyn that were definitely not written by Jeremy Corbyn. So I now read your lame attempts at football-related humour on your mobile app thingy. Yet it seems, like Blackpool, your Big Paper overlords continue to relegate you to what can only be described as the Conference North position of newspaper articles near the bottom of the football section of said app thingy. Perhaps plucky Leicester\u2019s inspired season could encourage you to break off the shackles of Big Paper\u2019s embarrassed Luke Chadwick lookalike and try to reach the lofty heights of two thumb scrolls rather than 20?\u201d \u2013 Jon Techilovsky. \u201cKenneth Hanson\u2019s ire (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters) at The Fiver overlooking Burnley\u2019s achievement [it did make the SWMs \u2013 Fiver Hung-out-to-dry Media Officer] is matched by my wry smile at the invisibility of all the Football League. Barnsley went from bottom of League One at Christmas to a play-off place in the last game of the season, winning the Football League Trophy on the way. The Guardian\u2019s coverage? A feature describing how an American became a Leicester fan after watching them beat Barnsley 1-0 years ago, and a mention in Joy of Six for their fans\u2019 nihilistic chant [? \u2013 FHOTDMO].

BITS AND BOBS Bayern Munich have ensured the Bundesliga will remain the level playing field for which it is a byword, by signing Mats Hummels from Dortmund and Benfica\u2019s Renato Sanches. \u201cWe have been keeping an eye on Renato Sanches for a long time and are very happy to have signed him despite a lot of competition for him,\u201d whooped Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, as Mr Ed feebly pointed at an old press release about an official spirits partner.     A done deal, earlier. Photograph: Getty Images for FC Bayern    Bobby M has told Newcastle and Norwich that Everton won\u2019t confirm their relegation by rolling over at Sunderland. Strange, given that\u2019s what they\u2019ve done in every other away game for the past three months \u2026 \u201cWe are not going to make the mistake of losing attention from the only thing that matters at this time,\u201d he cheered.
