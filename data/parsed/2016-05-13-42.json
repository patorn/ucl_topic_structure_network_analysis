  "body": "Fifa\u2019s new president, Gianni Infantino, has appointed the first female secretary general in the organisation\u2019s chequered history as he battles to restore its battered reputation. Infantino said Fatma Samoura, a Senegalese UN official with no previous experience in sport, would bring a \u201cfresh wind\u201d as its most senior executive as he attempts to convince the world that Fifa is capable of reform. \u201cShe is used to managing big organisations, big budgets, human resources, finance,\u201d Infantino told Fifa\u2019s Congress in Mexico City. \u201cShe will bring a fresh wind to Fifa, somebody from outside not somebody from inside, not somebody from the past. Somebody new, somebody who can help us do the right thing in the future.\u201d   Related: Michel Platini resigns as Uefa president after ban reduced to four years    Assuming she passes an eligibility test, the 54-year-old will replace the disgraced J\u00e9r\u00f4me Valcke, who was one of a slew of Fifa executives banned over wide-ranging corruption allegations. Valcke was banned for 12 years earlier this year. \u201cThis new Fifa is about change and about leadership. It\u2019s about not being afraid of bold decisions sometimes,\u201d added Infantino. Samoura, who has worked at the UN since 1995 and acted as a representative or director in six countries, said: \u201cI believe this role is a perfect fit for my skills and experience \u2013 strategic, high-impact team building in international settings \u2013 which I will use to help grow the game of football all over the world. I also look forward to bringing my experience in governance and compliance to bear on the important reform work that is already under way at Fifa.\u201d Infantino, the Swiss Italian former Uefa secretary general who took over from his now banned predecessor, Sepp Blatter, in February, also unveiled a four-year build-up to the next World Cup hosting decision. Fifa\u2019s meltdown was sparked by the chaotic joint bidding race for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups and Infantino insisted the 2026 process would not follow suit. \u201cAfter all the issues and criticisms that happened around the last World Cup bidding process it is absolutely crucial for Fifa\u2019s credibility that we have a bullet-proof World Cup bidding process in place,\u201d he said. Infantino also outlined his plans to increase the amount of development funding to member associations. He said the current arrangements were \u201ca mess\u201d and would be replaced with a single programme called Forward. He said Fifa would sign contracts with each member association for development projects that will increase their income from $1.6m (\u00a31.1m) to $5m (\u00a33.5m) over four years. \u201cFifa will increase the investment for member associations. It\u2019s not just throwing out money; we will ask for more accountability,\u201d he warned. \u201cThis money is to invest in football. Don\u2019t betray us.\u201d",
