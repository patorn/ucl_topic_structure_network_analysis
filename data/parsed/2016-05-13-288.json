  "body": "Few actors have made the transition from blockbuster lead to arthouse darling with such finesse as Kristen Stewart. The star, who shot to fame with the Twilight franchise in her teens, appears in two films at this year\u2019s Cannes film festival: Woody Allen\u2019s Cafe Society and Personal Shopper, her second film with French director Olivier Assayas \u2013 the first, Clouds of Sils Maria, made her the first American woman to win a Cesar award.  Speaking to promote Cafe Society at the festival, Stewart spoke of her respect and admiration for both directors, and her happiness in France, praising \u201cthe risk taken that\u2019s different from why people make movies in the States\u201d. She was eager to work with film-makers with \u201creckless intentions\u201d, she said, adding: \u201cI feel like there\u2019s something psychic that happens when people are drawn to each other to make something. And I have so much faith in that that I will always follow it. And I will definitely make a few missteps and a few bad movies and things that aren\u2019t so sure.\u201d   Related: Caf\u00e9 Society review \u2013 Woody Allen's amiable, if insubstantial, tribute to golden-age Hollywood    Stewart will soon begin shooting her own film \u2013 a short based on her own script \u2013 and said she took inspiration from Assayas and Allen, as well as Sean Penn, with whom she worked on 2007\u2018s Into the Wild, one of the first of her various left-field films.            Caf\u00e9 Society: trailer for new Woody Allen film    \u201cI thought: \u2018Yep, that\u2019s how I\u2019m going to do it!\u2019\u201d she said of watching Penn work. \u201cThere\u2019s a firm, almost staggeringly strong diligence, yet he\u2019s so trusting in the process of discovery that what happens is always like lightning in a bottle. I really love the idea of creating an environment in which you can just completely expose yourself and do things you otherwise wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Once in a high-profile relationship with Twilight co-star Robert Pattinson, Stewart also discussed her changing relations with the media and her own ease with her private life. She recently told Variety she was impressed by the happiness of today\u2019s teenagers to not be sexually pigeonholed, and would be keen to advocate for LGBT rights. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be too guarded,\u201d said Stewart of being photographed with whoever it is she happens to be dating. \u201cI got really exceedingly famous at 17, and at 17 you don\u2019t really know how to interact with more than a couple of people. You\u2019re trying to figure it out. Who are you? What do I seem like? Can I affect that? Should I think about that? So then when it\u2019s thrust at you and that conversation is owned by the masses and not just you or the closest people to you it kickstarts this weird thought process that is really unnatural.\u201d The situation, said Stewart, caused her to \u201cjust really shut down. I was so guarded. And that really doesn\u2019t provide a fully- lived life. There are ways to interact with media and there are ways to interact with the public and, beyond that, just human beings. Because those are all very different things. \u201cSo I\u2019ve found this balance of ignoring the things I find worthless and really letting in the stuff that feels human and that is by not hiding and being honest.\u201d",
