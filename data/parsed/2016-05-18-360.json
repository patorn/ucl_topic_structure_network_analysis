  "body": "Australian cultural identity is balanced at the edge of a cliff. This country\u2019s scientific advancement, its artistic communities and the national institutions that curate its stories and make it possible to tell new ones are buckling under what can only be seen as ideologically driven federal government funding cuts. The internationally lauded CSIRO is shedding hundreds of jobs, many in its climate science realm.  Last Friday the full legacy of the federal coalition government\u2019s $300m-plus cuts to the arts sector since 2013 (including a net $73m to the Australia Council) became apparent when \u201cOzCo\u201d announced which (mostly) small to medium sized arts organisations had lost funding. The net creative and human impact of this will be vast and catastrophic. It will cost hundreds, perhaps thousands, of livelihoods across the sectors. Arts administrators, writers, performers, visual artists, dancers, choreographers \u2013 many of whom already struggle to cobble together a living wage \u2013 are in personal crisis. Meanwhile, after years of successive budget cuts, Australia\u2019s leading national cultural institutions are also shedding dozens of staff and considering savings, including shorter opening hours and abandoning critical digitisation, to cope with another \u201cefficiency dividend\u201d (read funding attack to the tune of about $20m) in the last mid-year economic and fiscal outlook.   Related: Australian election 2016: Turnbull asked about Dutton's claim 'illiterate' refugees would take jobs \u2013 politics live    The emasculation of the arts sector and the attack on publicly funded scientific research that began under Tony Abbott\u2019s administration has continued seamlessly under Malcolm Turnbull. While arts communities easily cast Abbott as a villainous Philistine and held out hope that his more urbane successor would put his money where his artistic patronage was, Turnbull has just been more of the same with nicer manners. Unlike Abbott, Turnbull believes in the science of climate change and the virtue of investment in the arts \u2013 but does it matter if the outcome is the same? How does Australia really want to see itself, and be seen? Since well before federation the Australian colonies exported their stories, culture, history and innovation, participating in world expositions from London in 1851 and Paris in 1855 to Chicago in 1893. The colonial cringe gave way to a 20th century of international achievement, recognition and endeavour in research and artistic production that gathered pace (ironically perhaps) with the establishment of the Australia Council by the Liberal Holt government in 1967. Australia has a long tradition of bipartisan political support \u2013 demonstrated by funding commitments \u2013 for the ethos that a healthy creative sector, supported by government, is a vital sign of democracy and civilisation. The Australia Council has been critical to that. Funding for the arts has waxed and waned and been eroded by inflation, but fundamental support has remained largely consistent. The virtue of OzCo\u2019s funding of individuals, as well as medium-sized and large artistic entities, has been at once the sustainability of a broad arts sector that employs hundreds of thousands, and the encouragement of individual excellence. In literature alone, dozens of Australian writers who have made (and continue to make) national and international names for themselves would not have been able to without Australia Council financial support. Adversity in artistic pursuit is nothing new. But there is now a pervading sense that first Abbott\u2019s and now Turnbull\u2019s governments are demonstrating open hostility towards the creative sector. The national institutions (the Film and Sound Archive, the National Library of Australia, the National Museum, the Portrait Gallery, the Museum of Australian Democracy and the National Gallery) battle on, doing more with less, losing staff through redundancy and attrition, all the while nobly continuing to financially support individual artists through fellowships and stipends. While devastating, the latest $20m or so cut in the midyear outlook is \u2013 like the attack on Australia Council funding and the recent budget \u201csavings\u201d in the arts more generally \u2013 small change for the government, considering its other priorities. Like replacing submarines ($50bn) and imprisoning asylum seekers in offshore living hell ($1.2bn last year for Nauru and Manus alone).   Related: Arts workers should be angry about funding cuts \u2013 we can't work harder for less    Government spending is a window into ideological priority. It tells us what governments choose to celebrate. Right now, for example, the government is investing up to $600m of public and private money in the Anzac centenary. It includes some $100m on an \u201cinterpretative centre\u201d in France, dedicated to Australian war dead who are already appropriately memorialised. What a difference that money could make to the living. The attacks on national institutions, arts and science makes for a holy trinity of cultural crises. Australia\u2019s strong reputation as a place that cultivates and nurtures artistic and knowledge culture stands at the edge of a precipice. Will it stand or will it fall?",
