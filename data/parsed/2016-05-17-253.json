  "body": "Dairy farmers still adjusting to a sudden drop in the farmgate price of milk are skeptical of the direct benefit of an announcement by supermarket giant Coles, which plans to release a premium brand of milk to maintain a new industry support fund. John Durkan, the managing director of Coles, told ABC radio the new milk brand would be marketed as assisting farmers and feed $0.20 a litre into the new farming fund, which was established with a balance of $1m. But the company would not increase the price of the $1 a litre homebrand milk, which is matched by competitor Woolworths.    Related: Northern Territory fracking debate 'life or death', says cattle farmer    Durkan said the fund was established in response to the drop in milk prices led by Australian dairy farmer cooperative Murray Goulburn, which dropped its season prices from $5.60 per kilogram of milk solids to between $4.75 and $5 per kilogram in late April. \u201cAs we have seen over the last three years the payments to farmers have been pretty strong and the sudden change will certainly have brought difficulty and we want to help in any way we can,\u201d he said. It mirrors similar funds in South Australia and Western Australia, which invest money into education and research. Durkan said the brand would be launched within two months, and farmers would see the \u201cdirect benefit.\u201d The Murray Goulburn price cut was a correction for the company overestimating the international market, which created a shortfall of between $170m and $200m. It will be applied retrospectively to the 2015-16 financial year with the overpayments recouped over the next three years, which means that Murray Goulburn suppliers will continue to receive a lower price per kilo, by about $0.50, than they otherwise would. Murray Goulburn\u2019s price drop came 12 months after the cooperative listed its non-voting trust on the Australian Stock Exchange, with a projected profit of $89m. That has been revised down to about $63m. Investors on Monday filed a class action with the supreme court claiming that the cooperative misled investors. Murray Goulburn\u2019s confirmation of the class action was met on Tuesday by a further drop in the MG Unit Trust\u2019s listed unit price, which fell to $0.85 per unit \u2013 below the $1 buy-in price offered to farmers. Major dairy companies in south-east Australia have an agreement to meet the benchmark price, which is set by Murray Goulburn as the largest supplier. So when Murray Goulburn lowered its price the Australian arm of Fonterra, a New Zealand based cooperative and the largest dairy company in the world, was able to follow suit.  Fonterra announced a drop in its 2016-17 season price from $5.60 per kilogram to $5 per kilogram of milk solids two weeks ago, and the cut was applied immediately, affecting prices for May and June.  A week later, on Friday, the company softened the blow by announcing it would pay an extra $2.50 per kilo in July and August for every kilo that matched supply received in May and June. Marian MacDonald, a dairy farmer from south-east Gippsland who supplies Fonterra and runs a popular dairy industry blog, said that meant suppliers would still receive a lower price, which for her is $1.91 a kilo, in July and August, but if they supplied, for example, 10,000kg in that time, they would receive an extra $2.50 per kilo for milk supplied in those months, up to a limit of 10,000kg. Fonterra said the adjustment was made so farmers who calved in autumn were not unfairly disadvantaged and the offset would be \u201cdrawn through the redistribution of base rates in the 2016-17 season.\u201d MacDonald said many dairy farmers would be operating at a loss until they could adjust to the new payscale. Those that could not cut costs enough to produce milk at the new price would be pushed out of the industry. She said the swiftness of the price cut, coming at the end of a dry and difficult season, hit farmers hard.  \u201cIf you don\u2019t know what the price is going to be next year let alone next week then it\u2019s very hard to go and spend money on things that make the farm effective,\u201d MacDonald told Guardian Australia. \u201cBecause we are exposed to this international export market \u2026 you need to be very efficient, and you can\u2019t be efficient without investment, and you can\u2019t invest without certainty.\u201d MacDonald said dairy farmers could not react to sudden price changes. Even selling stock \u2013 she has reduced her herd from 260 to 220 in response to drought \u2013 can take time. \u201cYou can\u2019t just stop [the cows] and start them again,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t stockpile milk, because it goes off.\u201d There is also a limit to the costs that can be cut. MacDonald and her husband have been buying in a semi-trailer load of hay every fortnight since Christmas \u2013 they lose that expense just because the price has dropped. \u201cAt the end of the day I didn\u2019t become a dairy farmer so I could treat my cows like stock in a box,\u201d she said. \u201cI did it because I love my cows, I love my farm \u2013 that\u2019s what makes it worthwhile.\u201d She said the Coles fund was a \u201cpublic relations exercise\u201d that was would not ease the financial burden on farmers.   Related: Dams, drought, deposits: a guide to Barnaby Joyce's agriculture white paper    Stuart Crosthwaite, who supplies Murray Goulburn and runs 400 head of dairy cattle in Kergunyah, in northern Victoria, had a similar view of the Coles fund, but told Guardian Australia that investment in industry research was \u201call good stuff.\u201d Crosthwaite, who reckoned his farm would just manage to break even next year, said the industry \u201cdoesn\u2019t need propping up\u201d. \u201cLet\u2019s not ignore the fact that we are exposed to an international export market and prices are volatile \u2013 that\u2019s just part of farming,\u201d he said.  \u201cThe media coverage tends to be quite negative with a lot of this stuff, but it\u2019s still a bloody good industry \u2026 it\u2019s an exciting area of farming.\u201d",
