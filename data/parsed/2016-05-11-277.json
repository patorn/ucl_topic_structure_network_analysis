The Senate armed services committee is due on Wednesday to start considering the annual national defense authorization act (NDAA), which was passed with bipartisan support by counterparts in the House in late April. However, Republican defense sources believe the bill reveals the extreme tension between Trump and the traditional Republican defense establishment. \u201cTrump\u2019s foreign policy is an inane jumble of jingoistic sloganeering, and the NDAA is a serious document,\u201d said John Noonan, a national-security aide to former presidential aspirants Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush.   Related: Donald Trump unveils 'America first' foreign policy plan    The NDAA, passed by the House panel and slated to go to the House floor late next week, reflects longstanding defense priorities for the GOP, including plans to increase troop numbers and keep open the Guant\u00e1namo Bay detention facility. But, GOP sources say, the bill\u2019s contents conflict with Trump\u2019s offerings in a manner that helps explain why a substantial number of the Republicans who categorically reject Trump come from the national-security wing of the party. Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a member of the Senate armed services committee, said his biggest concern with Trump was that he had \u201cno idea what his priorities are\u201d. \u201cHis foreign policy positions are way out of the mainstream with most Republicans,\u201d said Graham, who suspended his own campaign for president in December and has said he will not support Trump as his party\u2019s nominee.  \u201cHe talks like Ronald Reagan one moment then embraces [Vladimir] Putin the next. \u2026 The contradictions are just overwhelming to me.\u201d           Trump vows to \u2018shake rust off America\u2019s foreign policy\u2019    Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who exited the race in March, said he stood by charges leveled against Trump during his own campaign that included referring to his former opponent as \u201can erratic conman\u201d who shouldn\u2019t have access to nuclear codes. \u201cI stand by the things I said,\u201d Rubio told CNN on Tuesday. \u201cMy differences with Donald \u2013 both my reservations about his campaign and my policy differences with him \u2013 are well documented and they remain.\u201d Some on the right view the NDAA as more akin to a living will for GOP defense priorities likely to go into eclipse under either presidents Trump or Clinton. \u201cAnything that champions a sensible defense reform, like [panel chairmen] John McCain and Mac Thornberry advocate, there\u2019s a general belief among conservatives that you need to get it into the 2017 bill,\u201d said Kori Schake, a former campaign adviser to McCain. \u201cMy sense is everyone is right to be worried that this year\u2019s defense authorization bill could very well be Republicans\u2019 last chance to put their stamp on defense reforms \u2026 Trump\u2019s effect down-ticket is likely to be disastrous.\u201d In such a political environment, the reasoning goes, the proposed $610.5bn defense budget serves as a battle standard for a Republican defense orthodoxy during a moment when most Republican voters are rallying around a different flag. Republican defense hawks hope to pass a set of 2017 budget measures that provide a marker for shaping Hillary Clinton\u2019s defense policies if she wins in November, or would be politically difficult for Trump to reverse if he becomes president. Among the bill\u2019s more conspicuous features are proposals to increase the army by 20,000 active and 25,000 reserve soldiers; to lock in 9,800 troops for the Afghanistan war after Barack Obama leaves office; to purchase more F-35 and F-22 warplanes; and to prevent the closure of the detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. To fix what Thornberry calls a \u201creadiness crisis\u201d, the bill would move $23bn in war spending to buy big-ticket hardware. McCain plans to add measures to rebalance power between the military services, the regional commands, and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. Whereas Trump has called into question the value of US defense partnerships, including Nato, the House version of the bill would consolidate a maze of legal authorities to enable more US sponsorship of partner militaries. It also suggests that Russia \u2013 whose leader, Putin, has exchanged compliments with Trump \u2013 is \u201cthe greatest threat to US national security\u201d. On the campaign trail, Trump espouses a highly militarized isolationism; a rejection of traditional US alliances; and goals mocked by the party\u2019s defense leadership as dangerous fantasies \u2013 a southern border wall, rejection of free trade, trade wars with China, hostility to ally Japan.  Whereas Republican congressional leaders have, with the exception of McCain and Graham, offered only muted support for torture, Trump embraces it enthusiastically. While many elected Republicans have dealt in Islamophobic rhetoric and policies, Trump\u2019s call for a ban on Muslims entering America has attracted more grassroots GOP support than congressional enthusiasm.  Even where their goals align, such as on enlarging the military, Trump\u2019s proposals stop at a vague promise to \u201cspend what we need\u201d.     \u2018He talks like Ronald Reagan one moment then embraces [Vladimir] Putin the next \u2026 The contradictions are just overwhelming to me,\u2019 Lindsey Graham said of Trump. Photograph: Susan Walsh/AP    Most parochially, Trump has portrayed traditional GOP foreign policy as part of a rot he pledges to fix, calling in the same speech last month for \u201cnew voices and new visions\u201d at the Pentagon. Claude Chafin, a spokesman for the House armed services committee, said the bill was not written as a response to Trump, as many of its measures reflect longstanding committee priorities, particularly bolstering military readiness. \u201cIt\u2019s never as closely tied to the political winds as it appears on the day it hits the floor,\u201d Chafin said. Trump\u2019s major support from the party\u2019s elected leaders on foreign affairs comes from Bob Corker, the Tennessee Republican who chairs the Senate foreign relations committee. Corker on Tuesday told reporters on Capitol Hill he was confident that much of Trump\u2019s prior statements had to do with appealing to primary voters who wanted \u201ca personality and someone who is irreverent\u201d. Corker, who said he has discussed foreign policy with the Trump campaign in recent weeks, said he believed there was room for him to \u201cevolve and learn\u201d and suggested the Republican party would suffer if it were to reject him as its nominee. \u201cWhen people say, \u2018Never this or never that,\u2019 I think a better place to be is to chill and let the campaign evolve a little bit and see where the candidate ends up,\u201d Corker said. He said Trump was trying to espouse views like those of George HW Bush, adding: \u201cI heard some realism creeping back into foreign policy.\u201d Senator Richard Burr of North Carolina, another influential Republican who chairs the Senate intelligence committee, was similarly prepared to accept Trump. \u201cI didn\u2019t agree with 100% of what George W Bush proposed, and I\u2019ll pick those places where I disagree,\u201d Burr said. But an exchange on the issue of torture exposed some of the challenges elected officials will endure as they reluctantly embrace Trump as their standard bearer.  Asked if by endorsing Trump he was then also backing the real estate mogul\u2019s stance in favor of torture, Burr initially hedged: \u201cYou\u2019d have to define what torture is,\u201d he said.  Presented with Trump\u2019s statement that he would go beyond waterboarding, Burr simply replied: \u201cI would not support bringing back waterboarding.\u201d Senator Jeff Sessions, a Trump surrogate who sits on the Senate armed services committee, sought to downplay some of the billionaire\u2019s more outlandish comments on torture and targeting the families of terrorists.  \u201cHe has a foreign policy that\u2019s more realistic,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cIt\u2019s one that\u2019s a little more cautious in assuming how much we can accomplish by using military force. But when we\u2019re clearly threatened, he\u2019s made it quite clear that he will react strongly and vigorously.\u201d  He added that Trump was in the process of surrounding himself with prominent national security advisers whose advice would help to inform defense priorities more in step with Republican orthodoxy. Yet there are many in Republican defense circles who have shown reluctance or refusal to advise Trump, and more who are withholding their support for his campaign. Eliot Cohen, a senior official in both Bush administrations who is deeply respected in the military, has cast about for a third party. The hawkish thinktanker Max Boot called Clinton \u201cfar preferable\u201d in an article for the Los Angeles Times.  There is an active debate among defense experts on the right over whether serving in a Trump administration would be irresponsible, with 121 luminaries of the party\u2019s national-security apparatus signing an open letter pledging to \u201cenergetically\u201d prevent his election.  \u201cThe fact we have a presumptive nominee who doesn\u2019t know we have an air, sea and land-based nuclear triad is disqualifying in and of itself,\u201d said Noonan, a former air force missile officer and House armed services committee staffer, who said he doubted Trump will be elected. Schake, the former McCain adviser, added: \u201cThe president has so much wider latitude in national security policy than in domestic policy. So the national-security community worries that a reckless president could use that power with much greater damage to the country than in an area where there are more checks to the presidency.\u201d",
