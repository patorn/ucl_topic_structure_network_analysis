  "body": "Gord Downie, the frontman for the Tragically Hip and one of Canada\u2019s biggest rock stars, has been diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. The band announced the news on its website on Tuesday. \u201cWe have some very tough news to share with you today, and we wish it wasn\u2019t so.\u201d  The diagnosis, they said, had come in December. \u201cSince then, obviously, he\u2019s endured a lot of difficult times, and he has been fighting hard. In privacy along with his family, and through all of this, we\u2019ve been standing by him.\u201d The band, which has been together for more than three decades, was formed at an Ontario high school in the early 1980s. The group swiftly became a mainstay on the Canadian music scene, releasing 13 studio albums \u2013 nine of which reached No 1 in Canada \u2013 and winning 14 Juno awards, which recognise excellence in Canadian music. The group was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 2005.  Downie, 52, has also released three solo albums.  Downie\u2019s lyrics are often woven with references to Canada\u2019s history and geography, from explorer Jacques Cartier to the Toronto Maple Leafs. \u201cYou write about what you know,\u201d the father of four explained in a 2012 CBC interview. \u201cAnd I love this country. I love my idea of this country.\u201d Downie\u2019s doctor, James Perry, said on Tuesday that the musician had undergone surgery and six weeks of chemotherapy and radiation after being diagnosed with an invasive brain tumour known as glioblastoma.  Downie has so far responded well to treatment, but the tumour is impossible to completely remove from the brain, said Perry. \u201cIt\u2019s my difficult duty today to tell you Gord Downie\u2019s tumour is incurable.\u201d He added it was too early to know Downie\u2019s long-term prognosis and refused to speculate on a timeline. \u201cFor many people, in fact most of my patients, it\u2019s daunting to actually reveal your diagnosis \u2026 let alone somebody that is truly a national treasure.\u201d The Tragically Hip said plans were in the works for Downie and the band to tour Canada this summer, despite the diagnosis. \u201cThis feels like the right thing to do now, for Gord, and for all of us \u2026 So we\u2019re going to dig deep and try to make this our best tour yet.\u201d The tour will coincide with the release of the band\u2019s latest album, Man Machine Poem. As the news broke on Tuesday, tributes to Downie poured in from across Canada and around the world with many expressing their shock at the news. \u201cGord IS Canada,\u201d said actor Jonathan Torrens, who played J-Roc on Trailer Park Boys. \u201cNo band in our history has embraced/defined #canadianity more than The Hip. Gutted by this news.\u201d The sentiment was echoed by Canadian indie pop band Stars who tweeted: \u201cGord Downie is the poet laureate of the Canadian soul.\u201d  Justin Trudeau also weighed in from Japan, where the Canadian prime minister was wrapping up a working visit ahead of this week\u2019s G7 talks. \u201cGord Downie is a true original who has been writing Canada\u2019s soundtrack for more than 30 years. Courage,\u201d he wrote on Twitter.",
