His comments came two days after one of the fast-food giant\u2019s former US chief executives suggested that a minimum wage of $15 an hour could lead to McDonald\u2019s replacing its workers with robots. Easterbrook was speaking at the company\u2019s annual shareholders\u2019 meeting when he said that technology is not likely to lead to \u201cjob elimination\u201d at McDonald\u2019s.   Related: Ex-McDonald's CEO suggests replacing employees with robots amid protests    \u201cIt\u2019s a topic of discussion right now,\u201d he said, when asked by one of the shareholders if the higher minimum wage would lead to shift to more automated services. McDonald\u2019s is in a service business and \u201cwill always have an important human element\u201d, Easterbrook said. \u201cIf we were able to automate certain non-value-added processes in the restaurant, we would do that because that\u2019s a smart thing to do. But then that gives us more opportunity to bring back that manpower to the front of the house where we can offer a better dining area experience,\u201d Easterbrook said.  McDonald\u2019s expects to roll out table service at 400 stores in the UK by the end of this year. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as being a risk to job elimination. It might change the nature of the jobs in our restaurants.\u201d     I don\u2019t see it as being a risk to job elimination. It might change the nature of the jobs in our restaurants  Steve Easterbrook     Earlier in the meeting Easterbrook said that the strategy at the core of the company\u2019s turnaround plan was putting customers \u201cback at the center of everything we do\u201d and adapting to customers instead of asking customers to adapt to the company. \u201cFrankly, technology is something that our customers are embracing,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to adapt to that. It is not actually meant to be labor replacement. We can just reapportion that labor into that more service-oriented roles,\u201dhe said. Two days before the shareholders\u2019 annual meeting, former US boss Ed Rensi told Fox Business that \u201cit\u2019s cheaper to buy a $35,000 robotic arm than it is to hire an employee who\u2019s inefficient, making $15 an hour bagging french fries\u201d.

Photograph: Marty Lederhandler/AP    Easterbrook did not address the potential effects of a higher federal minimum wage or the Fight for $15 protests taking place outside the meeting. Not everyone, however, was thrilled with all of McDonald\u2019s updates. Albert, a 76-year-old McDonald\u2019s stockholder with bad vision, told Easterbrook that the electronic menu boards at his local store were not customer-friendly.  \u201cThe menu is small,\u201d he said, pointing out that calorie count and prices are right next to each other and are hard to tell apart.

It keeps changing the menu, so by the time I focus on the menu and get halfway down, it changes and disappears! Then I have to wait another 15 to 20 seconds till it comes back and the person at the register is going: \u2018May I help you? May I help you?\u2019\u201d he said, to laughter from the room. \u201cIt\u2019s pressure. If you could stop that \u2026 I don\u2019t care about the calories, it\u2019s too much to read and too fast. Otherwise, I love McDonald\u2019s.\u201d \u201cWe never want to get to the stage where it gets too difficult for the customer, so I hear your plea,\u201d Easterbook said.  Since being appointed as the CEO in January of last year, Easterbrook has successfully implemented a turnaround plan for the company. He has been able to reverse the burger chain\u2019s declining sales \u2013 established US stores have reported rising sales during the past three quarters.",
