  "body": "If you hear elephants trumpeting and tigers growling on the wrong side of Regent\u2019s Park from the zoo, it\u2019s not because the animals have escaped: the Open Air theatre is giving the professional premiere to Samuel Adamson\u2019s stage version of Michael Morpurgo\u2019s story about a girl, Lilly, (a boy in the original book and at some performances here) who escapes the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami with the help of a friendly elephant, Oona. The protective Oona carries Lilly into the Indonesian rainforest where they make friends with the orangutans and encounter poachers working for a murderous baddie who is destroying the forest for profit.  First produced by the excellent Chichester Festival Youth theatre, this out-does both War Horse and The Lion King in the puppetry stakes. It\u2019s Finn Caldwell and Toby Oli\u00e9\u2019s lifesize animals who are the real draw in a piece that lacks a convincing emotional underpinning (Lilly\u2019s loss of both parents seem to pass almost unnoticed) and is way too earnest in the delivery of its conservation message. But it\u2019s a brilliant spectacle.  There are cute baby orangutans, a stealthy crocodile, giant butterflies and, of course, Oona herself who requires a cast of four to manipulate her. It\u2019s lovely stuff. A large young people\u2019s ensemble play the devastating great wave with aplomb, and there\u2019s an engaging central performance from Ava Potter as Lilly, a girl who turns personal disaster into animal magic.   At Regent\u2019s Park Open Air theatre until 12 June. Box office: 0844-826 4242.",
