  "body": "When is a question not a question?  When it\u2019s an exclamation!  Consider: \u201cDid you see that!\u201d \u2013 I know you did; \u201cAre you kidding me!\u201d \u2013 I know you\u2019re not; \u201cWhat on earth!\u201d \u2013 neither of us have a clue.  Reactions like these distill what makes sport sport, shared moments of wonder and stupefaction where fantasy meets reality, our conception of the possible altered forever. It can\u2019t be true, except that it is, but it can\u2019t be, but it is, look! Exclamation!  Such pleasure speaks well of us: the most intense joy anyone can experience that we\u2019ll never experience, paraded right in our faces while we vicariously gorge on the tiniest morsel without even wanting to die of envy, agony and shame. Or, alternatively, we simply make it about ourselves.  Keith Houchen\u2019s goal in the 1987 FA Cup final encompasses all of these feelings, a moment that stands alone. Of course, there have been other showpiece blinders, but few so unexpected; Ricky Villa, Norman Whiteside, Roberto Di Matteo and Steven Gerrard were meant to do things like that, and Spurs, Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool certainly were. Houchen and Coventry City were not.          \u2018Fly \u2026 fly and you\u2019ll get it!\u2019 Keith Houchen heads Coventry level.    The start of Houchen\u2019s career was inauspicious \u2013 \u201cI was one of those lads who had dreamed of being a footballer but was never sure if it would happen,\u201d he said. \u201cI was 13 and going to places like Crystal Palace, hoping for a chance. But I just couldn\u2019t get my break.\u201d  He eventually joined Chesterfield but was released without making an appearance, ending up at Hartlepool United. But despite 65 goals in 170 games he never felt settled there, leaving for an underwhelming two-year stint at Orient before arriving at York City where he etched himself into FA Cup marginalia, winning and scoring the penalty that eliminated Arsenal in January 1985. The following year he moved to Scunthorpe United and hated it. \u201cIt was the only time I ever gave up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the right club because it wasn\u2019t going anywhere.\u201d He even told his wife that he was \u201cjust going to take the money\u201d, turning down offers from Bury and Preston North End to that end and finding himself in the reserves. There, he impressed in a game against Coventry, who made him an offer: \u00a3350 a week, \u00a350 an appearance, \u00a310,000 to sign. He did, in June 1986. Coventry\u2019s unbroken run in the top division then stood at 19 years, the third longest after Arsenal and Everton. But they had also been involved in nine relegation struggles, and in each of the three previous seasons had needed to win their final fixture to stay up. And in 104 years of existence they had never reached a cup final \u2013 much to Che Guevara\u2019s apparent disgust. Unusually, management duties at the club were shared. There was Big John Sillett, responsible for coaching, and Big George Curtis, responsible for everything else, two \u201ccharacters\u201d who were actually characters, their shared prefix based on more than corpulence and ego.  Sillett, or Snozz as he was known, was right-back for Chelsea\u2019s 1955 league champions before Jimmy Hill took him to Highfield Road seven years later. When Hill then became chairman, Sillett was appointed coach; that was 1979. But in 1984 he fell out with Bobby Gould, Coventry\u2019s manager, and was sacked. This forced him to spend time away from the game, during which he experienced an epiphany: football was supposed \u201cto entertain by flair, passion and skill\u201d. He vowed to achieve this in his next job.  Not long afterwards Gould was sacked and Don Mackay took over, reinstating Sillett. Then, when Mackay was also sacked with only three games remaining of the 1985-86 season, he and Curtis were placed in joint charge. Together, they kept Coventry up.  Curtis had also played for Coventry \u2013 538 times, then a record \u2013 and captained them from the fourth to the first division, also helping Maurice Setters dispel the perception that, despite the accent, southern people can be hard and unhinged too. \u201cA tank of a man\u201d, said Kenneth Wolstenholme in 1967; \u201cGodzilla\u201d, offered Jimmy Greaves 20 years later, prompting Ian St John to observe that he\u2019d lost weight since he stopped playing. \u201cActually,\u201d he went on, \u201cBig George almost broke my leg \u2026 in his own testimonial game.\u201d As a youngster, Curtis spent a year down the mines at Kent\u2019s Snowdown Colliery, and never forgot the privilege of talent; while he prepared for Wembley, his brother and mates were still there. \u201cWhoever pays you, you work your balls out,\u201d was his assessment of professional life. \u201cWe pay all our members of staff and I expect a job out of them.\u201d And didn\u2019t his players know it \u2013 if they were late for the team bus, the doors would shut and they would have to pay him to get on. \u201cI don\u2019t think other managers can pick them up by the ears and bite their noses,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t mind doing that.\u201d  Essentially, the routine was good cop, bad cop/good cop, bad cop: Sillett was a charismatic softie given to extremes of emotion, while Curtis was calmer but tougher. Together, they built a family atmosphere in which their players were free to express themselves.  \u201cDave Bennett and Cyrille Regis \u2026 have what I might call lazed around at other clubs and all of a sudden have been revitalised,\u201d said Sillett. \u201cBecause they\u2019re enjoying their job.\u201d Or, put another way, he understood management.  Between mid-September 1986 and May 1987, Coventry did not drop below tenth spot in the league, 26,709 watching them beat Liverpool in April \u2013 their highest attendance in six years, generating record gate receipts of \u00a3101,000. Indeed.  But it was the Cup that really got them going. After beating Bolton Wanderers in the third round they were drawn away to Manchester United in the fourth. The teams had not met in the competition since 1963, a game in which Sillett and Curtis both played. Bad luck with injuries meant that Keith was still more Whochen than Houchen \u2013 but not for much longer. On a slab of frozen mud miserable even by Old Trafford standards, Greg Downs \u2013 he of the two-tone hair and pre-match rice pudding \u2013 had his cross flicked square by Panini album dreamboat David Phillips. Houchen then won a tackle with Billy Garton, blocked Mick Duxbury\u2019s clearance, poked a shot that Chris Turner saved, blocked the rebound with his face, then poked in from under the bar to complete a glorious mess of a goal. \u201cI can\u2019t remember how many touches I had,\u201d he told Match of the Day. \u201cIt kept coming back off people and I kept stabbing at it, but I\u2019ve got legs that are six foot long you see, so I got the last touch on it in the end.\u201d \u201cAre Coventry going to have a cup run?\u201d asked Tony Gubba. \u201cWe\u2019re having one,\u201d came back the reply.  And they were. A 1-0 win at Stoke City in the next round earned a quarter-final trip to Sheffield Wednesday, where Gary Megson equalised Regis\u2019s opener before Houchen intervened once more. First, on 78 minutes, his deflected shot flew in and then, on 83 minutes, he chased down a long kick, charged down a feeble backheaded clearance, and strode into the box to finish easily. Suddenly, Whochen was pure hoachin\u2019 with goals.   \u201cWe had a great bunch of lads, who prepared for each round in exactly the same way,\u201d he explained. \u201cBy going to Fuengirola for a few drinks \u2026 it was just like a ride we got on. Never for one minute did I imagine that we were gonna go on and win the FA Cup that season.\u201d  John Poynton, the club chairman, disagreed. Since before the turn of the year he\u2019d been insisting that Coventry\u2019s name was on the Cup, and now, all they had to do was beat Division Two\u2019s Leeds United and they were in the final. Which was good enough for one supporter, a soldier stationed in Cyprus: he went awol, hitched a ride on an Italian freighter, and returned thereafter to escape a charge of absenteeism.  On their return to Hillsborough, Coventry went behind after 14 minutes and only the excellence of Steve Ogrizovic kept the deficit at one. But, though they came back into the game, they were still behind with 22 minutes left \u2013 until Brendan Ormsby, the captain whose monstrous header saw Leeds through the previous round, dallied on the ball, allowing Bennett to set up Micky Gynn for the equaliser. Even now, the mere mention of his name is enough to elicit shouts of \u201cJust kick it out!\u201d Shortly afterwards, Gynn bundled through three tackles and the ball broke to Houchen, who rounded the keeper to put Coventry in front. But Keith Edwards, on as a late sub, headed home with his second touch to send the game into extra-time. Despite such disappointment Coventry remained the stronger side, and after a further eight minutes, Houchen shot against Mervyn Day\u2019s legs and Bennett rammed in the winner. They were there.          Coventry see off Leeds in a memorable semi-final at Hillsborough.    Most sides would have relaxed at that point, but most sides weren\u2019t led by April\u2019s joint managers of the month. \u201cIf they go in with a softie touch, they\u2019ll be injured for Wembley\u201d, said Curtis. \u201cBut if you play your normal game it\u2019s just the percentage of injuries you get.\u201d  So the players fought hard for that 10th spot before travelling to Dorset for various spa treatments, making it home in time to see their youngsters win the FA Youth Cup in front of 12,000 fans. City and the city were buzzing.  \u201cSuddenly you\u2019re like the most important people in the world, the world\u2019s press just following you,\u201d said Houchen of the buildup to the final. \u201cFor somebody like me that\u2019d been playing fourth division football a season before, it was incredible \u2026 it was just an amazing time.\u201d  The team\u2019s suits were made by a local tailor \u2013 but they were not the only ones so pampered. \u201cThis is the enjoyable part really,\u201d said Trevor Peake, \u201cbringing the women into the shop for some clothes.\u201d Little did he know that the future would prove that they\u2019d been capable of going by their own selves all along.  Also that week came an appearance on Blue Peter, where they performed Go For It City, the club\u2019s picaresque Cup final single. \u201cI thought you said they had to able to sing,\u201d quipped Janet Ellis; \u201cDoesn\u2019t Dave Bennett look like Michael Jackson?\u201d observed Mark Curry. Yes, he really did. Coventry\u2019s opponents at Wembley would be the clapping circus monkeys of Hot Shot Tottenham, enjoying their best season in years. This was thanks in significant part to the tactical expertise of David Pleat, whose five-man midfield both liberated and harnessed the creative talents of Glenn Hoddle, Chris Waddle and Ossie Ardiles; Clive Allen had benefitted to the tune of 48 goals.  Spurs came third in the league, but with the title out of reach by the start of May, Pleat began resting players. In such circumstances they lost to Nottingham Forest, and though the first XI then rousted Manchester United to such extent that Mitchell Thomas scored an overhead kick, two defeats and many more changes followed.  Such preparation did not amuse Brian Clough, nor was it the only receptacle for his ire. \u201cIt sticks in my craw that Glenn can coolly nominate Wembley for his farewell appearance,\u201d he wrote of Hoddle\u2019s decision to join Monaco that summer, weary after years of insufficient feting. How grievous were the sins of a past life! In the two league meetings between the finalists, honours were even: Spurs won 1-0 at White Hart Lane in November, Coventry won 4-3 at Highfield Road in December. In that second game, Bennett scored twice, the manner in which he rode a heavy tackle to get his first reminiscent of George Best \u2013 likewise his interest in his appearance. \u201cI dress sharp, I look sharp on the pitch,\u201d he reckoned.  Other team-mates had other concerns. Nick Pickering wondered whether to leave a radio in his rabbit\u2019s hutch so that it might hear commentary of the game, while Houchen missed a midweek Wembley recce, crook with food poisoning after eating a trout caught by Jake Findlay, the team\u2019s reserve goalkeeper. Also in difficulty was Ogrizovic, his wife so pregnant she was to be induced; the appointed time was Saturday, 1pm. Callously, he declared himself busy elsewhere, so his daughter was born on the Thursday instead, allowing him to skive off for a weekend of fun with his mates.  And, unfortunately, there was also Brian Borrows. He had been injured in the last league game of the season \u2013 Curtis\u2019s percentage in operation \u2013 but expected to recover in time for the final. But on the Friday it transpired that he needed an immediate operation, so for him Cup final glory meant the opening segment of ITV\u2019s coverage, sat in pyjamas nattering to John Helm. Devastated but relentlessly positive, Sillett found relief in the fact that in the end it hadn\u2019t been close, also observing how the accordant change \u2013 Phillips dropping back and Gynn coming in at right-midfield \u2013 \u201ccould be the key to us winning the cup\u201d. He had advised Gynn to be ready earlier in the week and had both him and Regis sign a new contract, fortifying them with confidence when they needed it most. Essentially, he understood that one-off games present a unique set of circumstances, with probability and happenstance more finely balanced. A few Coventry players had experienced finals: Bennett\u2019s Manchester City lost to Spurs in 1981, and in 1985 Pickering\u2019s Sunderland were beaten to the Milk Cup by Downs\u2019s Norwich \u2013 except he was dropped. \u201cWhat I say should\u2019ve been the greatest day of my life turned out to be probably the saddest day of my life,\u201d he reflected.  Otherwise, Ogrizovic had won various medals as Liverpool\u2019s reserve goalie, though only one on the pitch. He had, however, bowled at Viv Richards when playing for Shropshire against Somerset in the NatWest trophy, rattling his stumps with a no ball; he understood both pressure and disappointment.  Coventry spent the night before the game in Marlow, and at dawn the following morning Houchen was running along the Thames in his kit, watching the mist clear. \u201cI was just ready,\u201d he said. \u201cI wasn\u2019t up like nervous or I couldn\u2019t sleep, I slept really well, but then I got up and I just wanted to be at Wembley. I just wanted to play.\u201d  Things then took a turn for the unusual. The supposedly superstitious Sillett was convinced that his team would win should he see a wedding before a game, so upon discovering one at the church opposite the hotel, sent a boat to bring the couple across the river to meet the team \u2013 \u201cpart of brainwashing the players that we were gonna be there,\u201d he said.  Captain-leader-lover Brian \u201cKiller\u201d Kilcline duly handed over a bunch of flowers, and when the bride asked him to remove her garter, he was no one to refuse. \u201cDid you get her number?\u201d asked Jimmy Hill that evening; yes, he really did.  Shortly afterwards the players left for Wembley in quite sumptuous Adidas tracksuits, baby blue with burgundy stripes, and it was at this point that an aghast Lloyd McGrath saw himself on the back pages, boasting \u201cI\u2019ll tame Hoddle\u201d. He wondered. And on the bus, others were doing the same \u2013 the usual card games were absent until Sillett insisted they proceed as normal. Then, as they reached the ground, he insisted they stop. \u201cThat was the moment of all moments,\u201d he said. \u201cOn that coach going down Wembley Way and seeing all the supporters with the scarves, all shouting all waving, all wanting, all hoping, all praying that we were going to do the job. Wonderful, wonderful moment.\u201d As a young player Houchen had driven to the 1978 Cup final, spending the night at South Mimms services in a battered old Ford Escort. He had never expected to be back as a player, and going about in his suit was staggered by the scale of it all. \u201cThey had a waiter, bringing you tea, whatever you wanted,\u201d he recalled. The Spurs lot were more blas\u00e9. A fiesta was already arranged for the following day, fans invited to a marquee at White Hart Lane before a parade down Tottenham High Road, and now, Hoddle, Ray Clemence and Ossie Ardiles got into character mooching on the turf with their young sons.  At Stanmore Tube station, meanwhile, a carload of Coventry supporters discussed a hypothetical pub quandary, except in real life. Steven Marks, his dad, his dad\u2019s mate and his dad\u2019s mate\u2019s dad had just pulled off the M1 and into London when the dad\u2019s mate\u2019s dad suffered a fatal seizure. Obviously, the sad reality could not be altered; naturally, they left him propped up in his seat; verily, it was what he would\u2019ve wanted.  Back outside the ground, the Labour leader Neil Kinnock was mobbed by a bunch of Coventry supporters \u2013 though he might not have been so warmly received in the dressing room. At the following month\u2019s general election, Houchen and Ogrizovic would exploit their fame to campaign for their local Tory MP, a circumstance particularly unusual as both spent the 80s in regions hit hard by Thatcherism. Nonetheless, that was what they did.  In the dressing rooms the players got stripped, Coventry in their usual sky-blue and white stripes adorned with sumptuous centenary crest. Spurs, on the other hand, replaced their classic chevron design with a plain, guileless affair whose shapeless collar demanded some kind of tie or cravat. This caused no little consternation, as someone\u2019s oversight meant that their sponsor\u2019s name was missing from some players\u2019 chests; nowadays, they call it \u201cguerilla marketing\u201d.  As the teams lined up in the tunnel behind their managers, Pleat leant over to Sillett.  \u201cJohn, you nervous?\u201d  \u201cJust a little bit, David.\u201d \u201cWell just have this in mind: we\u2019ve been here seven times and never lost.\u201d \u201cNor have we.\u201d Then they set off. \u201cYou walk up this dark tunnel, literally a dark tunnel,\u201d recalled Houchen, \u201cand you can see the brilliant sunshine at the end of it. And then when you break from the end of that tunnel, this crescendo almost lifts you off your feet. The colour and the spectacle and the noise, just carries you. You go from that tunnel to the halfway where you line up to meet the dignitaries and I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t even walk, I\u2019m sure you just get carried there.\u201d Similar levitation would have helped when, shortly after kick-off, he made the mistake of helping out his defence and turned an ankle. \u201cI thought I\u2019d snapped my ligaments,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought: \u2018Oh no, this can\u2019t be happening.\u2019\u201d And immediately things got worse, the ball cleared only as far as Chris Waddle whose brilliant cross picked out Clive Allen; he headed home at the near post. \u201cWe just glanced round at each other,\u201d said Houchen, \u201cand went \u2018uh-oh, it\u2019s not gonna be one of them is it?\u2019\u201d  It was not. Just six minutes later, his flick-on put Bennett in to find both corner and camera, the latter escaping with minor injuries relative to the previous year\u2019s decapitation by Ian Rush.  There followed the anomaly of an entertaining game, and in the 40th minute the third goal arrived. Pickering fouled Paul Allen unnecessarily, Ogrizovic came then went for Hoddle\u2019s free-kick, and between them Gary Mabbutt and Kilcline diverted the ball past him \u2013 2-1 Spurs.  Then, just past the hour and after an even start to the second half, it happened. Ogrizovic humped the ball downfield and Regis flicked on for Houchen who, ignoring Richard Gough tugging him from behind, lowered the ball on his toe before sending it wide to Bennett, the pitch of the crowd ascending. And the cross was worthy of it, a flat, bending, whipping ripper that Clemence can\u2019t come for \u2013 but it\u2019s just too far in front of Houchen for him to have any chance of connecting. Back in the Coventry half, Trevor Peake disagreed. \u201cFly!\u201d he yelled. \u201cFly and you\u2019ll get it!\u201d \u2013 and somehow, Houchen heard. \u201cI never took my eyes off it,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m watching it coming in and thinking I\u2019m flat out here. I had to throw myself at it, or I would never have got on the end of it. I can\u2019t say I was consciously thinking: \u2018If it comes in, I\u2019m going to dive and head it\u2019 \u2026 playing in the schoolyard on the tarmac, there was something about doing diving headers, wasn\u2019t there? If the ball\u2019s at a certain height and stuff you used to like to throw yourself and get a diving header.\u201d So, back straight, body low and stripes horizontal, he hurtled after the ball like a flying human bench, like the fast train that normally misses out Wembley Park; he\u2019s smiling. Smiling! The connection was faultless, forehead trouncing leather into the corner of the net, and no one had ever seen anything like that ever before and no one will ever see anything like that again, anticipation at what could happen multiplied by shock that it actually did. Did you see that!  \u201cThe whole thing looks so spectacular \u2013 it looks like I\u2019m flying,\u201d Houchen said. \u201cWhen it is perfect timing, it\u2019s like a dance \u2013 it all comes together. I knew I was getting it. When I scored, I was totally disorientated.\u201d We all experience moments of pure instinct, but for most of us they constitute mundanities like breathing, grunting and soiling ourselves. Sportsfolk are different, but even so this was special: players who aren\u2019t great score great goals, players who aren\u2019t great score in great games, and players who aren\u2019t great score in great finals. But a player who isn\u2019t great scoring a great goal in a great game that was a great final? Are you kidding me!  Of course, there have been other diving headers \u2013 though, relative to other forms of spectacular scoring, not many: Ted MacDougall in 1972, Tommy Hutchinson in the 1981 final and Gary Mabbutt earlier in the 86-87 season spring to mind. But none were as aesthetic or dramatic. Nor did John Motson fail it. \u201cHouchen!\u201d he yelled, Jimmy Hill beside himself beside him. \u201cBrilliant goal! Keith Houchen! The man with the Midas touch in the FA Cup strikes gold for Coventry!\u201d And Houchen was away! \u201cAll you could hear was this deafening noise, I just set off running towards the fans,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one followed me, though. All my team-mates said later, \u2018There was too much time left, we\u2019d have been too knackered to play on if we\u2019d followed you\u2019.\u201d The goal was enough to earn Coventry extra-time, and in its fifth minute Mabbutt\u2019s left knee diverted McGrath\u2019s cross into the only part of the goal Clemence couldn\u2019t cover. Coventry had won the Cup.  Though this wasn\u2019t great for Spurs, for everyone else it was absolutely necessary. Prior to it, Houchen\u2019s header was merely an equaliser, and even after it, still not the game\u2019s decisive moment as a matter of fact. But the flukey, forgettable winner for his team made Houchen\u2019s goal the game\u2019s decisive moment as a matter of truth, one that defined and subsumed the afternoon; our collective soul was the winner.  And didn\u2019t Houchen appreciate it. \u201cWembley was this wonderful, historic place,\u2019 he said. \u201cI grew up as kid thinking about all these ghosts of Wembley, Stanley Matthews and Bobby Moore and all these things that went with Wembley \u2013 suddenly I became a part of that. We felt as a group of players and as individuals we deserved it, it was like our day that, it was like all that we\u2019ve put in, all that blood, sweat and tears this is our day.\u2026 It\u2019s such a long, hard career, and it was a hard career, to be able to pull this out occasionally, it makes everything worthwhile.\u201d So, how do you feel about your life, then?  In Coventry, \u201cit\u201d, to coin a phrase, \u201cwent off\u201d. Hitherto empty, the city was full of celebrants, police cars decorated with sky blue balloons and police helmets full of champagne. The fountain was dyed blue, a girl in a sky blue bikini sat on the bonnet of a car circling Lady Godiva\u2019s statue, and everyone waded in. The players, meanwhile, endured a dry trip home \u2013 in a rare lapse of efficiency Sillett had forgotten the juice. But they eventually arrived at their hotel in Rugby, celebrating until the early hours, before returning to Coventry the following morning. On the way they visited Borrows, then went to see Ogrizovic\u2019s wife, before being greeted by 250,000 people as the cathedral bells sounded for the first time in 100 years. Despite the rain, a further party did therefore ensue, the Cup chucked about with abandon and its lid bent out of shape by a stray set of buttocks.   \u201cIt brought a lot to the city,\u201d said McGrath, \u201ca lot of closeness\u201d; in the weeks after the game, Peugeot noticed an increase in productivity at its Coventry factory. \u201cEverybody was just \u2026 happy\u201d, said Houchen. \u201cThere\u2019s not that many times in your life when you can look back and say well, we were all just happy and everybody was.\u201d  Which is not only the point of football but the point of everything.",
