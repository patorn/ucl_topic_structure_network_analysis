This week\u2019s question:  My daughter, 18, is about to leave school and wants to buy her form tutor a present. This teacher really helped her over many years and a bottle of wine doesn\u2019t seem enough. What, if anything, would be appropriate \u2013 what do teachers like to receive? Do you have a problem readers could solve? Email your suggestions to money@theguardian.com or write to us at Money, The Guardian, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU.",
