  "body": "There\u2019s something striking about the press reviews of singer-songwriter Gregory Porter\u2019s third album, Liquid Spirit (2013). They\u2019re all written by specialist jazz critics, full of references to the singer\u2019s rhythmic phrasing, the tasty call-and-response between bass and vocals and the steady eighth-note strut in the right hand of the title track\u2019s piano solo. Nothing wrong with that, of course. Porter is unequivocally a jazz artist; a stalwart of festivals from Cheltenham to New Orleans, who first attracted attention when Wynton Marsalis selected him for a residency at New York\u2019s Lincoln Centre, and whose repertoire features songs by Wayne Shorter, Nat Adderley and Max Roach. And yet, it seems telling: clearly no one expected Liquid Soul to become a vast crossover pop success. You can see why: jazz hasn\u2019t really produced a crossover pop success since that curious period in the noughties when Michael Parkinson became Britain\u2019s least likely arbiter of musical taste and a swath of middle-aged middle England fell for the boyish charms of Jamie Cullum and Michael Bubl\u00e9. But a vast crossover success is precisely what Liquid Spirit became, at least in Britain. It went gold, and became the most streamed jazz album in history.            Moreover, the nature of Porter\u2019s success seems intriguing. Fairly or otherwise, the Noughties pop-jazz stars were inexorably linked with a certain demographic. Their audience always seemed to have something of the garden centre and the Vauxhall Cavalier about them: fans of Sunday-morning Radio 2 whose biannual CD purchase brought with it the added thrill of extra points on their Tesco Clubcard. Porter clearly has that audience sewn up \u2013 last year he could be spotted at the Royal British Legion\u2019s VE Day concert singing We\u2019ll Meet Again alongside Elaine Paige, Bernard Cribbins and the Strictly Come Dancing cast \u2013 but he\u2019s also collaborated with dance duo Disclosure on Holding On; his 2012 single 1960 What? proved a huge club hit when remixed by Opolopo, as did Claptone\u2019s Ibiza-friendly take on Liquid Spirit\u2019s title track. He is perhaps the only artist who can generate excitable copy in the Daily Express (\u201cGregory Porter: why he wears a hat and other facts\u201d, it offered in a rare moment when not squealing about asylum seekers or telling its readers that yoghurt can cure dementia) and gushing praise from perennially hip DJ Gilles Peterson, who has compared him to Teddy Pendergrass and Lou Rawls, among others.    Even the poppiest songs come underpinned by intriguingly chewy chord progressions    This is obviously an unlikely state of affairs, and playing Liquid Spirit\u2019s follow-up, you find yourself wondering if it might have happened because, for all its easiness on the ear, \u2013 and there are moments when listening Take Me to the Alley feels like being mugged by a syrup sponge pudding \u2013 there\u2019s something weirdly uncompromising about Porter\u2019s music. He doesn\u2019t bother with glossy production: Take Me to the Alley sounds fantastic, but that\u2019s down to the warm spontaneity of an album that seems to have been recorded in six days. Nor does he dabble in radio-friendly pop covers \u2013 no scat-singing interpreter of the Coldplay songbook he. His own compositions proudly display his gospel roots \u2013 not the first genre you\u2019d think of flaunting were you desperate for mainstream success. The title track offers up a parable about the second coming of Christ, its sternness at odds with the pacific piano playing and Alicia Olatuja\u2019s pillowy backing vocals; In Heaven undercuts the small hours loveliness of its muted trumpet with a lyric by Porter\u2019s cousin about death and redemption.             If it frequently functions as pop music \u2013 the melody of Holding On feels as direct here as it did in the version Porter recorded with Disclosure, while In Fashion clearly has a strand of Elton John\u2019s Benny and the Jets somewhere in its DNA \u2013 you\u2019re never struck by the sense of a jazz artist holding back his natural impulses. Even the poppiest songs come underpinned by intriguingly chewy chord progressions and a drummer with a noticeably exploratory approach to rhythm. Fan the Flames\u2019 lyrics feel rooted in early 70s soul and there\u2019s a hint of Curtis Mayfield\u2019s unfailing equanimity about its attempt to interest a post-Ferguson world in peaceful protest \u2013 but the music is blaring hard bop.   Related: Gregory Porter review \u2013 jazz chameleon finds countless ways to seduce    The standard explanation of Porter\u2019s broad appeal is that there\u2019s something undeniable about his talent; that anyone who can come up with a song such as the unfeasibly beautiful ballad Consequence of Love is obviously destined for success; that his voice, with its echoes of Bill Withers and Donny Hathaway, is built to steamroller any conceivable objection one might raise. And there\u2019s truth in all of that. There are certainly points during Take Me to the Alley when you can\u2019t help but wish he\u2019d ease up on the sentimentality and inject a little more edge \u2013 the roar of Fan the Flames and intriguingly off-kilter closer French African Queen come as something of a relief after a run of drowsily paced tracks \u2013 but no matter how velvety things get, there\u2019s a grit in Porter\u2019s voice that scrapes against the smoothness. You hear it on the chorus of Insanity, a song resolutely situated in the middle of the road: an affecting wince of pain, at odds with his reputation for baritone mellowness. If there\u2019s nothing on Take Me to the Alley to scare away Porter\u2019s existing audience, it still sounds less like music made for a mass market than that of a man who happened to have found one while following his own path.",
