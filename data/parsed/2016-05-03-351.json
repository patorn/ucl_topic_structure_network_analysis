  "body": "A rare dwarf sperm whale that has been spotted only 17 times since records began in Australia may have washed up on a Victorian beach, local authorities have said. The 2.42-metre whale died after becoming stranded on Lake Tyers beach in Gippsland, about 330km east of Melbourne, on Saturday.    Related: Whale CSI: why sperm whales are washing up dead on British shores    The species is yet to be confirmed, but Tony Mitchell, biodiversity officer with the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning in Victoria, said it was believed it could be a dwarf sperm whale, Kogia sima, which has never been recorded in Australia before. \u201cIt\u2019s leading us towards a dwarf sperm whale rather than the more commonly encountered dwarf pygmy whale,\u201d Mitchell told ABC news. Charlie Franken, wildlife manager with the department, said the final identification would depend on genetic testing and also comparing the animal\u2019s bone structure to skeletons in storage. \u201cIt\u2019s not 100% yet but it\u2019s maybe 95 to 99% certain,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not [like] if you look at an emu or a budgie and you can clearly see one\u2019s one or one is the other.\u201d A second, similar whale washed up on a beach at Wonthaggi, 136km south of Melbourne, on Monday, but authorities are confident it is a pygmy sperm whale. At an average length of just 2.7 metres the dwarf sperm whale is the smallest whale species in the world and a head shorter than a bottlenose dolphin. Dr Kevin Rowe, senior curator of mammals at Museum Victoria, said sightings of pygmy and dwarf sperm whales were extremely rare because the animals appeared to live in deep-sea chasms at the edge of continental shelfs.  Like their more famous large cousin, the smaller sperm whales are predatory, hunting crabs and squid. But while the slightly larger pygmy sperm whales, Kogia breviceps, have been known to wash up on Australian beaches on rare occasions, Rowe said there were only six physical records of dwarf sperm whales mentioned in the 150-year history of the Atlas of Living Australia, and all were incomplete specimens. \u201cThere\u2019s so much we don\u2019t know about these animals because it\u2019s hard to study things in the deep ocean, even things that are three metres long,\u201d Rowe said. \u201cWe can really only study them through carcasses.\u201d Department firefighters were called in to lift the body off the beach on Saturday and a preliminary examination by a department vet has found no obvious cause of death.  It will be delivered to Museum Victoria for a closer examination on Wednesday. \u201cWe know it\u2019s a Kogia [the genus for both pygmy and dwarf sperm whales] but differentiating between these two is very difficult,\u201d Rowe said. The main differences are the placement of the dorsal fin, which is further down the back on a pygmy sperm whale, and the shape of the \u201cfalse gill\u201d, a light patch near the whale\u2019s head which, combined with their relatively small size, meant the whales were frequently mistaken for sharks. Rowe said both attributes were visible on photos he had seen of a second whale that washed up on Monday but not in photos of Saturday\u2019s whale. Even if both turn out to be pygmy sperm whales it would provide scientists with two intact carcasses to study, which Rowe said was itself a rarity: \u201cUsually by the time you come to a whale carcass it is rotting away and we are lucky to get the skeleton out of it.\u201d Rowe said researchers would also try to figure out why the whales were so close to the coast, saying the animals, which are believed to dive to depths of 1,000 metres, \u201cwouldn\u2019t be coming near shore unless they were a bit crook\u201d. The discovery of the two small sperm whales comes two months after a tooth believed to belong to a long-extinct giant sperm whale was found on a Melbourne beach. The 30cm fossil dates from the Pliocene epoch (about five million years ago) and is believed to have belonged to an 18-metre, 40-tonne whale.",
