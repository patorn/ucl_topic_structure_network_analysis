As Pixar\u2019s charming version of a tropical blue tang swims on to screens in Finding Dory next month, conservationists fear a\u00a0wave of inappropriate fish buying. Finding Nemo, which triggered just such a global craze in 2003, posed less of a threat. Clownfish (Nemo\u2019s ilk) are usually bred in captivity for the aquarium trade, but blue tangs are \u201charvested\u201d from the wild for aquariums, with up to 80% dying during capture and transportation. There is intense pressure on wild populations, especially around coral reefs. The preferred method of capture remains squirting cyanide straight on to the coral reefs they inhabit.    'Tankbusters' are an ugly feature of home aquariums. Bought as pretty juveniles, these species grow large very quickly    Of 12.5m tropical fish entering the US each year, 90% are thought to be harvested this way. To identify \u201cgood\u201d \u2013 essentially captive-bred \u2013 fish for aquariums, try the mobile app Tank Watch. That, however, is not the end of the story. So-called \u201ctankbusters\u201d are an ugly feature of many home aquariums in the UK. Bought as pretty juveniles, these are species, such as pacu and pangasius, that grow large very quickly. It\u2019s a pet-shop myth that fish only grow to the size of their tanks. Many species are characterised by indeterminate growth. The result has been a fish that would migrate thousands of miles in the wild ending up trapped in a tank in which it can barely turn as its muscles atrophy. The Big Fish Campaign, promoting responsible fish-keeping in the hobby and aquatic trade, suggests you only buy where retailers have a \u201cNo big fish policy\u201d. Anyone who found that Nemo grew beyond all recognition and has tried to re-home a big fish will know how difficult it can be. Fish Rescue and Welfare is a rare charity that does this. Public aquariums around the country report that they are inundated with requests to rehome, but their focus is on research and conservation. Scientists have watched in horror as stocks of species such as the giant Mekong catfish have fallen by 90% in the last 20 years (also due to the building of hydroelectric dams). Increasingly, their tanks will be full of these endangered species \u2013 leaving not much room for unwanted blue tangs. The big picture: Tomorrow documentary     Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow: in this eco documentary, six people explore the world in search of solutions that can save their children and future generations    Rather than characters in search of an author, the Tomorrow team are filmmakers in search of a distributor. A Change.org petition calls for cinemas to screen this award-winning documentary on staving off ecological collapse, from urban farming in Denmark to participative democracy in India. It is seriously inspiring\u2026 if you can get someone to show it to you, that is. Go to demain-lefilm.com Well dressed: Sundried ethical sportswear     Run for your life: Breithorn bra \u00a345, and Ruinette running tights \u00a375, both sundried.com    At last, an ethical sports bra! Sundried is a new apparel brand, for men and women, set up and run by personal trainers in partnership with the Low Carbon Initiative, which supports businesses to develop technology consistent with limiting global warming to below 2%. Sundried manufacturing takes place in Portugal \u2013 not China \u2013 using European fabrics, and the company donates a\u00a0portion of proceeds to Water for Kids. Daniel Puddick, the trainer and triathlete who founded Sundried, says he wanted to create a sports brand his children would be proud of in 15 years\u2019 time \u2013 one that is worlds away from the fast-fashion attitude pervasive in sportswear today. The brand\u2019s website says: \u201cUp to 80% of the impact of a T-shirt occurs after purchase\u201d from washing and drying.
