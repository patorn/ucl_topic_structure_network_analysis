  "body": "Your memory is not playing tricks on you \u2013 it has been unusually warm across much of eastern Australia this May. The Bureau of Meteorology said temperatures had been \u201cdefinitely well above average\u201d across most of the eastern states so far this month. The high for Sydney was 28C on Tuesday when the average temperature for May is 19.5C. Duty forecaster Philip Landvogt said it was a similar story for \u201cpretty much all of the eastern states\u201d.   Related: April breaks global temperature record, marking seven months of new highs    \u201cAll the way from Brisbane down to even Hobart is warmer than average for this part of year.\u201d In Brisbane the average high temperature for May is 23.2C \u2013 and so far this month not a day has fell below 24C. The city can expect temperatures in the mid-to-high 20s \u201cwell into next week\u201d. Canberra has also been warmer than the average May, with an average high of 18.9C so far this month compared with the usual 15.6C. And the effect has been felt as far south as Melbourne, where this month it has been 20.3C while the average May day peaks at 16. 7C. The cause was warm ocean temperatures off the east coast and over northern Australia and prevailing winds bringing warm air from over the central part of the country to the eastern states. \u201cThe combination of those two factors has been the reason we\u2019ve had these warm temperatures,\u201d said Landvogt. Landvogt said the warmer weather was set to continue for at least a week in many parts of Australia. A high of 25C for Sydney on Wednesday was forecast to be followed by at least seven days of temperatures in the region of early to mid-20s \u2013 all well above the May average of 19.5C. Tasmania and Melbourne would start to cool down early next week, with the arrival of a cold front in the coming days.

Sea surface temperatures across the tropical Pacific Ocean have cooled in the past fortnight as El Ni\u00f1o draws closer to an end. Landvogt said there was a \u201c50-50 chance\u201d of a La Ni\u00f1a weather pattern forming with the onset of winter. That could lead to more rainfall over the winter through northern, central and eastern Australia. The unseasonal weather follows confirmation of the hottest April on record globally \u2013 and the seventh consecutive month to have broken global temperature records. The latest figures, released by Nasa over the weekend, smashed the previous record for April by the largest margin ever recorded, setting 2016 up to be the hottest year ever.",
