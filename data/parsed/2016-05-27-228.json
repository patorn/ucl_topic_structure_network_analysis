  "body": "Hi there, 16-year-old me, I know it\u2019s awful. The boils, rashes, lumps, bumps \u2013 explosions that leave holes, yes, holes in your face. But it will be OK. Yes, you\u2019ll still get spots in the future, but they won\u2019t be as bad and you\u2019ll appreciate your oily skin at last because at 58 you won\u2019t look a day over 50. Good eh? Sometimes, after a boil has erupted, you have to wear a plaster. I remember the excruciating shame when your father, probably meaning to be kind, said it looked better when you used cover-up rather than a plaster. \u201cDad, it\u2019s a hole oozing blood and pus and don\u2019t mention it because I\u2019m trying to carry on as though it\u2019s not there, OK!\u201d Except you don\u2019t say that, do you? You just squirm. Other people make it seem worse: it\u2019s not their fault; they are trying to be nice. But I do understand that when you got a new skin-stripping treatment from the doctors and things improved for a day or two, then you\u2019d get compliments, and that those compliments feel like daggers to the heart. They are worse to deal with than the acne itself, because it shows people are thinking about it all along, even when you have managed not to.    Compliments are worse to deal with than the acne itself, because it shows people were thinking about it all along    Anyway, before long your skin will produce even more oil, you are back to square one, and then they shut up again. Sometimes you don\u2019t even want to wear the spot cover-up foundation because people offer you compliments. Anyone bringing up the subject of your skin \u2013 unless they are a doctor you have gone to see \u2013 feels horrible. You didn\u2019t mind being called Pizza Face as much as when people recommended a particular cure or cover-up. Not that being called Pizza Face is great, but it is better than pity and unsolicited help. Again, I give you permission to tell them to stop with the compliments and joshing, because it makes everything twice as bad. The good thing is that, although you didn\u2019t know it at the time (which was before people used Roaccutaine and antibiotics and hormone treatments for acne), more people had it, so you aren\u2019t as alone as you might have been had you got untreatable acne in 2016. You tend to make friends and go out with other people with acne. This is a good ploy because those people who insensitively moan at you over one tiny pimple are really annoying, and you are doing well to steer clear of them. And I think you are lucky because, although you hate your skin and feel self-conscious and ugly, in the 70s we did not fetishise looks in the way people seem to now. Personality really did count for something then. So I know you\u2019re hating it, but as far as acne goes you are luckier to have the worst of it then rather than in the new millennium, with its selfie culture and polarised, pornified pressure to look a certain way.    You are good enough as you are, acne and all. Never let not having smooth skin stop you from looking anyone in the face    If I had to give you any advice, it would be this: you are good enough exactly as you are, acne and all, and never let not having smooth, uniform skin EVER stop you from looking at anyone right in the face. And you may be spotty (understatement) but you mustn\u2019t hold yourself back because of this. No one minds the spots as much as you do. I think your policy of trying not to think about it, trying not to look, trying not to squeeze, is pretty effective, which is why it is so annoying if someone else brings the subject up By the way, acned as you are \u2013 not only on your face, but your back, your chest, your buttocks; and, I\u2019m sorry to say, it will continue right through your twenties \u2013 you will be never short of a boyfriend. But you\u2019ve so much to look forward to, and you can enjoy everything this world has to offer \u2013 with acne. Love, Philippa",
