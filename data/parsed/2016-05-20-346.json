  "body": "A Liberal National party fundraiser featuring Julie Bishop has been moved to a new venue after party supporters raised concerns it was to be held in a Brisbane restaurant owned by a convicted heroin trafficker with longstanding family links to the underworld. The foreign minister was billed as the special guest at the $300-a-head event next Tuesday at Mariosarti, owned by Daniel Milos, whose family history in the drug trade was widely reported when his brother Peter was murdered in 2014. But on Friday, after Guardian Australia revealed the connection, a spokesman for the LNP announced the change of venue. \u201cA fundraising event scheduled to be held at Mariosarti restaurant in Brisbane next week was organised by the LNP with no involvement of the foreign minister, or her staff,\u201d he said. \u201cNeither the minister, nor any of her staff, had any input in the selection of the venue, and were unaware of current ownership arrangement at the restaurant.\u201d On Friday Bishop\u2019s office also said it had no previous knowledge of concerns about the venue, but evidence seen by Guardian Australia indicated her office had been made aware of the concerns but had given the go-ahead for the event.    Related: Guardian Live election special event with Lenore Taylor and Katharine Murphy    Party supporters contacted organisers this week to query the venue for the women\u2019s breakfast, which will raise $12,000 for four female LNP candidates running in Brisbane seats. The organisers alerted officials at the LNP state headquarters, who contacted Bishop\u2019s office before deciding the event would go ahead as planned. Guardian Australia understands the LNP was told that Milos \u2013 who was sentenced to nine years in jail in 2000 as the ringleader in his family\u2019s $10,000 a week heroin trafficking business \u2013 no longer owned the restaurant. However, the party has been provided with documents showing he remains the owner. The restaurant\u2019s liquor licence is held by Milos\u2019s company Mariosarti Pty Ltd, according to documents held by the state Office of Liquor and Gaming Regulation. Milos is registered as a director, secretary and sole shareholder of Mariosarti Pty Ltd, according to documents held by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. It is understood Mariosarti was offered as a venue for the party function at no charge.  A man had been stabbed in the chest outside the restaurant last week. The money raised through 40 guests attending would go to Griffith candidate Fiona Ward, Blair candidate Teresa Harding, Oxley candidate Bibe Roadley and Rankin candidate Freya Ostapovitch. The breakfast is billed as \u201ca fantastic opportunity, limited to 40 guests, to meet and speak with The Hon. Julie Bishop MP, Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia and to network with like-minded individuals\u201d. Daniel and Peter were donors to the party and met John Howard and Campbell Newman at an LNP fundraiser in 2011, where they paid $3,000 in an auction for a red striped shirt famously worn by Newman during the Brisbane floods.

Allen was the main supplier to a corrupt Builders\u2019 Labourers Federation official and sold cocaine to a Sydney developer acting as the frontman for a Hells Angels boss, who secured a workplace agreement for his steel-fixing company with the CFMEU. Allen will remain in prison until at least 2020.  Daniel\u2019s younger brother Peter was a chef and co-owner of Mariosarti until the year before his alleged murder in an attack with a hammer at his Morningside home in May 2014. At the time of his death, Peter was facing charges for drug dealing and possessing weapons.",
