  "body": "A multi-headed monster. An animal of fire. The Beast. As it raged out of control across northern Alberta and burst into Fort McMurray with unparalleled ferocity, the wildfire began racking up a list of colourful nicknames. Within the span of a few days, the blaze had swelled in size, from some 1,200 hectares (3,000 acres) to more than 220,000 hectares (544,000 acres) . It cut a path of destruction through Fort McMurray, a city in the heart of Alberta\u2019s oilsands, forcing the evacuation of more than 88,000 people and flattening some parts of the city, leaving a trail of charred rubble in its wake. Few on the front lines had ever seen anything like it. \u201cIt\u2019s an unprecedented fire with respect to the rate it spread, how it involved the community,\u201d said regional fire chief Darby Allen earlier this week, after cooler temperatures and higher humidity allowed crews to get a handle on the fire. \u201cThe way this thing happened, the way it travelled, the way it behaved \u2013 they\u2019re rewriting their formulas on how fires behave, based on this fire,\u201d he said. So what made this fire different from the hundreds of others that ignite yearly in the region, or other wildfires around the world? \u201cWe\u2019ve had faster fire speeds, we\u2019ve had bigger fires, but this one, in terms of impact and where it landed, it is definitely historic,\u201d explained Chad Morrison, Alberta\u2019s manager of wildfire prevention. A 2011 fire in northern Alberta grew to more than 700,000 hectares (1.7m acres). Another, in 1951, burned some 1.4m hectares (3.5m acres), becoming one of the largest recorded fires ever seen in North America. But these fires burned in remote areas of the province, Morrison said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever seen a community of this size and scale be impacted by a wildfire of this size and ferocity.\u201d  The fire pitted firefighting crews \u2013 often more used to battling blazing houses or apartments \u2013 against a wildfire capable of sweeping through entire neighbourhoods. Firefighters managed to save around 85% of the city, leaving an estimated 2,400 homes and buildings to the flames.  The cause of the extreme fire, which first ignited in a remote forested area, remains under investigation.  Shifting winds early last week saw the fire swiftly transform from one that was largely under control into a raging blaze that breached the boundaries of Fort McMurray. At one point, the fire managed to jump a kilometre-wide river.  \u201cNo amount of tankers or resources, or no size of firebreak, could have prevented it from hitting the community that day,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cSometimes Mother Nature is going to do what it wants to do and bad things happen.\u201d The \u201cnasty, dirty\u201d fire \u2013 in the words of the local fire chief \u2013 surprised scientists by igniting its own fires, said Mike Flannigan, who studies wildland fire at Edmonton\u2019s University of Alberta. Fuelled by tinder and helped along by unseasonably warm weather and low humidity, the fire released massive amounts of energy as it moved, creating its own weather, including lightning. Fires that produce lightning are not unheard of, said Flannigan. \u201cBut this one generated lightning and then generated new fire starts. That\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard this.\u201d As the fire made headlines around the world, many were quick to link its extreme behaviour to climate change. But Kerry Anderson, a fire research scientist with Natural Resources Canada, said the long-term records needed to firmly establish whether this link existed. \u201cWe know that forest fires occurred 100 years ago, but it\u2019s not really until the last 15 or 20 years that we\u2019ve gotten a fairly reliable record of the fire area being burned every year.\u201d  He pointed to the current El Ni\u00f1o event to explain the extreme fire. A mild winter in Canada saw the fire season start some four weeks earlier than usual and helped created the tinder-dry conditions. \u201cFire is a natural part of the environment in Canada \u2026 If it weren\u2019t for fires, mature forests would suddenly be susceptible to fire and disease.\u201d Others say climate change could make these kinds of extreme fire events the new normal. \u201cWe have a temperature and it\u2019s turning into a fever and we\u2019re trying to ignore it,\u201d said Tim Lynham, a fire behaviour expert with Natural Resources Canada.           Alberta driver\u2019s dashcam footage of wildfire     Related: The arsonists of Fort McMurray have a name | Martin Lukacs    Climate warming has seen snow melt earlier, leaving soil and vegetation drier and helping to push the fire season to begin earlier. The result is a longer period of the year when fires can occur, said Lynham. \u201cAnd with that will come more threats to communities.\u201d More than 500 firefighters continue to fight the blaze in northern Alberta. Its growth has slowed in recent days and its size now hovers around 241,000 hectares. Winds have helped shift its movement away from the communities. Across Alberta, where more than 15 wildfires are currently burning, firefighters continue to aggressively focus on the fire they call the Beast, all too conscious of its latent strength and power to wreak havoc.  \u201cIt\u2019s kind of a sleeping giant in that forested area,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cAnd someday, when it gets hot and dry again, it\u2019s going to wake up and go for a little walk in the forest and burn some more.\u201d",
