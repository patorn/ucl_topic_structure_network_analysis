  "body": "The Castleford coach, Daryl Powell, is likely to become the latest coach to incur a fine from the Rugby Football League after branding Ben Thaler\u2019s refereeing performance during his side\u2019s 33-26 defeat by Wigan \u201cunacceptable\u201d. If Super League persists with its controversial Thursday night slot in the coming years, perhaps it should consider striking a deal to play every game in Castleford after another thriller here. Games in this part of West Yorkshire are never dull and, while the spotlight is usually on the action concerning the players, most of the attention after the match here fell on Thaler after Powell\u2019s extraordinary dressing-down of the official regarded by many as Super League\u2019s best. In a game lasting more than two hours with numerous video referee referrals, Powell was highly critical of Thaler \u2013 who was dropped following an earlier match refereeing Castleford this season \u2013 for his failure to communicate with the players in the appropriate fashion.   Related: Sam Tomkins inspires Wigan to handsome win over Leeds    Powell said: \u201cHe got dropped after he refereed us in Catalans; if I dropped a player as many times I\u2019d be getting rid of him at the end of the year. The way he\u2019s talking to players is unacceptable \u2013 every single one of my players is saying that, some of whom have a decent relationship with him, too. I\u2019ll cop a fine and I don\u2019t care. There seems to be an issue there with him.\u201d Powell\u2019s side came up narrowly short in a game that, away from the controversy involving Thaler, was a fine spectacle between two of the competition\u2019s in-form sides. Wigan just about had enough throughout to repel numerous second-half fightbacks from the Tigers, eventually prevailing to move level on points with Hull FC at the top of the table before the rest of this weekend\u2019s fixtures. \u201cI\u2019m not being arrogant here but we\u2019re playing at about four or five out of 10 at the moment,\u201d said the Wigan coach, Shaun Wane. \u201cThere\u2019s miles of improvement left in us. We\u2019re halfway through the year now and we\u2019ve just got our halves back playing together, and both Matty [Smith] and George [Williams] were very good for us.\u201d Smith\u2019s game-management was one of the key factors which split the sides on the night, with the scrum-half\u2019s kicking game pivotal for Wigan throughout. Tries for Josh Charnley and a first back in Wigan colours for Sam Tomkins, coupled with three successful kicks from Smith, nudged the Warriors into a 14-12 lead at the break. But it was events after the hooter which sparked the first of several controversial moments on the night. A Wigan defender appeared to be offside when collecting the ball after a Luke Gale kick but, instead of awarding a penalty, Thaler blew for half-time. Much to the chagrin of the home fans, Thaler would ignore the protests from the Castleford players but not before showing a yellow card to the their centre Jake Webster for dissent. \u201cIt was a poor call \u2013 there was clearly an offside there \u2013 but it was poor by Jake,\u201d Powell later conceded. Wigan would punish their opponents during the 10-minute spell after the break with a man advantage, as Dom Manfredi crossed to extend their lead. Castleford hit back with a fine try from Webster just after a penalty goal from Gale, but Wigan always seemed to have the hosts at arm\u2019s length. Charnley\u2019s second was followed by another moment that irked the home fans, as Sam Powell stabbed on and touched down with most of the Castleford defence assuming Thaler would blow for a knock-on. Denny Solomona\u2019s second gave Powell\u2019s side faint hope of a fourth successive win but a drop goal from Smith five minutes from time secured a crucial victory for the Warriors \u2013 who are joint-top of the table despite being nowhere near their best in the eyes of their head coach.
