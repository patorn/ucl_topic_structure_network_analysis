  "body": "Welcome back to our ongoing effort to demystify cryptic clueing and entice the cautious but curious to crosswords based on wordplay. A quick reminder that a cryptic clue typically has a definition of the answer (either at its beginning or its end and indicated in bold below), and a little recipe for the letters that spell out that answer. (The names of the setters whose clues are cited generally link to Q&As, if you want to try to get inside the head of each.) A neat way of giving that recipe is to use abbreviations that can be combined or meddled with, and so solvers get to know the lingo used in various areas of life that have a lot of abbreviations. The British army, for example. The most important thing you need to know \u2013 and the soldier that you encounter most often when solving \u2013 is the GI. This priapic nylons-sporting visitor might be history now, and it\u2019s of at least mild interest to note that the letters may have originally stood for \u201cgalvanized iron\u201d rather than \u201cgovernment issue\u201d, but all the solver needs to remember is that \u201csoldier\u201d in a clue might indicate GI in the answer. Here\u2019s Paul:  13ac Musical soldiers (4)[ abbrev. for a soldier, twice ]  It\u2019s \u201csoldiers\u201d plural here, so you take GI twice and you\u2019ve got yourself the title of a Lerner/Loewe musical, GIGI. Not so hard, is it? Except that it\u2019s not always that simple ... ... in the military, or in cryptic clueing. If GI gets you nowhere, perhaps the setter has some other soldiers in mind. Here\u2019s Crucible:  19ac Blunt character soldiers follow? (7)[ synonym for \u2018character\u2019, \u2018followed\u2019 by abbrev. for some \u2018soldiers\u2019 ][ TRAIT followed by OR ]  These soldiers are the Other Ranks, abbreviated to OR and whacked after TRAIT to give such a TRAITOR as (Anthony) Blunt. Oh yes, and those soldiers might also indicate the letters NCO (non-commissioned officers) as part of ENCORE, INCOME or indeed COMMON COLD. Those in the higher ranks tend to be clued with the more respectful \u201cofficer\u201d, and the one to keep in mind is the colonel. Nutmeg:  16ac Officer slow to check everything\u2019s in order (7)[ abbrev. for an \u2018officer\u2019 + synonym for \u2018late\u2019 ][ COL + LATE ]  And that\u2019s it. Oh, except that of course, \u201csoldiers\u201d might equally indicate a corps. Here\u2019s Rufus:  1ac To fall back, a mistake made by soldiers (7)[ synonym for \u2018mistake\u2019 after (\u2018by\u2019) abbrev. for \u2018Royal Engineers\u2019 (\u2018soldiers\u2019) ][ RE + LAPSE ]  The RE\u2019s colleagues in the Regiment of Artillery, by the way, tend to be clued by \u201cgunners\u201d, requiring an RA.  And that really is it. Um, except to say that since \u201cmen\u201d is a way of referring to soldiers, \u201cmen\u201d in a clue might be doing the same job, or MEN might be part of the answer to a clue describing military matters, except that \u201cmen\u201d might also have something to do with chessmen (which we\u2019ll return to).  Ah yes, and thanks to the existence of the existence of belligerent termites, \u201csoldier\u201d might also mean something that\u2019s not even a person. Here\u2019s Paul again ...  6d Soldier shackling a young rogue, one solving others\u2019 problems? (5,4)[ what a \u2018soldier\u2019 might be, going around (\u2018shackling\u2019) an anagram (\u2018rogue\u2019) of AYOUNG ][ ANT around GONYAU ]  ... with a clue for AGONY AUNT which uses \u201csoldier\u201d, like other puzzles use \u201cworker\u201d, to give ANT. I know, it\u2019s a minefield. Happily, only in metaphor. Over to you Beginners, any questions? And seasoned solvers, any favourite military clues you would like to share? Your homework is this splendid puzzle by Puck, which takes what we\u2019ve been talking about and makes it into a touching theme.",
