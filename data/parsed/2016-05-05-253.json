  "body": "Thursday\u2019s best bets, by Greg Wood The ground at Chester has dried to good all round ahead of the second day of the May Festival meeting, and another warm afternoon is in prospect as US Army Ranger, the narrow ante-post favourite for the Derby, goes on trial for Epsom in the Group Three Chester Vase.   Related: Horse racing tips: Thursday 5 May    There was a 32-year gap between Shergar, in 1981, and Ruler Of The World in 2013, the last two horses to complete the Vase-Derby double, but Aidan O\u2019Brien is such a keen supporter of this meeting that it is unlikely to be another three decades before it happens again. Even by Ballydoyle standards, US Army Ranger\u2019s pedigree is impeccable \u2013 he is by Galileo out of Moonstone, who took the Irish Oaks in 2008 \u2013 and he was a 16-1 chance for the Derby before he had even set foot on a racecourse. His three-quarter length success in a maiden at The Curragh last month confirmed his potential, and while he faces some unexposed opponents, it will be hugely disappointing if US Army Ranger (3.10) fails to win convincingly today. If he does come home in front, US Army Ranger\u2019s margin of victory over High Grounds will be one point of interest, as Charlie Hills\u2019s colt was nine-and-a-half lengths behind Midterm, who is a point behind US Army Ranger in the Derby betting, in the Sandown Classic Trial last month. Western Hymn, the favourite for the Group Three Huxley Stakes, also ran at Sandown the same afternoon, when he started odds-on for the Gordon Richards Stakes but did not look entirely comfortable as he failed to hold off My Dream Boat in the last half-furlong. It was the performance of a horse to treat with some caution at short odds, and while Cannock Chase (2.40) is making his seasonal debut today, he looks a better bet at the prices at around 4-1. Elsewhere on the card, Reflektor (4.55) can follow up his recent success at Thirsk, while Lord Franklin (5.25) is a big price for a well-drawn front-runner at this course. He did not show much on his return to action at Haydock last month, but should come on for the run and is feasibly weighted off 79 having won over this trip at Nottingham three runs ago from a mark of 75.
