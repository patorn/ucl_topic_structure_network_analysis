  "body": "My uncle John Norton, who has died aged 85, was an aeronautical engineer whose achievements added greatly to the quality and safety of modern aircraft. John was born in Bristol, son of May (nee Rich) and John, an engineer, and after leaving St Brendan\u2019s grammar school began working for the British Aircraft Corporation in Bristol, where he became part of the company\u2019s mission to produce ever lighter, stronger components. John\u2019s early experiments involved the use of explosives to \u201cblow\u201d sheets of titanium into preformed moulds. Over time his thinking developed \u2013 and success finally came with the use of electrically heated moulds, into which the hot, malleable titanium was formed using high-pressure benign gas. The first production item of real significance was an Airbus under-wing access panel. When it went into successful production it was probably the lightest, strongest and most corrosion-resistant titanium structure ever produced. The process \u2013 now universally known as \u201csuperplastic forming\u201d \u2013 has since been adopted worldwide. Spin-offs of the technique led to improvements in medical implants, racing car parts, ship structures and locomotive components. John also collaborated with surgeons pioneering microsurgery to create fine surgical instruments. On retirement he was in demand as a consultant, helping others establish their superplastic forming capabilities. John embodied Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s injunction not to \u201cunderestimate the determination of a quiet man\u201d. He was very determined, and worked out of the limelight. He was a great listener \u2013 and unfailingly asked exactly the right questions, making just the right comments to help you to the correct conclusions. He was also enormous fun \u2013 as indicated by the wicked glint in his eye and a tiny tug at the corner of his mouth. He is survived by his wife, Teresa (nee James), whom he married in 1954, their children, Kevin and Mandy, and granddaughters Jade and Rubie.",
