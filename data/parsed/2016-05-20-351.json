  "body": "Australian community leaders have publicly expressed concern about Q&A audience member Duncan Storrar\u2019s \u201cextreme\u201d targeting by the media, singling out News Corp Australia newspapers for their \u201cabuse of power\u201d. The Civil Society statement of concern, published on Friday, said Storrar\u2019s question to the panel about tax-free thresholds had been \u201cappropriate and civil\u201d, but had opened him up to an \u201conslaught of personal investigations, attacks, intrusion into his privacy [and] family, and ridicule\u201d. The letter noted that Storrar had identified himself as having a disability, and singled out the Australian and Herald-Sun newspapers for their coverage.   Related: Duncan Storrar may just as well have held up a bowl and asked for more | Jeff Sparrow    \u201cThe patent disregard of the impact of this reporting on an individual is an abuse of power.  \u201cWe believe it\u2019s time to ask why a member of the community is being targeted in an extreme way for simply asking a question about the fairness of a tax cut on a national broadcaster during an election campaign. \u201cThe issues involved go beyond one individual and represent a turning point for the open debate, discussion, criticism and dissent which underpin our free society.\u201d It ended by calling for political leaders to protect public participation by voters, particularly those on low incomes, who have a mental illness or a disability, or are vulnerable or marginalised.     Read the Civil Society statement of concern about media treatment of Duncan Storrar   The letter was supported by a broad coalition of 35 community leaders, unions and advocacy groups, among them Catholic Social Services Australia, the Community and Public Sector Union, Anglicare Australia, Jobs Australia, the St Vincent de Paul Society and the National Ethnic Disability Alliance. It had been sent to the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, Labor leader, Bill Shorten, the incoming Human Rights Commissioner, the Press Council and the Australian Communications and Media Authority. \u201cWe think a line has been crossed,\u201d said Craig Wallace, president of People With Disability Australia, the organisation that took the lead on the letter.   Related: Duncan Storrar responds to Q&A furore: 'I didn't want this'    \u201cMany of our members have complex lives, complex families. It\u2019s simply not relevant to be using those to attack people for exercising their democratic rights.\u201d He said it was not the signees\u2019 intention to draw Storrar further into the public spotlight, and stressed that the letter had not had his input. \u201cBut we are now two weeks after the Q&A program and it\u2019s hard to see how we could make this worse.\u201d But Wallace decried the failure of politicians from both the left and the right to protect or defend him. \u201cThe first job of politicians is to defend the rights of their electors \u2013 to speak out if the public voter is the job of an informed voter and Duncan was doing exactly that, and he was crucified.\u201d Wallace said the coverage of Storrar in the News Corp Australia press was especially troubling, pointing out that a picture of him had been run on the front page, alongside detail of his criminal record dating back 15 years. \u201cThere are many Australians with lives with tangled threads and broken threads that wouldn\u2019t stand up to that kind of scrutiny \u2013 and why should they have to?\u201d",
