  "body": "Ryan Giggs has been offered a role on Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s coaching staff when the Portuguese becomes the next Manchester United manager. However, he could decide to end a 25-year association with the club by refusing the position and depart Old Trafford. While Mourinho is expected to be appointed in the next 48 hours, with Ed Woodward, the executive vice-chairman, due to meet his agent Jorge Mendes to finalise a three-year contract, Giggs has been assured there is a future at United for him.   Related: Memphis Depay welcomes prospect of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho at Manchester United    The Welshman must to decide if he wishes to continue at United or that now is the time to leave. As the No2 to Louis van Gaal, who was sacked on Monday night, Giggs was viewed as a potential successor to the Dutchman. Now that he has been overlooked for Mourinho, Giggs may feel frustration and decide to leave a club he first represented as a player in 1991. Mourinho is expected to sign a contract for a minimum three years, earning a salary which will be a marked increase on the \u00a37.5m a year he was paid at Stamford Bridge. He is also likely to want to bring his long-term assistant Rui Faria to the club, casting doubt on the role which has been offered to Giggs. Meanwhile, Memphis Depay has shrugged off Van Gaal\u2019s departure and suggested that playing for Mourinho would be \u201ca nice prospect\u201d. Dutchman Depay, who insisted that he would succeed at United after joining them for \u00a325m from PSV Eindhoven last summer, admitted things had not exactly gone to plan. \u201cI said this because I believe in myself. A love-hate relationship [with Van Gaal]? I do not know. And now he leaves \u2013 this is how things go in football and in life. You learn and you become stronger,\u201d he told De Telegraaf.",
