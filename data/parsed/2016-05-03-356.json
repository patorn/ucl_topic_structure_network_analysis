From Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s \u201cideas boom\u201d to the ALP\u2019s \u201cpowering innovation\u201d strategy, the basis for an innovation agenda is already outlined in their platforms. But building an innovation nation takes a lot more than just headline policies. It also requires reflection on exactly what you are trying to achieve. \u00a0   Related: Budget 2016: Morrison says Australia will live within its means \u2013 politics live    The first question to all of our politicians is: what do you actually mean by innovation? Unfortunately, much like love or pornography, innovation is often something you only know when you see it.\u00a0 Today, many people tend to equate innovation with technology, which often leads to a strategy driven by \u201ctechnological solutionism\u201d \u2013 the evangelical belief that all the answers lie in Silicon Valley and technology labs. But innovation is actually just the way we go about improving or adding value to something.\u00a0 Take Uber, the shared-economy based transport app that successfully \u201cdisrupted\u201d the taxi industry on a global scale. You may access Uber\u2019s friendly, efficient service through a smartphone app, but that technology is simply Uber\u2019s platform for service delivery. Uber\u2019s actual innovative appeal lies instead in its novel way of connecting supply and demand, addressing market failures in the traditional taxi system, and filling a latent consumer desire for better service.\u00a0 Even the celebrated iPhone\u2019s successful differentiation in the mobile phone market was much more due to thoughtful, intuitive design based on an understanding of its end user, than the core technology itself.\u00a0 The lesson here for governments is to be open to all concepts and methods that create value. So, before we rush to train more Stem (science, technology, engineering, maths) graduates who will crank out the tech solutions of the future, we should reflect on ways to redesign our national curriculum and tertiary education system across the board. A truly modern innovation strategy would ensure that all graduates are equipped with critical thinking and design skills required to fuel innovation across all sectors of the economy. The second definitional problem governments come up against is the assumption that innovation is always inherently good. Unfortunately, by trying to promote an innovative nation, governments may inadvertently encourage bad, dangerous or ethically questionable economic and social behaviours. These behaviours can then become incredibly hard to regulate \u2013 especially as they are further replicated and spread globally. Here, Amazon provides a gloomy glimpse into the downside of corporate \u201cinnovation\u201d. The US-based company has piloted everything from the Kindle to drones that can deliver you toilet paper as you run out. This is amazing for customers and shareholders and Amazon has created a model in the US for online shopping that is superior to all else. But the company has been in the public eye just as much for its cut-throat and toxic work culture and for how it is reshaping the retail economy.\u00a0 At the top, Amazon\u2019s white-collar workers are, according to a recent New York Times article, reduced to crying at their desks because of a reportedly ruthless performance management system. Meanwhile, customer service professionals in such a retail model are swapped out for unskilled, casualised and seasonal workers who slave away in warehouses pulling products off shelves and boxing them for delivery.\u00a0 While this system provides great flexibility and cost savings for the employer and consumer, if the model is replicated throughout a country\u2019s economy, it surely paints a dystopian future worthy of some reflection. In fact, one could argue that the \u201cAmazon model\u201d is already fuelling a jobs and wellbeing race to the bottom in countries like the USA. This conclusion highlights that only the state is best placed to rein in companies\u2019 overly aggressive innovation strategies. For example, companies cannot sidestep \u201cinconvenient\u201d regulation to make a profit under the guise of innovation. Airbnb for example, has \u201cdisrupted\u201d the hotel market by flouting of hotel and tenant legislation. This is not innovation, this is just showing disregard for regulation. The state\u2019s role in innovation is to promote a healthy business innovation environment while ensuring that innovations also add social value to our economy and our nation.\u00a0 However, governments often assume creativity must be outsourced and that the state needs to get out of the way for the private sector to function \u201cat its innovative best\u201d. This is a mistake.\u00a0   Related: Malcolm Turnbull's innovation package  offers tax breaks and school focus    In fact, governments have a comparative advantage as a collaborator, a convenor and an enabler of innovation (as well as a regulator). As Mariana Mazzucato points out in The Entrepreneurial State, even Silicon Valley owes much of its success to the active role of the state, not the absence of it. Whether one looks at the internet, smartphones, GPS technology, or in dozens of other corners, government research and business incentive dollars birthed all these technologies and industries. Finally, governments need to remember what the public service itself can do, not only to create enabling environments but also to define the problem and help create solutions all on its own. After all, it was the clunky old state that created the internet and launched man into space.  Getting the innovation strategy right for Australia will take patience and careful thought. The consequences of getting it wrong are high. Somewhere though, there is a sweet spot that does not involve turning Australia into a dystopian \u201cAmazon model\u201d economy. A good innovation strategy will create new, dynamic industries and jobs \u2013 and that\u2019s what we should all demand of those on the ballot.",
