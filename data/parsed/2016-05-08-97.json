Yet the governor of Chihuahua state appeared enthused about having cartel kingpin Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n occupy a prison cell in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez \u2013 the border city once considered the murder capital of the world. Local leaders there are anxious to shed old stereotypes and show that security institutions are improved enough to house Mexico\u2019s most notorious criminal and two-time escape artist. \u201cThe decision of having him brought here is because there will not be any escape,\u201d Governor C\u00e9sar Duarte said on Saturday evening.    Related: Juaqu\u00edn 'El Chapo' Guzm\u00e1n transferred to prison near US-Mexico border    \u201cThis speaks well of the state\u2019s [security] system, speaks very well of the environment that we are experiencing in Chihuahua, and above all, the strengthening of institutions, which we have achieved,\u201d Duarte said, according to the newspaper Reforma.  Guzm\u00e1n was sent suddenly during the early hours of Saturday morning to a federal penitentiary in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, though his lawyers say the move in no way speeds up possible extradition to the United States. Federal officials say the move was made so they could \u201creinforce security\u201d at the Altiplano prison to the west of Mexico City, where Guzm\u00e1n tunnelled out in July 2015 and was returned after his recapture six months later. The interior ministry said in a Saturday statement that it regularly rotated prisoners around the country as part of a policy introduced last September while Guzm\u00e1n was on the lam.  Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s lawyers have applied for injunctions against his extradition, though the process is proceeding slowly. The interior ministry said it had advised the judges weighing the injunctions that Guzm\u00e1n had been sent to Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, just across the border from El Paso, Texas. One of Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s lawyers, Jos\u00e9 Refugio Rodr\u00edguez, told the Guardian he was advised of his client\u2019s transfer at 2am on Saturday. He was not told why the government moved Guzm\u00e1n, though he called the Interior ministry\u2019s explanation \u201ccontradictory\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a common practice that [the authorities] transfer prisoners around the country,\u201d Refugio said.   Related: El Chapo entered US twice while on the run after prison break, daughter claims    Security analysts also expressed surprise at the transfer to Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez \u2013 where Guzm\u00e1n is believed to have orchestrated a claim for a coveted smuggling corridor, causing chaos and violence in the city \u2013 but suspected the government wanted to avoid another embarrassing escape.  \u201cMoving him from one prison to another is one way of delaying any potentially successful escape plans, or they might have had some information that an escape plan had been hatched,\u201d said Alejandro Hope, a security analyst in Mexico City. Chihuahua state officials, who say crime in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez has plunged by 92% since 2010, and who threatened to sue the producers of the movie Sicario for its unflattering portrayal of the city, expressed no misgivings about the local penitentiary. \u201cThe security conditions are well above those in Altiplano,\u201d Duarte said, \u201cso there is no risk of an escape.\u201d In February, Pope Francis met with inmates at the state prison in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, once considered among the worst prisons in Latin America, in a visit publicized by state officials as an endorsement of their efforts in improving the city. Details on Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s security inside Cefereso No 9 prison in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez are not known.  Guzm\u00e1n has escaped prison twice. He is said to have wheeled out of a Guadalajara-area prison in a laundry cart in 2001 \u2013 though there have long been allegations that he walked out with corrupt officials \u2013 and in 2015 escaped from Altiplano by slipping through a shaft connecting a shower to a nearly mile-long tunnel. He was recaptured in his home state of Sinaloa in early January and sent back to Altiplano, where he was kept under constant guard in a cell with reinforced concrete.  Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s beauty queen wife, Emma Coronel, and his legal team launched a public relations offensive earlier this year, saying \u201cEl Chapo\u201d was suffering ill health and was unable to sleep due to security staff constantly waking him. Federal officials showed little sympathy. National security commissioner Renato Sales told reporters at the time: \u201cHe\u2019s sleeping perfectly.\u201d",
