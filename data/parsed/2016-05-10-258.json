  "body": "I first realised something was wrong when my girlfriend noticed that one of my testes was a lot harder than the other one. I really became concerned over the next couple of weeks, when it began to increase in size.  This was two months ago, while I was away in Belfast during Easter break, and I was unable to get a hospital appointment. It was four weeks before I was diagnosed with testicular cancer.  The most difficult part was not only the waiting, but also the realisation that life wouldn\u2019t continue as normal any time soon. You can\u2019t make any plans; you can only hope for the best.  It sucks being 21 and having to have serious conversations about going to sperm banks, about losing all my hair, and having to leave my university two months earlier than planned. It scares me that the next three months of my life \u2013 my holidays, my trips with my girlfriend that we had planned when we graduate this summer \u2013 have all come into question.

Photograph: Ethan Mclaughlin    One of the weird things about the cancer is that I can still basically function as a human being; I can still go outside and talk to people \u2013 but they now find it hard to interact with me. They try their best to be nice, diverting the conversation away from cancer. Unfortunately, as I begin my treatment, I don\u2019t have much else to talk about nowadays.   Related: Coping with cancer at university showed me who my friends are    This day-to-day struggle to stay casual is not exclusive to me. My girlfriend and my parents have each had to deal with the constant bombardment of polite enquiries about me. But while it can get annoying, I can completely appreciate that it\u2019s hard for people to know how to react: it\u2019s not like you can take a class on this stuff. I am certainly grateful that people care and show an interest. I\u2019m getting all this at a time when a future lack of independence due to my disease could really affect my quality of life. As a Europhile and international politics student, what\u2019s keeping me positive is campaigning for the UK to remain in Europe. I\u2019m more determined than ever to try to shape the world I live in. Now I\u2019m at the end of my student days I regret that the cancer has taken away my ability to reflect on my time at university. Ideally, when you come to an important juncture in your life, you\u2019d look back and talk to your peers about what you had. I had a week to leave university, so I only got the opportunity to see all my friends together for the final time in a rushed few days - often at formals, when we were slightly inebriated and unfit for the deeper conversation I had hoped for.

This isn\u2019t what I wanted my final year at university to be about, but it\u2019s put whatever student worries I had into perspective.
