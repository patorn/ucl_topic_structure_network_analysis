  "body": "The sign outside says \u201cHappy Hours\u201d. It has a picture of a woman\u2019s cleavage and advertises *Hookah* *Belly Dancing* *Live Music*. It doesn\u2019t advertise death, which is what I\u2019m here for.  It\u2019s a rainy Wednesday evening and I\u2019m at a Moroccan restaurant in Times Square to attend the New York franchise of the Death Caf\u00e9.  The Death Caf\u00e9 is a global movement in which strangers gather over tea and cake \u2013 or, in this case, tea and couscous \u2013 to discuss death. It\u2019s not a support group; the point is simply to encourage more frank conversation. Started by Jon Underwood in 2011, the first Death Caf\u00e9 was based out of his East London house. Since then, more than 1,000 cafes have popped up in 90 countries. Anyone can host a Death Caf\u00e9 and they\u2019ve been held in a variety of venues, from cemeteries to yurts to, well, Moroccan belly-dancing restaurants. Nancy Gershman and Audrey Pellicano started the monthly New York event in 2013. Audrey is a registered nurse and Nancy is a \u201cmemory artist\u201d. She works with terminally ill patients and their families to create \u201cdreamscapes\u201d, photoshopped montages of memories that people don\u2019t have pictures of. Sometimes she also creates pictures of memories people wish they had been able to create (she recently created an image of a couple on the cruise they\u2019d always meant to take).  There are four people sitting around a table when I arrive: Nancy and three octogenarians. Nancy points me to a neighboring empty table. The Death Caf\u00e9 is an intimate affair; you sit at tables of four rather than chatting to the whole group. Soon, two more people soon arrive: a young guy, K, in his early 20s, and M, in her 50s.     An art piece by Nancy Gershman. Photograph: Nancy Gershman    It\u2019s K\u2019s second Death Caf\u00e9; he\u2019d heard about it in a class at college. Although young, he\u2019s experienced a series of deaths in quick succession. The latest had just been an acquaintance, nevertheless it had affected him more than he\u2019d been expecting.  \u201cHave you ever had that?\u201d he asked, leaning forward. \u201cFeeling sadder than you really should about someone you don\u2019t really know?\u201d The guy had been 27, a talented musician who died of a heroin overdose. K hadn\u2019t been able to go to the funeral in Brooklyn but found closure in other rituals, like listening to the man\u2019s music, or sharing memories on his Facebook wall. \u201cWhat do you think about that?\u201d I ask. \u201cDigital afterlives? The way we live on now in social media?\u201d I\u2019m 33, old enough for social media mourning to feel weird. But K, a decade younger, just shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s normal.\u201d    Americans think there\u2019s a pill for everything. They try and avoid death. They think they can buy their way out.  D, a palliative care worker     Conversation at the Death Caf\u00e9 isn\u2019t moderated or structured. You simply sit and talk. Or sit and don\u2019t talk. There was, after K stopped speaking, an uncomfortable silence. Attempting to fill it, I turned to M: \u201cSo, um, do you come here often?\u201d It\u2019s M\u2019s second time as well. Her mother recently died, she felt like she was getting older, like she was \u201cnext in line\u201d, and so had started thinking about death more.  Another slightly morose silence ensued. And then D breezed in. In her mid 30s, she was wearing a bright blue skirt and exuding an upbeat, somewhat frenetic, energy. Which seems at odd with her job: she\u2019s a fellow in palliative care at a Manhattan hospital. She explains to terminally ill patients and their families that nothing more can be done and prepares them for death. D is Bulgarian but has worked in the US for the last 10 years. America\u2019s different from Europe, she tells the table. Americans think there\u2019s a pill for everything. They try and avoid death. They think they can buy their way out. American kids aren\u2019t educated about death. Look at the fairytales \u2013 they\u2019re all sanitized. You know what happens in the Little Mermaid really? She dies. A painful death. The prince finds another woman. He doesn\u2019t care. That\u2019s real life.  In the last three years, D estimates, she\u2019s seen 80 or so people die. \u201cYou start to know when it\u2019s about to happen,\u201d she said, spooning couscous onto her plate. \u201cTheir toes start curling, their skins starts changing, their hands go a little purple.\u201d She pauses to eat. \u201cThey start breathing quickly and irregularly.\u201d There is one nursing home she\u2019s heard of where a cat called Oscar knows exactly when someone\u2019s died. He goes and sits next to them as soon as they\u2019ve shuffled off their mortal coil. \u201cI guess he likes the smell.\u201d Death brings out both the best and the worst in people, and D has seen it all. There are old people with rent-stabilized apartments whose kids insist on keeping them alive, skewered with tubes, so they can hang on to those apartments. And then there are the scammers who befriend lonely old people so that they can gain their trust and rob them. \u201cThey especially like people with dogs,\u201d D says. \u201cBecause when the person goes to hospital they say \u2013 here are my keys, feed my dog \u2013 and then they go and steal everything.\u201d  Some of D\u2019s work includes home visits and these take her from penthouses on Park Avenue to bedsits in the Bronx. \u201cThere was one guy,\u201d she recalls, \u201cenormous apartment, lots of staff, his dog had cancer earlier. He spent $39,000 treating it. The poodle lived but now the man is dying and he\u2019s worried about who will take care of his dog when he\u2019s gone. He set up a trust fund for it. He made one of his staff its guardian. He didn\u2019t have anyone else. \u201d  When you\u2019re too ill to speak for yourself or make your own healthcare decisions, an appointed proxy makes these decisions for you (normally a close friend or family member). There\u2019s a term for people who don\u2019t have anyone to willing to take that role: the \u201cunbefriended\u201d. Death is the great equalizer, and one thing D has noticed is that no matter how rich or poor her patients, a lot of them are alone. Many Manhattanites, she says, don\u2019t speak to their kids or the kids refuse to be the healthcare proxy.\u201d Sometimes people ask for their doorman or the guy at the local bodega to be their proxy; these people always refuse, they don\u2019t want that responsibility. D has started talking about antibiotic-resistant infections and flesh-eating illnesses when the waitress comes by with dessert menus. We order cake. Life starts to encroach on death: people check their phones, make their excuses, put on their coats, exit.  I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019d thought the night would end, but it comes suddenly and with a sort of anti-climax. I\u2019m the last to leave and, before I go, I head to the bathroom to check my mascara.",
