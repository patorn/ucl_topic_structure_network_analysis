A court in Dakar will decide whether Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9 is guilty of murder, torture, rape and crimes against humanity in the culmination of a five-month trial. The landmark case is the first time the courts of one country have prosecuted the former leader of another for alleged human rights crimes. Activists say it gives hope to the victims of dictators that it is possible to bring their tormentors to justice. Habr\u00e9, hiding his face behind sunglasses and a voluminous white turban, sat in court each day to hear dozens of Chadians describe the horrors they suffered at the hands of his officials.    Victims and widows arrive for the verdict in the landmark trial of #HisseneHabre pic.twitter.com/YGIu0qwAWY\u2014 Ruth Maclean (@ruthmaclean) May 30, 2016    On one of the most dramatic days of the trial, a woman who had been imprisoned at the presidential palace revealed a secret she said she had been hiding for 30 years: she accused Habr\u00e9 of raping her four times. Habr\u00e9 did not speak and stared straight ahead as she made the allegation, as he did throughout the trial except the first day, on which soldiers dragged the former desert warlord into the courtroom kicking and shouting insults, and pinned him down. Later, his legal team dismissed the woman, Khadija Zidane, as a \u201cnymphomaniac prostitute\u201d. Habr\u00e9\u2019s alleged victims have pinned all their hopes on a conviction. Cl\u00e9ment Abaifouta, who was a young student when he was arrested and imprisoned for four years, during which he became known as the \u201cgravedigger\u201d because he was forced to bury the bodies of his cellmates, said the experience had ruined his life.           Watch: Victims \u2018hope for justice\u2019 as Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9 awaits verdict    \u201cFor my four years of detention, I did not exist. I was like a tiny coin, buried in a hole,\u201d Abaifouta said. \u201cFor four years I went through terrible treatment, I slept on the floor. You get sick and you don\u2019t get medicine. You just wait for death to come. \u201cThis has marked my life. I was forced to bury people \u2013 my friends \u2013 who, maybe, if they had just had an aspirin or some other small treatment, would have survived. Men were taken out of prison only to be killed, and women to be raped. This was a nightmare for me. I was a victim of a system that has broken my life.     Cle\u0301ment Abaifouta testifying in the trial, which was televised.    \u201cWhen I hear people ask \u2018what if Hiss\u00e8ne Habr\u00e9 is not convicted?\u2019, I can\u2019t even think about it. Just put me in the fire and burn me now. I was out of my mind when I gave evidence \u2013 I could have jumped on him. I couldn\u2019t stand that I was sitting one metre away from the person who did this to me, and he didn\u2019t say a word. It was the worst insult. It was like he took all the victims, and just threw them away.\u201d Habr\u00e9\u2019s legal strategy was to not recognise the Extraordinary African Chambers, which was set up by the African Union and Senegal, the country to which he fled in 1990 when Chad\u2019s current president, Idriss D\u00e9by, marched on the capital, Ndjamena, and overthrew his former ally. Before he left the country, Habr\u00e9 is accused of emptying its coffers, money that prosecutors hope can be clawed back and paid to his alleged victims. The trial breaks new ground in Africa, where there has been growing resistance to the international criminal court\u2019s perceived racism: all the investigations the latter has opened so far have been in African countries. Senegal\u2019s method is being seen as an alternative, and a precedent-setter for the continent. However, Reed Brody, a Human Rights Watch campaigner nicknamed the \u201cdictator hunter\u201d for his tenacity in pursuing both Habr\u00e9 and Chile\u2019s Augusto Pinochet, thinks the greatest precedent is not a legal one but the message it sends to survivors of other regimes. \u201cWhat\u2019s really precendential here is that survivors have fought to bring their dictator to justice. It serves as an inspiration for other victims,\u201d he said.     A document showing the note \u2018No prisoner to leave the prison except in case of death\u2019 scrawled in Habr\u00e9\u2019s handwriting.    Prisoners under Habr\u00e9\u2019s regime were allegedly forced into cells so cramped that they could not turn around; many suffocated to death in the 50-degree heat. Souleymane Guengueng, one of the leaders of the victims\u2019 campaign, stopped breathing three times and nearly died: he considers it an act of God that he did not. He vowed that if he got out he would fight to bring his torturers to justice. Guengueng\u2019s meticulous documentation of survivors\u2019 stories was key to the prosecution\u2019s case, along with a huge tranche of documents that Brody found strewn in an old Chadian army building. The documents point to 1,208 people dying in detention and 12,321 victims of human rights violations, though in 1992 the Chadian Truth Commission put the death toll at 40,000. Dapper in a black fedora adorned with bright feathers and a large silver crucifix around his neck, Guengueng, in Dakar to hear the verdict, took off his glasses to reveal damaged eyes, ringed with pale blue. He was locked up in pitch-dark solitary confinement for three months and almost went blind.   Related: Why South Africa is wrong to leave the international criminal court    \u201cAll the suffering we went through in prison, the torture, the deprivation of food and healthcare, led me to wonder how someone could make people endure that \u2013 could treat them like animals,\u201d he said. \u201cIn court, I was scared Habr\u00e9 would just explode \u2013 it was incredible for a human being to take in all the things we said about him and not crack. I will forgive him after justice, not before.\u201d For Abaifouta, the trial should serve as a warning to other tyrants, and though a conviction cannot mend his broken life, would nevertheless be a relief. \u201cFor a victim like me, it\u2019s going to be one of the greatest days of my life,\u201d he said. \u201cFor 26 years we have braved fear, violence and humiliation. It\u2019s the climax of our struggle.\u201d",
