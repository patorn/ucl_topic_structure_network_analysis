  "body": "Historically, the bowl has always had to squeeze itself in around the colossal ego of the dinner plate \u2013 whether upfront as soup, or later on, as dessert. Yet after so long on the margins, this humble half-sphere is finally having its moment. Nigella Lawson says: \u201cIf I could, I\u2019d eat everything out of a bowl.\u201d Sara Forte\u2019s 2015 book Bowl + Spoon put the joys of mushed-together food centre-stage. And now, sales of bowls are booming, driven by modern lap-food lifestyles and the rise and rise of Instagram eating. In a survey commissioned ahead of Mary Portas\u2019s new show, What Britain Buys, C4, 9pm, tonight, trend-forecasters WSGN points out that bowl sales have leapt to 40% of new crockery purchased, with the plate languishing at 8%. Instagram\u2019s obsession with the bowl began with the \u201cpower bowl\u201d \u2013 specific ratios of protein, wholegrains and vegetables that piggybacked on the \u201cwellness\u201d trend defined by the work of food writer Ella Woodward. It extended through the 2015 fad for the \u201csmoothie bowl\u201d \u2013 a high-art, Kandinsky-esque constellation of berries, nuts and juiced fruits that was as sweet on the eye as on the tooth. To cater for the new breed of amateur food photographers, bowl ranges are expanding rapidly, with Denby Dinnerware reporting that it has expanded its list to 32 different varieties. \u201cThe bowl is like the T-shirt of the crockery market,\u201d Carla Busazi of WSGN points out. \u201cIt goes with absolutely everything, and in a day and age when we\u2019re always clutching our smartphones, it\u2019s very easy just to have a bowl in the other hand.\u201d Not everyone is as delighted with the bowl\u2019s new supremacy. Some suggest it is another example of the increasing infantilisation of our culture. That in a post-Cereal Cafe world, we\u2019re all big babies pureeing ourselves into our happy-happy cocoon with yet-more blueberries and pearl barley. But Jeremy Lee of Soho\u2019s Quo Vadis dining room can find no fault in the trend, and confesses to having an extensive collection. \u201cWe adore bowls! They are things of beauty. So long as the food is matched to the receptacle, I have no problem with it. Wet things \u2013 bowl - dry things \u2013 plate. Of course, there are a few notable exceptions - for instance, risotto should always be on a plate, never a bowl.\u201d When the mug usurps it, perhaps we\u2019ll need a re-think, but for now, at least, the bowl\u2019s curve is still upwards.",
