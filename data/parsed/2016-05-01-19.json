  "body": "Roberto Mart\u00ednez may not realise he has talked his way into trouble but even the Everton manager appears to accept he will struggle to talk his way out of it. He has twin audiences to convince and the added difficulty that minds, particularly those of the supporters, already seem to be made up. He may be making a concerted attempt to persuade the new majority shareholder Farhad Moshiri but actions, as he admitted, speak louder than words. \u201cIt\u2019s not about winning the fans over with talking; it\u2019s about doing it with wins,\u201d he said. Yet with three games remaining there may be too few opportunities to procure them before an end-of-season review that must have the potential to double up as an inquest.   Related: Everton\u2019s Roberto Mart\u00ednez: judge me over three seasons, not three months    Mart\u00ednez nevertheless suggested his conversations with Moshiri are amicable. \u201cWe all work together really well,\u201d he said. \u201cFor the moment, there is a constant dialogue in the usual way. We won\u2019t do anything different. There will be enough time at the end of the season to sit down and prepare for whatever is ahead of us.\u201d Managers who have underachieved in successive seasons rarely survive in the Premier League, least of all when ambitious new investors materialise. The tide has turned against the eloquent Spaniard with a bold blueprint and Mart\u00ednez almost seemed to accept the gamble would be keeping him on. \u201cIt\u2019s not about making safe decisions,\u201d he said. The popular move would be to curtail his three-year reign. Displays of dissent bookended the defeat of Bournemouth. The first was embarrassing for Everton, when fans\u2019 tweets calling for his dismissal were shown on a big screen outside Goodison Park; the second lasted long after the final whistle as supporters protested not at a team who have underperformed but at Mart\u00ednez. He usually projects an image of harmony but has been isolated by his critics. \u201cBeing a manager is a lonely job and it has to be a lonely job,\u201d he said. He refrained from using the word unique but his use of such adjectives has backfired at other times. The gap between rhetoric and results is a prime problem for Mart\u00ednez after a season when his more outlandishly optimistic comments have jarred in a city where there is a strong strain of downbeat realism. Now he is trying to show empathy as well as humility. \u201cIt is an honour to be Everton manager,\u201d he said. \u201cI know the history and expectation we have, but I bring that on myself anyway.\u201d While referencing the past he argued he was the futuristic choice. Everton\u2019s points totals have diminished since an outstanding first season in 2013-14 but Mart\u00ednez took pride from other declining numbers. \u201cThe average age was nearly 30, now it\u2019s around 26,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we have five or six players in the under-21s that will make the grade to be an Everton player.\u201d The centre-back Matthew Pennington\u2019s ultimately encouraging league bow was a source of pride but modern-day managers are often judged more on their prowess in acquiring players than developing them. Moshiri\u2019s money, plus the possible windfalls from the sales of Romelu Lukaku and John Stones, could give Everton a sizeable summer transfer budget. The prolific Belgian at least provides proof Mart\u00ednez can be trusted with funds but Lukaku\u2019s deputy could offer an alternative impression. Oumar Niasse\u2019s belated first start evidenced few clues \u00a313.5m was invested sensibly in him. \u201cThe fans were able to see our player,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said. \u201cHe was voted best footballer in the Russian league and can be very important for us.\u201d Yet while the Senegalese striker\u2019s subdued display was ill-timed and one of Mart\u00ednez\u2019s better signings Gerard Deulofeu has seen his season ended by a training-ground knee injury, there were other examples of the manager\u2019s acumen: Tom Cleverley scored the opener, Aaron Lennon set up Leighton Baines\u2019 winner and James McCarthy proved reliable in midfield. Mart\u00ednez argued he has the potential to transform and not by reinventing traditional top-eight finishers as lower-half teams. \u201cI arrived in 2013 in a very important moment because we lost probably the most important goalscoring threat in the team with [Marouane] Fellaini and [Victor] Anichebe,\u201d he said. Another rebuild beckons. The surprise would be if Mart\u00ednez is the man overseeing it. Man of the match Leighton Baines (Everton)",
