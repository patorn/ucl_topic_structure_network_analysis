  "body": "Artist and naturalist John James Audubon was a master of ornithological illustration, and also, it turns out, master of the prank. A new paper in the journal Archives of Natural History, Pranked By Audubon, sees the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History curator Neal Woodman lay out how the author of The Birds of America took time out from his superb illustrations to invent a series of \u201cwild rats of the western states\u201d and other creations with which to fool the naturalist Constantine Rafinesque. Rafinesque, an excellent piece in Atlas Obscura notes, \u201cwas an extremely enthusiastic namer of species: during his career as a naturalist, he named 2,700 plant genera and 6,700 species, approximately\u201d. It is already known, writes Woodman, that Audubon invented 11 \u201cfraudulent fishes\u201d for the \u201ctoo credulous ichthyologist\u201d after Rafinesque stayed with him in Kentucky in 1818. Rafinesque went on to publish formal descriptions of the fish, but attributed them to Audubon, and the prank was discovered in the 1870s. But Woodman believes that \u201cother organisms were involved in Audubon\u2019s ruse as well\u201d, including the big-eye jumping mouse, lion-tail jumping mouse and the three-striped mole rat.     A page from Constantine Rafinesque\u2019s field notebook, with a \u2018big-eye jumping mouse\u2019, a \u2018lion-tail jumping mouse\u2019, a \u2018three-striped mole rat\u2019 and a \u2018brindled stamiter\u2019. Photograph: Smithsonian Institution Archives. Image # SIA2012-6065.    \u201cWe know without doubt that Audubon provided Rafinesque with the description of one imaginary mammal, and it appears that he described nine additional \u2018species\u2019 to him. This rivals in magnitude the number of fraudulent fishes he invented,\u201d he writes. \u201cAudubon may have thought that Rafinesque would realise the prank, and he probably considered it unlikely that the eccentric naturalist would be capable of publishing his descriptions in scientific journals. If so, he underestimated both Rafinesque\u2019s trusting naivety and his ingenuity in finding and creating outlets for his work.\u201d Rafinesque had been staying with Audubon, and Woodman points to speculation that the invention of the \u201cfantastic animals\u201d could have been revenge for the \u201cviolin incident\u201d recounted in his tale The Eccentric Naturalist, which was inspired by his visit \u2013 and which bears recounting in full:  We had all retired to rest. Every person I imagined was in deep slumber save myself, when of a sudden I heard a great uproar in the naturalist\u2019s room. I got up, reached the place in a few moments, and opened the door, when, to my astonishment, I saw my guest running about the room naked, holding the handle of my favourite violin, the body of which he had battered to pieces against the walls in attempting to kill the bats which had entered by the open window, probably attracted by the insects flying around his candle. I stood amazed, but he continued jumping and running round and round, until he was fairly exhausted, when he begged me to procure one of the animals for him, as he felt convinced they belonged to \u2018a new species\u2019. Although I was convinced of the contrary, I took up the bow of my demolished Cremona, and administering a smart tap to each of the bats as it came up, soon got specimens enough. The war ended, I again bade him good night, but could not help observing the state of the room. It was strewed with plants, which it would seem he had arranged into groups, but which were now scattered about in confusion. \u2018Never mind, Mr Audubon,\u2019 quoth the eccentric naturalist, \u2018never mind, I\u2019ll soon arrange them again. I have the bats, and that\u2019s enough.\u2019  Woodman writes: \u201cWhether or not it was payback for his broken violin, Audubon\u2019s subsequent relation of the fantastic animals was certainly in line with his sense of humour and may have been meant to test the limits of Rafinesque\u2019s gullibility, or, possibly, his sanity. Although Audubon described Rafinesque as \u2018a most agreeable and intelligent companion and hoped his sojourn [with us] might be of long duration\u2019, he also noted with some humour Rafinesque\u2019s arrogant condescension, and Audubon later termed Rafinesque \u2018crazy\u2019.\u201d There is little not to love about all this \u2013 Woodman\u2019s dedicated sleuthing almost two centuries after the prank was perpetrated, Audubon\u2019s mischief in dreaming up imaginary mole rats, and Rafinesque\u2019s passion and dedication in his quest for new species. I think it\u2019s that I like most of all \u2013 I love the description of Rafinesque that Atlas Obscura provides: the naturalist was called an \u201codd fish\u201d in a letter of introduction he gave to Audubon when they met for the first time, when he was wearing a \u201clong loose coat \u2026 stained all over with the juice of plants\u201d, a waistcoat \u201cwith enormous pockets\u201d and a very long beard. He sounds fantastically dedicated and utterly suited to his task.   Related: William Boyd: how David Bowie and I hoaxed the art world    And I am fond of a good literary prank, whether it\u2019s the \u201cdeliberately concocted nonsense\u201d poetry of Ern Malley, William Boyd\u2019s artist creation Nat Tate, the \u201cdiscovered\u201d Shakespeare play Vortigern \u2013 or more recent fare, as Melville House highlights here. I\u2019m entirely convinced that, as Rafinesque was with Audubon\u2019s inventions, I\u2019d be taken in by any of them.",
