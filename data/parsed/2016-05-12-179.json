  "body": "\u201cBlow, bugle, blow,\u201d sings Allan Clayton, and it\u2019s not as if horn player Richard Watkins needs any encouragement. The Aldeburgh Strings\u2019 urgently communicative performance of the Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings is the icing on this four-layer Britten cake. Clayton pushes his robust but airy tenor in all the right places, eking out the tension in the texts. Watkins is superb. There is vibrant, punchy playing from three incarnations of Aldeburgh Strings, one of the training ensembles continuing the composer\u2019s work of developing young artists, with everything directed from the violin by Markus D\u00e4unert. The serenade was recorded in 2013; from the previous year, there\u2019s the Dowland-inspired Lachrymae, the viola solo powerfully taken by the Berlin Philharmonic\u2019s M\u00e1t\u00e9 Sz\u00fccs, and the Op 29 Prelude and Fugue, its whirling intricacy electrifyingly clear. Leading everything off is a zingy 2015 recording of Young Apollo featuring pianist Lorenzo Soul\u00e8s.",
