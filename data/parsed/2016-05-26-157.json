But with everything now always at our fingertips, many people find themselves blurring the line between work and free time. \u201cTechnology has led to an always-on culture,\u201d says Tracey Eker, chief executive of Flexiworkforce. \u201cWe live in a 24/7 environment where everything is instant \u2013 which puts pressure on professionals to keep up the pace outside of work.\u201d \u201cEmail has revolutionised communication, but it\u2019s also led to a constant barrage of messages,\u201d agrees psychologist Dr Gary Wood. \u201cIt would be unthinkable to have the post delivered every three minutes, or for us to permanently perch the other side of the letterbox to grab every letter before it hits the floor \u2013 but that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing with email.\u201d This is mainly because the devices that connect us to work \u2013 smartphones, tablets and laptops \u2013 are now portable. \u201c30 years ago you had a computer at a desk that didn\u2019t move,\u201d says Jessica Chivers, managing director of the Talent Keepers. \u201cThe fact you can now take things with you has shifted the responsibility of drawing boundaries on when you work from the employer to the employee.\u201d And as use of technology increases, people are working longer hours than ever before. With professionals finding it increasingly hard to switch off, how can we better use tech to make sure work does not dominate our free time? Ideally technology should create a better work-life balance, enabling us to be more productive and more mobile. \u201cSo the technology is not the problem \u2013 we are the problem,\u201d says author and counsellor Tim Grimes. First, don\u2019t allow technology to let you feel anxious, says Grimes. \u201cThat defeats the point. Digital technology can\u2019t control the way you think and behave \u2013 so don\u2019t let it. Know the importance of relaxing, and practice doing the things you enjoy to help take your mind off work.\u201d You also need to set limits on the time you spend on work tasks, says Wood. \u201cSet aside times when we check emails and limit the time you spend on social media accounts. The brain needs to be able to switch off to process information effectively. So you need to create your own time outs.\u201d Eker adds that you need to turn off work notifications on your phone, tablet or laptop during your free time. \u201cOut of sight, out of mind. Also don\u2019t have email apps on your phone \u2013 so you have to go to your search engine app to look for emails if you must view emails on the go. This makes it harder to access work messages after hours.\u201d If you are still finding it hard to strike a good work-life balance, then there are several ways you can use apps to your advantage. \u201cI recommend downloading apps such as Offtime or Moment. You can use these to block emails, or you can set daily time limits on certain apps \u2013 they will tell you when you have exceeded them and give you stats on how much you use them for,\u201d says Eker. \u201cIt can be an important wake up call for mobile addicts.\u201d Wood also recommends downloading goal-setting apps such as Nozbe and LifeTick to remind you to do things that aren\u2019t work-related. \u201cIt\u2019s a useful tool to put leisure activities in a diary or calendar so that they have significance. Make your down-time important.\u201d There are also mindfulness apps such as HeadSpace that you can use to help you relax and unwind during your free time. \u201cBy being mindful of what we are doing, time doesn\u2019t race away from us,\u201d adds Wood.   Related: Simplification of work: the coming revolution    Another tip to strike a healthy work-life balance is to split your time into work and leisure using the Pomodora Technique, says Chivers. \u201cThere\u2019s the Pomodora app you can download which allows you to split tasks into 25-minute chunks. It\u2019s a good way of helping your work-life balance as it forces you to draw time boundaries on tasks.\u201d An important part of finding time for work and leisure is saving time on tasks. For this purpose, Eker swears by time-saving app AirTable \u2013 a spreadsheet application that allows colleagues to work simultaneously on a spreadsheet. \u201cIt\u2019s less time consuming that regular spreadsheets. You can tag someone in a cell and they receive a notification. So this saves time on having to email people documents or ask them to complete a task.\u201d Setting boundaries is also key to helping you focus during work, and relax during your leisure time. One tip is to switch your phone to airplane mode once or twice a day, and not to check your phone before bed. \u201cI have a cut-off point, I\u2019ll generally stop work at nine and from then on I make sure I don\u2019t check it before bed. If you do this, your mind starts whirling,\u201d says Chivers. She also says make sure you don\u2019t have your phone, tablets or laptops in the bedroom. \u201cThe bedroom should be for three things only: sleep, reading and sex.\u201d There are also plenty of ways you can strike a good work-life balance without reaching for your smartphone or downloading the latest apps. \u201cThe way I manage my time is to look at output. At the beginning of the week I set a realistic goal of what I am going to achieve that week,\u201d says Chivers. And this output doesn\u2019t just relate to work goals: you must set goals across the whole of your life, including extra leisure time. \u201cBe realistic with your goals. You also have to make sure you have things for yourself on that list, whether that\u2019s walking the dog or doing your allotment \u2013 anything that relaxes you and makes up a rich life.\u201d Ultimately, achieving a healthy work-life balance is about learning to use new technology and apps to help manage your time \u2013 rather than being a slave to your smartphone. As Chivers says, the responsibility for achieving a good work-life balance now sits firmly with the employee \u2013 so you need to be strict with your time and set boundaries on when you use new technology and when you allow yourself time to switch off. Being instantly connected to work can be a blessing, but only when you are in control of that connection.",
