  "body": "The Copa del Rey final was into extra time and still nothing could separate the league champions from the Europa League winners when Lionel Messi played the most perfect of passes and Jordi Alba scored the goal that took Barcelona towards the double. As elated and exhausted bodies piled up in the corner of the pitch, supporters in yellow, red and blue celebrated at the other, south end of the Vicente Calder\u00f3n. Their team were 1-0 up against Sevilla and on course to become the first side to win the double two years in a row for more than 60 years.   Related: Barcelona v Sevilla: Copa del Rey final \u2013 as it happened    There were still 23 minutes of extra time left and nervous moments ahead in a game so intense, so long, that even the referee got cramp but Barcelona were closer than ever now. And, when Messi slipped another gorgeous ball to Neymar to make it two in the last minute, they were there. For much of the night it had not looked as if they would get there. They had been down to 10 men for an hour and had to do it without Luis Su\u00e1rez. They had had to do it against a superb side too. Sevilla, winners of three consecutive Europa League titles, never know they are beaten. This was the first time in seven finals over the last decade. When the final whistle went, Sevilla\u2019s supporters gave their players a gigantic reception at one end while Barcelona\u2019s celebrated at the other. \u201cSince when does anyone win a final without suffering?\u201d Luis Enrique had asked before this game. He knew. They had suffered from the start and the more so from the 35th minute when Javier Mascherano was sent off for pulling down K\u00e9vin Gameiro. It was only Barcelona\u2019s second red card since Gerard Piqu\u00e9 was sent off in the Super Cup last August. Both have been shown to Mascherano and both by this referee, Carlos Del Cerro Grande. The Argentinian watched from by the tunnel as Ever Banega\u2019s free-kick was saved sharply by Marc Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen and an already difficult game seemed to shift further Sevilla\u2019s way. Until then this had been close but Sevilla might have been more satisfied, quick into the challenge and quicker to spring forward. The threat was clear when they broke and the first half\u2019s best opportunity had fallen to Coke Andujar, but he could not finish from 10 yards. The red card prompted Barcelona momentarily to shift Sergio Busquets to centre-back before, at half-time, putting on J\u00e9r\u00e9my Mathieu at centre-back and withdrawing Ivan Rakitic from midfield. The second period began with Banega striking the post, the ball travelling across the face of goal. Su\u00e1rez then pulled his right hamstring and withdrew. Down on the bench he was in tears, with his participation in the Copa Am\u00e9rica at risk. Uruguay\u2019s first game is only a fortnight away. Out on the pitch Sevilla kept coming. \u201cWhen you\u2019re playing for a title your legs no longer feel heavy,\u201d Vitolo had said before their 63rd game of the season. He was running at Barcelona, his team-mates too, and in two minutes Busquets blocked from both Gameiro and Gregorz Krychowiak. Piqu\u00e9 was everywhere, tackle after tackle after header. Sergio Escudero\u2019s looped ball hit the bar, Gameiro sprinted into the area on the right and again Piqu\u00e9 went to ground; again the tackle was impeccably timed. Yet it was not always desperate and at times it felt as if Barcelona were managing this well, notwithstanding being a man down. As the game went on that sensation grew. A Sevilla goal no longer seemed imminent and Neymar, Iniesta and Messi carried forward when they could, which was increasingly often. They took responsibility and occasionally took control too. Fleet of foot, the touch impressive, their runs usually ended with a tumble just as they threatened to get beyond Sevilla. Barcelona grew frustrated at how few were blown as fouls as Sevilla stopped them any way they could. From one that was, on Iniesta, Sergio Rico saved Messi\u2019s free-kick. Rico had to save another in the very last minute after Neymar had been brought down on the edge of the area by Banega who, like Mascherano, was then sent off. Extra time beckoned, 10 against 10. It began with Gameiro\u2019s shot blocked but then Messi saw Jordi Alba racing up the left. From near the centre circle he curled a wonderful delivery left-footed into the area; the ball bounced once and Alba put it beyond the reach of Sergio Rico. There was more and it was mostly from Barcelona now. A Messi free-kick was pushed away, Piqu\u00e9\u2019s header saved and Rico made a double stop from Dani Alves and Busquets. Another red card followed, too, as Daniel Carri\u00e7o was sent off for a wild challenge on Messi, who had been down often but never out. Messi then did it again, finding Neymar to score the second. The cup was heading back to Catalonia again.   Related: How Barcelona lost La Liga, then won it all over again | Sid Lowe",
