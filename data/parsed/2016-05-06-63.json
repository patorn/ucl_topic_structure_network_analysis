The party suffered a big setback in the Scottish parliamentary elections, as they were pushed back into third place behind the Tories.  Their vote held up more successfully in the Welsh assembly and the English council elections than some had predicted, and Sadiq Khan is set to be the new London mayor, succeeding Boris Johnson.   Related: Corbyn hails local election results but faces 'long journey back' in Scotland    \u201cAll across England last night we were getting predictions that Labour was going to lose councils. We didn\u2019t, we hung on and we grew support in a lot of places,\u201d Corbyn said. Some Labour MPs expressed their dissatisfaction with the party\u2019s performance, with one Midland MP suggesting that Corbyn should consider resigning.  What do you think the results mean for Labour? We heard from Labour-voting readers across the country. Below are a selection of their views. You can add your own in the comments section below. \u2018In Scotland the centre ground will now be keenly contested\u2019 I think that the Labour Party now has some breathing space in Scotland in which to work out what a progressive unionist party looks like. The policies put forward in this election felt as though they came from the same box of tricks as Ed Milliband used - 1p on tax, that kind of thing. There had been no ground work for this and the idea had no traction with voters.  The centre ground will now be keenly contested by SNP and Tories with each vying for the middle class vote. For Labour this could mean leaving this middle ground and presenting itself as a progressive radical alternative working alongside Labour nationally to present a raft of policy themes that could look different across UK.  This could also help Welsh Labour which seems to be drifting towards Scottish style meltdown. Policy directions could be based around taxation system changes; housing, local land taxes and social care.I would imagine that the SNP will now fill the role of the old Labour party which could not think beyond winning elections at all costs without looking for policies that push boundaries.  Ivan Cornford, Angus, Scotland \u2018Labour still have huge bridges to build\u2019 The turn out very low and disappointing.I expected my area to remain Conservative but I cannot believe the rise in Tory votes throughout Scotland.  The turnout is low because so many unsure how to vote. Labour still have huge bridges to build after standing against SNP and with Tories during referendum.People are still not trusting Labour and the party in Scotland needs a stronger leader and more support of and from Jeremy Corbyn.  I believe next time around the vote will be very different. The SNP and Conservatives will impose cuts and austerity measures in aim to boost economy.

I joined the Labour Party in the summer and helped elect Jeremy Corbyn. Since then, I have been active in my local ward \u2013 canvassing and leafleting when I have spare time.  For me, the elections were a mixed bag. I\u2019m pleased we have managed to hold onto most of our councils and have made a good push down south too. I\u2019m also relieved Labour managed to hold onto my ward \u2013 it is a marginal seat and used to be Lib Dem! But I do feels pangs of disappointment with the Scottish results.  I am bitterly disappointed that the Tories have pushed Labour into third given Scotland\u2019s history and traditionally socialist leaning nature. We have a lot to do in the run up to 2020 \u2013 there\u2019s a long road ahead of us and it will be an uphill struggle, but if we can mobilise more people, young and old, and continue to provide a real alternative to austerity and Obsornomics, we might just be in with a fighting chance. Emma Deeny, Manchester  \u2018I feel that the future of Ukip in Wales will be short lived\u2019 Traditionally most of Wales voted Labour, because the Labour party used to be very obviously about working people. Welsh people started to see Labour as just another Tory party, and many lost interest in them entirely, turning to alternatives such as Plaid. Ukip are capitalising on the unrest and anger of those in Wales who see no political party, or even their own assembly, as being able to provide what they need. I feel that the future of Ukip will be short lived though, as once they start to be influential in politics in Wales, people will see them supporting the wrong side, in Welsh people\u2019s opinion.  And if Labour continue, under Corbyn, to press issues, such as being opposed to austerity, and opposed to offshore banks, support more power for the Welsh assembly, and really do go back to being a party for the real people, and listen to their changing needs, then a big swing back to Labour is likely to happen in the future.  Sylvani, GuardianWitness \u2018England is basically a Blairite country\u2019 A disappointing result for Labour but not unexpected. Corbyn is up against it, appears to be a genuine guy albeit a bit of a students union politician. England is basically a Tory / Blairite country interested more in low taxes, rising house prices and immigration rather than international, social issues. The UK now needs a new voting system rather than FPTP given that we have a plethora of competing parties rather than a big two.  Local government is in disarray, poorly funded and generally powerless. It is amazing to me that anyone would want to be a councillor these days. Token devolution is not the answer, the regions want genuine autonomy, financial power and the ability to respond to local needs. We are one of the most centrally governed countries in the democratic world.  I generally despair for the future of my children and future generations in the UK. We had good social housing, quality education at both school and university level funded by generous maintenance grant provision and full employment in pensionable jobs.  The young of today in northern England have little to look forward to, voting is a waste of time so they don\u2019t bother. Why should they? Dr John Lingard, Newcastle",
