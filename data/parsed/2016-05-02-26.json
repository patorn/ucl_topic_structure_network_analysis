  "body": "Things are getting complicated in Marcella land, with yet more characters and the grim subject of child abduction thrown into the mix. It\u2019s chaotic, convoluted and increasingly hard to follow, but I do have a sneaking admiration for the show for chucking everything at the wall and seeing what sticks. Detective. Witness. Suspect A good week for our titular crime-solver, who looks to finally be off the hook for Grace Gibson\u2019s murder, and managed to eke out an admission of guilt from her old adversary Peter Cullen. Cullen\u2019s confession came at the end of a lengthy interrogation scene in which Marcella used every last trick in the book \u2013 spraying herself in the perfume Cullen bought for Maddy, questioning his abilities in the bedroom and playing to his vanity by declaring him nothing more than a \u201cpiss-pot copycat killer\u201d. At that point, Cullen couldn\u2019t bear to be considered some ersatz Grove Park wannabe and confessed to all the original murders. That he did so without a lawyer present doesn\u2019t seem to have been a problem for anyone involved, least of all the show\u2019s writers.     Not just some \u2018piss-pot copycat killer\u2019 \u2026 Peter Cullen admits to the original Grove Park murders. Photograph: Amanda Searle/ITV    Cullen managed to get a few decent jabs in himself, twigging that Marcella had separated from Jason and highlighting the shared fear he and Marcella have in being \u201creplaced\u201d by their partners. The old \u201cwe\u2019re not so different, you and I\u201d trope has been done to death in detective dramas, but this was an effective spin on it, mainly because we know that Marcella, like Cullen, is capable of acts of violence. There was some nice tense back and forths between the pair, with Cullen trying to goad Marcella into a moment of rage by mentioning \u201clittle Juliette\u201d, whose birthday it is. Just what happened to her 11 years ago, and why does Cullen seem to know the ins and outs of it? Marcella\u2019s second big victory of the week came when she managed to link the Grove Park killer \u2013 or rather the copycat \u2013 to Grace Gibson\u2019s death, effectively absolving herself. It was rather fortunate that Cara\u2019s friend Leah was wearing the same drug-filled necklace the killer took as a trophy from Grace, and managed to get arrested, putting her in direct contact with the police, but hey, I\u2019m sure Marcella will take it. She probably shouldn\u2019t put up the \u201cI\u2019m not guilty\u201d bunting just yet \u2013 there\u2019s still the testimony to come of Mo, the cab driver working illegally for Hassan. Hassan was murdered this week by an unknown assailant, after revealing to Marcella that Mo had seen a woman carrying a heavy object out of Gibson\u2019s flat. The team are already on Mo\u2019s trail \u2013 I have a feeling that he might point the finger of blame at Marcella when they do track him down. Also under suspicion While Cullen has taken the rap for those original killings, there\u2019s still the more recent crimes left to solve, most notably the attack on the old man last week. The hotel keycard dropped during that botched effort links to Bendik, but while he\u2019s definitely a wrong\u2019un, CCTV footage shows that a hooded figure nabbed his keycard after he handed it back in. Who could that hooded figure be? Well, bizarrely there\u2019s a chance it\u2019s Matthew, Henry\u2019s mate and head of the IT firm that set up the computer used by the person who threatened Cara shortly before she died. (I did say it was convoluted!) Matthew doesn\u2019t look the type to threaten webcam girls and stick plastic bags over people\u2019s heads, but what about his boyfriend Yann? I\u2019m guessing he could get access to the computer through Matthew, and he\u2019s certainly exhibiting enough telling weirdo traits. His surprise for Matthew, an exact recreation of their first meal together, came off as more creepy than caring, especially when he decided to interrupt their date with a tirade about Matthew\u2019s closeness to Henry. Like Cullen (and Marcella), fear of being replaced seems to be fuelling Yann\u2019s fire. Whoever the killer is they\u2019ve struck again, this time adding \u201cchild abduction\u201d to their rap sheet. Six-year-old May has been taken, after the killer murdered her babysitter in the standard fashion. Thankfully they didn\u2019t do the same to May \u2013 probably a bit much for primetime TV \u2013 but why they didn\u2019t is an interesting question. As is \u201cwhat links all these victims?\u201d Surely there are too many interlinked plotlines here for these killings to be completely indiscriminate. Other goings on     Curious \u2026 Sylvie Gibson and her husband Stephen Holmes, who has a strange fondness for Grace. Photograph: ITV    Finally, the \u201cGibson land deal\u201d subplot sparks into life, with Jason accidentally taking out a hit on Andrew Barnes, the bloke from the planning commission. And just as he had managed to get himself back into the Gibson family\u2019s good books as well. The man who did the hitting was Stuart, Bendik\u2019s lodger \u2026 yet more evidence that in Marcella\u2019s London (population: 25) everyone knows everyone. Elsewhere, the Gibsons continue to prepare for Grace\u2019s funeral, which they\u2019ve been readying themselves for for at least three episodes. Stephen, Sylvie\u2019s husband, continues to express his grief in a curious manner, this week staring longingly at pictures of Grace online. Sylvie clearly knows all about Stephen\u2019s fondness for Grace, and was just about to blurt out something telling when she was rudely interrupted by news of the Lambeth deal. Until next week ... Notes and observations  Cameo of the week goes to Claire Shaw, the plummy woman whose PC was used to intimidate Cara, and who blurted out the week\u2019s best line. \u201cHas someone been having sex in my computer?\u201d Talking of IT, the long-running joke about the various detectives rolling their eyes whenever Mark says anything vaguely technical is getting incredibly dull.  That said, Mark is an incredibly annoying character and it wouldn\u2019t be the worst thing in the world if a bag found itself sellotaped to his head in the near future.",
