  "body": "The Desmond Elliott prize has taken on an Irish lilt, with two out of the three authors shortlisted for the 2016 award for first novels written in English hailing from the Republic. Lisa McInerney and Gavin McCrea are up against the English author Julia Rochester for the \u00a310,000 debut fiction prize. McCrea makes the shortlist with Mrs Engels, a fictionalised account of two sisters who became involved with Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. According to the novelist Ian Pears, chair of the judges on this year\u2019s award, the novel was \u201cperhaps the most feminist novel we read for the prize\u201d. \u201cMcCrea has cleverly included just enough historical detail to set a very evocative scene, then lets his cast tell the story,\u201d Pears said. \u201cThe writing always surprises \u2026 his characters are compelling without having to be likeable.\u201d Fellow Irish writer McInerney, the self-styled \u201cSweary Lady\u201d who wrote the award-winning blog Arse End of Ireland about working-class life on a Galway council estate, is also shortlisted for The Glorious Heresies. Set in post-crash Ireland, McInerney\u2019s novel features drug dealers, young love and a gangster\u2019s mother who brains someone with a religious icon. The book has also been shortlisted for the 2016 Baileys women\u2019s prize for fiction, something Pears said was \u201cno surprise\u201d given McInerney\u2019s talent. \u201cShe gives us strong, complex working-class characters with real emotional hinterlands, and plays with the reader\u2019s emotions in an extraordinarily sophisticated way,\u201d Pears said. A fellow Baileys longlistee, Julia Rochester is nominated for The House at the Edge of the World. Set in her childhood landscape of Devon, Rochester\u2019s novel hinges on the death of a father, who falls to his death from a cliff while coming home from the pub. Pears called her writing \u201cquite wonderful \u2013 she is particularly strong on her sense of place. She brings the landscape to life just as she does her characters. We all felt we were with them at key points in the book.\u201d Pears is joined on the panel by Sam Baker, co-founder of the women\u2019s online magazine the Pool, and the former literary editor of the Independent on Sunday Katy Guest. The winner will be revealed at a ceremony in central London on 22 June, joining a roster that includes Nikita Lalwani, Eimear McBride and last year\u2019s victor Claire Fuller.",
