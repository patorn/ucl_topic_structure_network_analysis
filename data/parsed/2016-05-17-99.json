  "body": "ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT This season\u2019s Manchester United strip references the early 1980s. Their current brand of football, meantime, also betrays retro stylings, heavily influenced as it is by 1973. And quite a bit of 1974. It wasn\u2019t totally surprising, then, when the club looked back a few decades to gain similar old-school inspiration for the pre-match entertainment at Old Trafford. The 1960s-style dog handling display was a cute idea, to be fair, though perhaps next time best stick to a few small hurdles along the pitch with a ball to fetch at the end of it, or a guy dressed as a robber with one of his arms wrapped in hessian.   Related: David Squires on \u2026 the end of the Premier League season    Anyway, just as every phone owned by a slightly confused retired policeman has a length of rubber hose attached to it, so every cloud has a silver lining. And on Tuesday night Manchester United have the stage to themselves, as they close out their Premier League season against Bournemouth with a chance to show the entire nation \u2013 well, those not watching Derby\u2019s efforts to pull three goals back at Hull \u2013 what they\u2019re all about. United need to win 19-0 if they\u2019re to pip neighbours City for the final place in next season\u2019s Big Cup. That\u2019s admittedly something of a tall order, given that the record score in the top division is 12-0, last achieved in 1909 when Nottingham Forest beat Leicester Fosse. (Whatever happened to them?! They sound useless. The Fiver confidently assumes they must have given up.) But has Louis van Gaal given up? Well, yes, he clearly did that sometime during 2014. But he understands the grand United tradition as well as the next man \u2013 providing that next man is Herbert Bamlett, who oversaw 12 consecutive defeats in 1930 to an aggregate score of 49-14 \u2013 and will surely send his side out to score at least one of the 19 goals they require. Perhaps in the second half, when Bournemouth have lost interest a bit. Speaking of losing interest, representatives of David de Gea have categorically denied rumours that he wants out should LVG stay put next season. A categorical denial, huh.

It\u2019s a nice feelgood story of course, but a lot of people gave up a lot of time and money to support the team during the cup run, and won\u2019t be able to get into the final\u201d \u2013 Stephen Yoxall. \u201cHarry Kane commented that Sunday\u2019s 5-1 gubbing at Newcastle was the worst performance he has been in (yesterday\u2019s Bits and Bobs), but he should have more patience. The Euros haven\u2019t started yet\u201d \u2013 Leon Herrell. \u201cI spent most of Monday seeking a comparison to Tottenham\u2019s capitulation \u2013 then I remembered the Liberal Democrats\u201d \u2013 JJ Zucal.     Some low-res for you. Photograph: Kraig Dixon    \u201cI\u2019m not sure what\u2019s worse; the realisation that the line \u2018Yet incredibly, the only people who still want him in their team these days are middle-aged Chelsea fans who wish it was 2005 again, when the sun shone every day and Jos\u00e9 made everything all right and kissed it better\u2019 (yesterday\u2019s Fiver) applies 100% to me and that I am pining for the past, given that I have the attached photo of my spare room wall as my Social FaceSpace profile picture. Or the realisation that The Fiver knows me so well and is written for the likes of me. If it isn\u2019t obvious enough already, I should also point out, I didn\u2019t even read The Fiver in 2005 either (*sobs*)\u201d \u2013 Kraig Dixon. \u201cAs a dedicated regular to Richard Foster\u2019s excellent monthly pub quiz (Mason\u2019s Arms NW10, somewhat short of 1,057 regulars), I feel obliged to send a letter with the aim of getting a copy of his prized book signed by the man himself. Supported by his colleague Simon, Richard provides an informative evening blessed with posers, trivia and great humour. I am struggling to see the natural association with The Fiver\u201d \u2013 Leonard Cohen. \u2022 Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com. And if you\u2019ve nothing better to do you can also tweet The Fiver. Today\u2019s winner of our letter o\u2019the day is \u2026 Kraig Dixon, who receives a copy of The Agony & the Ecstasy: a Comprehensive History of the Football League Play-Offs, by Richard Foster. We\u2019ve copies to give away for the rest of the week, so get scribbling.

BITS AND BOBS Here\u2019s how Leicester\u2019s Premier League trophy parade went down. \u201cIt\u2019s just been incredible for the town. People have been talking about the diversity of this city, but it\u2019s really true that this has brought us even closer together,\u201d said Ish Lunat.     Jaywalkers. Photograph: Alex Pantling/Getty Images    Diego Costa and Juan Mata have failed to make the cut for Spain\u2019s Euro 2016 squad. Germany have found room for a knacked Bastian Schweinsteiger in their provisional 27, mind. Rafa Ben\u00edtez looks like he\u2019ll be going for a Burton and staying at Newcastle for their Championship campaign next season. Swansea City\u2019s Andr\u00e9 Ayew is fluttering his eyelashes at Premier League admirers. \u201cIf I have to stay, fine. If I have to leave, I have to leave,\u201d he tootled. \u201cWhat is important for me is that I keep doing my work, and in football the truth of today is not the truth of tomorrow.\u201d OK. After withstanding an early storm and getting away with a shameless foul for their equaliser, Sheffield Wednesday dumped Brighton out of the Championship play-offs. \u201cThe club is a sleeping giant but it is waking up and we are making history,\u201d cooed Carlos Carvalhal. \u201cWe know we will be underdogs but we also know we have a 50-50 chance of making it to the Premier League. And Nasty Leeds have been charged by the FA with breaching Mr 15% regulations over the \u00a311m sale of Ross McCormack to Fulham. STILL WANT MORE?
