  "body": "Malcolm Turnbull has rebuked Bill Shorten for describing Donald Trump as \u201cbarking mad\u201d, although senior Liberals have also expressed strong feelings about the man who has now gathered the necessary number of delegates to secure the Republican party\u2019s presidential nomination. \u201cI think some of Donald Trump\u2019s views are just barking mad on some issues,\u201d Shorten told Darwin radio station Hot 100. Turnbull suggested Shorten\u2019s comments were not fitting for a prime ministerial contender and could be \u201cagainst the national interest\u201d.    I believe in the American alliance; it can withstand the vagaries of Australian and American domestic politics  Bill Shorten     \u201cYou can imagine how Australians would feel if an American president were to describe one of our prime ministerial aspirants as barking mad. You can imagine the ill will and resentment that would create in Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Australian-American relationship is of vital importance, in every respect \u2026 What that means is that a PM, in this case myself, or those who seek to be PM, Mr Shorten for example, should be very careful about the comments they make about American politics. \u201cThey may have views about \u2013 we all have private views about the merits of individual candidates, but to express them publicly, if you\u2019re asking me to echo what Mr Shorten has said, I have to tell you, I think that would be clearly contrary to our national interest and, regardless of what many Americans may think about Mr Trump, would be seen as being offensive to Americans. The choice of president is Americans\u2019 to make. It is their decision to make it and they should \u2013 that should be respected,\u201d he said.   Related: State of the 2016 race: Trump looks to take over America after conquering GOP    Shorten said he was just being \u201cstraight\u201d, when asked about the comments at a press conference, but toned down his \u201cbarking mad\u201d description, saying Trump\u2019s views were \u201cvery erratic\u201d. \u201cPeople ask me what do you think about Donald Trump? Will I just stand here and tell you nothing? Will I stand here and not be straight with people? No, with me, you will always know what we think.,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s not exaggerate. Mr Trump\u2019s comments are truly remarkable. If you think someone who says Mexicans are killers and rapists, if you think that I can\u2019t have an opinion about someone who says about John McCain, yes he is a war hero, but Mr Trump prefers war heroes who aren\u2019t captured. Really! Let\u2019s be clear, John Howard has the same views I do about Donald Trump. We will maintain the American alliance no matter what. I saw Mr Howard make comments about President Obama. That hasn\u2019t damaged the Australian-American relations. \u201cIn terms of the American alliance and whoever is elected, of course we will work with them ... I believe in the American alliance; it can withstand the vagaries of Australian and American domestic politics. If a Labor administration is elected, Australia will stick by the American alliance full-stop.\u201d   Related: Guardian Live election special event with Lenore Taylor and Katharine Murphy    Labor pointed to the remarks by Howard and other Coalition figures about Trump. In February, Howard told Sky News: \u201cI\u2019m conflicted ... because my natural inclination would be to see a Republican in the White House, but I tremble at the thought of Trump being president. There\u2019s an instability about him that bothers me.\u201d  He told Channel Nine: \u201cI think [Donald Trump] is too unstable to hold that high office. I\u2019m disappointed Republicans, who I feel an affinity for, have not been able to find anyone different.\u201d And when the industry minister, Christopher Pyne, was asked about Trump in March, he said, \u201cWell, it\u2019s terrifying ... we are seeing in America these terrible rallies occurring where the people are becoming violent ... democracy should be robust but it certainly shouldn\u2019t be violent. And I think the Donald Trump phenomenon is a real problem for the United States, making their democracy look kind of weird.\u201d During his trip to Washington in January, Turnbull spoke by phone to Marco Rubio, then a presidential candidate, and to Hillary Clinton. Trump has now officially reached the required delegate votes to be the Republican nominee for the November election. \u2022 Join Lenore Taylor and Katharine Murphy in Sydney and Melbourne as they host our Guardian Live election special event featuring a panel of prominent political guests",
