  "body": "If you\u2019re suffering from a surfeit of psychological thrillers about dysfunctional women this summer post- Gone Girl, The Girl on the Train and their ilk, then you could do a lot worse than turn to Joanne Harris\u2019s latest, Different Class. The follow-up to 2005\u2019s Gentlemen and Players, it\u2019s set in a second-rate boys\u2019 grammar school in the north of England and is a magnificently plotted and twisty journey to the heart of a 24-year-old crime, as well as a darkly humorous look at the march of progress in a 500-year-old institution. Harris\u2019s main narrator is Latin master Roy Straitley, a St Oswald\u2019s man born and bred, \u201csixty six on Bonfire Night, with a hundred and two terms under my fast-expanding belt\u201d. Prone to Latin epithets, he wears a battered old gown covered in chalk dust and tea stains, is fond of Liquorice Allsorts and Gauloises, and enjoys a regular \u201cmodest libation\u201d in the local pub, the Thirsty Scholar. Straitley and his colleagues \u2013 some institutions at St Oswald\u2019s like him, others younger, newer, and even (gasp) female \u2013 are recovering from the events of Gentlemen and Players, and debating the arrival of the new headmaster who is being parachuted in to save them from the scandal.   Related: Joanne Harris: 'I'm not as sweet-toothed as people think'    When Straitley meets the new head \u2013 \u201cOxbridge man; education guru; charity worker; Superman ... Some might question the wisdom of letting a state-school Yes-man into a place like St Oswald\u2019s\u201d \u2013 he\u2019s disturbed to recognise an old pupil, Johnny Harrington. \u201cThat pale-faced, bland, insufferable boy, with his impeccable uniform and his air of barely concealed contempt. How I hated him, then and now.\u201d Harrington and his two friends were linked to one of the school\u2019s worst scandals, 24 years earlier, which saw a master brought down amid some very dark happenings indeed. Straitley has nothing in particular to pin on him, then or now, but he can\u2019t help feeling \u201cthat sense of something just behind me, moving with inexorable stealth towards the spot, just between my shoulder blades, where the knife is likely to fall\u201d. Harris is very good at foreshadowing impending doom. The author of Chocolat who is now known as much for her fantasies and thrillers as her more whimsical novels, is also very, very good on school life. A former teacher, she pinpoints with unerring eye the tribes of the staff room, as well as gently revelling in Straitley\u2019s impotent rage as he\u2019s forced to contend with PowerPoint (\u201ca kind of electronic crib sheet for idiots\u201d), email and the prospect of girls attending his school. Moving between Straitley\u2019s narration in 2005, his reminiscences of events in 1981 and the disturbing diary of an unidentified pupil from that time, taking in subjects from paedophilia to homophobia to religious cults, Different Class constantly wrongfoots and misdirects. Bodies slip silently into the water, Straitley is edged ever closer towards retirement, and Harris and her bluff, kindly, somewhat melodramatic narrator, that \u201clast survivor of the fleet, while all around the cannons roared and the rising tide of iron-grey Suits lashed at the beleaguered decks\u201d, ramp up to a satisfyingly eccentric conclusion.
