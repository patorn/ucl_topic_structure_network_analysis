  "body": "Related: Delegates, not death threats: how the Trump campaign got real to seal the deal    Donald Trump may have formally secured the Republican nomination for president this week, but that hasn\u2019t stopped him from continuing to offend and attack with impunity.  Despite this, most agree that if the billionaire is not to risk becoming his own favorite insult \u2013 \u201ca loser\u201d \u2013 he must improve his poor standing among women and Latino voters. That was what made Trump\u2019s decision this week to go after Governor Susana Martinez of New Mexico \u2013 the nation\u2019s only Latina governor and the chair of the Republican Governors Association \u2013 seem all the more quixotic. At a campaign rally in Albuquerque on Tuesday, Trump unloaded on Martinez, who has been floated as a potential vice-presidential pick, saying the governor was \u201cnot doing the job\u201d. \u201cYour governor has got to do a better job,\u201d Trump said, after accusing Martinez of creating a welfare state beset by joblessness and dependency on the federal government. \u201cShe\u2019s not doing the job. Hey, maybe I\u2019ll run for governor of New Mexico. I\u2019ll get this place going.\u201d By Sunday, Trump\u2019s top operatives were working to untangle the resultant mess. Campaign chairman Paul Manafort and campaign manager Corey Lewandowski \u2013 the subjects of reports this week about infighting and chaos within the Trump campaign \u2013 both insisted that Trump\u2019s remarks would not further hinder his appeal to women and Latinos.  \u201cThe Governor Martinez thing \u2013 the focus was on the wrong thing,\u201d Manafort said on ABC\u2019s This Week, blaming the media (once again) for overhyping the incident. \u201cHe was talking about the welfare system and how it was out of control in New Mexico,\u201d Manafort said. \u201cAnd just as he criticized issues in Washington, when he\u2019s in the states he talks about the things that need to be done to improve the situation for the voters \u2026 \u201cThe fact that it was a Republican governor of New Mexico is not the point. The point is that the system was broken.\u201d On Fox News Sunday, Lewandowski similarly argued that Trump\u2019s attack was a nonpartisan indictment of a broken system that he intends to fix as president.  \u201cThere was no attack on a Latino or woman governor,\u201d Lewandowski said, adding, wrongly, that: \u201cDonald Trump is winning with Latinos, if you look at the last poll, he\u2019s winning with Hispanics, if you look at the polls, he\u2019s doing very well with women.\u201d A recent Fox Latino poll showed Clinton leading Trump by an impressive 39 points, with 62% of Hispanic voters in favor of the former secretary of state compared with only 23% who favor the business man. And a CBS-New York Times poll found a large gender gap between the likely general election contenders, with Clinton leading Trump by 17 points among women.  Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace noted that, in fact, polls show the candidate is \u201chugely underwater with both\u201d constituencies.  \u201cYou guys want to make this a story about something that doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d Lewandowski said, shifting the blame to the media. Asked if Trump stood by his comments about Martinez, Lewandowski said: \u201cWe absolutely stand by our statement that the state of New Mexico could be doing better.\u201d Martinez has been openly circumspect about Trump\u2019s candidacy since last summer, telling a local NBC affiliate last week that she was simply \u201ctoo busy\u201d to meet the nominee while he campaigned in her state. Manafort said the Trump campaign had identified a list of potential running mates that included women and Latinos, but re-iterated that neither were selling points in a vice-presidential pick.  \u201cHe wouldn\u2019t select someone only on the basis of gender or ethnicity, because that would be pandering, but the qualifications, if there\u2019s a female who\u2019s qualified that\u2019s a different story,\u201d Manafort said.  He added that Trump was looking for someone with \u201cWashington experience\u201d who could work with the Congress.  Lewandowski sidestepped questions about the rumored rift between himself and Manafort, telling Fox that such reports were, again, \u201cmedia hype\u201d. He also dismissed other reports that the Trump campaign was being massively outspent and out-organized by its likely opponent, Hillary Clinton.

'Illegals!' 'Scum!': protesters v Donald Trump supporters    The Trump 2016 team was \u201csmall, lean and efficient\u201d, he said, claiming that was in deliberate contrast to the Clinton campaign\u2019s belief, as in government, that \u201cbigger is better\u201d. Both men also rejected a New York Times report that said staffers at Trump Tower in Manhattan feared the campaign offices were bugged. Stories of discord were stoked this week by the departure of national political director Rick Wiley. Earlier, in an extensive interview on CNN\u2019s State of the Union, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who dropped out of the Republican race after losing in his home state to Trump, said he found Trump\u2019s early remark that many Mexican immigrants were \u201crapists\u201d and drug dealers \u201coffensive\u201d.  Rubio said he was also dismayed by the robo-calls sent out by hate groups that urged voters to support Trump and not \u201ca Cuban\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s offensive,\u201d said Rubio, whose parents are from Cuba, \u201cNot just against me, but the fact that elements like that are still involved in American politics, and traditionally, the candidate would disavow that, say, I want nothing to do with that.\u201d",
