  "body": "Having taken the major Classic trial on each of the first two days of the Dante meeting, Frankie Dettori started work on his book of Group One rides at Royal Ascot here on Friday, as Nemoralia made a deeply impressive three-year-old debut in the Listed Irish Champions Weekend Fillies\u2019 Stakes.   Related: Midterm fifth as Frankie Dettori wins Dante Stakes on Wings Of Desire    Nemoralia travelled sweetly from the off and quickened instantly for Dettori approaching the final quarter-mile. She then stretched six lengths clear of Aljuljalah without any serious encouragement from the saddle and is now the 5-1 second-favourite (from 12-1) with Paddy Power for the Coronation Stakes on the fourth day of the Royal meeting. Jeremy Noseda\u2019s filly will probably line up against Classic winners at Ascot but showed enough here to suggest that she has all the class required to win one of the Royal meeting\u2019s showpiece events. Her victory also confirmed that she is on course for other significant targets later in the season, not least a return to America for the Breeders\u2019 Cup meeting in November, where she finished a luckless third last season. It was a bold move by Noseda to send Nemoralia to the States last year following an easy success in a nursery handicap at Doncaster\u2019s Leger meeting in mid-September. First, he targeted the Grade One Frizette Stakes on dirt at Belmont Park, where Nemoralia was a very creditable runner-up. She was then pointed towards the Juvenile Fillies\u2019 Turf at Keeneland a few later, but lined up only after overcoming a training setback, and on ground that was much softer than expected after several days of heavy rain. Even so, Nemoralia finished fast but too late into third, having been given a lot to do by Joel Rosario. The sense of unfinished business means that the Breeders\u2019 Cup is an obvious target later this year, and given Nemoralia\u2019s dirt-based pedigree, she would have plenty of options. \u201cNothing went right for us in America last year, so I\u2019m just delighted that she\u2019s back and she\u2019s shown what she\u2019s capable of,\u201d Noseda said. \u201cTwo weeks before the Breeders\u2019 Cup we were in trouble and nothing went right on the day. She should have won. \u201cThere was a huge amount of rain the day before her race in New York, so she was on sloppy ground, and two weeks before the Breeders\u2019 Cup we had a setback and then the rain poured down and the ground went soft. \u201cThere was no pace in the race, she got a long way back and finished fast and I felt that, with anything going right in the lead-up or on the day, she would have won. This has been the plan since the Breeders\u2019 Cup, to come here and then go to Royal Ascot.\u201d Dettori\u2019s week in the big races came to a disappointing conclusion when Flying Officer, the favourite for the Group Two Yorkshire Cup, dumped the jockey and bolted on the way to the start. John Gosden\u2019s stayer was withdrawn, leaving Luca Cumani\u2019s Second Step as the 10-11 favourite, but he had no answer to the finishing charge of the popular eight-year-old gelding Clever Cookie, who recorded the first Group Two win of his Flat career by half a length from Curbyourenthusiasm with Second Step only third. Clever Cookie tends to be thought of as a soft-ground specialist but this was a first success on going faster than good and he will now be aimed at the Ascot Gold Cup, for which he is top-priced at 20-1. \u201cHe\u2019s always been able to go on this better ground,\u201d Niven said, \u201cbut it\u2019s just that I\u2019ve always been worried about him and they put a drop of water on last night which encouraged me to run. \u201cI\u2019m so short of Flat horses that it\u2019s unreal. I have to ride him out myself every day and I\u2019m giving three stone to the other staff so he\u2019s having to do plenty of work, but this is the only [Flat] horse I\u2019ve got in the yard, basically. \u201cI can\u2019t do anything else, can I? I\u2019ve won Group races but I can\u2019t get a Flat horse. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re doing that badly but I can\u2019t get one, whether it be a sprinter or a stayer.\u201d There was a general air of astonishment as Vona, a 33-1 chance, finished strongly to beat Boater, the 11-8 favourite, in the Listed Marygate Fillies\u2019 Stakes, and nowhere more so than the winners\u2019 enclosure, where Richard Fahey, Vona\u2019s trainer, seemed thoroughly perplexed. \u201cI\u2019m very surprised, to be honest,\u201d Fahey said. \u201cNick [Bradley, Vona\u2019s owner] made the entry and there\u2019s not much I can say, but it didn\u2019t look like a fluke. Maybe the stronger pace suited and she got herself into a rhythm and came home. \u201cShe got knocked about at Chester last time, but it\u2019s still a huge step up today. All credit to Nick for the making the entry. \u201cI\u2019m sure she\u2019ll be there [the Queen Mary Stakes at Royal Ascot in June] because there\u2019s nowhere else to go now.\u201d",
