  "body": "One of my favourite forms of fan fiction is the rewriting of movie plots from the villain\u2019s point of view: the Joker is trying to bring joy to Gotham only to be thwarted by a grim-faced weirdo in a bat costume; the poor Wicked Witch Of The West lost first her sister and then her own life to a murderous child, and so on. The point \u2013 aside from reminding us just what a psychotic little monster Dorothy actually is \u2013 is that no one ever thinks they\u2019re the bad guy. Which brings me to antisemitism, which is quite the hot topic (again). Last weekend the Labour party became \u2013 to borrow a memorable description of Donald Trump \u2013 its own comments section. One minute we were a normal country; the next, one of the most recognisable members of the Labour party was running around shouting about Hitler. Not only shouting about Hitler, but incapable of shutting up about Hitler. It was enough to take you back to the glory days of 24 hours previously, when the only kind of antisemitism to emerge from the Labour party was of the more vanilla variety, with Naz Shah\u2019s old online ramblings about Israel, \u201cJews rallying\u201d and \u2013 as we Jews say \u2013 yadda yadda yadda. But arguing that Hitler supported Zionism \u2013 that\u2019s niche. You have to look way down an online comments thread to find that kind of thinking. I am very much looking forward to the publication, History: According To Ken! in which he will explain, alongside Hitler\u2019s enthusiasm for a Jewish homeland, how Jack the Ripper was trying to get women out of prostitution; Fred West was giving hitchhikers a lift out of the goodness of his heart; slave traders were simply taking Africans on package holidays so they could see the world. Brief reminder: Livingstone was tasked by his old friend Jeremy Corbyn with co-convening Labour\u2019s defence review. The guy talking about Hitler. Yes, him. Small problem, though: when people say that maybe the Labour party has some problems with antisemitism, well, feelings are hurt. No, not among Jews \u2013 among Labour. Corbyn has developed some strange tic that compels him to say \u201cand all forms of racism\u201d every time he is obliged to condemn antisemitism, even though none of his old friends or MPs are being racist against anyone but the Jews. Diane Abbott insisted that the whole thing was a \u201csmear\u201d, as though Livingstone was a figment of our collective imagination. When Livingstone announced that he couldn\u2019t possibly be antisemitic because he\u2019d slept with Jewish women, the country wished he was. George Galloway, another old pal of Corbyn\u2019s, appeared with the inevitability of dry rot, insisting that this was \u201can entirely synthetic crisis\u201d, perhaps confusing the crisis with his hat. Others insist the whole thing is a plot against the Labour leader, which makes me wonder if perhaps all antisemitism is actually, secretly, about Corbyn. Honestly, you could have powered the National Grid with the amount of energy the left was expending on telling Britain\u2019s Jews they were wrong to feel grossed out by all this. Like I said, no one ever thinks they\u2019re the bad guy. So the new NUS president Malia Bouattia claims her stance against Zionism is purely political, even while using decrepit antisemitic tropes such as \u201cmainstream Zionist-led media\u201d, which is about as political as a joke about hooked noses. Livingstone insisted that antisemites don\u2019t \u201cjust\u201d despise \u201cthe Jews in Israel\u201d (because that\u2019s OK), but also \u201ctheir Jewish neighbours in Golders Green and Stoke Newington\u201d. Corbyn clearly wishes the whole thing would go away, saying last month: \u201cLet\u2019s respect each other and move on from there.\u201d Yes, we\u2019re all nice leftwing people, what\u2019s the problem? Increasingly numerous Labour supporters are complaining that too much attention is being paid to Labour\u2019s bad apples. What about the Tories, they cry! Didn\u2019t you see Zac Goldsmith\u2019s racist mayoral campaign? Perhaps this should be Labour\u2019s new slogan: \u201cNot as racist as the rightwing\u201d.   Related: Hadley Freeman: I like Bernie as much as the next idealist, but Hillary gets my vote    So while Labour rearranges the deck chairs with an investigation its leading lights can\u2019t even admit it needs, the rest of us can spend our time more fruitfully. Namely, pondering that being nice isn\u2019t the same as being good or right. Describing complaints about antisemitism as \u201csmears\u201d is not the way to criticise Israel, and focusing all of one\u2019s fury at that country while happily appearing on Iranian and Russian state TV, as certain leftwing MPs have done \u2013 well, let\u2019s say it betrays a blind spot. These guys are not the bad guys, but they\u2019re not always so noble, either. Heroes and villains exist only in fiction: grownups know that they live in the grey.",
