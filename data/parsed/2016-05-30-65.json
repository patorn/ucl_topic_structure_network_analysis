  "body": "New research has indicated that almost two thirds of internet clothes shoppers are \u201cserial returners\u201d. That is, they regularly purchase clothes online, have them delivered, and then send them back again, in exchange for a full refund. With many online retail outlets offering free standard delivery and returns, it\u2019s easier than ever to have a change of heart having tried on your purchases. But, I\u2019d say two thirds of us don\u2019t return the things we buy online based on any conscious decision to exercise our rights as consumers. I certainly don\u2019t think about The Man when I\u2019m returning a vest to Asos. I do it because I can, and because my every online move is governed by Cookies which, like a bad friend, tells me things I didn\u2019t need to know while reminding me of my whimsical approach to trends over and over until I kowtow just to make the picture of the trainers go away. So why do I do it? I don\u2019t shop like an automaton. I shop when I\u2019m bored or post-windfall. But sizing online is tricky, choice is ever expanding and I\u2019m faddy to a fault.     \u2018We don\u2019t return things because of a conscious decision to exercise our rights are consumers. We do it because we can.\u2019 Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo    For me, as with all newly introduced laws or social mores, it comes down to choice, or rather, there being one. I don\u2019t buy clothes to return them. But if I can, well, super. A number of new places have popped up, such as Doddle, with the sole purpose of encouraging our retail caprice. It\u2019s not easy, it\u2019s too easy. I regularly walk around with labels deliberately left in my collar. Hug me and I crackle. Yes this is exploitative of a system which relies on trust and faith but, well, bite me because I want to know how the skirt sits over an eight-hour period. There is an argument that, in committing to a purchase, we are simply following the Sartrean philosophy of bad faith; that we think we are not free to make choices and are therefore at the mercy of the circumstance/dress we bought when we were pissed. In reality, it\u2019s simply that we change our mind, and are encouraged to. This isn\u2019t great news for the shop itself. What a process it must be to deal with returns and damaged goods. The irony of the DHL T-shirt as a possible comment on the slipperiness of the shopper/seller relationship isn\u2019t lost on us. Still, I\u2019ve come a long way from my heady days as a so-called serial returner. Even if that 28-day money-back guarantee had long passed, I found that with sufficient gall and a good pair of scissors, you can win. I once unpicked the lining in a jacket because I\u2019d changed my mind a month later. It was quite the performance. I got my money back and subverted capitalism in a single move. But truth be told, I slept uneasily that night.",
