He\u2019s also made headlines with his bold views on everything from drugs, to climate change and feminism. But, as the world looks on in wonder, how do people feel in Canada? Six months after he was sworn into office, we asked Canadians to tell us how they think Trudeau is faring.  The mood six months on On 4 November 2015, Trudeau took office, after nine years of Stephen Harper\u2019s leadership. Harper was known, among other things, for his contempt for the public\u2019s right to know about his government\u2019s activities, insisting that he choose who got to ask the questions at press conferences. One of the biggest changes since he was voted out, according to those who responded, is that government is now much more open. Bobbie Jean Huff, 70, from Ontario summed it up saying: \u201cTrudeau\u2019s not a tyrant like Harper. There\u2019s a new openness in the air. It\u2019s refreshing.\u201d Barbara Densmore, 59, from Vancouver Island, says: \u201cJustin has brought a level of intention, authenticity, openness, thoughtfulness and forward thinking that I\u2019ve never before seen.\u201d She adds: \u201cI think the mood has changed for the more progressive thinkers in the country. It\u2019s like having a light switched on after almost a decade of darkness. But there are a lot of people who are still having time adjusting to the light.\u201d Trudeau\u2019s global outlook has also been a game-changer. Vicky, 29, from Toronto says: \u201cHe is bringing international attention to our country ... He won\u2019t do everything he set out to do, but he is making a great effort to come out of the gate swinging on all his campaign promises.\u201d     \u2018He is bringing international attention to our country.\u2019 Photograph: Chris Jackson/Getty Images    Sean, 24, from Toronto agreed: \u201cThe tone of government has changed a lot. People are more optimistic as the government responds more to concerns of everyday Canadians and takes on a more positive role internationally.\u201d There was general recognition that he is reinvigorating interest in the political process. Colin Mitchell, 18, from Vancouver says:\u201cHis emphasis on young people has truly reengaged a large segment of Canadian society. After nearly a decade of neglect, our current government has a demonstrated interest in the future of Canada.\u201d The policies Although he\u2019s only been in office for six month, many Canadians have been watching to see which policies he will stick to, and which ones he may abandon. We heard from a lot of people who praised how he has handled the global refugee crisis. Christian, 20 from Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, says: \u201cThe acceptance of over 25,000 refugees was very popular and showed the Liberals intended to keep their promises. The gender parity in his cabinet was also extremely popular, as were his views on feminism as expressed at the World Economic Forum in Davos.\u201d Sue G, 55, from Ottawa agreed: \u201cBy welcoming Syrian refugees, Trudeau has reaffirmed the role of Canada as a humanitarian nation \u2013 and has refuted the myth that Muslims are terrorists.\u201d     Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, left, greets Georgina Zires, center, Madeleine Jamkossian, second right, and her father Kevork Jamkossian, refugees fleeing from Syria, as they arrive in Toronto.

One way he is doing this is by launching a national public inquiry into missing and murdered indigenous women. Trudeau also said his government would make significant investments in education and lift the 2% cap on funding for First Nations programs. Dave T, 60, from Southern Ontario says: \u201cThe one policy change that is probably most significant would be the restoration of relations between Canada\u2019s government and the indigenous people. Imagine my horror to learn that successive governments for over 150 years were engaged in systemic cultural genocide. To now have a government that has made it central to their mandate to respect and include these severely marginalised people in the decision making process will have a significant impact on Canada\u2019s social fabric for many generations to come.\u201d However, Trudeau\u2019s policies sometimes appear to be in conflict and many criticised his lack of action on bill C-51, the anti-terrorism law passed by the former Conservative government in the spring following homegrown attacks in Quebec and Ottawa. Anonymous, 46, from Vancouver says: \u201cThe mood was pretty giddy just after the election, and his cabinet selections solidified that. But we\u2019re still waiting for actual significant policy \u2013 C-51 is still the law, we still have first past the post for voting, and the time to change that before the next election is getting short. Trade deals and pipelines still lumber along. It\u2019s still business as usual in most respects, which is not what I expected. I know it takes time to change things, but I would have liked to have seen at least one significant piece of legislation by now.\u201d Not blocking sales of arms to Saudi Arabia also proved unpopular. Guillaume Gervais, 32, from Toronto says: \u201cHe disagrees that \u2018honour killings,\u2019 female genital mutilation, forced marriage or other gender-based violence\u201d are barbaric. They are just a different cultural practices for him. His thumbs-up for the sale of $15bn of weaponry to the Islamic State of Saudi Arabia is also outrageous and humiliating for Canadians.\u201d Gervais adds that on the positive side, the last budget his team proposed seems promising. \u201cCanada\u2019s infrastructure are deficient and are not keeping up with economic and demographic growth. His team doctor-assisted death legislation is also promising. It mostly leaves behind opinions from backward ideologies on the subject and focuses on the patient.\u201d A case of good public relations  Many of those who responded had their concerns that Trudeau was all talk \u2013 and great PR \u2013 but no action. \u201cHis team looks well prepared to manage him. He\u2019s a poster boy with very little life experience. He never really had a job before jumping into politics a few years ago. Overall, Justin is a pretty good actor backed by a very well oiled PR machine,\u201d says Gervais. Anonymous, 46, from Toronto says: \u201cHe looks good but Canadians were looking for more than a change of clothes: they were looking for a whole different wardrobe. Instead it\u2019s like the same elite wealthy people are running things the way they always did. And it\u2019s really disappointing.\u201d However, others said that rhetoric in itself \u2013 even without action \u2013 can be powerful: \u201cThe best thing he has done for our country is his rhetoric. He has promoted respect for aboriginal peoples, acceptance of refugees and other cultures, the importance of multilateralism and humanitarianism ... Even without concrete policy, his rhetoric has resulted in a paradigm shift in the Canadian public on many key issues.\u201d Jury is still out While it\u2019s still really too soon to tell whether Trudeau will live up to the expectations, many people are now waiting to see what will happen in coming months. Peter Jakubiak, 36, from Ottawa, summed up the mood perfectly: \u201cHis policy ideas will face greater scrutiny as they are further rolled out and tested over time. So far his government seems open to input, committed to putting in the work, and not too proud to change or adapt course in response to criticism. This seems a fairly promising beginning to what will surely become a less forgiving general reception.\u201d",
