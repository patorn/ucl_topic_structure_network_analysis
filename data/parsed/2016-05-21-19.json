  "body": "Robin Wright, currently playing the scheming first lady Claire Underwood in long-running TV drama House of Cards  swung by the Guardian\u2019s offices in New York last week on a mission to draw attention to the mining of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d in the Democratic Republic of Congo \u2013 and the war it continues to spark. She has produced a documentary on the subject, When Elephants Fight, and her words echoed those of Joseph Conrad in Heart of Darkness more than a century ago, describing the conflict as \u201cthe most vile scramble for loot that ever scarred the face of human consciousness\u201d. Wright is championing an international effort, known by the hashtag #StandWithCongo, which is working to break a cycle of internal conflict and foreign wars that has cost more than five million lives. The movement takes aim close to home \u2013 at US tech and electronics companies whose demand for rare-earth metals used in the manufacture of computers and mobile phones has aggravated the region\u2019s violence and corruption. \u201cI felt a personal responsibility to step up, take action, create a voice,\u201d Wright said. \u201cWe are using these devices all day, every day, for our convenience, and it\u2019s perpetuating a war. I find it unacceptable that as consumers we allow this to go on.\u201d   Related: Robin Wright targets Congo's 'conflict minerals' violence with new campaign    But is Wright more than a mid-career actor with a new stage and a new cause? And why Congo? John Prendergast, director of African affairs at the National Security Council during the Clinton administration, who has worked with George Clooney in Sudan and is now a director of the Enough Project, dedicated to crimes against humanity, says the Hollywood focus on the country \u201cisn\u2019t a really recent phenomenon. Congo is the deadliest war in the world since world war two. My question would be, why not Congo?\u201d Wright drew attention to an Amnesty International investigation that traced cobalt used by tech manufacturers including Apple and Microsoft to Congolese mines that use child labour in dangerous conditions. A ranking of electronics companies compiled by the Enough Project placed Nintendo at the bottom. \u201cThey simply don\u2019t care,\u201d Wright said. Nintendo countered, saying it took its social responsibility as a global company \u201cvery seriously\u201d and had banned suppliers from using \u201cconflict minerals\u201d in its supply chain. Separately, the Panama Papers traced some Congo mining interests through the British Virgin Islands to companies set up by the Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler, a friend of the Congo president, Joseph Kabila, that are reputed to be central to mining deals in 2011 that robbed the Congolese people of more than $1bn (\u00a3690m). The Congo isn\u2019t Wright\u2019s only current concern. In recent weeks she launched herself into Hollywood\u2019s campaign for equal pay for equal work when she revealed that she threatened House of Cards producers with public exposure when she discovered that co-star Kevin Spacey received $500,000 per episode in 2014 while Wright was paid $420,000 per episode in 2015. \u201cI was like, \u2018You better pay me or I\u2019m going to go public,\u2019\u201d Wright said last week at the Rockefeller Foundation in New York. \u201cAnd they did.\u201d Wright later explained she\u2019d seen statistics showing that her character was more popular than Spacey\u2019s for a period of time. \u201cSo I capitalised on it.\u201d Before playing Claire Underwood, Wright was best known as Buttercup in the cult favourite The Princess Bride, and as Jenny opposite Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump. She began acting 31 years ago as Kelly Capwell, the \u201cdaddy\u2019s girl\u201d ingenue on the soap opera Santa Barbara. She has appeared in more than 40 films since, but it was, ironically, the TV screen that delivered unequivocal stardom. \u201cI feel as though I\u2019ve just graduated,\u201d she told Vanity Fair last year. \u201cI mean, I never went to college. I was pregnant at 23. You hear people say how they have \u201carrived\u201d, but it was just always there, waiting to come out. For me, it just took a long time. I\u2019m 48. I\u2019m finally a person. I think I\u2019m finally ready.\u201d Wright now adds her voice to a cast of women including Jennifer Lawrence and Meryl Streep who have spoken out about the pay gap. \u201cIt was a perfect paradigm. There are very few films or TV shows where the male, the patriarch, and the matriarch are equal.\u201d Wright\u2019s comments set off a firestorm, with many arguing that women shouldn\u2019t have to threaten employers with exposure to resolve pay disputes. \u201cWe can\u2019t forget that this represents a small and elite group of largely white women who have documented proof of their success,\u201d noted Forbes columnist Ruchika Tulshyan. \u201cFor the average worker, raising questions over pay could see them being ostracised or even fired.\u201d That, in turn, triggered anxiety that celebrity-branded feminism might be a failure on its own terms. \u201cIndividual celebrities are great at putting an appealing face on social issues,\u201d wrote Andi Zeisler, author of We Were Feminists Once. \u201cBut the celebrity machine is one that runs on neither complexity nor nuance, but on cold, hard cash.\u201d She continued: \u201cEmphasising the personal empowerment of individual actors, comedians and pop stars \u2013 whether for itself or in relation to others \u2013 only serves to pull focus from the ways in which their industries make money from stereotyping and devaluing women.\u201d And that, in turn, caused Suzanne Moore in the Guardian to muse that \u201cthe assumption that any celebrity who says something vaguely feminist is somehow a hypocrite is ludicrous. It is a way of discrediting women. It happens a lot.\u201d   Related: Stop telling women they\u2019re doing feminism wrong    This back and forth was somewhat undermined by Wright herself. In an industry where men are regarded as bigger box-office drivers than women, the pay scale differential may simply be a matter of market forces. In the case of the House of Cards, she implied, they worked in her favour. This was a game which, for many years, she decided not to play. Wright and ex-husband Sean Penn had abandoned Los Angeles to raise a family in San Francisco and to avoid the \u201cbubble of celebrity\u201d. (In a telling coincident, at the Cannes film festival last week Penn screened his latest directorial effort, The Last Face, starring Charlize Theron and Javier Bardem, about lovestruck aid workers in war-ravaged Africa. The film meditates on the dangers of mixing charity and social-conscientiousness with entertainment. The Hollywood Reporter called it a \u201cstunningly self-important but numbingly empty cocktail of romance and insulting refugee porn.\u201d) After repeated breakups and reconciliations, Wright and Penn divorced in 2010. \u201cI believe we were together not only to have our beautiful children but to learn how to love \u2026 for the next time around, the right way,\u201d she told Vanity Fair. \u201cAnd then, what I\u2019m looking for in people now,\u201d she adds, \u201cis kindness.\u201d Wright is currently with Ben Foster, an actor 13 years her junior. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s not ladylike [to say] but I\u2019ve never laughed more, read more or come more than with Ben. He inspires me to be the best of myself. There\u2019s so much to learn. It\u2019s endless. How great! It took me a long time to grow up. Love is possible as life is possible.\u201d Wright said the inequality in her pay package came after years of part-time work. \u201cI wasn\u2019t building my salary bracket. If you don\u2019t build salary bracket with notoriety and presence, you\u2019re not in the game any more. You become a B-list actor \u2026 You\u2019re not box office material. You don\u2019t hold the value you would have held if you had done four movies a year, like Nicole Kidman and Cate Blanchett did, during the time I was raising my kids. Now I\u2019m kind of on a comeback at 50 years old.\u201d No wonder, then, that Wright likes to temper the potential superficialty of one profession \u2013 next year she\u2019ll appear in a film adaptation of the TV series Wonder Woman \u2013 with a grounded, life-and-death real-world issue. Wright told the Guardian\u2019s Ed Pilkington her decision to get involved with the effort to help with the Congo and the Enough Project came after visiting women who\u2019d been raped by soldiers. \u201cSome had had six or eight surgeries to rebuild their reproductive system,\u201d Wright reported. \u201cThey were not able to stand sometimes for a year and a half. To hear their harrowing stories, and then to ask as an American travelling abroad, \u2018What can I do, measly old me, I have no idea what you\u2019ve been through.\u2019 They all said the same thing: \u2018Can you be our voice? We don\u2019t have a voice here.\u2019 That\u2019s when we decided to amplify that voice for them, back in America.\u201d The Wright File Born 8 April, 1966 in Dallas, Texas, but raised in San Diego. Her mother was a cosmetics saleswoman and her father worked for a pharmaceutical company. She began modelling at 14 and, after leaving school, got a part in the soap opera Santa Barbara, where she met her first husband. Wright later moved into film, starring in the Princess Bride, Forrest Gump and the Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. She married (and eventually split from) Sean Penn, with whom she has two children. Best of times Winning the Golden Globe award for best actress (television series drama) for her role as Claire Underwood in House of Cards. Wright was the first actress to win a Golden Globe for a web television series. Worst of times Her divorce from Sean Penn, after 13 years of marriage and numerous separations What she says \u201cI feel as though I\u2019ve just graduated. I mean, I never went to college. I was pregnant at 23. You hear people say how they have \u2018arrived\u2019, but it was just always there, waiting to come out. For me, it just took a long time. I\u2019m 48. I\u2019m finally a person. I think I\u2019m finally ready.\u201d Vanity Fair What others say \u201cIt\u2019s just so clear she\u2019s an amazing actress, one of the best we\u2019ve got. But she was in movies that were not home runs.\u201d Jodie Foster, who directed Wright in an episode of House of Cards, Vanity Fair",
