Related: Knitting to BDSM: readers on where to find a sense of community    The proportion of the population who identify in NatCen\u2019s British Social Attitudes survey as having no religion, referred to as \u201cnones\u201d, reached 48.5% in 2014, outnumbering the 43.8% who define themselves as Christian \u2013 Anglicans, Catholics and other denominations. In 2011 the BSA survey found 46% identified as having no religion. The 2011 census gave a much lower figure of 25%, but phrased the question differently. \u201cThe striking thing is the clear sense of the growth of \u2018no religion\u2019 as a proportion of the population,\u201d said Stephen Bullivant, senior lecturer in theology and ethics at St Mary\u2019s Catholic University in Twickenham, who analysed data collected through British Social Attitudes surveys over three decades. \u201cThe main driver is people who were brought up with some religion now saying they have no religion. What we\u2019re seeing is an acceleration in the numbers of people not only not practising their faith on a regular basis, but not even ticking the box. The reason for that is the big question in the sociology of religion.\u201d The report did not examine data from Scotland or Northern Ireland. Last month a Scottish Social Attitudes survey found that 52% of the population said they were not religious, compared with 40% in 1999. In Northern Ireland, which has long been the most religious part of the UK, 7% said in the 2011 census that they belonged to a non-Christian religion or no religion. The new analysis will fuel concern among Christian leaders about growing indifference to organised religion. This year the Church of England said it expected attendance to continue to fall for another 30 years as its congregations age and the millennial generation spurns the institutions of faith. According to Bullivant\u2019s report, Contemporary Catholicism in England and Wales \u2013 which will be launched at the House of Commons on Tuesday, both the Anglican and Catholic churches are struggling to retain people brought up as Christians. Four out 10 adults who were raised as Anglicans define themselves as having no religion, and almost as many \u201ccradle Catholics\u201d have abandoned their family faith to become \u201cnones\u201d. Neither church is bringing in fresh blood through conversions. Anglicans lose 12 followers for every person they recruit, and Catholics 10. The vast majority of converts come from other Christian denominations, rather than non-Christians or people with no religion. \u201cThere\u2019s a kind of denominational musical chairs,\u201d said Bullivant. \u201cNo one is making serious inroads into the non-Christian population.\u201d The proportion of the population who describe themselves as Anglican plunged from 44.5% in 1983 to 19% in 2014. Catholics made up 8.3%, other Christians 15.7% and non-Christian religions 7.7%.   Religions   The analysis throws up striking regional variations. London has the smallest proportion of people identifying as \u201cnones\u201d, at an average of 40%, accounted for by the capital\u2019s large minority ethnic population. In contrast, 59.5% of people in Wales say they have no religion.   Regions   Half of all Christians in England and Wales are over the age of 55, although Catholics have a younger age profile. Of those describing themselves as Christian, 58.6% are women. More than nine in 10 Christians are white, which is slightly higher than in the general population. Far more Catholics (27.5%) than Anglicans (8.9%) attend church once a week or more.   Upbringing   The report is intended to fill a gap in reliable up-to-date statistics about the state of Christianity, and particularly Catholicism. It drew on data from British Social Attitudes surveys between 1983 and 2014.

This can flag up areas for further research or groups that need particular pastoral attention.\u201d A spokesperson for the Church of England said: \u201cThe increase in those identifying as \u2018no faith\u2019 reflects a growing plurality in society rather than any increase in secularism or humanism. We do not have an increasingly secular society as much as a more agnostic one. \u201cIn a global context, adherence to religion is growing rather than decreasing. Christianity remains the world\u2019s largest religion with over 2 billion adherents. In the UK the latest census found the overwhelming majority of people to have a faith.\u201d Mark O\u2019Toole, the Catholic bishop of Plymouth, said the report demonstrated \u201cthe challenge to Christian evangelisation in this country\u201d and would \u201chelp hone priorities\u201d. He added: \u201cThe church is committed to reaching out to those who are seeking meaning in their lives and helping them discover the joy of an encounter with Christ.\u201d  \u2022 This article was amended on 9 June 2016 to correct the subheading which said that the proportion of the population who identify as having no religion rose from 25% in 2011 to 48.5% in 2014. That compared figures from two different sources: the 2011 census and NatCen\u2019s 2014 British Social Attitudes survey which asked questions about religion in different ways. The 2011 BSA survey found 46% identified as having no religion. The text of the article has also been amended to make this clear.",
