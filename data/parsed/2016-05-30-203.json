  "body": "It\u2019s odd going somewhere to listen. Usually you go somewhere to look. I\u2019d never knowingly heard a nightingale. The word is so resonant. It\u2019s maybe 1,000 years old, that name: nihtgale, \u201cnight songstress\u201d \u2013 but now they know it\u2019s the male that sings so distinctively by dark, to defend and attract. I\u2019d always thought the name elegantly, evocatively, benignly crepuscular. Probably I\u2019d heard it passively. But I\u2019d never gone somewhere to find it. Knowing little of birds, I had to be told where and when to listen. \u201cDusk and into dark, and you\u2019ll hear the nightingales. You\u2019ll know it because nothing else will be singing.\u201d A wood near my home, Castor Hanglands, is where. Another old name, though it probably hits the ear more darkly than it should: hangra, Old English for \u201cwood on a hill\u201d. These trees mark the nightingale\u2019s grasping northern limit, when they return from Africa, and sing at night.   Related: Perspective on war from an overgrown airfield    The Hanglands are like a rearing wave of thicket in calm farmland. The trees are chaotic and wriggled, jungle-like. It\u2019s dusk as I walk into them. It has been raining. Everything\u2019s wet, and smells and sounds crisp as it does afterwards.  A cornfield, its leaves marbled with water. A hare I see twice. Mist is rising coolly with the falling dark. I hear water-weighted leaves fidget, and birds I recognise. A blackbird\u2019s stammer alarm. An owl\u2019s two frail syllables. Then, ahead to the right, I hear a nightingale.  I\u2019m excited, then transfixed as I focus on its subtleties. It\u2019s extraordinary, encyclopaedically intricate. Frenetic, urgent, cheerful. Tropical, homely, robotic. It stutters, dives, whistles, purrs, clicks, raps, ticks, beeps, scrapes. Oscillates, repeats. Climbs, falls.  It\u2019s almost full dark. Other birds shush, and I hear more nightingales deeper in the woods. I listen for 30 minutes, imagining this delicate thing inhaling, exhaling, creating that sound. I look for it until I\u2019m so close I might scare it, but I don\u2019t see it. They\u2019re tiny birds. Tiny birds that cut the quiet of the night with beautiful novelty. Now I know what to listen for, I will. Sometimes you have to make that effort to listen to appreciate what you\u2019re hearing. Follow Country diary on Twitter: @gdncountrydiary",
