  "body": "Name: Fat. AKA: Triglycerides. Appearance: Three fatty acid chains attached to a glycerol molecule. And if you zoom out a bit? Greasy/delicious. Mmmm\u2026 greasy/delicious. But is it healthy? Asking that question demonstrates that you don\u2019t understand what \u201chealthy\u201d means. Giving that answer demonstrates why you have no friends. Look, the point is that there are many different kinds of dietary fat, each of them with different effects on the body, effects that, in turn, vary according to how much of them you eat, which other things you eat, and the genetic, behavioural and other circumstances of your life. Couldn\u2019t you just say: \u201cIt depends\u201d? I could, but then you wouldn\u2019t understand the full complexity of public nutrition. Who says I want to? Just tell me what the experts have decided. Mostly, that they hate each other. Eh? The National Obesity Forum has just published a report claiming that government advice to cut down on fat is having \u201cdisastrous health consequences\u201d. \u201cThe change in dietary advice to promote low-fat foods is perhaps the biggest mistake in modern medical history,\u201d says Dr Aseem Malhotra, a senior NOF adviser. Is he right? No, according to Public Health England\u2019s chief nutritionist, Dr Alison Tedstone. \u201cIt\u2019s a risk to the nation\u2019s health when potentially influential voices suggest people should eat a high-fat diet, especially saturated fat,\u201d she says, pointing out that official advice is based on a lot more studies than the NOF\u2019s. That\u2019s Dr Aseem Malhotra told! It probably isn\u2019t. The NOF report claims that the science behind the official guidelines has been \u201ccorrupted by commercial influences\u201d. Take that Big, um, Farmer! Except Professor Simon Capewell from the Faculty of Public Health denies it. \u201cBy contrast,\u201d he adds, \u201cthe report from the National Obesity Forum is not peer-reviewed. Furthermore, it does not indicate who wrote it or how is was funded.\u201d The British Heart Foundation are on his side as well. Look, can I jam my head into a bucket of doughnuts or can\u2019t I? Go for it. Just not too often. How often is too often? Well it\u2019s complicated and we don\u2019t really know. Argh! Sorry. Do say: Just eat a balanced diet, stay a healthy weight and do regular exercise. No really, just say: Eat a balanced diet, stay a healthy weight and do regular exercise.",
