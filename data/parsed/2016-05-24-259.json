  "body": "The cost of a family holiday could rise by \u00a3230 and new limits on duty free could put an end to \u201cbooze cruises\u201d to the continent if Britain votes to leave the EU, David Cameron is to claim. In the latest warning about the price of Brexit, the prime minister will argue that the cost of holiday spending and accommodation could go up because of the falling pound. The leave campaign is likely to level charges of exaggeration and scaremongering at the new Treasury figures, released a day after a warning about job losses, lower wages, higher inflation and falling house prices.    Guardian explained: the referendum and airfares   But Downing Street insists it is setting out the government\u2019s objective viewpoint ahead of the 23 June vote. In its new analysis, the Treasury claimed holiday prices could go up as soon as this summer because the pound is likely to fall by around 12%, making the cost of accommodation, food and drinks higher for those travelling overseas. It predicted that two years after Britain leaving the EU, the average holiday for four people travelling together for eight nights in Europe would cost \u00a3230 more.  The government argued that other benefits would be at risk, including the end of roaming charges from 2017, free healthcare within the EU and booze cruises because of potential limits on duty free. \u201cAll the evidence points to the value of the pound falling after a vote to leave the EU. A weaker pound means people\u2019s hard-earned savings won\u2019t go as far on holidays overseas,\u201d Cameron will warn.   Related: Cameron warns against 'self-destruct' vote to leave EU    \u201cThe choice facing the British people on 23 June is increasingly clear: the certainty and economic security of remaining in the EU, or a leap in the dark that would raise prices \u2013 including the cost of a family holiday.\u201d His warnings add to a previous ones by airline chief executives, including Carolyn McCall of easyJet and Michael O\u2019Leary of Ryanair, that the price of flights could be affected. McCall said: \u201cFor easyJet and our passengers, membership of the EU has been a good thing. The common aviation area created by the EU allows any European airline to fly anywhere in Europe. This has kept all airlines\u2019 costs low and has enabled low-fare airlines like easyJet to expand. \u201cIf the UK were to vote to leave the EU any new, more restrictive aviation arrangements would add cost and therefore fares would rise. And a weaker pound would mean the cost of a holiday abroad \u2013 including food, accommodation and drinks \u2013 would be more expensive. That is why we think our customers are better off in Europe.\u201d Two bosses of mobile phone companies backed the government\u2019s claims that the UK would not necessarily benefit from the end of mobile roaming charges from June 2017 if it left the EU.   Related: Brexit could risk tourists' safety and push up flight prices, say top travel figures    Gavin Patterson, chief executive of BT Group, which owns EE, said: \u201cBecause of the UK\u2019s membership of the EU, BT and EE have been able to offer our customers lower charges, including inclusive roaming plans and data charges that are over 90% lower for Britons travelling on the continent. Voters need to think very carefully before turning their backs on an institution that helps to ensure benefits like that are delivered.\u201d Vittorio Colao, chief executive of the Vodafone Group, said: \u201cThe end of roaming charges \u2013 which was driven by the EU \u2013 and Europe-wide offers from operators like Vodafone \u2013 the European leader in 4G \u2013 mean that everyone can use their mobiles anywhere in Europe without having to worry about excessive costs. \u201cBritain will benefit from being part of a borderless European single digital market as it will create new opportunities for economic growth. Consequently, we believe it is better to be a shaper and leader from within, rather than being just a commercial neighbour.\u201d",
