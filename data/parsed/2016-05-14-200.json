  "body": "Italians \u2013 or, rather, Venetians, Tuscans, Sicilians and so on \u2013 have very specific baking styles. From one region to the next \u2013 actually, from one village to the next \u2013 recipes and traditions differ greatly. They take pride in these nuances. With pride comes tradition, and with tradition comes history. When Italians settled in the US, there was no shortage of this pride, as seen in the Italian rainbow cookie, combining the flavours of Italy with the bold aesthetic of America. I recently had to find a way to bake some, even though the brief left me cold. Food colouring? Almond extract? Apricot jam with chocolate? But somehow all of these ingredients come together to form a delicious treat with a very moreish texture. I liked them so much that we have started making them at the bakery, defying all my no-food-colouring rules. More in keeping with my seasonal approach to baking is panna cotta. This milk-and-cream-based pudding is the perfect canvas for fresh, roasted or poached fruit. I chose nespole (or loquat) because, when roasted lightly, they melt beautifully into the pudding. Texture is key here. Made without eggs, panna cotta is set with gelatin for a light and refreshing dessert. As it sits, the gelatin continues to set, so this is at its best made on the same day you plan to serve it.      Panna cotta with roasted nespole Serves 62 tsp powdered gelatin2 tbsp cold water240g double cream240g milk75g caster sugar1 vanilla pod, scrapedZest of one lemonA pinch fine salt300g Greek yoghurt  For the fruit12 nespole (loquats)1 vanilla pod4 tbsp caster sugarJuice of one lemon100g Amaretto 1 To make the panna, I recommend starting the morning of the evening you intend to serve it. You could make it the night before but it sets a little too firmly for my taste. 2 Have ready a large bowl with a sieve suspended above it. Bloom the gelatin in the 2 tbsp water and set aside. 3 In a heavy saucepan, heat the cream and milk gently with the sugar, scraped vanilla pod, lemon zest and salt. Heat until frothy (not quite boiling), remove from the heat and sieve into the prepared bowl. 4 Whisk a little of the cream with the bloomed gelatin, then whisk the gelatin into the remaining cream mixture. Whisk in the yoghurt. 5 Pour the mixture into a large serving bowl and chill. 6 Heat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Line a roasting dish with baking parchment. Cut the nespole in half and take out the stones along with the tough skin that surrounds them. Place the fruits cut-side up in the dish. 7 Put the vanilla seeds and pod on top of the nespole. Sprinkle with the sugar and lemon juice. Lastly, pour over the Amaretto and place the tray in the oven to bake for 15-20 minutes or until the fruit is starting to caramelise on the edges. 8 Remove the fruit from the oven and allow to cool slightly. 9 To serve, scoop a generous portion of panna cotta on to a plate, and spoon the fruit alongside it. Italian rainbow cookies These soft \u201ccookies\u201d are more like a multi-layered traybake, but they keep really well. Makes 28 400g unsalted butter, at room temperature300g almond paste (50%), chopped (not marzipan, see tip)270g caster sugar1 tbsp almond extract6 large eggs, separated385g plain flour1 tsp salt1 tsp red food colouring\u00bd tsp green food colouring (leaf green)245g apricot jam, heated, strained100g dark chocolate (70%), chopped80g double cream 1 Heat the oven to 170C/340F/gas mark 3\u00bd. Butter and line three 20cm x 30cm x 2cm (or deeper) metal baking trays with baking paper (one for each coloured layer of sponge). If you don\u2019t have three tins, you can simply bake the cakes in three batches. 2 In the bowl of a stand mixer, weigh the butter, 200g of caster sugar, almond paste and almond extract. Beat until pale and fluffy, then beat in the egg yolks one at a time, add the flour and salt, then scrape into another bowl and wash your mixing bowl very well. 3 Put the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment; whisk until soft peaks form. Gradually add 70g sugar, whisking until stiff. 4 Incorporate half of the egg whites into the almond paste mixture to loosen the batter, before folding in the second half of the egg whites. 5 Divide the batter evenly between three bowls. Mix the red colouring into one bowl, the green into a second bowl, and leave the third bowl plain. 6 Spread one bowl of batter into each prepared tin and smooth the tops. Bake for 20 minutes or until set. Leave to cool for 10 minutes in the pans, before removing to a cooling rack. 7 Once cooled, start with the green cake as a base. Spread half the apricot jam to the edges of the cake. Place the plain cake layer on top of the green, brush with the remaining apricot jam, and top with the red layer. Cover the cake with baking paper. Place one of the baking tins on top, weighing it down with something heavy, such as tins of tomatoes. Leave for at least two hours, or overnight, to compress. 8 To ice, place the chopped chocolate into a heatproof bowl, then heat the cream until it just starts to bubble, and pour over the chocolate pieces. Let it sit for 5 minutes, then stir together until smooth. 9 Spread the ganache over the cake and leave it to set for 10 minutes before slicing. These cookies will keep for a week in an airtight container.  Claire Ptak is an author and food stylist and owns Violet Bakery in London.
