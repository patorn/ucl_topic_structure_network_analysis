Related: Chinese, Germans and Britons most welcoming to refugees, says report    The attitude is in stark contrast to government statements this week. The immigration minister Peter Dutton argued that many refugees are uneducated and illiterate, and that accepting more into Australia would see them take jobs from Australians or burden the country\u2019s welfare system. But more than half of Australian respondents to the Amnesty survey said they would welcome refugees into their neighbourhoods, and more than one in 10 would welcome a refugee to live in their home. Globally, China, Germany and the UK were found to be the countries with populations most welcoming of refugees, followed by Canada and Australia in fifth place; while Russia, Indonesia and Thailand ranked lowest of the 27 countries surveyed.   Graph: refugee welcome index   Some 27,000 people responded to the survey, conducted by Globescan in person, by phone, and online, for Amnesty International. The survey of Australians found:   Related: Fact check: was Peter Dutton right about 'illiterate' refugees 'taking jobs'?     84% agreed that \u201cpeople should be able to take refuge in other countries to escape war or persecution\u201d. 71% believed the government should do more to help refugees fleeing war or persecution. 68% would welcome refugees living in their city, town, or village. 57% would welcome refugees living in their neighbourhood. 13% would welcome refugees living in their own home.  The results of the Amnesty survey contrast sharply with domestic polling, which shows support for hardline asylum policies in Australia. Essential Report polling found 48% of people (43% of Labor voters, 62% of Coalition voters) oppose the idea of bringing asylum seekers from Manus Island to Australia, even though Papua New Guinea\u2019s supreme court has found the centre illegal. Of 27,000 respondents globally, two-thirds said their governments should do more to help refugees. One in 10 would accept a refugee to live in their own home.    Graph: should your government do more to help   In China, 46% said they would accept refugees into their own home. In Germany, which received 1.1 million asylum seekers in 2015, almost every respondent (96%) said they would accept refugees in their country, while only 3% said refugees should be refused entry. In Jordan \u2013 a country that already hosts 650,000 Syrian refugees \u2013 84% of people believe their government should do more to assist refugees fleeing war or persecution. Refugees from Syria make up a quarter of Lebanon\u2019s population and 69% of that country\u2019s citizens believe their government should do more to assist.   Would you personally accept people fleeing war or persecution in your home?   \u201cThese figures speak for themselves,\u201d said Amnesty International\u2019s secretary general, Salil Shetty. \u201cPeople are ready to make refugees welcome, but governments\u2019 inhumane responses to the refugee crisis are badly out of touch with their own citizens. \u201cThe Refugees Welcome Index exposes the shameful way governments have played short-term politics with the lives of people fleeing war and repression.           Enough hysteria over the migration crisis. It\u2019s time to get rational    \u201cGovernments cannot allow their response to the refugee crisis to be held hostage by headlines. Too often they use xenophobic anti-refugee rhetoric to chase approval ratings. This survey suggests they are not listening to the silent majority of welcoming citizens who take the refugee crisis personally.\u201d This week Dutton said Australia would not consider accepting more refugees than its current humanitarian intake, now at 13,750 rising to 18,750 by 2018. A one-off additional intake of 12,000 Syrian refugees is also being undertaken. Dutton said more refugees would be a drain on Australia\u2019s welfare system, or else would cause unemployment to rise by taking jobs from Australians. \u201cFor many people, they won\u2019t be, you know, numerate or literate in their own language, let alone English,\u201d he said. \u201cThese people would be taking Australian jobs, there\u2019s no question about that. \u201cFor many of them that would be unemployed, they would languish in unemployment queues and on Medicare and the rest of it, so there would be huge cost and there\u2019s no sense in sugar-coating that, that\u2019s the scenario.\u201d   Graph: should people be able to take refuge   Amnesty International Australia\u2019s refugee co-ordinator Graham Thom said that while Australia had experienced \u201cdreadful rhetoric\u201d around boat-borne asylum seekers for years, criticism of Australia\u2019s offshore humanitarian program to resettle recognised refugees from overseas \u2013 in defiance of international opinion \u2013 was rare. \u201cI think that disconnect between the attitudes of ordinary Australians and the political rhetoric in this country was most apparent in the response to the decision to accept 12,000 Syrian refugees,\u201d Thom said. \u201cThe outpouring of generosity from churches, community groups, individual families offering their homes to assist people demonstrated that people in Australia are ready and willing to assist people in need.\u201d Thom said wealthy western countries needed to do more to help resettle displaced people across the world. Currently 86% of the world\u2019s refugees are hosted by developing countries. National leaders and delegates will meet at the UN-convened world humanitarian summit in Istanbul next week, where countries are expected to make commitments to resettle more refugees.",
