  "body": "\u201cThe death of a beloved is an amputation,\u201d CS Lewis wrote in A\u00a0Grief Observed, his\u00a0memoir about the death of his wife;\u00a0but more than\u00a0that, \u201cThe same leg is cut\u00a0off time after\u00a0time.\u201d Narratives of bereavement, once rare, have grown more numerous in recent years: Joan Didion\u2019s The Year of Magical Thinking and Joyce Carol Oates\u2019s A Widow\u2019s Story are two devastating examples of the genre, each distinctive in its raw compulsion. We seem to fall on these accounts of grief with a troubling hunger, in the hope that the shared revelation of pain may assuage \u2013 or perhaps stave off? \u2013 our private sufferings. But each death is unique, each loss particular. Whereas Didion and Oates both lost their husbands in relatively advanced age, to sudden illness, after\u00a0many years of marriage, the Guardian journalist Decca Aitkenhead, a woman in her early 40s, was widowed in May\u00a02014, while on holiday in Jamaica with her partner and their two\u00a0small children. Her agonising memoir All at Sea tells the story of that\u00a0unthinkable death and its aftermath, with the author\u2019s particular clear-eyed self-awareness. This is a\u00a0book entirely without sentimentality or rhapsodising, a\u00a0jaggedly complex meditation that refuses to idealise her beloved, Tony, or herself. All at Sea compels the reader\u2019s trust and sympathy, but also provokes us to consider our hypocrisies. Tony was in many ways not the \u201cideal\u201d husband for the highly educated, professional Aitkenhead. As she explains: \u201cWhen Tony and I first met, I\u00a0was married to a man I loved very much. Everyone loved Paul. Everyone loved our marriage \u2026 I loved being that\u00a0couple.\u201d Paul, a photographer with\u00a0Reuters, was, like Aitkenhead, part of\u00a0\u201cthe London media scene\u201d: the\u00a0successful young journalists moved\u00a0into a\u00a0house in Hackney, where\u00a0Tony was a neighbour. Tony, a\u00a0few years Aitkenhead\u2019s senior, was\u00a0a\u00a0dreadlocked, crack-addicted career criminal, a drug dealer who had\u00a0been in prison, and who, in his 30s, had established some legal businesses \u2013 a\u00a0wholefood store and a\u00a0property company \u2013 so\u00a0he wouldn\u2019t have to tell his daughter about the drugs. \u201cAs he saw it, he had practically gone legit. At\u00a0times I got the impression he genuinely believed he had,\u201d Aitkenhead writes. Once they became a couple (a move that involved Tony quitting crack), the melding of their worlds posed inevitable challenges. They had radically different sets of friends; Aitkenhead\u2019s family, fond of her ex-husband, struggled to accept Tony; Tony\u2019s wife was furious about his new relationship. But,\u00a0together, they overcame the odds: Tony got a scholarship to university, and went to work for Kids Company, the\u00a0now-defunct London charity. They\u00a0had two children, and moved to Tubslake, \u201ca dilapidated old\u00a0farmhouse in rural Kent\u201d. A holiday in Jamaica \u2013 at a place called Treasure Beach, where Aitkenhead had been many times \u2013 was to have provided respite from their exhausting renovation project, full-time jobs, small-kid stress and the hard winter. On a morning 10 days into\u00a0their stay, Tony and their older son\u00a0Jake headed down to the beach, leaving Aitkenhead and their youngest, Joe, at\u00a0the beach cottage where the family was\u00a0staying. What ensued is sheer nightmare: an invisible rip-tide sucked Jake out to sea, and his father leapt to\u00a0his rescue. Aitkenhead, suddenly aware of the danger, rushed to\u00a0assist, and swam with Jake back to shore, assuming Tony was swimming behind her. But he wasn\u2019t: local fishermen tried to help him, but he drowned. The events, relayed at their simplest, seem surreal. Aitkenhead\u2019s account, journalistically precise, renders that morning both vivid and incomprehensible. We relive it with her. There is no intellectualised explanation for how this could happen. The telling feels true, unpractised; but, of course, Aitkenhead will learn, in the weeks afterwards, that shaping this story is\u00a0as\u00a0important as with any piece of journalism. Her brother Tom says: \u201cPeople keep asking me if he was drunk. So instead of saying he\u00a0went down to the beach in the morning, be more specific \u2013 you need to say it was around 8.30am.\u201d All at Sea is leavened by such moments of dark humour. An unsavoury associate of Tony\u2019s, when invited to the funeral, starts haggling over an unpaid debt; months later, the contractor renovating Tubslake asks Aitkenhead what to do about the marijuana plants in one of the barns, and she discovers that Tony had cultivated a veritable farm. The search for a\u00a0live-in nanny proves full of ironies: \u201cWe are nothing like the type of family who employs a\u00a0live-in nanny housekeeper. Army colonels and QCs feature prominently among the names of referees.\u201d Finally, Aitkenhead finds \u201csalvation\u201d in a Native American firefighter named Michelle and her \u201cfoxy South African girlfriend called Amba\u201d.     Tony on Calabash beach, Jamaica, a few yards from the spot where he drowned. Photograph: Courtesy of Decca Aitkenhead    The memoir is also clarified by Aitkenhead\u2019s stringent self-assessments \u2013 \u201cIn the departures hall at Montego Bay airport I unravel into a\u00a0monstrous brat\u201d; \u201cAs I\u2019m boxing everything up, I\u2019m struck by a thought so dangerously ugly, I\u00a0want to scrub my brain with bleach. I\u00a0see there\u2019s been\u00a0no card or letter from X, whispers a\u00a0toxic voice in\u00a0my head. Nope, nor anything from Y.\u201d She doesn\u2019t spare herself from revealing her most embarrassing lapse of judgment: having received letters of\u00a0support from many, including two billionaires, she replies to these latter (when stoned, egged on\u00a0by friends) with an email \u201cthanking them for their generous offer of help and suggesting it\u00a0might best be realised in a\u00a0monetary form\u201d. \u201cOh my God. What can we have\u00a0been thinking? What must they have thought when they opened these\u00a0emails?\u201d Aitkenhead\u2019s mortification serves as a public apology; but it\u00a0is also part of her literary mission to\u00a0demystify the grieving widow as much as the beloved departed, to make\u00a0clear that even in our darkest times, we aren\u2019t other than our flawed and jumbled selves. Tony\u2019s death is a tragedy. But this memoir reminds us that it would be\u00a0no\u00a0less a tragedy if he had been drunk that morning; nor less if he had\u00a0still been using crack. Life is to be\u00a0embraced in its full messiness. Aitkenhead, as a\u00a0journalist \u2013 one who\u00a0knows well what others want to hear, and what they can understand \u2013 refuses adamantly to beautify or beatify her family\u2019s story. Last summer, she was diagnosed with breast cancer, the illness that killed her mother when Aitkenhead was a child of nine. All at Sea is threaded with the story and ramifications of her\u00a0mother\u2019s death (like everything else, more complicated than it at first appears), but she does not include her\u00a0own diagnosis in the\u00a0book. (She has\u00a0completed treatment and is now cancer-free.) Instead, she closes with a\u00a0description of her first, ultimately joyous, return to Treasure Beach, with\u00a0the boys, nine months after Tony\u2019s death: \u201cWhatever\u00a0happens now,\u00a0and whoever we\u00a0become, we are no longer those broken\u00a0ghosts.\u201d This unblinking but resilient voice \u2013 sometimes stern, sometimes funny, always fierce \u2013 makes this book, like its author, inspiring in the best sense. \u2022 To order All at Sea for \u00a312.99 (RRP \u00a316.99) with free UK postage and p&p call Guardian book service on 0330 333 6846 or go to guardianbookshop.co.uk",
