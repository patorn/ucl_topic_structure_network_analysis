Ori GershtLyrical images with a disconcerting historical burden make Gersht a subtle and thought-provoking artist.\u2022 Ben Brown Fine Arts, London, until 16 June. Masterpiece of the week     Antoine Watteau\u2019s Sous un habit de Mezetin. 1717- 1719. Photograph: The Wallace Collection, London    The commedia dell\u2019arte character Mezetin looks at us with lyrical intimacy as he strums his guitar. His silken costume, bohemian company and the theatrical feel of the setting all reflect the fantastical, dreamlike atmosphere Watteau\u2019s brush creates. Yet the robust, earthy quality of the faces tells us these are real people. Mezetin is a portrait of Watteau\u2019s art dealer Pierre Sirois. Art and life magically merge.\u2022 Wallace Collection, London.
