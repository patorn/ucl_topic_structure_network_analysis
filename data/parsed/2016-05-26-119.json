  "body": "Imagine a UK music chart with almost no UK acts in it. A Top 40 comprising North Americans, Scandinavians and, down at the bottom reaches, a British outlier or two. That is the gloomy prediction being made in some corners of the British music industry because of two problems: the difficulty of finding new artists capable of becoming global stars, coupled with the slog of pushing them into a chart dominated by streaming. \u201cAt the moment, it\u2019s not great. [Potentially big new acts] aren\u2019t coming through,\u201d says one insider. Even recent international successes have failed to lift the market: take the 1975, who are doing pretty well. After their current album entered the charts at No 1 both here and in the US, it dropped swiftly, spending only three weeks in the UK Top 10. What\u2019s more, they have yet to produce the kind of inescapable hit singles that tip groups into worldwide stardom. Lee Thompson of industry website Record of the Day is even less optimistic: \u201cJust see what happens with streaming [which has been included in sales calculations since 2014]. Our presence, our ability as a country to break through, will lose its importance.\u201d The dominance of North American acts such as Beyonc\u00e9, Bieber and Drake seems to bear that out: their tracks are streamed billions of times, guaranteeing both high chart positions and A-list radio play (old-fashioned airplay is still an important factor in breaking acts in Britain). Few British artists can compete, and brand new ones not at all. But, short of crying: \u201cBritish charts for British bands!\u201d what can be done? \u201cIt depends on how labels define success,\u201d says Welsh singer-producer Catherine Anne Davies, who records as the Anchoress. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking at whether your YouTube streams are 3m and you\u2019re on Radio 1, that\u2019s a different kind of success from what I\u2019m looking for.\u201d After releasing her debut album, Confessions of a Romance Novelist, on the independent label Kscope, Davies is critical of major label risk aversion that she says has created \u201can ever disintegrating divide between whether you\u2019re a creative musician or an entertainer. I don\u2019t think the majors are aware that people want personality, so they churn out sanitised karaoke singers.\u201d         Watch he BBC\u2019s Sound of 2016 hopefuls.    One response, if you are a major, is to send your entire A&R department around the country to find out what people want to listen to (and, more importantly, buy). The label doing this, which can\u2019t be named, has instructed its team to speak to promoters, club owners and others connected to local music scenes, until they have an idea of why new acts aren\u2019t connecting. It has been spurred by the fact that this is the time of year when the frontrunners for 2017\u2019s next-big-thing polls should be gathering at the starting gate. However, according to another insider, there is an unprecedented lack of viable hopefuls, let alone those with the potential to be the next Sam Smith, Adele or even James Bay. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing on the horizon, no music scene at the moment. It seems to be that the talent isn\u2019t out there, [or if it is] they don\u2019t know what to do with it,\u201d says the label source. \u201c[Labels] just chase data and click-throughs. They\u2019ll say: \u2018Oh, this new band has three No 1s on Hype Machine [a site that tallies the most popular songs on music blogs], let\u2019s go, go, go!\u2019 But just because it\u2019s on a blog doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s a song that people will buy.\u201d Some will feel little sympathy for the plight of the big three majors, Warners, Sony and Universal, but independents are also affected. Geeneus, the head of east London station Rinse FM and the label Rinse Recordings, is voluble: \u201cThe problem with new acts is that there\u2019s nowhere to get into it. For a long time, radio stations have looked at statistics. They don\u2019t think: \u2018Amazing song,\u2019 they look at how many YouTube plays, how many Facebook likes. Your sales are in the hundreds, and people think it\u2019s not good.\u201d Radio 1\u2019s head of music, Chris Price, has a theory about that: \u201cThe debate about data versus passion is a very live one for us. Music comes from a place of passion, and so does the point at which it connects to new audiences. We believe this should be the defining factor in the decisions we make on behalf of our listeners.\u201d         See the video for Jack Garratt\u2019s Surprise Yourself.    He could have a point: Radio 1\u2019s staunch support for Jack Garratt, whose career hasn\u2019t taken off as quickly as expected, is clearly a case of passion over data. Garratt won the BBC Sound of 2016 and Brits critics\u2019 choice awards this year, but hasn\u2019t matched the trajectories of James Bay and Sam Smith, critics\u2019 choice winners in 2015 and 2014. His debut album reached No 3, but it spent only one week in the Top 10, and four in the Top 40. Now it is not even in the Top 100. His only song to reach the singles charts, Worry, peaked at No 67, and stayed on the chart for just three weeks. By the same point in their careers, Smith and Bay had both had No 1 albums and major hit singles. It might turn out to be a marathon rather than a sprint for Garratt, but the pressure is on. Clare Maguire knows about the pressures of being hotly tipped. She came fifth in the Sound of 2011 poll (won by Jessie J) and soon found herself floundering. \u201cNobody [at her former label, Polydor] was a bad person, it\u2019s just a bad situation to be involved in. If it doesn\u2019t work instantly, there\u2019s not much support; you\u2019re left, and people are quick to forget.\u201d Her first album went Top 10, but Maguire\u2019s life was complicated, and after promoting the album, she entered rehab for alcoholism. She\u2019s only just started releasing music again (her second album, Stranger Things Have Happened, is out this week). \u201cLabels are definitely focused on signing young people who have a level of media training,\u201d she says warily. \u201cThey sign people who are then very slowly stripped of their identity.\u201d Ryan Bassil, UK editor of Vice\u2019s music site Noisey, calls the music generated by young signings \u201clandfill electronica\u201d, a follow on from the landfill indie of the mid-2000s. \u201cThe majors have jumped on teenagers who bought production software and make music for New Music Friday [Spotify\u2019s compilation of the week\u2019s best new releases]. If any of these new ones released a sick track, they\u2019d do fine. But it\u2019s much harder for bands to break through, because so much stuff is coming out every single day, so there needs to be more than just a tune. There needs to be a character there.\u201d There are optimists around, such as Ben Mortimer. As an A&R scout, he was responsible for bringing Jamie T, Florence + the Machine and Years & Years to major labels, so he has experience in breaking British acts. Now, as newly appointed co-president of Polydor, he acknowledges that although there has not been \u201cthe same proliferation of breaking acts in the last six months\u201d, the industry shouldn\u2019t be pessimistic. \u201cThings are really healthy and we\u2019ll be breaking acts again really soon,\u201d he says. But it\u2019s hard not to heed the words of the Anchoress, whose CV (degrees in literature and queer theory; author of a book about Walt Whitman\u2019s epic poetry) qualifies her as one of pop\u2019s more interesting outliers. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to talk about Bowie and Prince when you\u2019re talking about careers, which should be measured in decades. If even the person presenting the music isn\u2019t invested in it, the public can\u2019t get invested.\u201d",
