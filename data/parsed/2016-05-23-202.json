  "body": "The managing director of Transfield Holdings, Luca Belgiorno-Nettis, says his company made political donations because \u201cit was fairly plain that that bought access\u201d to politicians and created opportunities to influence events. Belgiorno-Nettis told Monday\u2019s Four Corners program political donations were like the Latin saying Do Ut Des, \u201cYou give in order to have given back.\u201d \u201cI think it was fairly plain that [donations] bought access in terms of the ability to simply be able to knock on the door and make the phone call and have the meeting with the political masters to voice whatever concerns that we might have, or indeed just to explore further relationships and further potential opportunities,\u201d said the prominent businessman, who has now renounced donations and founded the newDemocracy foundation.

Monday night\u2019s Four Corners program went over some case studies examining donations and policy outcomes in recent years, including mandated ethanol in New South Wales, a decision that has benefited the Manildra Group. That company has donated more than $4m to the major parties since 1998 and the company\u2019s chairman, Dick Honan, has courted leaders across the political spectrum by hosting private soirees, sponsoring party conferences and supporting fundraising efforts. The program quotes Peter Phelps, a former Liberal whip in NSW, who opposed a bipartisan bill in NSW that penalises service station owners if they don\u2019t meet a quota of E10 fuel sales and subsequently resigned as party whip. \u201cHonan is his own lobbyist and ... he is the Donald Trump style of, you know, gruff bravado, you know, you must do what I want to do because I\u2019m an important person,\u201d Phelps told Four Corners. He said the bill was \u201ctotally unfair, it\u2019s a complete violation of the Liberal party ideals\u201d.  Phelps said he didn\u2019t think that Honan \u201cgave out of the goodness of his heart, that\u2019s for certain, and the mere fact that, after the 2007 election, if you have a look at the figures for that, he gave the state Labor party something like $164,000 in the year that legislation, or the year after the legislation had passed. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s coincidental.\u201d     Luca Belgiorno-Nettis, right, with Guido and Amina Belgiorno-Nettis at the Art Gallery of NSW. Photograph: Tracey Nearmy/AAP    Monday\u2019s program also contained an admission from the former Liberal party fundraiser Michael Yabsley that Australia\u2019s funding and disclosure system required a complete overhaul. Yabsley, who was the honorary federal treasurer of the Liberal party from 2008 to 2010, said the practice of funnelling allegedly prohibited developer donations to the New South Wales branch through the Free Enterprise Foundation was \u201cunacceptable\u201d. He said knowledge of the practice was widespread. In 2014 the NSW Independent Commission Against Corruption found a range of verbal and documentary evidence that showed the NSW party was sending donations from property developers to the foundation and arranging to have them funnelled back. State law had banned donations from property developers from January 2010. Just before he called the election, the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull \u2013 who lost one minister, Stuart Robert, because of a controversy related to fundraising, and had his cabinet secretary, Arthur Sinodinos, caught up in the Liberal party\u2019s fundraising problems in NSW \u2013 signalled he was interested in revisiting the issue of electoral reform in the next parliament, although he said change was hard to implement because of constitutional limitations and because it was hard to constrain the activities of third parties.   Related: Political donations: Bill Heffernan warns of  'Asian facilitation culture'    The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, on Monday renewed his party\u2019s call to change the system so that any political donation over $1,000 be disclosed. Shorten said the \u201congoing saga of the Free Enterprise Foundation in NSW and Liberal fundraising, what it goes to show is we need more transparency, we need more transparency in the way that money is raised for elections\u201d. \u201cI challenge Mr Turnbull now today to agree with Labor\u2019s proposal that any donations over $1,000 should be disclosed,\u201d Shorten said. \u201cTransparency is the sunlight which clears away all the dark corners in terms of fundraising and Australians I think have a reasonable expectation that that is what should happen.\u201d But Labor\u2019s Senate leader, Penny Wong, played down the connection between donations to the ALP by Australia\u2019s trade unions and policy outcomes favourable to organised labour. \u201cTo suggest there\u2019s some analogy between a bundle of cash and a longstanding transparent and public and historical relationship with the trade union movement I think is a pretty long bow,\u201d Wong told Four Corners.",
