  "body": "A former prisoner of war of the Japanese led domestic praise in America on Friday for Barack Obama\u2019s historic visit to Hiroshima, but expressed regret that he and fellow veterans had not been invited to attend. Lester Tenney, 96, a survivor of the Bataan Death March, said he supported Obama\u2019s decision to become the first incumbent American president to set foot in Hiroshima since the US dropped a nuclear bomb there in August 1945. About 140,000 of the city\u2019s residents were estimated to have died by the end of that year. \u201cHe had to do it,\u201d Tenney told the Guardian from his home in Carlsbad, California. \u201cIt was the right thing to do. He didn\u2019t say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry\u2019, and he was not supposed to because he had no reason to.\u201d At the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park on Friday, Obama offered a floral wreath at the cenotaph, hugged one of the survivors and gave a speech in which he expressed hope that the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings would be \u201cthe start of our own moral awakening\u201d. Tenney welcomed the president\u2019s tone. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to understand why he was there,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was paying tribute to all those who died in world war two.   Related: Barack Obama says memory of Hiroshima 'must never fade'    \u201cWe all know there was a problem with the Japanese. There\u2019s no secret that if there was no Pearl Harbor, there would have been no Hiroshima. We don\u2019t have to embarrass anyone by saying this 71 years later.\u201d But Tenney, who served in the Philippines during the war and was captured by the Japanese at Bataan, said he understood the White House had originally intended to invite former prisoners of war, \u201cbut not one who has a wheelchair or walker. We\u2019re in our 90s so most of us have walkers. They wanted someone who could get around but there was no one.\u201d Nevertheless, he said it was an emotional day. \u201cOh yes, no question, you have to remember I left a lot of my friends there. They never got to enjoy a part of life that I did, so it\u2019s a very emotional thing. Even thinking about the war and thinking about the bomb is.\u201d Eleven US presidents have served since Harry Truman ordered the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima but none had gone there while in office. Some veterans have long objected that Japan never apologised for its brutal treatment of American prisoners during the war. The Obama administration had prepared for the president\u2019s visits to both Vietnam and Hiroshima by inviting veterans to the White House to meet national security adviser Susan Rice and provide reassurance that there would be no apologies. Jan Thompson, president of the American Defenders of Bataan and Corregidor Memorial Society, said: \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s speech was very powerful and I know it was meaningful for the citizens of Japan. I wish, though, there had also been American POWs among the hibakusha [bomb survivors] because symbolically that would have been powerful. \u201cIt would keep the history of that war balanced. This trip to Hiroshima is about history and reconciliation but you really have to show both sides.\u201d During his speech, Obama made reference to the deaths of 60 million people in the space of a few years during the war. Thompson, whose father Robert was a POW and survived transportation on Japanese \u201chell ships\u201d, commented: \u201cThe president used the death toll for the entire war and that\u2019s where I got confused because the A-bomb ended the war in the Pacific. My concern is that the Pacific war has been diluted and not got the attention of the war in Europe. I wish he had not combined the death tolls.\u201d Joe Davis, a spokesman for the 1.2-million-member Veterans of Foreign Wars, gave a lukewarm reaction to Obama\u2019s visit, telling USA Today that only that \u201ca world without conflict is a vision we should all share\u201d. Foreign policy analysts in Washington praised Obama for his delicate handling of the trip. Sharon Squassoni, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies thinktank, said: \u201cI liked his speech very much. I think he did get the tone right. Even though a lot of folks who advocate nuclear disarmament might have been hoping for more, I think it was just about right for a president visiting Hiroshima for the first time. \u201cA point he could have emphasised a little more, but was in there, was the need for alliances, specially in Asia right now.\u201d The debate over Truman\u2019s decision to use the bomb is not a preoccupation in 21st century America, Squassoni added, so the visit has helped raise awareness. \u201cI would say the majority of Americans don\u2019t think about it at all. Obama\u2019s lending his personal credibility: whether you think he deserved it or not, he did win the Nobel peace prize.\u201d Mireya Solis, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said: \u201cI thought it was a very powerful speech because it was broader than we imagined. We expected it to be about nuclear non-proliferation but he also delivered a message that war is the enemy.\u201d An apology would \u201cnot have been well-received\u201d in the US and polls show it is only desired by a minority of Japanese, she added. \u201cI think he really put his finger on what the people in Japan really hoped this was about.\u201d But the president\u2019s most trenchant opponents were critical. John Bolton, former US ambassador to the UN, told Breitbart News Daily: \u201cI think the president\u2019s other remarks, where he said the scientific revolution that brought us the splitting of the atom should have brought us a \u2018moral revolution\u2019 as well, is a not-too-thinly veiled attack on Harry Truman, whose morals apparently didn\u2019t quite make it up to Barack Obama\u2019s high standards. \u201cThis is a typically subtle Obama speech in many respects, but, make no mistake, it is the next stage, maybe the last act, of his apology tour.\u201d",
