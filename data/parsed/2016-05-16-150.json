  "body": "We want to build up the stock of attractive, illustrated books which also contain a lot of information as part of our book collection as the children still seem to enjoy finding things out from books as much as from the internet  Illustrated non-fiction can provide children with some of the best ways of finding things out for themselves and exploring them in their own time, sometimes going back over things again and again. Well-written texts matched by illustrations which may be photographs or artwork can provide enticing and imaginative ways of encouraging children to find out more. Whether it is an in-depth study of a single topic or a wide-ranging overview these books will engage readers and support their learning.      Classics of illustrated non-fiction include David Macaulay\u2019s The Ways Things Work, an easy to read and understand account of scientific principles in words and attractive illustrations and Stephen Biesty\u2019s clever Cross Sections series which includes Cross Sections: Castle and Cross Section: Man of War, both written by Richard Platt.   Related: William Grill, Kate Greenaway medal winner 2015 \u2013 in pictures    One of the best books of last year, and the winner of the 2015 Kate Greenaway medal, the librarians\u2019 award for a picture book, was William Grill\u2019s Shackleton\u2019s Journey. In it, through his stunning illustrations and the carefully planned and beautifully designed pages, Will Grill tells the gruelling story of Ernest Shackleton\u2019s ill-fated attempt to find a passage way across Antarctica. Grill captures the extraordinary effort of the trip and the desperation of Shackleton and the crew as their journey had to be abandoned.      William Grill\u2019s beautiful illustration of Shackleton\u2019s 800-mile open-boat journey to South Georgia (using only a pocket compass). Illustration: William Grill/Flying Eye Books    In his new book, The Wolves of Currumpaw, William Grill has created an equally striking book through his illustrations to a retelling of a nineteenth century American classic. Set on the plains of New Mexico, the story tells of how man\u2019s arrival threatens the natural life of the region, especially the wolves.    Related: William Grill's wolves of New Mexico \u2013 in pictures    Dieter Braun\u2019s Wild Animals of the North is a most beautiful illustrated guide to some of the great animals that live in the northern hemisphere including polar bear from the Arctic, pandas from Asia and pumas from North America. The captivating, large scale illustrations accurately show the animals in their natural habitats while the text adds a lively description of each backed up by some entertaining \u2018fun facts\u2019.

The result is a dictionary that would be useful in any home or classroom with word definitions given through examples of how they are used in Dahl\u2019s well-loved books. But that regular side of the dictionary is spiced up and enlivened by Roald Dahl\u2019s own richly invented vocabulary. Thus \u201cmuck\u201d - defined by the muck in Farmer Bean\u2019s ears from Fantastic Mr Fox \u2013 is followed by Dahl\u2019s own \u201cmuckfrumping\u201d, a word to describe an unpleasant country in The BFG. Quentin Blake\u2019s illustrations capture all of Dahl\u2019s humour perfectly.       All of these are books to \u2018read\u2019 as much as books to learn from which is why building up a collection of interesting non- fiction for home and school is so important.
