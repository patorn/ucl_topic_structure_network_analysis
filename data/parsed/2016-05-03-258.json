  "body": "One of the biggest challenges for entrepreneurs setting up their own businesses is the transition from \u2018innovator\u2019 to \u2018manager of other people\u2019. Yet according to recent research, formal management training is lacking in small businesses. Close Brothers\u2019 Business Barometer, a quarterly survey of UK SMEs, found that only 42% of their owners have had any formal leadership training \u2013 despite strong belief in its contribution to success.  \u201cMany entrepreneurs leave a big-company role believing they can do a better job with more freedom and greater rewards,\u201d comments Martin Norbury, a business mentor known as The Scalability Coach. \u201cBut when it comes to running a business, there\u2019s little or no experience in leading or managing, and a resistance to delegating.\u201d Maintaining balance Emma Smith started customer membership forum Memberoo in 2013. For the first year it was just her and co-founder Don Keir. \u201cWe tended to work from home, in coffee shops, or on sofas and we just managed ourselves. Everything changed as soon as we started hiring staff,\u201d she says.     When you're small, each new member of staff has an enormous impact on the company culture  Emma Smith     Within two years, the business had a proper office and seven people. Smith, CEO, has an MSc in Management. Although this proved useful in a previous corporate environment, it didn\u2019t prepare her for the challenges of running her own business. \u201cThe protocols and safety nets of a large company aren\u2019t there in a startup, and the lessons you really need to learn are not those taught in classrooms,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re small, each new member of staff has an enormous impact on the company culture, and everything had to be carefully managed to avoid upsetting the balance.\u201d Smith has picked up a lot of skills informally, from the day she walked into the University of Bath Innovation Centre declaring she wanted to be a tech entrepreneur. She has received mentoring through the Centre\u2019s business incubation programme, SETsquared. \u201cI think business mentoring is much more beneficial than training courses,\u201d she says. \u201cMentors get to know your business on a personal level and can offer contextual advice. This has been hugely helpful.\u201d Memberoo is now hiring people to head up departments, which has created additional challenges. \u201cWe\u2019re adding people with specialist knowledge to help us grow the business, but it can leave people feeling put out,\u201d Smith explains. \u201cIt\u2019s like someone telling you how to parent your toddler. We have to avoid making our early joiners feel that they are no longer important.\u201d Welcoming advice      Richard Bateman, director of westfourstreet    Before Richard Bateman set up his own web design agency, westfourstreet six years ago, he too lacked the right kind of leadership skills. He was young, and his background was working on a service desk for Volkswagen, before an internal opportunity arose to move into web development. He then spent two years at a local digital agency before starting his own business. \u201cThe first year was a mess,\u201d he admits, adding that everything was new: \u201cI was no longer just a designer and developer; I was now a managing director of a business turning over \u00a345,000.\u201d Initially he used freelancers and other agencies to fill gaps, but this created issues of control. \u201cThey were all massively talented but they weren\u2019t employees,\u201d Bateman notes. \u201cI couldn\u2019t just call a meeting and expect them to be there, cup of coffee and notepad in hand.\u201d The situation soon took its toll. \u201cI had to manage client expectations, and the freelancers. It was the most challenging stage of my career,\u201d Bateman concedes. \u201cRunning a business can be a lonely experience.\u201d Bateman\u2019s mentor came from within the family: his father-in-law had run a successful steel business for 30+ years. He also leaned on Buckinghamshire Business First, which put him in touch with like-minded individuals. \u201cI\u2019m convinced that great management skills are a combination of advice passed down and lessons learnt through personal experience,\u201d Bateman says. \u201cIt\u2019s my mistakes that have made me a better leader. And I\u2019m never afraid to ask for advice.\u201d Celebrating difference      The Magenta team seen here in Brighton. Owner Cathy Hayward is in the centre Photograph: Peter Searle    Cathy Hayward started building management communications agency Magenta Associates five years ago. Its growth has accelerated over the last 18 months and the headcount has tripled to nine.  In October, Hayward signed up to the Government\u2019s now-defunct Growth Accelerator programme, retaining a business coach. \u201cI\u2019m quite an introverted, self-motivated sort of person, so trying to become a more open, accessible and leader-type person is proving quite a journey,\u201d she says. Her knowledge of management consisted solely of her own experiences of good and bad bosses. \u201cThe business was still very much about me, but we had started to grow quickly and I was finding it difficult to bring in the right people to look after the new clients,\u201d Hayward says. My coach set me a lot of homework, and got me reading management books. I hadn\u2019t realised what I didn\u2019t know. It\u2019s easy to think that everyone is motivated in the same way as you, but they\u2019re not.\u201d Hayward found that recruiting people you know, or from within the specific industry, isn\u2019t always the best policy. \u201cI couldn\u2019t match the salaries of larger players and I wasn\u2019t looking in the right places,\u201d she admits. \u201cRecruiting through an agency made a big difference.    It\u2019s easy to think that everyone is motivated in the same way as you, but they\u2019re not  Cathy Hayward     \u201cThere was no real structure to the business, either. It was all vague and everyone reported to me. Working with my coach and looking at what other PR companies did, I created a structure we can replicate.\u201d Learning to lean on external experts For David Wray, founder and MD of Grease Monkey Cycles, which provides convenient bike maintenance services to the Central Belt of Scotland, an early error was to take on people too soon for functions such as marketing and finance which could have been outsourced for much less.  \u201cDespite a lot of management experience I found that managing people is one of the biggest challenges, taking much more time than I anticipated,\u201d he says. He got help from Business Gateway High Growth Pipeline, which provides access to HR support and training. \u201cOne thing all early-stage entrepreneurs suffer from is a surplus of ideas, ideas that they generate at a rate of knots,\u201d says Graeme Read at The Association of Professional Staffing Companies. \u201cManaging a team from this perspective slows businesses down, leads to lots of half-built plans and takes its toll on morale \u2013 because no one knows what the priority is.\u201d APSCo offers new leaders the chance to learn from fellow entrepreneurs in an intense, three-day peer-to-peer session where each can \u201cstep outside their own bubble\u201d and share knowledge, information and skills, says Read.
