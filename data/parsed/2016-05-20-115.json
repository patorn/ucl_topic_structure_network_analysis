  "body": "Paul Strand was a\u00a0New\u00a0Yorker who photographed his own city, before travelling widely, to Mexico, France, Italy, Ghana. He photographed the UK once, during a\u00a0visit to the Hebrides in 1954. He was worried that a\u00a0plan to have a missile base on the island would change the lives of the people on South Uist, which included me and my family, and he wanted to record us before it was too late. This is me, in the middle, aged eight, with my sisters Millie and Jean. We are standing on the sofa to give us a bit more height. I remember Strand outside, setting up his large camera on a tripod under a\u00a0cloak. Apparently, he was meticulous like this, taking a\u00a0long time to set up and take his pictures, like a studio photographer, even though he was in the open air. This had been our grandparents\u2019 house, and when he inherited it, my father built two new wings. We also had a croft and 10 acres of land, and there was a loch at the back of the house. For me and my siblings \u2013 I had five brothers and five sisters \u2013 there were always jobs to do: we\u00a0had hens, ducks and two cows. We fed them, took them in at night, collected eggs, cleaned the birds\u2019 houses and milked the cows. We had to fetch peat for the fires from some distance. I planted a vegetable garden; I\u00a0grew lettuce, carrots, beetroot and cabbage. In summer, there were other crops to tend, and peat-cutting, drying and stacking to do. Shopping involved walking to Lochboisdale; we would get deposit money back on empty lemonade bottles and jam jars, which supplemented any pocket money we had. Travelling shops visited on certain days. As my elder brothers and sisters left home, more work fell to the younger ones \u2013 I was the second youngest. It was like a business with inbuilt downsizing of the workforce; we were certainly multitasking before the term came into common usage. There weren\u2019t many other children living nearby to play with, and the pace of life was pretty slow. Strand wasn\u2019t the first person to photograph us. Werner Kissling, a\u00a0German photographer who documented similar communities all over the world, had taken our picture many times with his Leica. Unlike Strand, he always photographed us outside. He returned often and became a\u00a0family friend.

I first saw this photograph when I bought the book 20 years later, in 1981. I left South Uist when I was 15 and had finished school \u2013 young people really had to move to the mainland to study or work. I feel no sense of loss; in fact, everything has worked out well, probably due, in no small measure, to my upbringing. I go back occasionally from Edinburgh, where I now live, and am always treated as if I\u2019ve never been away. \u2022 Paul Strand: Photography And Film For The 20th Century runs until 3 July at the Victoria & Albert Museum, London SW7.
