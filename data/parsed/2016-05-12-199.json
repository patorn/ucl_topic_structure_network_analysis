But, like Pharrell\u2019s Happy two years ago, sometimes we\u2019re powerless to resist such unmitigated joy.     Kirsten Dunst in yellow at Cannes. Photograph: Gisela Schober/Getty Images    Yellow is not cool; it\u2019s not black transparent layers like those worn by Kirsten Stewart, or Julianne Moore\u2019s badass sequin cobras. There\u2019s no androgynous edge, like Victoria Beckham\u2019s jumpsuit or Susan Sarandon\u2019s suit. But it has had major play on the Croisette, having been worn by Anna Kendrick, Kirsten Dunst and Jessica Chastain this year alone. The reasoning? A no-brainer impact of a colour without having to think too much about any other design element, perhaps? Because it looks great in a picture? Or, as some critics have suggested, a love of condiments? Yellow and red \u2013 that\u2019s mustard and ketchup, obviously.      Angelina Jolie and the condiment colour combo, at Cannes in 2007. Photograph: David Fisher/REX/Shutterstock    It\u2019s a combo \u2013 both sartorially and culinarily \u2013 that is classic. Michelle Williams in a yellow Vera Wang dress at the Oscars in 2006 is now in the canon of best red carpet dresses ever. Angelina Jolie at Cannes a year later is another example of red carpet yellow, as is Jourdan Dunn in 2014.      Kate Moss\u2019s classic yellow dress in 2003. Photograph: MATT BARON/BEI/BEI/Shutterstock    Yellow works off the red carpet, too. A vintage yellow one-shouldered dress, accessorised with fag, at a party for Another magazine in 2003 is one of fashion insiders\u2019 favourite Kate Moss looks. It\u2019s such a cult image that she recreated the dress for her Topshop collection in 2007.      Rihanna and her meme-able dress at the Met Ball in 2015. Photograph: Karwai Tang/WireImage    Arguably the best red-carpet yellow-dress moment came last year and \u2013 as luck would have it \u2013 there are culinary associations. Rihanna\u2019s dress for the Met Ball in 2015 was bright yellow, with a huge train that stretched out behind the singer. The internet soon responded, with memes turning the train into pizzas and omelettes quicker than you can say \u201cfrying pan\u201d. The dresses on the red carpet at Cannes this year might not have quite have the same meme-ability, but when looking at a yellow (mustard) dress on a red (ketchup) carpet, don\u2019t be surprised if you have a sudden hankering for the only thing that\u2019s missing \u2013 a hotdog.",
