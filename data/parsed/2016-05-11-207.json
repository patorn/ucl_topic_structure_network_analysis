  "body": "On 25 October 1944, as\u00a0Japanese and American forces pulverised one another in the Pacific, Florence Foster Jenkins took to\u00a0the stage at New York\u2019s Carnegie Hall. Before a crowd of 3,000 \u2013 thousands more were left outside, having failed to get tickets \u2013 she performed a\u00a0challenging programme including the\u00a0Queen of the Night\u2019s aria from The\u00a0Magic Flute, \u201cIn the Silence of the\u00a0Night\u201d by Rachmaninoff and \u201cClavelitos\u201d, \u201ca short, flirtatious song in the Hispanic idiom\u201d. But this was no\u00a0ordinary concert, the main draw being that Jenkins, a stately soprano then in her mid-70s, was utterly tone deaf. Throughout the performance the audience were laughing so hard at her tuneless screeches and yelps that, according to some reports, they completely drowned her out. One actor suffered such incontrollable hysterics that she had to be removed from her box. The music critic from the New York Post stopped the singer\u2019s partner and \u201cpersonal representative\u201d, St Clair Bayfield, as he left the hall. \u201cWhy?\u201d he asked. \u201cBecause she loves music,\u201d came the reply. \u201cIf she loves music,\u201d countered the critic, \u201cwhy does she do this?\u201d It is a question many of us will have pondered as we watch The Voice, The X\u00a0Factor or Britain\u2019s Got Talent. And indeed the story of Jenkins, a woman who did not let a lack of talent limit her ambitions, seems to speak to a certain spirit of our age. The first play about her, Terry Sneed\u2019s Precious Few, premiered in 1994, and since then she has inspired ever more prestigious stage productions, culminating with Glorious!, which opened in the West End in 2005. Now, with the release of an eponymous film about her, starring Meryl Streep and directed by Stephen Frears, her continued fame seems assured. The screenplay by\u00a0Nicholas Martin, which is tagged on to the end of Jasper Rees\u2019s biography, furnishes the myth with many delicious details: Jenkins\u2019s obsession with potato salad, which she served in such great quantities at her private \u201cmusicales\u201d that she\u00a0stored it in the bath; the suggestion that syphilis, contracted from her first husband, may have been the cause of some of her eccentricities; her habit of\u00a0carrying her will around at\u00a0all times in a large black briefcase. But even as the Jenkins myth gains momentum, we are no nearer to answering the question posed by that critic. Why on earth did she do it? What\u00a0would possess a wealthy, well-connected, ageing heiress to expose herself to mockery on this scale? At best, we imagine that she simply didn\u2019t care, and that it was worth braving the catcalls in order to realise her childhood dream of performing in New York\u2019s premier concert venue. At worst, she was a vulnerable and deluded woman who was taken advantage of by Bayfield, a struggling actor who depended on her financially, and a concert promoter who spotted the opportunity to make a\u00a0quick buck. The fact that she died of heart failure just a few days after reading the scathing reviews of her Carnegie Hall performance would seem to suggest the latter, but perhaps \u2013 and this is certainly the line taken in the film \u2013 the reality lay somewhere between the two.   Related: Florence Foster Jenkins review \u2013 Streep is note perfect as a deluded diva    Weighing up the evidence is surely the crucial task for any biographer of Jenkins, but unfortunately Rees allows himself to be distracted by a wealth of minutiae. There is no doubt that he has\u00a0done his research: we get a potted history of her place of birth, the town of Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania; a huge amount of detail about a court case involving her father\u2019s will; and some random speculation about early influences (\u201cFlorence is likely to have taken her inspiration from tales of female empowerment and self-expression in\u00a0Louisa May Alcott\u2019s Little Women\u201d). Sadly, much of the juicy stuff, such as her scandalous marriage at the age of 14 and the question of whether or not she really contracted syphilis, is lost in\u00a0the mists of mostly undocumented history. One can sense Rees\u2019s anxiety at the lack of primary sources: \u201cthe biographer\u2019s task is further frustrated by the disappearance of all but four of the 500 letters which passed between Jenkins and St\u00a0Clair Bayfield over 30\u00a0years of common law marriage.\u201d All this would have been surmountable had Rees succeeded in bringing alive the spirit of Jenkins. He sketches out her rise through the New York \u201cwomen\u2019s clubs\u201d with brisk efficiency: she began singing to the well-heeled ladies of the Verdi Club, which she funded and ran, while Bayfield paid certain amenable journals to run positive reviews. It was only once she made some ear-splittingly off-key recordings that her fame began to spread into wider, and less easily manipulated, corners of society. But beyond these basic facts, the biography has little to offer on what to make of Jenkins herself. At times Rees tries to\u00a0argue that she was a symbol of female empowerment, \u201ca serious and hugely knowledgable lover of music\u201d, but he doesn\u2019t take her seriously as a\u00a0human being, often slipping into a\u00a0tone just as mocking as the Carnegie Hall audience. \u2022 To order Florence Foster Jenkins for \u00a37.19 (RRP \u00a38.99) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330\u00a0333\u00a06846.
