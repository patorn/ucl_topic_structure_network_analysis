  "body": "The Bank of England\u2019s chief economist Andy Haldane has warned that the UK pension system is too complicated, admitting that even he finds it confusing. \u201cI consider myself moderately financially literate,\u201d he said. \u201cYet I confess to not being able to make the remotest sense of pensions.\u201d At its most basic, a pension is a savings account you pay into and can only withdraw money from when you reach the age of 55. Which sounds simple. So why are pensions so confusing? There are lots of rules about what you can and cannot do In April 2015, the government introduced \u201cpension freedoms\u201d which made the rules about what you can do when you retire a bit simpler. In theory, you can now access all your money as you wish, subject to tax on some of the withdrawals.  However, before you get that far there are rules on how much you can put in each year (\u00a340,000 unless you are a high earner), how much you can invest in total (\u00a31m) and what happens to your fund if you die (you can leave it to someone tax-free if you die before 75, but there is a tax bill after that). And different pension schemes have their own rules and charges. Governments keep fiddling with them The pensions system involves lots of money and lots of people, so successive governments have made changes to it. These are generally geared towards making the system fairer, encouraging people to save and closing unintended consequences of previous changes. The results though are layer upon layer of rules. In 2006, the pensions industry was hoping to see an end to the confusion, with 6 April that year supposed to bring \u201cpensions simplification\u201d. That day, eight sets of old rules were brought together and some old limits were scrapped. It did make some bits of the system easier \u2013 for example, anyone could now open a personal scheme alongside their work pension. But since then there have been more pensions acts, all bringing their own new rules and regulations. Only on Wednesday, we saw the announcement of another pensions bill in the Queen\u2019s speech. As well as complicating the rules, the fact that MPs keep changing the system could be putting off people from engaging with it \u2013 after all, what\u2019s the point of learning how it works if it might change again next year. There are lots of different types of pension Roughly speaking, there are two types of pension: the state pension and those organised by either an individual or employer. But within both groups there different systems, and over your working life you could end up with several pensions run in different ways. The state pension is based on your national insurance (NI) contributions. For anyone retiring before 6 April 2016, there are potentially two sets of payment \u2013 the basic state pension, currently worth up to \u00a3119.30 a week, and the second state pension, paid on top of the basic state one. Anyone retiring on or after 6 April 2016 gets the new state pension \u2013 this is worth up to \u00a3155.65 a week. There is no additional state pension any more but, to complicate matters, people who have made enough NI contributions during their working life will qualify for an extra payment on top. Beyond the state pension there are severaltypes of scheme. Workplace pensions are offered by employers, but can be run as either \u201cdefined benefit\u201d or \u201cdefined contribution\u201d schemes. Defined benefit schemes are usually final salary schemes, and how much you will be paid will depend on your earnings when you retire. Defined contribution schemes will set how much you need to pay in each month and your payout will depend on how the pension scheme\u2019s investments perform. Your employer will contribute each month too, so a workplace pension is generally worth signing up to. Previously, employers could leave their workers to set up their own scheme, but under auto-enrolment they must all offer a scheme and make payments into it.  Personal pensions are set up by individuals \u2013 often freelancers or contracters who don\u2019t have access to a workplace scheme. They choose their own investments and make payments into their account each month or year.  The government has also introduced the Lifetime Isa, which everyone insists is categorically not a pension but, as it offers people a way to save until retirement, it is likely to be considered as an alternative for some savers.  They involve tax To encourage people to save the government offers tax relief on money put into pensions. If you are a basic rate taxpayer it is worth 20%, if you pay the higher rate it is worth 40% and at the top rate it is worth 45%. This means that to put \u00a3100 into your pension will only cost you \u00a380 if you are a basicrate payer and \u00a355 at the top rate.  If you are paying into a workplace pension your employer will take your contributions from your pay before deducting tax, but if you are paying into a personal scheme the provider will only reclaim 20% \u2013 if you are a higher rate or top rate taxpayer you need to reclaim the difference via your tax return. If you are a non-taxpayer and paying into a pension you get 20% tax relief on the first \u00a32,880 each tax year. No one knows who to trust for advice and information After mis-selling scandals around pensions and other financial products many people are sceptical about taking advice on what to do with their money. The Pensions Advisory Service has lots of resources and a phone line if you have questions \u2013 it doesn\u2019t sell pensions so you won\u2019t be put under pressure to sign up for anything.",
