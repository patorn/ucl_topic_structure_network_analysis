  "body": "I\u2019m the definition of what tech companies call a \u201clate adopter\u201d. When I first heard about the phenomenon of combining mobile phones with cameras, I thought the idea of giving up my Nokia 6100 and brick-like digital camera for something that did both \u2013 surely not as well \u2013 was crazy. When a friend explained this new thing called Facebook, I couldn\u2019t understand why you wouldn\u2019t text a message to your friends, or share your photos over email, rather than posting them for everyone you knew to see. And I laughed at the idea of Twitter: who\u2019d go for a pared back, rubbish version of Facebook? Needless to say, I\u2019ve now enthusiastically embraced them all. But when I read that Facebook wants us to spend more time on it, the old late-adopter questions went through my mind. Users already spend an average 50 minutes a day on Facebook. Like most people I know, I use it mainly to keep up to date with friends, spy on my exes and show off about my social life. Fun up to a point, but I certainly don\u2019t do that for almost an hour a day. How, then, does Facebook want to eke more time out of us? I spend far more than 50 minutes a day on social media in total: I just spend much more time on Twitter. The average Briton spends 80 minutes a day managing an average of four social networks. So it\u2019s not the total time on social networks that I find it hard to get my head around. I read Twitter when I\u2019m commuting, when I\u2019m watching TV, and when I\u2019m on hold waiting to speak to my bank. It decreases my productivity in some ways: I got very little work done the day Ken Livingstone\u2019s self-implosion was being tracked in real-time. But for me, the benefits far outweigh the downsides: I read news on the go, and access thinking I simply wouldn\u2019t if I were limited to reading one daily newspaper. As I suspect most people do, I fit social media around my life rather than vice versa. Because you can use social media while doing other things \u2013 travelling, watching, waiting \u2013 I\u2019m sure there\u2019s scope for the total time we spend on it to increase. But there\u2019s got to be a limit, because we all have real-world things that require exclusive attention: reading to your kids, dinner with friends, meetings at work. So I read Facebook\u2019s desire to capture extra time more as a grab on the rest of the time we spend online and on other apps. It wants that 30 minutes we spend on other types of social media: if Facebook had its way, there\u2019d be no Twitter, LinkedIn or Pinterest. Just as Microsoft sought to position itself as the only software option, and Apple as the only choice for interconnected phones and tablets, Facebook wants to be the only social media site you\u2019ll ever use. There are reasons to think it might achieve it. It has an inherent advantage of ubiquity: an amazing 85% of online adults, excluding China, have an account on one of Facebook\u2019s four services (the others being Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp). And its impressive success comes from the way it has seamlessly evolved over time. From its humble origins as a university-style online message board, it fast became a way of making public declarations of love and stalking people you haven\u2019t seen in years. Now it\u2019s used to generate support for big political campaigns and as a way for celebrities to share updates with their followers. But it wants more: to become the only platform we use to share content: once you open it up, there\u2019ll be no reason to leave it.    We pay for Facebook through the ads we consume. That\u2019s why Facebook cares so much about the time we spend with it    Would a world where we all spend more time on Facebook be so bad? Despite my initial scepticism I am, on balance, a fan. Of course there are downsides. It nurtures the show-off in us all: when on holiday, I find it as hard as the next person to resist posting a photo of a nice palm tree. It has changed my attention span: I rarely watch a big live TV event without scanning Facebook or Twitter to see what people are saying about it \u2013 although I think this makes things more fun. I find the enthusiastic virtue-signalling a bit distasteful, even as I take part in it: I wonder if changing your profile picture or posting a video of the ice-bucket challenge makes it easier to assuage any guilt you might feel at not getting involved with real social change. But it is Facebook\u2019s quest to be \u201cthe everything app\u201d that is worrying. We pay for Facebook through the ads we consume. That\u2019s why Facebook cares so much about the time we spend with it: more time equals more advertising. Its reach is already massive, so its growth strategy depends on directing us to ever-more tailored content, so that we use it for everything. It seems to me this is the fatal flaw in Facebook\u2019s plan. As lovely as my friend\u2019s baby photos are, much of the best content I interact with on social media is free to access, but created by people paid to produce it. And the only sustainable business model for that free-to-access quality content is the same online advertising revenue that sustains Facebook and Google. As we all know, those platforms are hoovering up an increased share. To the extent it gets invested, their ad revenue is spent not on the content itself but on their interfaces, and clever algorithms that curate the content. It\u2019s hard to see how a declining share of online advertising available for producers of content won\u2019t undermine the quality of what gets shared. I\u2019m only a lowly late adopter: but I do wonder if Facebook is at risk of cannibalising itself. @soniasodha",
