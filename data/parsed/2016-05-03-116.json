  "body": "Jeremy Corbyn, David Cameron and Ken Livingstone will be asked to give evidence to an inquiry by MPs into antisemitism. The House of Commons home affairs committee confirmed it would call the party leaders, as well as Livingstone, to give evidence after Labour launched an independent inquiry into allegations of antisemitism within the party. It is unusual for such senior politicians to be called to a select committee inquiry \u2013 Cameron usually only gives evidence to the Commons liaison committee \u2013 but the decision demonstrates that antisemitism has become a major political issue. It is understood the committee had until recently been planning to call only the home secretary, Theresa May, and shadow home secretary, Andy Burnham, but events over the past week have changed its mind.  Corbyn, Cameron and Livingstone are allowed to turn down the invitation to attend but they are likely to come under pressure to submit to questioning. The Labour inquiry was ordered by Corbyn after complaints that comments made by Livingstone and Facebook posts by Naz Shah, the Bradford West MP, were antisemitic. Shah is a member of the home affairs committee but, having been suspended by Labour, was asked to step aside from those duties while her case was investigated by the party. She has apologised over Facebook posts from 2014 that suggested Israel should be moved to the US and claiming the \u201cJews are rallying\u201d in support of an online poll in relation to the Israeli-Palestinian war at the time. Livingstone was subsequently suspended after he suggested, while trying to defend Shah, that Adolf Hitler was a supporter of Zionism. Keith Vaz, the chairman of the committee, said on Tuesday: \u201cNaz Shah attended the private session of the committee today and she has informed me and the committee that she wishes to stand aside from all her duties until current matters are resolved. \u201cWe have accepted her decision. She will not take part in any future matters concerning the home affairs select committee with immediate effect, until further notice. \u201cThe committee will now proceed with its inquiry into antisemitism, and we will begin calling witnesses including the Community Security Trust, the Jewish Board of Deputies, Ken Livingstone, and the prime minister, Jeremy Corbyn and [Scottish National party\u2019s parliamentary group leader] Angus Robertson.\u201d Corbyn has repeatedly stressed that Labour will not tolerate racism and ordered the Chakrabarti inquiry to address claims that there was a \u201ccrisis\u201d of antisemitism in the party. He said on Tuesday that complaints of antisemitism within Labour had been dealt with and related only to a very small number of suspensions of party members. Two of his allies, Diane Abbott, the shadow development secretary, and Len McCluskey, the leader of Unite, have angrily dismissed claims of a crisis, suggesting it is a smear designed to undermine Corbyn\u2019s leadership of the party.",
