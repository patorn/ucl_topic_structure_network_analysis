  "body": "Diamanda Gal\u00e1s is going to church this week. As one of the most extreme singers operating today, she favours subject matter that\u2019s found on the dark side of the alleyway. Her work is obsessed with death, disease, fornication, suicide, misery, melancholy, madness and all that other stuff from the Bible. Perhaps fittingly, then, the shuttered St Thomas the Apostle church in Harlem will be the site of Gal\u00e1s\u2019s three performances as part of the Red Bull Music Academy festival, which is taking over part of New York City during May. She will present her latest concept piece, Death Will Come, and Will Have Your Eyes.   Related: Diamanda Gal\u00e1s review \u2013\u00a0a gothic rage against the dying of the light    For about 35 years, Gal\u00e1s has been the queen of confrontational vocal performance, co-opting elements of cabaret, blues, jazz and electronic interference to make grand-scale music that traverses the styles and ends up as a highly personal expression, largely of angst, malevolence or possession.  Gal\u00e1s made her first disturbing mark in 1982, with The Litanies Of Satan, her debut proper, though she\u2019d been recording since 1979. It remains one of her most intense works, a verbal assault of electro-improvisational fury. Her early success was consolidated by the Masque Of the Red Death trilogy, released by Mute Records in 1988.  The heavy shadow of Aids blankets this epic sequence. Into the 1990s, Gal\u00e1s revealed a fascination with the old songbooks of blues and jazz, twisting these classics into individualist fragmentations, denuded of straight beats, stalking with a wayward unpredictability. Her voice was equally suited to the extreme highs and lows that lay in this foundation material, her sonic stage stripped to bare voice and piano (although she\u2019s also enjoyed successful collaborations with John Zorn, Iannis Xenakis and John Paul Jones). For the last decade, St Thomas, a Roman Catholic church no longer in operation, has been seeking landmark preservation status. \u201cEverything was sold, except the centre of the church,\u201d Gal\u00e1s says. \u201cWhere the altar is: there\u2019s a word for it that I should know, if I was a church-going person.\u201d  Gal\u00e1s chose St Thomas as the venue herself after her show\u2019s producers gave her a variety of options. \u201cThis was the one that I thought was acoustically, visually, everything \u2013 the best place. It\u2019s magnificent, a beautiful church,\u201d she says.  \u201cMy father had, when I was very young, a gospel choir that came to our house and rehearsed. I grew up hearing all that music, and sometimes accompanying the choir. That music has been very close to me, since I was a little girl, and I\u2019ve sung it when in great despair. There\u2019s something magical about it, that I should be invited to perform in this particular church.\u201d \u201cI now live in New York again,\u201d she says. \u201cI was in San Diego and Poland, working, and being with my mother, who was very, very ill, and I needed to be there for her, and I wanted to be, and she\u2019s now doing fine, which is wonderful.\u201d The last time Gal\u00e1s played in New York City was in 2007, at the Highline Ballroom. Most of her recent appearances have been in Europe. While living in Poland, Gal\u00e1s was working on The Fever Hospital, an ambitious music-theatre piece. \u201cIt literally should take place in a church,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd I have wanted to find a suitable church with an organ, because that sound is part of that work. I\u2019m looking for someone in America with the guts to commission the production. I think that my approach would be quite different: I would consider the space, why I was in a church, why I was using the organ.\u201d This week\u2019s show marries text and poetry with music, often composed by Gal\u00e1s herself. \u201cI always tailor-make concerts for the space. I did a similar sequence once before, in Bologna, Italy, in March.\u201d The title comes from the work of Italian poet Pavese, and his suicide poems are pivotal to the idea of the presentation.  \u201cHe\u2019s talking about himself, but he\u2019s also addressing the woman who broke his spirit, to the point where he killed himself,\u201d explains Gal\u00e1s.  \u201cHe\u2019s pointing the accusatory finger in all of his poems. Suicide has been described by many as the final despair, from which there is no rescue, and also as a hostile act, towards those that remain. There\u2019s a hostility in these poems.\u201d This week, Gal\u00e1s will concentrate on grand piano, with occasional subtle electronic effects. There will also be interpretations of words and music, highlighting a particular part of Gal\u00e1s\u2019s oeuvre, picking musical matter from blues, gospel, US country, Andalusian, Egyptian, Middle Eastern and Greek traditions, all transformed by her epic range. Gal\u00e1s always insists on delivering lines in their original language. \u201cHere is the poet, who has crafted this gorgeous work, in his own language, and then people translate them, and the translations are not always very good, and then a person sings from that translation.\u201d Gal\u00e1s has a penchant for releasing live recordings. There is little change ahead, as her next release, probably available in the summer, follows this same path. \u201cThis album is made up of primarily live performances, with two studio pieces, but it\u2019s got stuff on it that I\u2019m not performing at these concerts: love songs, really, love and death songs, all jazz or country standards.\u201d Each of this week\u2019s performances will probably be wildly different \u2013 and with two out three shows already sold out, it is hoped that her return to New York will lead to further shows and more dark interpretations.  Diamanda Gal\u00e1s performs Death Will Come, and Will Have Your Eyes, at the former Saint Thomas the Apostle church in New York starting Tuesday and continuing on 12 May and 14 May",
