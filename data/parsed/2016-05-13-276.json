  "body": "When I started life as a palliative care social worker just over 26 years ago (although the term \u201cpalliative care\u201d hadn\u2019t been invented then) I was based in a multi-professional team that supported people with terminal cancer and their families in the community. I was employed by the north London borough in which we worked. The first day I arrived at work the team administrator said to me: \u201cThis is a good borough to work in; you can get anything you need for patients here.\u201d Well she was right (within reason) but oh how times have changed. My last few years of working life in a hospice in a different London borough have involved endless tussles with the Department for Work and Pensions, including fighting numerous appeal tribunals to help sick and disabled people get the benefits they are entitled to; with housing offices trying to help those living in completely unsuitable homes or who are effectively homeless get rehoused; with housing associations who resolutely ignore the needs of their tenants, however ill they may be and however serious the repairs are that need doing; trying to access desperately needed help for those with serious mental health issues and so on. It feels that the main purpose of statutory services is to prove at all cost that they do not need to help you.    Related: Soggy sofas aside, social work is an amazing job    The hospice was always aware that if a patient was well enough to be discharged from the day centre, for example, there would be no other similar service available in the community. Day centres for older people, those with learning difficulties or mental health needs have all but disappeared. The emphasis is now on how we should all be working whatever our age or situation and even those who are terminally ill are not immune from feeling that they are \u201cbenefit scroungers\u201d. But despite all these difficulties, some things have not changed at all. Those facing life limiting and life threatening illnesses continue to receive almost endless support from their families who so often rise to the challenge whatever the pressures that puts them under.  It is a myth that modern families do not care for each other. They do, and very often it is at the expense of their own health and income. Giving up work to care for a relative or a partner and perhaps claiming carer\u2019s allowance, as I have seen so many people do, is usually a fatal career move. Unless you have a job or a skill that will guarantee employment once your family member dies, you will generally find that caring counts for nothing on a CV and eight weeks after a death carer\u2019s allowance stops and it\u2019s on to job seekers allowance for you with all the humiliations that that involves as you try to prove you are looking for work.  I often joked to patients and colleagues alike that \u201cyour employer doesn\u2019t visit you when you are in the hospice\u201d. They don\u2019t, but your family does. It\u2019s a good reminder to keep a healthy work/life balance.  This is not to underestimate the power of friendship either. Time and again I have been struck by the kindness and devotion of friends, especially for those who may not have a large, or any, family. I well remember one woman devotedly cared for by two friends whom she had met, aged 11, when they all started secondary school together some 70 years earlier. There are many, many people out there prepared to go the extra mile for someone close to them.   Related: What one woman, two cats and a surprise bedfellow taught me about social work    So, for me, palliative care social work has been a wonderful field in which to work. It has involved working with a wide range of other professionals \u2013 including nurses, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, doctors, dieticians and complementary therapists \u2013 each with their own insights. Most of all it has been an opportunity to work with a diverse group of patients and families.  Life threatening and life limiting illnesses are no respecter of class, income, age, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, religious belief, immigration status, mental health or learning difficulties. Palliative care social workers offer a wide range of support to patients and families from practical help and advice around income maintenance and debt counselling, help with housing and accessing other services through to advocacy, individual and family support and counselling and help for bereaved adults and children.  It has been an opportunity to practise social work as it is meant to be \u2013 empowering, enabling but not afraid to face and challenge conflicts and difficulties both within families and communities but in wider society. A far cry indeed from the care management model that most adult social work has now been reduced to.  Our new series aims to show what working in social care is really like.
