In his note-perfect 2007 drama Once, he gave us a beautifully unconsummated Dublin love story played out over the composition and recording of songs such as Falling Slowly, which went on to win an Academy award. In 2013\u2019s underrated Begin Again, Keira Knightley played an adrift singer-songwriter who winds up recording her music to the backing of New York street sounds, spurred on by Mark Ruffalo\u2019s formerly washed-up A&R man. Now Carney returns to Dublin and his youthful heyday of the mid-80s, where the delightful Sing Street spins its warm and uplifting fairytale, tugging at our melancholy heartstrings like a piece of classic bubblegum pop.    As Carney has proved before, he knows how to straddle the line between the sound in the room and the sound in your head    Ferdia Walsh-Peelo is Conor, a bedroom Bob Dylan struggling to turn the background noise of his parents\u2019 collapsing marriage into songs. When his dad\u2019s work hits the skids, Conor \u2013 later Cosmo \u2013 is sent to the Christian Brothers\u2019 Synge Street school, where his private education manners (\u201cRestaurant? You mean the canteen? You\u2019re not in France now, you bleedin\u2019 spanner!\u201d) strike a bum note. Bullied by skinhead Barry, and smitten by mysterious outsider Raphina (Lucy Boynton), Conor decides that \u201cwe need to form a band\u201d, and sets about rounding up local talent who can provide the perfect soundtrack to his VHS-era love story. \u201cI\u2019m a futurist!\u201d declares Conor after conceding that John Taylor\u2019s bass proficiency does indeed lend a funky edge to Duran Duran, a mantra he has learned from his stoner big brother, Brendan (Jack Reynor), who insists that, like the Pistols, \u201cyou need to learn how not to play \u2013 and that takes practise\u201d. The bittersweet, \u201chappy sad\u201d drama that follows has drawn inevitable, if misguided, comparisons with The Commitments, yet tonally this is closer to the teen spirit of Todd Graff\u2019s 2009 film Bandslam (to which David Bowie lent an approving cameo) or even Richard Linklater\u2019s sublime School of Rock. As Carney has proved previously, he knows how to straddle the line between the sound in the room and the sound in your head \u2013 a sequence that segues from bedroom composition to living room rehearsal (with tea and biscuits) to full studio production perfectly negotiates the space between kitchen-sink realism and musical fantasy in which this lovely, lyrical movie casts its spell.         Watch the trailer for Sing Street.    There\u2019s a touch of Michel Gondry\u2019s Be Kind Rewind or Garth Jennings\u2019s Son of Rambow in the band\u2019s attempts to reproduce the high-gloss sheen of Russell Mulcahy\u2019s pop videos in a Dublin backstreet, armed only with a silk scarf, a cowboy outfit and\u00a0an abundance of eyeliner. As the film progresses, the videos become more ambitious, mutating into a dreamscape reminiscent of Back to the\u00a0Future\u2019s climactic prom, setting\u00a0the tone for Sing Street\u2019s own fabulist finale. But it\u2019s the fact that Carney wisely keeps one foot on the ground that gives the film its emotional heft. Having served time in the Frames, Carney understands the practicalities of writing, rehearsing and performing pop songs. Here, he enlists former Danny Wilson frontman Gary Clark to\u00a0(co-)write original material inspired by Conor\u2019s ever-changing playlist, from the Cure to the\u00a0Jam, Joe Jackson, Spandau Ballet and beyond. Reminding us that most great pop songs are written by channelling existing hits, Drive it Like You Stole It neatly echoes the triplet bass riff from Hall & Oates\u2019s already derivative Maneater to finger-popping effect, while the band\u2019s dress sense changes with the winds of the latest Top of the Pops (some chronological liberties notwithstanding). Providing the backbone \u2013 both musical and fraternal \u2013 for Conor\u2019s education is Reynor\u2019s affectionately observed Brendan, his lost dreams and rich experience fuelling his younger brother\u2019s rite of passage. Typical of Carney, too, to lend a gentle ear to even the most seemingly unsympathetic characters, with Barry\u2019s\u00a0bullying behaviour contextualised as a product of his own battered horizons. In this hazy, street-lamped world, no one is beyond the redemption of a good\u00a0tune. With its inclusive 12A certificate, Sing Street should strike a chord not only with those ageing 80s nostalgists underwhelmed by the locker room Americana of Everybody Wants Some!!, but also with tween audiences who have long outgrown their Camp Rock DVDs and are ready for a little more grit amid the glitter. Happy sad indeed. I laughed, I cried, I bought the soundtrack album.",
