The 92-year-old Canarsie tunnels under New York\u2019s East river took on more than 7m gallons of corrosive saltwater during the catastrophic landfall of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, bringing the city\u2019s L train to a grinding halt for nearly two weeks. The long-term impact of that flooding, in the form of crumbling cement and rusted machinery, means that for the first time in nearly a century, north Brooklyn and Manhattan may be without a convenient link for as long as three years. On Thursday night, hundreds of residents gathered in Brooklyn to voice their concerns about a plan that would shut down or severely limit the line in order to perform needed repairs. City officials have said that the longer the tracks go without a full restoration, the greater chance for a derailment and for other serious service interruptions.   L train map The L train line transports riders from Williamsburg to Manhattan\u2019s bustling Union Square transit hub in about 10 minutes. Graphic: Jan Diehm   \u201cIt\u2019s safe to operate today, but over the longer term failures may increase and that\u2019s what\u2019s prompting us to do an out-of-phase replacement on the tube,\u201d said the MTA\u2019s CEO, Thomas Prendergast. The line currently transports more than 400,000 commuters daily, a number that could be even higher when the outage is scheduled to begin, in January 2019. Ridership has increased dramatically since the early 2000s as Brooklyn neighborhoods along the L line have gentrified amid rapid residential development. Williamsburg, unofficially known as the \u201chipster\u201d capital of the world, was once one of New York\u2019s poorest neighborhoods, but now is home to some of the city\u2019s highest rents, with one-bedroom apartments fetching more than $3,000 a month on average.  Usage at the Bedford Avenue stop, in the heart of Williamsburg, has quadrupled since 1990. \u201cWilliamsburg is happening and people want to be there,\u201d said New York assemblyman Joseph Lentol, who addressed residents at the town hall and proposed a dedicated bus to take tourists from Times Square to Brooklyn during the extended outage.  Part of the neighborhood\u2019s appeal in recent decades has been its close proximity and ease of travel to Manhattan thanks to the L line, with travel times under 10 minutes to the bustling Union Square transit hub. Some residents have suggested that without the convenience of the L, neighborhoods such as Williamsburg and Bushwick, to its east, might lose their appeal to well-off residential and commercial renters, potentially lowering the cost of renting and buying there. \u201cThere\u2019s probably a couple dozen projects in the pipeline to put office space there and this really has a huge impact because the whole point is to be able to get to Manhattan easily,\u201d said Brooklyn real estate broker Christopher Havens. \u201cThis is really scary \u2026 It\u2019s a real estate catastrophe on all levels. \u201cHow do you invest in a real estate office building, a tenancy or a retail store when you know in three years you won\u2019t be able to get to Manhattan in under an hour?\u201d The L service also extends far beyond the artisanal shops and trendy lofts of north-western Brooklyn through lower-income neighborhoods to the east. \u201cThis is also about Canarsie and East New York \u2013 this is about a lot of people,\u201d Havens said.  A group calling themselves the L Train Coalition has asked the MTA to consider building new tubes under the East river before putting the current tubes out of order, but that proposal has been dismissed by officials as a non-starter. \u201cThe timeframe and the cost associated with it just doesn\u2019t make it a real option,\u201d Prendergast said. Estimates place the cost of a new tunnel in excess of $4bn over five to seven years. Under one potential plan, the tubes would be completely shut down for 18 months suspending both crosstown service in Manhattan along 14th Street, and critically, all Manhattan-to-Brooklyn service. Another proposal would shut down the two Canarsie tubes one at time, allowing for limited service \u2013 at about 20% of capacity \u2013 but would take three years to complete. In either case, the MTA would offset the lost capacity with shuttle busses, increased service on other train lines, and ferry boats across the East river. Among the crowd at Thursday\u2019s town hall, the full closure seemed the most popular option. \u201cJust close it. Get it done, and get it over with,\u201d said Williamsburg resident Nicole Fredericks. The MTA says the closures are also necessary to perform long overdue station upgrades at the 1st Avenue and Bedford Avenue stations which anchor the line on either side of the river. Like nearly 75% of the city\u2019s stations, neither is currently equipped with an elevator to accommodate disabled travellers. Restoration is expected to cost about $1bn, with $700m already covered by federal grants secured after Hurricane Sandy, a fact New York congresswoman Carolyn Maloney said was significant. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how hard it is to get federal money,\u201d Maloney said. If the city does not begin the project on the proposed timeline, it risks losing that funding.",
