  "body": "Veteran French intellectual Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy was granted a late entry in the official Cannes selection with his absorbing and very well photographed documentary tribute to the peshmerga, the fighting force of the Kurds, battling to establish the state of Kurdistan across the existing states of Syria, Iraq, Iran and Turkey - and now the west\u2019s newest best friends, our allies in the fight against Isis, or Daesh. L\u00e9vy\u2019s film is here to remind us that\u00a0Isis\u00a0is not simply being fought by the cynics Assad or Putin. L\u00e9vy and his crew travel with the peshmerga northwest along enemy lines \u2013 though never behind these lines, in enemy territory \u2013 across Iraq towards the Sinjar mountains, the site of a brutal\u00a0Isis\u00a0massacre in 2014. There is some gripping and scary battle footage, and with camera drones, L\u00e9vy gets some breathtaking birds-eye view shots of the cities and plains.   Related: 'Tyranny has gone': Kurds and Yazidis celebrate recapture of Sinjar from Isis    A key moment of the film comes when he shows the peshmerga\u2019s female battalions, and recounts the view that an\u00a0Isis\u00a0warrior is horrified above everything else by the idea\u00a0of getting killed by a woman: it means, says L\u00e9vy, that he is unclean, and won\u2019t get to heaven for his 72 virgins. Even if this nugget has been exaggerated \u2013 and I suspect it has \u2013 it\u2019s an interesting example of the peshmerga\u2019s tradition of equality. They incidentally don\u2019t like to call their fallen comrades \u201cmartyrs\u201d because that smacks of the jihadi death cult. L\u00e9vy\u2019s film is, of course, far from objective in any normal documentary sense. A more detached film might have wondered aloud if our admiration for the plucky peshmerga is the equivalent of our praise for Afghanistan\u2019s anti-Soviet mujahadeen in the 1980s, where the 21st century jihadis originated. But I think he is right to praise their courage and the fact that the fight against\u00a0Isis\u00a0terrorism isn\u2019t simply a\u00a0matter of waiting for the next act of asymmetrical warfare in western cities.",
