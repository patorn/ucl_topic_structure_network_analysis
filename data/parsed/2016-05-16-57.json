  "body": "The supreme court failed to resolve a dispute on Monday between faith-based groups and the Obama administration over birth control, asking lower courts to take another look at the issue in search of a compromise. \u201cThe court expresses no view on the merits of the cases\u201d involved, the justices wrote, issuing an unsigned, unanimous opinion. The case, Zubik v Burwell, pitted the government against 29 faith-based not-for-profit organizations that claimed that the government\u2019s rules for groups with religious objections to covering female employees\u2019 contraception were morally compromising. The decision implied that the court, which is evenly divided between four conservative justices and four liberals following the death of conservative Antonin Scalia in February, wanted to avoid a 4-4 tie. With the man Barack Obama has picked as Scalia\u2019s replacement, Merrick Garland, in limbo and awaiting confirmation, the case is highly unlikely to return to the supreme court before the presidential election.   Related: Supreme court punts on challenge to Obama's contraception mandate    Are there likely to be more such non-decisions? Probably. The evenly balanced, partially paralysed court will struggle to find a majority for important cases taken up before Scalia\u2019s death but will try to avoid 4-4 deadlocks when it can. On Monday it also sent back a major class-action case to a federal appeals court for further action. Asked the question at Monday\u2019s White House press briefing, spokesman Josh Earnest said: \u201cWhat is undeniable is that even Republicans have failed to make any sort of coherent case that the American people are better served by having a vacancy on the supreme court. That flies in the face of certainly the argument President Obama has made. It also flies in the face of the argument that President Reagan made.\u201d Does this mean that, in effect, the supreme court is broken? Yes, according to Washington lobbyist Vincent Eng. \u201cIt\u2019s the highest court in the land and if it can\u2019t make decisions, it\u2019s absolutely broken,\u201d he said. \u201cThe whole country is in a holding pattern. This could go on for two supreme court terms, and it doesn\u2019t bode well for getting the country on the right track on what\u2019s the law and what\u2019s not the law.\u201d The court has split 4-4 in two cases already this year, including a major labour rights case, and has dramatically slashed the number of new cases it is accepting for next term. Justice Elena Kagan admitted last month: \u201cThere is a reason why courts do not typically have an even number of members. We\u2019ve seen this already.\u201d Scalia himself once wrote that, if there are only eight justices on a case, it raises the \u201cpossibility that, by reason of a tie vote, [the court] will find itself unable to resolve the significant legal issues presented by the case\u201d. What other important cases are still to come this term? There are almost 50 cases left to decide before the justices leave for their summer break at the end of June. They include a challenge by 26 states including Texas to Barack Obama\u2019s plan to spare roughly 4 million undocumented immigrants from deportation, and a case brought by a Hispanic man that raises the question of whether jury secrecy laws stand in the way of his ability to present evidence of racial bias. How does the issue divide Democrats and Republicans? Republicans have adamantly opposed Obama\u2019s nomination of Garland, saying that it should wait until after the election so the American people can have a say. Earnest seized on Monday\u2019s non-decision saying: \u201cI haven\u2019t heard anybody make the argument that leaving the supreme court of the United States short-staffed is somehow good for the country. \u201cThe argument that we\u2019ve heard from Republicans is they don\u2019t want to confirm another of President Obama\u2019s nominees to the supreme court and they have made that declaration based solely on partisan reasons and many Republicans are having a tough time explaining it to their constituents why they\u2019ve refused to do their job, simply because the Republican leader in the Senate has requested that they do so.\u201d Democratic senator Patrick Leahy said on Monday: \u201cOur constitution ensures equal justice for all; not a patchwork of different rights in different parts of the country. This is precisely why the Senate must proceed with a public hearing and a vote for Chief Judge Merrick Garland, who was nominated two months ago to fill the vacancy on the supreme court.\u201d Donald Trump, the Republican presumptive nominee, has described the death of Scalia as a \u201ctremendous blow to conservatism\u201d and called on the Senate to halt any nomination. \u201cIt\u2019s up to Mitch McConnell and everyone else to stop it,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s called delay, delay, delay.\u201d What\u2019s the latest on Garland\u2019s nomination? Obama announced his pick two months ago today but Senate Republicans had already insisted that they would not grant him a hearing. Garland returns to Capitol Hill this week for talks with six senators but all are Democrats. There is still little sign of the Republicans budging. Lobbyist Eng said: \u201cAll individuals, Republicans and Democrats, should want an institution to be functioning. One of our branches of government is not able to put something to rest. I don\u2019t think people in the country want vagueness from its highest leaders. The Republicans are trying to stick to their word, even to the detriment of the country.\u201d Some Republican senators, such as Jeff Flake and Orrin Hatch, have conceded that they will back Garland if Trump loses the general election in November. They could confirm him in a lame duck session to pre-empt Democrat Hillary Clinton choosing a more liberal jurist.",
