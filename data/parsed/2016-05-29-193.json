  "body": "Truly Irresistible Pinotage, Swartland, South Africa 2015 (\u00a36.99, The Co-Operative) Good pinotage \u2013 now there\u2019s a statement that feels like an oxymoron. This much-maligned South African variety, a crossing between two varieties I like and love \u2013 cinsaut and pinot noir \u2013 has always been less than the sum of its parts, and can taste like a disaster at an industrial sweet factory: ash, rubber, artificial banana. Even with the drinkable ones (from Beyerskloof and Hamilton Russell), I generally feel I\u2019d rather be drinking something else for the price. A new addition at The Co-operative shows it doesn\u2019t have to be that way, however. It\u2019s made by the very talented Duncan Savage and, with its effortlessly supple berry juiciness, it\u2019s like a slightly wilder, deeper Beaujolais. A genuine bargain. Delas C\u00f4tes du Ventoux, Rh\u00f4ne, France 2013 (\u00a36.49, The Co-Operative) The Co-op\u2019s wine department is on good form at the moment with plenty worth looking out for if you\u2019re popping in for the pinotage. There\u2019s a fine range of Rh\u00f4ne reds, starting with the appealingly savoury and succulent C\u00f4tes du Ventoux 2014 made by the reliable Delas and rising to a sumptuously chewy, sweetly spiced Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape 2014 from the Co-operative (\u00a315.99). Domaine les Grandes Costes Pic St-Loup 2013 (\u00a314.39) does a similarly evocative sun-baked grenache-syrah southern French thing, and the peppery Sacred Hill Reserve Hawkes Bay Syrah 2014 (\u00a39.99) is an elegant Kiwi that takes its cue from the Northern Rh\u00f4ne. Ch\u00e2teau de la Petite Giraudi\u00e8re Muscadet S\u00e8vre et Maine Sur Lie, Loire, France 2015 (\u00a36.75, The Co-Operative) When it comes to whites and fizz, the Co-op stocks two standout wines: the latest vintages of both Les Pionniers Vintage Champagne 2006 (\u00a324.99) from the Heidsieck champagne stable and Denis Dubourdieu\u2019s tangy, toasty sauvignon-s\u00e9millon Bordeaux white blend Clos Floridi\u00e8ne Graves Blanc 2014 (\u00a317.49). Both are as fine as ever. I was impressed, too, by the stone-fruit richness in Italian white Truly Irresistible Fiano 2014 (\u00a36.99) and the estuarine tang of Ch\u00e2teau de la Petite Giraudi\u00e8re\u2019s muscadet. Finally, the Co-op\u2019s Cava Rosado Brut NV (\u00a35.99) is more interesting than prosecco at this price. Follow David on Twitter @Daveydaibach",
