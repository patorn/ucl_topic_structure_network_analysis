From the way they rise, he estimates his homemade liquor has 50% alcohol. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t do this, it\u2019s not mezcal. It\u2019s another alcoholic beverage,\u201d he says at his home in Mexico\u2019s western Jalisco state. Partida and his family have made mezcal for five generations, enduring the Mexican revolution, the Cristero rebellion and various attempts by governments \u2013 and the tequila industry \u2013 to rein in renegade mezcaleros. They even survived losing the legal right to use the name \u201cmezcal\u201d and are obliged to sell theirs as \u201cagavate distillates\u201d.   Related: From firewater to fine dining: exports triple for tequila\u2019s poor cousin, mezcal    But new rules will now require them to label their liquor something completely foreign: \u201cKomil\u201d. The word, from the indigenous Nahuatl language, means \u201can intoxicating drink\u201d \u2013 but few mezcaleros had even heard of it until late last year, when Mexico\u2019s finance ministry released new regulations governing denomination of origin (DO). For Partida, it\u2019s all an attempt at doing away with artisanal producers, wiping out a way of life and the ancestral knowledge of making mezcal \u201cnot written down in any books\u201d. \u201cMezcal has been persecuted since its origins,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve always wanted to control and regulate us. It happens every 20 to 30 years.\u201d NOM 199 promoters say the new rules aim to improve quality, make mezcal more marketable and do away with adulterated drinks. Officials from the Mezcal Regulatory Council (CRT), which oversees the DO, did not respond to interview requests.     Miguel \u00c1ngel Partida, a mezcal producer. Photograph: David Agren    The new rules emerge as the once-despised liquor has moved to the mainstream, winning fans with its smoky and earthy flavors, origins in oft-forgotten indigenous communities and small-scale production in backwoods stills. Over the past decade, bars known as \u201cmezcaler\u00edas\u201d have popped up in hip Mexican neighourhoods, while bartenders have developed a range of mezcal-based cocktails. The success could be short-lived, however. Mom-and-pop mezcal makers and their allies are accusing regulators of trying to industrialize and standardize an artisanal activity, along with appropriating the name, \u201cMezcal\u201d \u2013 just as it starts carrying some commercial cachet. \u201cThis is attacking the small producers and depriving them of the name that they\u2019ve had for 300 years,\u201d says Ana Valenzuela, a biologist, who studies agave along with tequila and mezcal. \u201cThey want to own mezcal as if it were a trademark \u2026 because mezcal now has value.\u201d Mezcal is made in most of Mexico\u2019s 31 states, but the DO introduced in 1994 excludes many traditional mezcal-making areas. If fully implemented, NOM 199 would force producers in those areas to call their products \u201cKomil\u201d \u2013 a name many are finding tough to swallow. Adding insult to injury, mezcaleros from outside the DO would also be prohibited from listing the ingredients \u2013 varieties of agave and maguey \u2013 on the labels of their products. Zapatitl\u00e1n, where the Partidas produce mezcal, is excluded from the DO area \u2013though ironically it is in an area authorized for producing tequila, something easily apparent by the rows of blue agave (tequila\u2019s lone ingredient) lining the landscape. Partida, 35, avoids blue agave in his products, however, preferring to instead combine 14 types of agave \u2013 some \u201cbitter\u201d, some \u201csweet\u201d and some \u201cwild\u201d, which mature for seven to 15 years \u2013 to create more complex flavors than the tequila industry. \u201cWe did tests with blue agave,\u201d says Partida\u2019s father, Marcario, 76, who recalls finding the fabled plant to have \u201cno flavor and no aroma\u201d. S\u00f3sima Olivera Aguilar, who makes around 200 litres of mezcal annually in an indigenous community in Oaxaca state can still call her liquor, \u201cmezcal,\u201d as she produces inside the DO area.  But, as she is unable to pay the several thousand dollars fee to be certified, she will no longer be allowed use the words \u201cagave\u201d or \u201cmaguey\u201d. \u201cIf I sell without getting certified, I\u2019m illegal. If I get certified, I won\u2019t be able to do this any longer because my production is so small,\u201d she said. \u201cSpeaking of mezcal is speaking of culture, of identity, of a drink that is spiritual, a drink that is ritual in our communities,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not this single thing for getting drunk.\u201d",
