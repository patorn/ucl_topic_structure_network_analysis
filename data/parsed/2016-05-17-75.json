  "body": "Expectations were low and the Competition and Markets Authority barely met them. If that sounds cruel, consider the painful moment at the end of the mid-morning press conference when Alasdair Smith, chair of the retail banking investigation, was asked to say who apart from the British Bankers\u2019 Association lobby group welcomed the report. Smith mentioned Citizens Advice and then paused. The silence was broken only by a colleague\u2019s assertion that positive responses were still, apparently, \u201crolling in\u201d. Really? To be fair to Smith, the CMA was never going to be allowed to host a fireworks display. The chief grumble from the \u201cchallenger\u201d banks \u2013 the likes of Metro Bank \u2013 is that their competitive ambitions are constrained by the need to hold disproportionate amounts of capital. But the little ol\u2019 CMA can\u2019t tread on the Bank of England\u2019s territory.   Related: Costs of overdrafts to fall as part of UK banks overhaul    Equally, the tempting option of breaking up the \u201cbig four\u201d lenders would have carried political risks. Royal Bank of Scotland, currently making the job of spinning off 600 branches resemble the labours of Hercules, has destroyed appetite for structural upheaval. As for abolishing free-if-in-credit banking \u2013 and thus exposing the hidden costs to consumers of current accounts \u2013 the politicians know there are no votes in the idea. Thus the CMA, while describing competitive pressures as weak, produced a hotchpotch of remedies that amount to nudges, prompts and tweaks. There will be a \u201ccap\u201d on charges for unarranged overdrafts but each bank can set its own rate. The CMA wants to push better comparison websites to encourage customers to switch accounts; banks will be obliged to adopt the necessary open-data software. And, in the small-business market, tech-minded whizzkids will be offered a prize to invent comparison tools. That was about it. The hard \u2013 and depressing \u2013 reality about competition in the banking market is that the pivotal moment was the day in September 2008, in the middle of crisis, that the Labour government allowed Lloyds TSB to buy HBOS to prevent an even bigger banking meltdown. A new market leader was created and competition objections were ignored. Some Labour politicians plead in their defence that they expected the Lloyds/HBOS merger to be unwound by a future competition watchdog. That hasn\u2019t happened this time, and now probably never will. One of these decades, the FinTech revolution, already seen in the rise of peer-to-peer lending, may succeed in injecting some real competition by changing the definition of what it means to be a bank. Until then, though, we\u2019re stuck with the CMA\u2019s attempt to make the current lot \u201cwork harder for customers\u201d while hitting them with a feather. Vodafone\u2019s organic approach finally pays dividends Vittorio Colao, Vodafone\u2019s chief executive, has been talking for ages about reaching a turning point and here it is: the first increase in \u201corganic\u201d revenues and top-line profits since 2008. It hasn\u2019t come cheaply. Vodafone has spent \u00a319bn in the past two years, including a necessary extra \u00a37bn under \u201cProject Spring\u201d to get its 4G and data capabilities up to competitive strength. If investors worried that heavy spending would become permanent \u2013 and that Project Summer would follow \u2013 there is no evidence to suggest so. The statistics for growth in broadband, mobile data, business customers and emerging markets all look healthy. The only blemish was a botched billing system in the UK. The wider picture is that Vodafone\u2019s dividend, costing \u00a33bn-a-year, looks more affordable that at any time since the $130bn (\u00a384bn) sale of the Verizon Wireless stake in 2014, which was followed by a mammoth return of cash to shareholders. Vodafone is a duller company these days \u2013 at least until the deal-making starts afresh. But its profit predictions are generally accurate and the dividend yield is 5%. Hard to quibble with that. Mike Ashley\u2019s chopper offer is fine for travel agents but not MPs Roll up, roll up, who wants a ride in Mike Ashley\u2019s helicopter? Unfortunately, this offer is available only to members of the Commons select committee on business, innovation and skills. The Sports Direct founder wants its MPs to visit him at the company\u2019s Shirebrook warehouse \u2013 travelling in his chopper or their charabanc, or whatever \u2013 and then he will graciously appear in front of the committee the next day in Westminster. If they value the dignity of their office, the MPs\u2019 reply to Ashley\u2019s invitation should be a firm no. It\u2019s their inquiry into working practices at Sports Direct and witnesses can\u2019t be allowed to attach conditions to their appearance. Hear from Ashley in Westminster and then decide if a trip to Derbyshire would be useful. Remember, dear MPs, you\u2019re running a parliamentary inquiry, not a travel agency.",
