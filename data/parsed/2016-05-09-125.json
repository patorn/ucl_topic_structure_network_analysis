Though fiction in translation accounts for just 3.5% of literary fiction titles published, it accounted for 7% of sales in 2015, according to a survey commissioned by the Man Booker International prize.  The research, conducted by Nielsen Book, looked at physical book sales in the UK between January 2001 and April 2016. It found that translated fiction sales almost doubled over the last 15 years, from 1.3m to 2.5m copies, while the market for fiction as a whole fell from 51.6m in 2001 to 49.7m in 2015.  Although the proportion of translated fiction is still \u201cextremely low\u201d, at 1.5% overall, the sector still \u201cpunches well above its weight\u201d, said the book sales monitor, with that 1.5% accounting for 5% of total fiction sales in 2015. \u201cOn average, translated fiction books sell better than books originally written in English, particularly in literary fiction,\u201d said Nielsen. Looking specifically at translated literary fiction, sales rose from 1m copies in 2001 to 1.5m in 2015, with translated literary fiction accounting for just 3.5% of literary fiction titles published, but 7% of the volume of sales in 2015.    25% of our top 20 fiction titles are translated - if more were published I\u2019m sure that percentage would be even higher  Chris White, fiction buyer for Waterstones     \u201cIn 2001, every literary fiction title written in English sold an average 1,153 copies, while every translated literary fiction title sold only 482 copies. By 2015 this had completely changed \u2013 every literary fiction title written in English sold an average of only 263 copies, while every translated literary fiction title sold an average of 531 copies,\u201d said Fiammetta Rocco, administrator of the Man Booker International prize. \u201cNot only are the numbers of translated books sold going up, but there is an incredibly devoted readership in Britain of translated fiction. We were amazed to discover this \u2013 the only thing we\u2019ve known is the 3% figure and we didn\u2019t know if that related to the number of titles published, or to sales. For translated literary fiction, it turns out the proportion published is about the same, at 3.5%, but that sales are much higher, at 7%.\u201d Rocco said the research was \u201cconfirmation of the health and growth potential of international fiction in the UK\u201d, and expressed the hope that it would \u201cencourage publishers and agents to take more risks and invest in translation\u201d. This year\u2019s Man Booker International prize will be awarded for the first time to a single book translated into English, rather than an author\u2019s body of work. Deborah Smith, publisher at Tilted Axis Press and translator of Han Kang\u2019s The Vegetarian, which is shortlisted for this year\u2019s prize, said she was \u201cnot surprised\u201d by Nielsen Book\u2019s \u201cencouraging\u201d research. \u201cPart of the reason I became a translator in the first place was because Anglophone or Eurocentric writing often felt quite parochial. Setting up Tilted Axis Press came from a similar impulse; our focus on Asian literatures \u2013 where linguistic experimentation is informed by daily lives shifting between languages \u2013 is a brilliant way of discovering the stylistic innovation and non-conforming narratives that most excite us,\u201d said Smith. \u201cJudging by this year\u2019s Man Booker International long- and shortlists, which included titles from South Korea, Japan, China, Indonesia, the Congo, the industry as a whole is definitely waking up to the fact that a lot of the most original and distinctive writing is happening in these areas. Exploring the underrepresented is also a great way to stand out in a crowded market as a publisher \u2013 when people hear we\u2019re doing the UK\u2019s first ever translation of contemporary Thai fiction, they sit up and take notice.\u201d    The 'Ferrante phenomenon' has helped drive sales of Italian fiction from 7,000 in 2001 to 237,000 in 2015    \u201cWe\u2019ve now reached a stage where not only are people happy to read fiction in translation, they are positively seeking it out,\u201d agreed Waterstones fiction buyer Chris White. \u201cCurrently 25% of our top 20 fiction titles are translated and if more were published I\u2019m sure that percentage would be higher still.\u201d White said that the growth of Scandinavian crime had \u201ccertainly helped to break down any psychological barriers or pre-conceptions which readers may have had about translated fiction\u201d. \u201cThe popularity of the likes of Stieg Larsson and Jo Nesbo has made people realise that \u2018translated\u2019 doesn\u2019t automatically equal \u2018difficult\u2019 or \u2018worthy\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a result, readers are now reading translated fiction of every description and you\u2019re as likely to find My Brilliant Friend, The Hundred-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out of the Window and Disappeared or Look Who\u2019s Back on the bestseller tables as you are The Girl in the Spider\u2019s Web.\u201d Rocco believes there are three reasons for the increase: \u201cPeople travel more and more people travel, there is highbrow foreign television coming here, so the whole landscape of foreignness is much more even \u2013 people cross boundaries much more easily. There are some stand-out authors like Knausgaard, Murakami and Ferrante. And there are also small publishers today, who were set up to deal almost entirely with translated fiction, which wasn\u2019t the case 15 years ago.\u201d   Related: Elena Ferrante: the global literary sensation nobody knows    French remains the most popular language for translation, with 200,000 books sold in 2001, and more than 400,000 in 2015, found Nielsen. But books were translated from 91 languages over the period studied, from Afrikaans to Yiddish. The \u201cFerrante phenomenon\u201d helped drive sales of Italian literary fiction, up from 7,000 in 2001 to 237,000 in 2015, while Korean books also boomed, up from 88 copies in 2001 to 10,191 in 2015, according to the research. By 2015, the most popular languages for translation were French, Italian, Japanese, Swedish and German, while in 2001, they were French, Brazilian Portuguese, Spanish, Russian and Mandarin. Nielsen noted that \u201cthe languages of the Indian sub-continent are extremely under-represented with just a handful of titles published from Kannada and a fall in the number of literary fiction from Hindi available in the period from 686 to 299 titles\u201d.
