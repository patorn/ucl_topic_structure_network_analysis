  "body": "1) Liverpool: You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone When the jubilant, vindicated and visibly relieved families, friends and supporters of the 96 Liverpool fans recently emerged from the inquest that confirmed what they\u2019d all known for 27 years, there was only ever one song they were likely to sing. There can scarcely have been a more sincere and heartfelt performance of a football chant that is always capable of prompting goosebumps regardless of one\u2019s football allegiances. While Liverpool supporters are widely credited with having been the first body of fans to replace random shouting and rattle-waving with the singing of actual songs at football matches, there seems to be some debate over whether their signature tune, one of the first to be included in their repertoire, was first sung by them or Celtic fans. Originally written by Rodgers and Hammerstein for the climax of their musical Carousel, the song was covered by the Liverpool band Gerry and The Pacemakers in 1963. In his autobiography, Anfield Iron, Liverpool legend Tommy Smith wrote that Gerry Marsden, the band\u2019s lead singer, had presented Bill Shankly with a tape recording of the song. Smith recalls that hearing the song for the first time on the team bus during a pre-season tour was akin to a religious experience for Shankly, who promptly told his players that the club would have to adopt it. \u201cFootball writers from the local papers were travelling with our party and, thirsty for a story of any kind between games, filed copy back to their editors to the effect that we had adopted Gerry Marsden\u2019s forthcoming single as the club song,\u201d wrote Smith. \u201cThe rest is history.\u201d In 1964, on the day Liverpool sealed their first title for 17 years with a 5-0 win over Arsenal, Panorama sent plummy-toned reporter John Morgan to the game for a now infamous special they were doing about the city\u2019s contribution to the cultural zeitgeist. In the subsequent broadcast, he could be seen standing in front of the heaving, swaying mass of humanity that was the Kop, looking slightly scared as he marvelled at their version of She Loves You and Anyone Who Had A Heart by local turns the Beatles and Cilla Black.            \u201cI\u2019ve never seen anything like this Liverpool crowd,\u201d he said. \u201cThe 28,000 people on the Kop begin singing together; they seem to know intuitively when to begin. Throughout the match they invent new words, usually within the framework of old Liverpool songs, to express adoratory, cruel or bawdy comments about the players or the police. But even then, they begin singing these new words with one immediate huge voice. They seem, mysteriously, to be in touch with one another, with \u2018wacker\u2019, the spirit of scouse.\u201d While Morgan\u2019s foray into the field of music criticism is unlikely to have given Lester Bangs any sleepless nights, his dispatch from Anfield did expose the phenomenon of the Kop to a wider audience and prompted supporters of other clubs to begin aping their Scouse counterparts. It seems Liverpool fans can rightfully lay claim to having been the creators of terrace chanting. In a football culture increasingly soundtracked by raucous rage, they remain synonymous with the uplifting and optimistic standard to solidarity You\u2019ll Never Walk Alone. Half a century after appearing on Panorama, their poignant commemoration of the 25th anniversary of Hillsborough earned them a spot on another high-browed BBC current affairs programme. BG             2) Leeds United: Marching on Together The Righteous Brothers\u2019 Unchained Melody was originally released as a B-side and so was one of the greatest love songs of all time: Marching on Together, a rousing, almost arousing, paean to Leeds United. It first appeared as the flip side to the single (cunningly entitled Leeds United) that was released before the club\u2019s ultimately triumphant appearance in the 1972 FA Cup final and was written jointly by Les Reed (yes, that one! If by \u2018that one\u2019 you mean the chap who penned a string of hits in the 1960s and 70s, not the one who managed Charlton Athletic and is now Southampton\u2019s director of football) and Barry Mason, who belongs in a football music hall of fame, or at the very least a rowdy football-themed pub, having also composed Delilah, the murder ballad at which Tom Jones had a stab before Stoke City fans made it famous. Since its release Marching on Together has become the Leeds anthem, its blend of jauntiness and faux militaristic bombast melodically capturing the power of a crowd mobilised in the name of fun and communal pride. Lots of rivals fans won\u2019t admit it but nearly every club looks forward to a visit by Leeds United fans and not simply because it means a cash bonanza for the hosts: it also generally means an uplifting experience for all, especially when Marching on Together gets its inevitable airing. Mind you, Peterborough United fans who admire spontaneity preferred one of the other songs that the visiting fans came up with on the spot back in 2008, when Gary McAllister was the Leeds manager and Peterborough local council chose match day as the perfect opportunity to stage a campaign to raise awareness of the importance of sexual health screening. Leeds fans, always happy to help promote a worthy campaign, chanted during the game: \u201cWe\u2019ve got McAllister, you\u2019ve got chlamydia\u201d. Not as enduringly catchy as Marching on Together, however. PD            3) Norwich: On the Ball City   Related: What are the wittiest chants you have heard at a football match?    Norwich fans have a fight for survival on their minds right now and we\u2019re not only talking about the team\u2019s attempt to avoid relegation. A campaign is under way to restore the club\u2019s anthem, On The Ball City, to its original form lest the uniqueness of the track be blurred by rash or slapdash singing. It\u2019s not that the tune has been altered or the words tampered with it, the problem, as some fans see it, is that the song is now being sung so quickly that the words cannot be distinguished. And the words are lovely. This, after all, is regarded as the oldest recorded football chant in the world, having been written in the 1890s by one Albert T Smith, as far as anyone can tell. Smith went on to become a director Norwich City when it was founded in 1902 and the club adopted the song, which had been originally written for a local team, possibly Norwich Teachers. As Jon Punt and Andrew Lawn, who set up the #slowdownOTBC campaign, wrote in the programme before Norwich\u2019s recent defeat by Sunderland: \u201cOn The Ball City sounds like no other chant you\u2019re likely to hear on the terraces elsewhere \u2026 the song features none of the tub-thumping one-upmanship which characterises many chants and instead focuses fully on the club.\u201d Nowadays the Carrow Road crowd tends to only sing the chorus and too often reduce the words to indecipherable hollering. Which is a shame because who wouldn\u2019t want to hear a full clear rendition of this song at the correct tempo? PD  In the days to call, which we\u2019ve left behind, Our boyhood\u2019s glorious game, And our youthful vigour has declined With its mirth and its lonesome end; You will think of the time, the happy time, Its memories fond recall When in the bloom of your youthful prime We\u2019ve kept upon the ball Kick off, throw in, have a little scrimmage, Keep it low, a splendid rush, bravo, win or die; On the ball, City, never mind the danger, Steady on, now\u2019s your chance, Hurrah! We\u2019ve scored a goal. Let all tonight then drink with me, To the football game we love And wish it may successful be As other games of old, And in one grand united toast Join player, game and song And fondly pledge your pride and toast Success to the City club.             4) Various: celebrating being on the road to nowhere As noted by the Norwich fans above, the leitmotif of most chants involves one-upmanship. Oft-times opposition supporters shun tit-for-tat song duelling because they know they can\u2019t win. So a different retort is needed, a defusing one to which the only sensible response is a chuckle: \u201cwe lose every week, we lose every weee-eek, you\u2019re nothing special, we lose every week\u201d or the always diverting: \u201cLet\u2019s pretend we\u2019ve scored a goal \u2026 \u201d. And then there are the fans of teams who are so boringly mediocre that even gallows humour seems inappropriate \u2013 instead, unity in glorious nihilism is strength. Let\u2019s choose Barnsley as an example, although the following chant has also been belted out by fans of Sheffield United, Bristol Rovers and many others in recent years: \u201cWe\u2019re not going down, we\u2019re not going up, we\u2019re Barnsley FC, we don\u2019t give a fuck.\u201d PD            5) AFC Wimbledon: Where were you when you were us?  It was the draw everybody wanted and nobody wanted: MK Dons v AFC Wimbledon in the second round of the 2012 FA Cup. Founded in 2002 by Wimbledon supporters enraged by a proposal to rip their club away from them and relocate it to Milton Keynes, AFC Wimbledon were enjoying their second season as a Football League club when fate and the Football Association tombola conspired to pair them against their estranged former selves in an FA Cup tie.   Related: AFC Wimbledon fans find FA Cup tie at MK Dons too hard to stomach | David Conn    Far from viewing it as an excellent opportunity to bloody the nose of a club they refer to as Franchise FC, many AFC Wimbledon fans were appalled when news of the fixture broke. Two members of the Football Association-appointed panel that sanctioned the grab and relocation of their former club had infamously warned Wimbledon fans that \u201cresurrecting the club from it\u2019s ashes\u201d and renaming it was \u201cnot in the best interests of football\u201d, but they had gone ahead and done it anyway, earning many plaudits as they played their way from the Combined Counties League to the Football League in under a decade. Now these were confronted by the prospect of having to muddy their spats on a visit to the ground of a club most held in contempt and whose existence many of them refuse to acknowledge. Plenty of tension surrounded a game that was always likely to struggle to match the hype surrounding it, but it passed off fairly peacefully. Unable to contain themselves, a crowd of AFC Wimbledon did pour on to the pitch when Jack Midson cancelled out Stephen Gleeson\u2019s excellent opener for the League One side. On a day when AFC Wimbledon fans had clubbed together to pay for a plane to fly over Stadium MK trailing a banner reading: \u201cWe are Wimbledon\u201d, the visiting supporters were left desolated by Jon Otsemobor\u2019s late, late winner but did provide one moment of high comedy. Surveying the home fans who had turned up to support the club that had been stolen from them, they struck up a decidedly existentialist chant of, \u201cWhere were you when you were us?\u201d BG            6) Various: Seven Nation Army In 2001, while sound-checking prior to a White Stripes gig in Melbourne, Jack White stumbled across a seven-note guitar riff he liked the sound of and enhanced by playing it through an effects pedal to give it a growling bass feel. \u201cI thought if I ever got asked to write the next James Bond theme, that would be the riff for it,\u201d he would later reveal. When no invitation from Eon Productions was forthcoming, White\u2019s simple composition provided the foundation for the White Stripes\u2019 2003 single Seven Nation Army, which became seared on the consciousness of a wider sporting public as it was played in sports venues all over the world. Depending on your point of view, it eventually reached its pinnacle or nadir by becoming the official Uefa-approved goal music for Euro 2012. So how exactly did the music from a song about one angry young man\u2019s sense of isolation become so ubiquitous a tribute to triumph?   Related: Seven Nation Army: the indiest football anthem ever?    The supporters of Club Brugge and Roma seem to have a fair claim to being responsible. In a Milan bar before a Champions League game, supporters of the Belgian side heard Seven Nation Army and enjoyed the signature riff as much as its composer had two years previously. Roaring along in lager-fuelled accompaniment, they brought it along with them to San Siro, before exporting it back to Bruges in the wake of their surprise 1-0 win. It quickly became a staple standard at the Jan Breydel Stadium, where it was soon introduced as the club\u2019s goal music. The following year, Brugge hosted Roma in the Uefa Cup. Impressed by their hosts\u2019 use of Seven Nation Army, Roma fans adopted it themselves. Their club\u2019s captain was also smitten. \u201cI had never heard the song before we stepped on the field in Brussels,\u201d Francesco Totti later told Dutch newspaper Het Nieuwsblad. \u201cIt sounded fantastic and the crowd was totally into it. I quickly went out and bought one of the band\u2019s albums.\u201d Praise indeed. Having been embraced by various Serie A terraces, Seven Nation Army became the Italian side\u2019s unofficial anthem at World Cup 2006 and at a Rolling Stones gig in Milan that July, Alessandro del Piero and Marco Materazzi were invited on stage and led an audience singalong. The chant quickly went viral, the riff behind it becoming a staple at all kinds of arenas in various continents, where it was occasionally adapted to pay homage to particular players whose names contained the requisite number of syllables. Then Uefa gave it their seal of approval, the football equivalent of that time David Cameron announced he likes The Smiths. Thanks Uefa. And Jack White\u2019s take on this cultural phenomenon? \u201cNothing is more beautiful than when people embrace a melody and allow it to enter the pantheon of folk music,\u201d he said. \u201cAs a songwriter it is something impossible to plan. Especially in modern times.\u201d In short: it\u2019s not \u2018The Referee\u2019s A Wanker\u2019 but it pays the rent. BG",
