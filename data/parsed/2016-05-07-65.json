  "body": "Aitor Karanka\u2019s Middlesbrough claimed a \u00a3170m prize as they drew 1-1 with Brighton at an initially tense, ultimately overjoyed, Riverside Stadium to secure automatic promotion to the Premier League. Although the teams finished level on points, Boro\u2019s superior goal difference was enough to push Brighton into the play-offs leaving the Teesside club to enjoy the riches stemming from next season\u2019s gargantuan top-tier television deal. It is only two months since Karanka was briefly placed on gardening leave and missed a defeat at Charlton following a fallout with his players but a subsequent 10-game unbeaten run has vindicated the decision of Steve Gibson, Boro\u2019s owner and chairman, not to sack the Spaniard. \u201cI want to say thank you,\u201d said Karanka. \u201cThank you the chairman for giving me the opportunity here two and a half years ago. I want to give Steve Gibson a big hug. Thank you to the players, these players have been amazing. And to the crowd \u2013 this crowd deserves to be in the Premier League.\u201d Yet despite the numerous warm embraces that followed a joyous pitch invasion, lingering doubts remain about Karanka\u2019s future. He has made it clear he has no intention of moving elsewhere but one school of thought suggests Gibson could yet consider replacing him. \u201cI have a few more years here,\u201d said the manager. \u201cI have three more years on my contract.\u201d   Related: Middlesbrough promoted to Premier League after 1-1 draw with Brighton    Asked if he might resign, Karanka replied: \u201cToday, thinking how difficult it has been to get promotion, I can say no. There are just 20 privileged managers who can be in the Premier League. I am going to be one of them after just two and a half years of experience, and that is amazing. I would like to go to my bed and cry for 24 hours in a row because I can\u2019t explain the emotions I have inside.\u201d Boro\u2019s Cristhian Stuani opened the scoring but Dale Stephens equalised three minutes before being sent off for a foul on Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez which saw the Uruguayan stretchered off. Hughton was particularly incensed that referee Mike Dean appeared ready to show Stephens a yellow card before his assistants intervened. \u201cI thought I had a good view and I thought it was nowhere near a red card,\u201d he said. \u201cI know at the time the referee pulled out a yellow card but he was persuaded by his officials that it was worth more than that, despite them being 35 to 40 yards away.\u201d Karanka demurred, maintaining it was a red-card challenge but revealed that, despite a nasty gash to a shin, Ram\u00edrez would be \u201cfit enough to celebrate\u201d. Hughton meanwhile was left with \u201cpride\u201d in his players\u2019s performance. \u201cIt\u2019s a distraught changing room,\u201d he said as he began preparing for a play-off semi-final against Sheffield Wednesday. \u201cBut the good news is we\u2019re still in there.\u201d",
