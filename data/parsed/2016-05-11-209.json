  "body": "Under different circumstances, Donald Trump might consider it an example of American capitalism: finding a new market for a neglected asset. The presumptive Republican nominee for president, however, is not likely to appreciate the art of a deal which lets US citizens \u201cshare\u201d their vote with undocumented migrants. The pilot project, known as Vote Allies, is a pioneering initiative to pair voters with disenfranchised people, matching electoral haves with electoral have-nots. \u201cWe see this as a form of social debt. This project is about understanding that people want to do the right thing, and facilitating them to do the right thing,\u201d said Brett Shears, who cofounded Vote Allies. To opponents it is an affront to the founding fathers. \u201cIt cheapens the whole process of participative democracy,\u201d said Ira Mehlman, a spokesman for Federation of American Immigration Reform. \u201cThe US, at least in theory, is a nation governed by the citizens of the US. Most Americans take that responsibility seriously and cherish it.\u201d The Los Angeles-based initiative will debut in California\u2019s 7 June primary, a contest expected to confirm Trump as the GOP nominee in an election riled by debate over immigration and national identity. The author of The Art of the Deal has vowed, if elected, to seal the country\u2019s southern border and deport an estimated 11 million undocumented migrants. Vote Allies is the antithesis of such rhetoric, arguing migrants should not only stay but also have a say over who rules the nation \u2013 right now.      Brett Shears, cofounder of Vote Allies. Photograph: Dan Tuffs for the Guardian    The notion has a touch of magical realism, given Washington\u2019s political gridlock. The Democratic candidates, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, have promised a law offering a \u201cpathway to citizenship\u201d, which is likely to be a slow, demanding process which could take years, if not decades. Yet Vote Ally is about to give two dozen undocumented migrants and felons \u2013 another disenfranchised category \u2013 a chance to vote in California. Sort of. Each will be paired with a voter who will hear their concerns and, in theory, reflect them when they cast a ballot. \u201cThe community of LA is made up of a lot of people who are disenfranchised,\u201d said Shears, 32, who works for LA city\u2019s elections\u2019 division. \u201cI was thinking: how do we get those people and bring their voices into the process?\u201d LA\u2019s school boards and neighbourhood councils allow non-citizens to participate, he reasoned, so why not also county, state and federal government? \u201cPlus, it would give non-citizens an incentive to think about naturalisation. This project could be a gateway. We\u2019re talking about people who want to be here. All these people say they\u2019re American,\u201d said Shears. The goal was for voters and non-voters \u2013 paired partly according to geographic proximity \u2013 to have conversations and agree on voting preferences. \u201cVoting is a private act, but we\u2019re living in a world where people speak openly their preferences.\u201d  Several dozen people \u2013 voters and non-voters - have signed up and are in the process of being paired for the 7 June primary. Ev Boyle, 32, a teacher at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism, expects to share his vote with a voteless Latina woman who has joined the program. Widespread disenfranchisement combined with low turnout rates \u2013 more than 90% of eligible voters sat out LA\u2019s 2015 municipal election \u2013 prompted him to sign up, said Boyle.  \u201cThe idea of connecting these two groups in a one-on-one way was very powerful. It forced me to look at the power and privilege of voting. It\u2019s too easy to think voting doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Boyle leans left but he would roll with it if the woman turned out to favour Republicans, he said. \u201cFine. The whole point is to have a conversation.\u201d In a few cases, the paired voters already know each other. That is the case for Maria Lopez Zamudio, 18, and her boyfriend, Sean Lucas, 18.  Lopez\u2019s family crossed the border illegally from Mexico and settled in LA when she was three. \u201cI understand that I can\u2019t vote because I wasn\u2019t born here, but I did grow up here. It\u2019s all I\u2019ve known,\u201d said Lopez, a freshman at Santa Monica College.  Undocumented Latinos work hard and pay taxes but have no say over laws that impact them, she said. \u201cAlthough we do a lot for this country, we don\u2019t have a voice. We don\u2019t have representation. When you have a vote, you know someone is listening to you. Without a vote, you have to protest to make people listen.\u201d She signed up to Vote Allies and persuaded the LA-born Lucas to do so too. \u201cThis project allows me to have a voice and to be more informed. And it gives me an opportunity with my boyfriend, who does have a vote, to bond and grow together.\u201d      Ev Boyle: \u2018It\u2019s too easy to think voting doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019 Photograph: Dan Tuffs for the Guardian    Lucas, who studies exercise science, said he might not have voted in the coming primary without prodding from his girlfriend. \u201cBefore, I didn\u2019t dwell too much on politics,\u201d he said, seated beside Lopez.  Of Mexican and Irish heritage, Lucas also found motivation in Trump\u2019s rise \u2013 as have many other Latinos who have registered to vote. \u201cTrump has (tilted) my vote away from Republicans in general, at least in this election. I\u2019m leaning Democratic.\u201d Lopez feels the Bern, so if she has her way, Lucas will vote for Sanders. First, though, he must register. \u201cI\u2019ve sent you the link,\u201d Lopez reminded him.  Lucas nodded. \u201cI know, I know. I\u2019m on it.\u201d Vote Allies is also reaching out to felons such as Troy Williams, 49. A former violent gang member who served 18 years in San Quentin, he was released in October 2014 and is now a film-maker, but he cannot vote in this election.  \u201cI committed a crime and I was sentenced to time in prison ... but not to be disenfranchised from the country in which I was born. I don\u2019t have a voice. I don\u2019t feel I\u2019m part of America without a voice,\u201d he said. Williams helped organise a mock vote in San Quentin for the 2008 general election \u2013 turnout and results closely reflected the rest of the US, he said. Denying felons the vote was unfair and, given the disproportionate number of African Americans behind bars, racially tinged, said Williams. \u201cNo valid reason has been given for someone not to vote in the American process just because they committed a crime. I don\u2019t see what one has to do with the other.\u201d Virginia\u2019s governor, Terry McAuliffe, recently paved the way for more than 200,000 convicted felons who have served their time to be eligible to vote, an executive order he dubbed historic. Republicans denounced it as an abuse of power which enfranchised murderers and rapists in an attempt to tilt the state Democratic. Mehlman, of the Federation of American Immigration Reform, objected to the principle of vote sharing but did not fear dramatic consequences. \u201cPeople who are inclined to give their vote to an illegal alien are likely to vote the same way as an illegal alien. So it won\u2019t make any real difference in how votes are cast.\u201d",
