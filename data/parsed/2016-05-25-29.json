  "body": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s appointment as Manchester United manager is being held up by Chelsea\u2019s ownership of the rights to his name and image, with the west London club thought to be seeking a sizeable payment for their release.   Related: Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and Pep Guardiola get set for a new El Crassico | Marina Hyde    Chelsea stand to earn a seven-figure sum from the manager they sacked in December even as he takes over at one of their major rivals. Ed Woodward, United\u2019s executive vice-chairman, was locked in negotiations until late on Wednesday night with Jorge Mendes, Mourinho\u2019s agent, and Chelsea, along with lawyers for the three parties. It is understood Chelsea bought the rights to Mourinho\u2019s name and image in 2005, a year into the first of his two tenures at Stamford Bridge. Despite being sacked to end his second spell in charge of Chelsea, the club continue to sell an array of products bearing his name and image, including mugs, phone cases and posters. Given Mourinho\u2019s global profile, Chelsea can be expected to still earn considerable money from those rights. There is no suggestion from United this could prevent Mourinho becoming Louis van Gaal\u2019s successor. But Woodward is intent on acquiring the rights, or failing that may consider leveraging them by paying a licence fee to Chelsea, since they will provide lucrative income. The issue is expected to be resolved and Mourinho should sign a three-year deal with United worth in excess of the \u00a37.5m he earned annually while at Stamford Bridge.

While it is not known how senior a role this is, Scholes, a close friend, said: \u201cI think it\u2019s important that there\u2019s some form of continuity. Hopefully he\u2019ll still be at the club, hopefully still working with the first team. He knows the club inside out, he\u2019s been there for nearly 30 years now.\u201d           Jos\u00e9 Mourinho: how would the Special One fare at Manchester United?    Mourinho could have to face a public employment tribunal next month if the case with Chelsea\u2019s former first-team doctor, Eva Carneiro, is not settled by then. Carneiro is claiming constructive dismissal against Chelsea and has a separate personal legal action against Mourinho. The case is set to be heard at the Croydon Employment Tribunal some time during the period of 6 to 24 June, the hearing to be no longer than 10 days. Carneiro and the Chelsea physiotherapist, Jon Fearn, were criticised by Mourinho following the draw with Swansea City on last season\u2019s opening day, each going on to the pitch to help Eden Hazard. Carneiro left the club but Fearn has since returned to first-team duties.",
