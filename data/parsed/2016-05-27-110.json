  "body": "I am a 32-year-old man. My girlfriend of two years is older and wants children, but says she needs me to grow up before this could happen. We argue often, always centred around my selfishness and my uncommunicative attitude. I worry that I won\u2019t mature at all, or it will be too late before I realise that I\u2019ve messed it up. What should I do? I think it is wise of you to consider your maturity if you want to be in a committed relationship. Otherwise, as you say, there is a strong likelihood that you will lose your girlfriend. But I would also encourage you to see the personal benefits of maturing for yourself. Increased self-esteem, self-awareness and perspective will help you to grow, as well as to be intimate with your partner. You will gain so much life knowledge and wisdom along the way. While growing up can be challenging, especially for those of us who were neglected as children, it not only benefits us, but all those whose lives we touch. If you do decide to pull up your bootstraps, I can almost guarantee that it won\u2019t always feel good, and it won\u2019t be easy. But you can look forward to a deep sense of connection with yourself, your friends and your partner, making it all worthwhile.   Related: Ask Alanis: why does my nephew talk about an imaginary sister?    There are many resources out there to help you. I can recommend Pia Mellody\u2019s book Facing Codependence, and Richard Schwartz\u2019s You Are The One You\u2019ve Been Waiting For. Dr Sue Johnson\u2019s books on emotionally focused couples therapy and Harville Hendrix\u2019s imago therapy are also helpful. Having done this work with my husband (and it has not always been easy) I can\u2019t extoll enough the benefits of having committed to growing up, together.  Both marriage and becoming a parent have their way of growing us up. It is just about whether we kick and scream through the process (or, ultimately, run from it), or submit to it willingly and with a relatively open mind. The choice is yours, and yours alone. Without a deep personal commitment to growing and healing (alone and together with your partner), it is simply not possible to achieve a functional relationship.  It is admirable that you are taking the time to consider these issues now, and it indicates that you are willing to change. Sadly, not everyone is up for this transformation. My life is riddled with ex-partners who were never ready for this commitment, for various reasons. But for those who are willing to try, great gifts await. \u2022 Alanis Morissette\u2019s podcast is available on iTunes and at alanis.com.
