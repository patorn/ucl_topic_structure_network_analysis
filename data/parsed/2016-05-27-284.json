  "body": "At a time when media consumption is shifting online, who in their right mind launches a 64-page print magazine costing more than your average paperback? And, having launched it, who eschews celebrities and glamour for stories about the Green Man and Gerald of Wales?  An entrepreneur from Hay-on-Wye, that\u2019s who. The Keep magazine, which hits the shelves this week, is the brainchild of James Mannox, a former London-based branding consultant who recently moved to the quirky Welsh border town with his young family. \u201cWe didn\u2019t start with a specific aesthetic or editorial line in mind,\u201d says Mannox, who regularly visited the area when he was growing up. \u201cAll we\u2019re trying to do is capture the town\u2019s sense of place, especially its reputation for being independently minded and slightly anti-establishment.\u201d The town\u2019s reputation for charting its own course dates back four decades to 1 April (April Fools\u2019 Day) 1977, when Richard Booth, a theatrical second-hand bookseller, pronounced Hay [as the town is known locally] as an independent sovereign state. To drum up media interest, he self-proclaimed himself king and started issuing passports and rice-paper money.      Interior of Richard Booth\u2019s second hand bookshop. Photograph: Alamy    The strategy worked. Within a few years, Hay grew into a mecca for bibliophile tourists who began flocking to the UK\u2019s so-called \u2018Town of Books\u2019 in their droves. Then came the town\u2019s eponymous annual literary festival, which kicks off this weekend. The book-loving jamboree tends to attract at least 150,000 visitors over a ten-day period. Not bad for a town of roughly 2,000 inhabitants (and one town crier).  Now a new generation of small businesses is looking to connect with the quirky, off-beat image with which Hay is now associated. Along with The Keep (which is set up as a Community Interest Company), the short but busy high-street boasts a new specialist stationers, a boutique lingerie store, two taxidermy shops and one of the UK\u2019s only design-led fair-trade retailers.       \u201cThe book industry and festival industry are all about ideas ultimately, right. Many of the small businesses in town really buy into that. If there\u2019s a conventional way of doing things or a more exciting way, they will typically opt for the second,\u201d says Andrew Williams, chair of the Hay Chamber of Commerce. One of the most successful examples of tapping into Hay\u2019s idiosyncratic town brand comes from Richard Booth\u2019s Bookshop. Once the nerve centre of Richard Booth\u2019s bookshop empire, the iconic store was purchased in 2011 by US businesswoman Elizabeth Haycox and her husband Paul Greatbatch, who moved to Hay after visiting the festival.  Under Haycox\u2019s stewardship, the once charming but mildly chaotic bookstore has undergone a substantial revamp. There\u2019s now a new sun-lit caf\u00e9 at the back, a cute cinema, and \u2013 shock, horror \u2013 new titles mixed among the old. The store also hosts regular book launches, community events and classical music recitals.  \u201cI was attracted to Hay because there are people here of all different points of view [\u2026] You don\u2019t need an MBA to set up a business here. Things happen much more organically; it\u2019s much more creative,\u201d says Haycox.  The ability of local entrepreneurs to connect with this idea of \u2018business-as-unusual\u2019 serves to cement the town\u2019s spirit of difference and dynamism ever more firmly. But, on the downside, so much creativity and independence makes it tricky to persuade business owners to work collectively.  Haycox is openly skeptical about the benefits of co-operation. Ensuring a healthy competition between local businesses helps drive innovation, she argues. There\u2019s something in that. One big bookshop \u2013 however beautiful and bountifully\u2013stocked \u2013 doesn\u2019t compare with two-dozen or so separate shops specialising in everything from poetry and maps to children\u2019s books and crime.  Anne Brichto, who co-owns three bookshops in Hay, including Addyman Books and Murder & Mayhem, agrees to an extent: \u201cIt\u2019s like Oxford Street: you need more than one clothes shop to attract crowds. Hay only works because there\u2019s so many of us.\u201d      Book shelves line a lane in front of book shops in Hay-on-Wye.

To that end, she co-ordinates the publication of the town\u2019s bookshop map along with the Hay Tourist Information Centre. Over recent months, she\u2019s also become a keen Instagram user too. \u201cWe\u2019re finding that young people really connect with images of real books and old books in particular, especially leather bindings, the classic Penguin and decorative cloth,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s totally different from buying online. \u2018Make the place magic and the books choose you,\u2019 is what I say.\u201d  Williams at the Hay Chamber of Commerce (and also co-owner of the fair trade store, Eighteen Rabbit) sees value in shared marketing too. Last year, he helped initiate a voucher scheme as a way of encouraging people to spend locally. The vouchers are accepted in almost all the 70 or so shops around town. Williams hopes the initiative might be the first step towards a local currency scheme such as the Bristol or Brixton pound.   All eyes are now on 2017, Hay\u2019s 40th anniversary of independence. The town\u2019s small business owners are already cooking up ideas about how to maximize the opportunity. A royal barge is one idea. A garden party in the town\u2019s soon-to-be-renovated castle is another. Whatever they opt for, Williams hopes it will be \u201coptimistic, a bit eccentric, and greater than the sum of its parts\u201d. At least the date is decided: April Fools\u2019 Day. Oliver Balch is author of Under The Tump: Sketches of Real Life in the Welsh Borders. He will be speaking at Hay Festival on 1 June, 8:30pm.
