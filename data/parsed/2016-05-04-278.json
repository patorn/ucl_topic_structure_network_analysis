  "body": "In the original California gold rush, thousands of prospectors scoured the San Gabriel mountains for nuggets, a scramble marked by rivalry and secrecy: see a gleam, keep shtum. Two centuries later, a handful of descendants use similar equipment to pan in the same crystal cold river, surrounded by the same wilderness, lured by an additional, different type of glitter: celebrity. Instead of concealing pay-dirt spots, these prospectors broadcast them on YouTube, giving locations and encouraging viewers to trek out and join them.  In return, if they draw enough online traffic, they gain a slice of fame and modest payments from Google, which owns YouTube, for eyeballs on ads. \u201cSince I started doing the videos, it got kind of addictive,\u201d said Robert Ferguson, 52, whose channel has more than 1,700 subscribers and 384,0000 views. \u201cThere\u2019s a little bit of stardom. People recognise me. It\u2019s not much, but Google pays me.\u201d  Ferguson, wearing a singlet, muddy shorts and boots, spoke during a break from sifting rocks and gravel by the San Gabriel river. Three other prospectors worked alongside him. All, it turned out, had first encountered each other via YouTube.  The video-sharing website has become a noticeboard for an eclectic community of prospectors to share information, show off skill or luck, cultivate online followers, and nurture dreams of fame, with one particular motherlode: starring in a reality TV show. \u201cI\u2019m terrible at video. My wife says I\u2019m the worst in the world,\u201d said Larry Englehart, 67, ankle-deep in burbling water. \u201cInstead of a nugget, I show a guy\u2019s bellybutton. But people must be bored, because they look at them.\u201d The retired industrial painter\u2019s channel has acquired 822 subscribers and 171,000 page views.

Few, if any, prospectors expect to get rich. Nuggets seem long gone from this part of the river. A day\u2019s arduous digging and panning for gold dust typically yields about half a gramme (worth $20), though with luck you could get maybe 5 grammes (worth $200), or with no luck, nothing.     Robert Ferguson in the river, prospecting for gold. Photograph: Noah Smith for the Guardian    The possibility of internet stardom, or just recognition, spurs relatively new arrivals such as Ryan Reynolds, 28. He recorded a brief piece to his camera phone \u2013 \u201cHey, the Guardian is here, hopefully they\u2019ll make us sound nice and not like total losers\u201d \u2013 before climbing into a waist-deep hole to heave a boulder.  Having only just started, Reynolds has only 98 subscribers. But he tasted fame when a stranger approached him at a gold convention. \u201cHe said, \u2018I know you \u2013 you\u2019re Odd Ryan.\u2019 I was blown away.\u201d Reynolds, whose day job is washing dogs at a pet salon, uses the moniker Odd Ryan on his YouTube channel to avoid being confused with the famous Canadian actor. Also in the hole was his partner, Brandon Preciado, 35. A DJ at a Hollywood nightclub and an ultrasound technician, he \u201ccaught gold fever\u201d after watching YouTube videos and reality shows such as Yukon Gold.  When Ferguson and Englehart turned up to dig nearby, mutual admiration flowed, as is prospector etiquette.  \u201cI\u2019ve seen all your work,\u201d Reynolds told Englehart. \u201cGreat to meet you.\u201d Englehart batted the words away with self-deprecation but glowed. Ferguson praised Preciado, saying he had seen a video of him nimbly moving heavy rocks. Preciado almost blushed. \u201cAll I do is copy Savage, man.\u201d Savage is the nickname of another miner.  At first sight, social media seems far removed from the scene at East Fork, a trail in the San Gabriel Mountains national monument, an idyll of wooded canyons an hour\u2019s drive east from Los Angeles.  There is no cellphone coverage, and there are no sounds except birds, insects, wind and the occasional whack of metal on rock. The spot is home to mountain lions, eagles, rattlesnakes, bears \u2013 including a patriarch named Baxter \u2013 and a wild turkey named Gobbles. The prospectors, dressed in ragged jeans and shorts, work much as their predecessors did during the 1840s gold rush: shovel and sieve soil into buckets, transfer it into sluice boxes and let river water run through it, leaving behind, they hope, gold traces. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing like the thrill of finding a piece of treasure. And that\u2019s what we are, treasure hunters,\u201d said Nick McKinney, 35, a former oil rig worker who goes by \u201cWyoming Nick\u201d. The mountains are said to whistle from all the holes and shafts, legacy of gold hunting by Native Americans, Spanish settlers and then the \u201c49ers\u201d, Americans and newly arrived immigrants from Europe, Asia and Latin America who flocked here, and to other parts of California, on wagons, mules and foot.     Gold flake in a pan. Photograph: Noah Smith for the Guardian    \u201cMy folks think I\u2019m nuts. They say there\u2019s no gold left, that the old-timers got it all. But they didn\u2019t. There\u2019s plenty left,\u201d said Preciado, who goes by DJ Foulmouth. There are legends of hidden veins and buried, forgotten fist-sized nuggets, but the reality is pay dirt is so meagre it often does not cover the cost of gas. The yo-yo global gold price \u2013 currently $1,245 an ounce, relatively high, taking the long view \u2013 seems an abstraction. For prospectors, the exertion and frontier feel of the mountains \u2013 notwithstanding hordes of bungee-jumpers who trek through at weekends \u2013 is its own reward. \u201cIt sounds weird, digging a hole by the river. But I\u2019m a nature person,\u201d said Reynolds, who finds respite from his minimum wage job bathing pampered pets. \u201cBeing bit sucks. And dealing with rich people \u2013 I can\u2019t stand them.\u201d    Hiking here, panning for gold, you forget all your problems  Larry Englehart     Ferguson, who is unemployed and cares for a brother with a neurodegenerative disease, echoed the sense of escape. \u201cBeing a caregiver, you get depressed if that\u2019s all you do. You need a place to go. This is my place.\u201d For Englehart, hunting gold represented resurrection. Diagnosed with hepatitis C in 2002, he was \u201csent home to die\u201d but ended up surviving extremely aggressive chemotherapy. After discovering Ferguson\u2019s videos, he started trekking to San Gabriel. \u201cI was a lump of jelly with not one muscle left in my body. Hiking here, panning for gold, you forget all your problems.\u201d Environmentalists say digging holes and making dams make problems for threatened species like the Santa Ana Sucker and other wildlife. And that mining is illegal in a federally designated wilderness. The miners deny causing damage and claim the law is unclear. It\u2019s not: mining is illegal, but authorities tend to turn a blind eye.  Lies, robbery and murder marked the original gold rush. Perhaps because the stakes are much lower, its 21st century sequel feels like a support group, with members teaming up and pooling information. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a brotherhood. Everyone helps each other out all the time,\u201d said Reynolds. Englehart agreed. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any secrets up here.\u201d The exception is further upriver where hardy prospectors trek deep into remote areas where there is more gold, and more reason to keep quiet.  Ferguson, who makes a few dozen dollars per month from YouTube, said advertising a hole he was working on was not necessarily altruistic. \u201cSometimes I want people to come out there and dig deeper so that when I go back I\u2019ll get more gold.\u201d Reality TV producers have reached out to him but he is still awaiting an offer.  His advice to would-be YouTube prospectors: \u201cBe real, don\u2019t lie, be yourself. Try to show snakes, flowers, wildlife.\u201d California, said Ferguson, polishing his pitch, was the obvious location for a mining show. \u201cIt\u2019s the golden state.\u201d",
