  "body": "Our selection of \u201cFive of the best back-to-nature cottages and campsites in Wales\u201d (Travel, last week, page 45) said confusingly that Fox and Hounds Cottage, Monmouthshire, \u201csits between the Wye valley and the Forest of Dean\u201d. The river Wye marks the western edge of the forest and of Gloucestershire, within which the forest is entirely situated; we meant between the Wye valley and the Brecon Beacons. Usage corner: \u201c\u2026 whenever I hove into view\u2026\u201d (Comment, last week, page 34). Our style guide says: \u201chove \u2013 past tense and past participle of heave used in a nautical context, literally or metaphorically (they hove into view, hove up the anchor and hove alongside); so do not write, for example, \u201cWoods and Mickelson had only to hove into view\u201d (should be heave) or \u201cSweeney Todd now hoves into view\u201d (should be heaves). In \u201cJamie, Nadiya and Instagrams big stars: who\u2019s who in the new list of food\u2019s top 50\u201d (News, 1 May, page 5) we neglected to mention that a list of 50 influential figures in food, which had originally appeared in the Grocer magazine, was compiled by the advertising agency Telegraph Hill.
