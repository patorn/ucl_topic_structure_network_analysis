  "body": "Labor plans to introduce a \u201cnational interest test\u201d for all energy companies that want to expand their export facilities to sell more of Australia\u2019s natural gas overseas. The shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, says local manufacturers are being crushed by the current regime because they\u2019re failing to secure reliable gas supplies at competitive prices, forcing many local businesses to close down while household prices are being pushed up. Labor would establish a domestic gas review board to consider whether any new gas export facility, or proposal to expand an existing one, would meet Australia\u2019s national interest, Bowen said. It would also require foreign companies to say how much gas they plan to make available for local manufacturers and households.   Related: Gas suppliers used market restructure to hike prices, watchdog says    But Bowen stopped short of calling for gas quotas to be introduced to force energy companies to sell an agreed amount of gas to local manufacturers.  \u201cNatural gas belongs to all Australians. We want to ensure it\u2019s extracted in the national interest,\u201d Bowen said. \u201cWe want to ensure that we don\u2019t face a situation in the future, as has been predicted, that more and more manufacturing facilities face closure, not only because of the price of gas but because they just can\u2019t get any gas.\u201d The proposed review board would operate in a similar way to the Foreign Investment Review Board, which considers the national benefit of foreign investment proposals. It would require energy companies to demonstrate how their newly expanded export facilities would boost Australia\u2019s exports and national income, increase the overall gas supply, and deliver a \u201cpredictable and affordable source of gas\u201d for local manufacturers. Bowen says other western countries already have a domestic gas national interest test, including the United States and Canada. It will cost $2.4m over four years to implement, he says. \u201cAfter nearly three years in government the Liberals have refused to recognise the impact soaring LNG exports are having on Australian businesses,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to protect local LNG exporters, local manufacturing businesses and households.\u201d Australia is the world\u2019s second-largest LNG exporter and is expected to become the world\u2019s largest LNG exporter by 2020. Prior to becoming a world leader in LNG exports, much of the gas produced up and down Australia\u2019s eastern seaboard was not linked to international markets and was instead used purely for domestic consumption, giving local manufacturers access to an affordable and predictable source of energy, helping them compete in the global marketplace.  Labor says the LNG export boom has put that gas supply at risk, and manufacturers are complaining they can\u2019t secure reliable supplies of gas anymore for long periods of time. Labor\u2019s new policy will go some way to placating demands from the Australian Workers\u2019 Union to reserve a proportion of Australia\u2019s gas for domestic use at affordable prices. The AWU\u2019s national secretary, Scott McDine, said the AWU has been leading the Reserve Our Gas campaign that has been pushing for the government to legislate and create the option to reserve natural gas for domestic use. \u201cAustralia finds itself the only developed nation on the planet which allows gas exporters to extract our gas and sell it to the highest international bidder without any restriction whatsoever,\u201d McDine said. \u201cAustralian households and industry are being forced to match the highest international prices for our own gas. Last month, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission found that gas suppliers on the east coast of Australia have used a market restructure to hike prices on domestic consumers, with evidence pipeline operators have set monopoly prices. It said the lack of competition in the local gas market even warranted consideration of whether joint marketing by one of the largest suppliers, the Gippsland Basin joint venture between Esso Australia and BHP Billiton Petroleum, had substantially lessened competition.",
