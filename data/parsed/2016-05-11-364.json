  "body": "Defending The Rhino: A Newsround Special5pm, CBBC Since 2008, poachers have been responsible for the deaths of almost 6,000 African rhinos. South Africa in particular has seen the number of killings skyrocket in recent years. Presenter Ayshah Tull looks at the dreadful effects of poaching, meeting the conservationists and campaigners fighting to stop the slaughter of this endangered species, as well as hearing sweetening stories of rhinos that somehow survived against the odds. David Stubbs Horizon: Curing Alzheimer\u2019s8pm, BBC2 The search for a cure for Alzheimer\u2019s grows ever more urgent as the population ages. This science documentary sketches the current state of our understanding and reveals some heartening, if tempered, optimism about potential ways forward. We meet people suffering from this cruel disease, as well as the researchers who are looking for the means to spare others. An absorbing film that\u2019s likely to promote equal parts amazement at human fortitude and awe at scientific enterprise. Andrew Mueller Nature\u2019s Epic Journeys9pm, BBC1 Liz Bonnin is your host in this three-part wildlife series following dramatic animal migrations. In tonight\u2019s opening episode, we\u2019re in northern Kenya for an annual gathering of elephants \u2013 a 21-day, long-distance excursion away from their usual stomping grounds \u2013 to eat and mate. Satellite tracking helps plot the movements of bull elephants such as the sizeable, testosterone-packed Matt; and also the cuter herd of young orphan elephants that are travelling in search of adoption. John Robinson Mary Beard\u2019s Ultimate Rome: Empire Without Limit9pm, BBC2 This week in Mary Beard\u2019s enthralling exploration of the history of the Roman empire, the classicist and historian travels to Algeria to look at how the Romans used an early incarnation of citizenship to expand their imperial conquest. Algeria boasts some of the most important and impressive Roman remains in the world as a result of the region\u2019s run-in with the empire. The empire put down roots, building cities such as Timgad in the Aur\u00e8s mountains, where Romans, Africans and Berbers lived side by side. Ben Arnold Killer Women With Piers Morgan9pm, ITV The US true-crime boom continues, and this latest dose of orange boiler-suited intrigue comes with added Piers Morgan. His customary blend of provocation and smarm doesn\u2019t feel like a particularly good fit for the material. Tonight\u2019s episode deals with Erin Caffey, who plotted the murder of her family at the age of 16. Morgan is on comparatively muted form, so even if his encounters don\u2019t elicit many revelations, at least he doesn\u2019t disgrace himself. Phil Harrison Cunk On Shakespeare10pm, BBC2 \u201cFour hundred years ago this year the world-famous playwrighter William Shakespeare stopped happening \u2026\u201d The Great Philomena (comedian Diane Morgan) brings all her wisdom and sensitivity to bear in her sublime exploration of the \u201cKing of the Bards\u201d, observing that Titus Andronicus is \u201ca posh Friday The 13th\u201d; pondering what Hamlet is all about (\u201cabout four hours long\u201d); and noting that Shakespeare had an easy time at school \u201cas he didn\u2019t have to study Shakespeare\u201d. Ali Catterall Sex Pod10pm, 5STAR Despite a title that makes it sound like an off-brand version of Channel 4\u2019s Sex Box, this new series seems more geared to sex education than public exhibitionism. With no copycat Perspex enclosures in sight, young audiences will put their most intimate quandaries to a panel of sexperts, in a format that sounds a bit like Embarrassing Bodies for the bedroom. But will it make for as bizarrely compelling viewing as Dr Christian\u2019s escapades? Hannah J Davies Film choice My Week With Marilyn (Simon Curtis, 2011) 10pm, BBC4 Based on Colin Clark\u2019s memoir about his (platonic) romance with Marilyn Monroe during the shooting of The Prince And The Showgirl in 1957, Curtis\u2019s evocative tale has a strong sense of time and place, and a superior cast, with Eddie Redmayne as a winning Clark, Kenneth Branagh grandstanding as co-star Laurence Olivier, and Michelle Williams a marvellous Marilyn. Paul Howlett The Kids Are All Right (Lisa Cholodenko, 2010) 1.30am, Channel 4 Annette Bening and Julianne Moore lead Cholodenko\u2019s sensitive, witty and moving film: they play Nic and Jules, whose 20-year relationship is tested when their children-by-artificial insemination \u2013 18-year-old Joni (Mia Wasikowska) and 14-year-old Laser (Josh Hutcherson) \u2013 seek out their father, the feckless, charming Paul (Mark Ruffalo) who unintentionally opens fault lines between the two women. A film of emotional power and subtlety.
