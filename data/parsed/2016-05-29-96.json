  "body": "1. Shorten goes negative in introduction, Turnbull accentuates the positive Bill Shorten attacked the government for having had \u201cthree economic plans in the last three months\u201d: one to increase the GST to 15%; one to allow states to levy income taxes; and the \u201c$50bn tax giveaway for large businesses in Australia\u201d in the 2016 budget.  Shorten called the tax cuts a \u201cvery expensive gamble\u201d because \u201cmuch of the money will go to overseas shareholders\u201d, and pointed out that $7bn of the tax cuts would go to the big four banks. Malcolm Turnbull was much more positive in his introduction \u2013 he saved criticism of Labor spending for his closing speech. He spoke about company tax cuts and Indigenous entrepreneurship.  Turnbull said government policies had created 39,000 more jobs for Indigenous Australians and were increasing the number of government contracts to Indigenous businesses 10-fold. 2. Panel struggles to get Turnbull to talk about himself The first question, from Laura Tingle of the Australian Financial Review, was about whether Turnbull had let down voters who thought he would move politics to the centre and now felt he had abandoned what he believed in.   Related: No winners on election debate night when answers were scripted and ideas untested    In response, Turnbull talked about his and his wife Lucy\u2019s record of creating businesses, and countered Shorten\u2019s points on company tax cuts. Tingle was blunt in the follow-up: \u201cI don\u2019t think it actually answered the question, prime minister.\u201d Moderator Chris Uhlmann also tried to give Turnbull a steer: \u201cI think the question is about yourself, prime minister.\u201d But Turnbull denied the premise of the question \u2013 that he had changed views or let voters down. \u201cThe question is about where I stand, and where I stand on climate change is where I have always stood,\u201d he said. The early exchange showed the panel was more easily ignored than a crowd of ordinary voters getting their shot at the leaders, as in the first debate. 3. Leaders trade \u201csame old Labor/Liberal\u201d barbs and won\u2019t commit to honour opponent\u2019s mandate Turnbull took aim at Labor for previously supporting company tax cuts but now opposing them. \u201cThey have no plan for economic growth and no plan for jobs. It\u2019s the same old Labor \u2013 just spending.\u201d Shorten shot back: \u201c[It\u2019s the] same old Liberals, just give tax cuts to the top end of town and let the rest of the people make do with not much at all. That\u2019s what I would say, Mr Turnbull.\u201d Call it the top hats versus hard hats election, voters have a distinct set of choices in this election and this exchange exemplified it. When Uhlmann asked if they would respect the mandate of their opponent if they lost, neither leader ruled out blocking their opponent\u2019s spending or savings in the Senate. Shorten rounded his answer out by promising Labor would provide cost forecasts for its policies over four and 10 years. \u201cOur principle is we will have more repairs to the budget bottom line than spends,\u201d he said. 4. Turnbull says people smugglers will use Labor victory to sell boat trips Speaking about the challenge of deterring asylum seeker boats, Turnbull said people smugglers looked to changes in the debate in Australia as a marketing opportunity.   Related: Australian election 2016: we will meet tougher targets on climate change, Turnbull says in leaders' debate    \u201cThey\u2019re out there marketing now, telling their customers that if Labor is elected it will be all on again. That\u2019s what they\u2019re saying,\u201d he said.  \u201cWe do no favours to anybody by being weak on border protection in the way Labor was. The truth is that Bill [Shorten] leads a party that is hopelessly divided on this issue.\u201d This provoked Shorten: \u201cShame on you, Mr Turnbull, for what you just said.\u201d But Turnbull was unrepentant, replying \u201cfor telling the truth\u201d. Shorten tried to turn the logic back on Turnbull, saying implying Labor was weak might give the green light to people smugglers. \u201cMr Turnbull is playing with fire when he says that somehow Labor would be a better deal, and he shouldn\u2019t say that, because he just conceded in his own remarks that the people smugglers are efficient and watching every bit of the debate.\u201d 5. Shorten more specific about the best way to reduce emissions Tingle asked whether the Coalition\u2019s Direct Action climate policy would become more like Labor\u2019s after a safeguards mechanism is introduced to prevent companies increasing their emissions. Turnbull committed to ensure that Australia would meet the target agreed to at last year\u2019s Paris climate talks and said \u201cwhen the global community agrees to higher targets, as I have no doubt it will, that we will meet them, too\u201d. But he would not be drawn on the safeguard mechanism and how the government would achieve reductions. Turnbull attacked Labor\u2019s proposal as \u201cunilateral action\u201d. Shorten had a few digs at Turnbull, saying he was implementing Tony Abbott\u2019s policies, but expressed hope for bipartisanship on the issue in future. \u201cThese are all real issues and I believe, I hope, this is the last election where we have the climate change wars and I know that if Labor is elected, hopefully then a Liberal opposition will learn to back in the science and deal away with the sceptics,\u201d he said. Shorten was also more specific about how to reduce emissions. He explained Labor\u2019s policy involved \u201ccutting pollution, and we do so through focusing on renewable energy, through our better vehicle emission standards, through revisiting the rate of land clearing through having an emissions trading scheme which is internationally linked\u201d.",
