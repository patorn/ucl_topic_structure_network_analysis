  "body": "Europe is the migrant crisis, the Greek crisis, the euro crisis. It is the CAP, Ecofin and Eurostat. It is Schengen suspended, anti-Europeans on the march, and the imminent threat of Brexit.   Related: Wanted: more jokes about an Englishman, Irishman and Scotsman    But it is also the Finns who snicker at overbearing Swedes (\u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between the Swedes and the Finns? The Swedes have got nice neighbours\u201d); and the Portuguese, who mock Spanish arrogance (\u201cIn a recent survey, 11 out of 10 Spaniards said they felt superior to the others\u201d). There are the Irish, who joke about buttoned-up Brits (\u201cWhat\u2019s the English definition of a thrill? Having an After Eight at 7.30\u201d); and the Poles, who have a go at the Germans for pretty much anything (\u201cGerman footballers are like German food: if they\u2019re not imported from Poland they\u2019re no good\u201d). Making fun of our best enemies, said Romain Seignovert, who has just published a book on the jokes Europeans tell about their neighbours, is a great European tradition. \u201cWe are a big, diverse community with a centuries-long common history of highs and lows, and our humour reflects that,\u201d he says.     After Eight mints: be a devil, have one before supper! Photograph: Alamy    De Qui Se Moque-t-On (Who do we make fun of?) features 345 jokes, many contributed by readers of Seignovert\u2019s blog, Europeisnotdead. A 29-year-old Frenchman who studied in Spain and Germany and now lives in Brussels, Seignovert said the jokes underlined the adage that \u201cteasing is a sign of affection. Some of them are pretty crude and unsubtle, but they\u2019re rarely downright nasty\u201d. Thus the Estonians laugh at the hopelessly shy Finns (\u201cHow do you tell an extrovert Finn? It\u2019s your shoes he\u2019s looking at, not his\u201d). The Macedonians giggle at the (lack of) machismo of Greek men: \u201cIf you knew how to cook and clean,\u201d says a Greek husband to his wife, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t need a maid.\u201d \u201cIf you knew how to make love,\u201d replies the wife, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t need a Macedonian lover.\u201d The only exception are the Italians, who rather endearingly make jokes mainly about themselves: \u201cYour wife cracked such a good joke the other day, I almost fell out of bed.\u201d \u201cNotice on an Italian bus: don\u2019t talk to the driver, he needs his hands.\u201d Otherwise, though, the Belgians love nothing better than teasing the penny-pinching Dutch: (\u201cHow do all Dutch recipes begin? Borrow six eggs, 200g of flour, half a litre of milk \u2026\u201d or \u201cWhy do the Dutch make so many jokes about the Belgians? Because they\u2019re cheap\u201d)  And pretty much all their neighbours finds the Belgians a tiny bit slow: \u201cWhy do Belgians have pommes frites, while the Arab world has oil? Because the Belgians got to choose first.\u201d And \u201cWhat do Belgian mothers do when the baby\u2019s bathwater is too hot? Put on a pair of gloves.\u201d There is a deeper point. Ultimately, Seignovert said, laughing at our neighbours is \u201crecognising, even celebrating, our particularities. It shows we\u2019re not indifferent. Europe isn\u2019t just political and economic, it\u2019s also cultural \u2013 about all these nations, living together. The EU hasn\u2019t made enough of that.\u201d That may be true. But Seignovert, remember, is French, so what he says should clearly not be taken too seriously. In the words of one particularly fine Belgian quip: \u201cHow does a Frenchman commit suicide? By shooting 15cm above his head, right in the middle of his superiority complex.\u201d Them and us: more cross-border barbs from Seignovert  Other Brits on the (tight-fisted) Scots: An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman are planning a party. \u201cI\u2019ll bring six pints of bitter,\u201d says the Englishman. \u201cI\u2019ll bring six pints of Guinness,\u201d says the Irishman. \u201cI\u2019ll bring six friends,\u201d says the Scot. The Belgians on the (parsimonious) Dutch: Dutch husband to Dutch wife: \u201cPut your coat on, dear.\u201d \u201cWhy, darling, are we going out?\u201d \u201cNo, I am. So I\u2019ll just turn the heating off.\u201d The Portuguese on the (supercilious) Spanish: \u201cDad,\u201d says a Spanish boy to his father, \u201cwhen I\u2019m grown up I want to be just like you.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s nice, son. Why?\u201d \u201cSo I can have a son like me!\u201d The Italians on themselves: Three reasons Jesus is an Italian: only an Italian son would live with his mama till he was 30. Only an Italian son could think his mama was still a virgin. Only an Italian mama could think her son was God. The Belgians on the (arrogant) French: Why did the French choose the cockerel as their national symbol? Because it\u2019s the only animal that sings when it\u2019s knee-deep in shit. The Swedes on the (dim-witted) Norwegians: Why do Norwegians have such greasy hair? They\u2019ve let their oil go to their heads. The Danes on the (overbearing) Swedes: What\u2019s the best ever thing to have come to us from Sweden? An empty ferry. The Estonians on the (hard-drinking) Finns: Two Finns meet up for the first time in years. \u201cSo how are you?\u201d asks Pekka. Ahti grunts and orders a beer. \u201cAnd how\u2019s the family?\u201d asks Pekka. Ahti grunts and orders another beer. \u201cAnd how\u2019s work?\u201d asks Pekka, three pints later. \u201cLook,\u201d says Ahti, \u201cdid we come here to drink, or to talk?\u201d The Germans on the (thieving) Poles: When is it Christmas in Poland? Two days after Christmas in Germany. The Swiss on the (not very bright) Austrians: Why is the Austrian flag red-white-red? So they don\u2019t get too confused when they hoist it. The Austrians on the (boring) Germans:  The main difference between Austrians and the Germans is that Germans would like to understand Austrians but can\u2019t, and Austrians understand Germans but would rather not. The Slovaks on the (despised) Czechs:  What does a Czech need to be happy? Not much, as long as everyone else has got less. The Romanians on the (mean-spirited) Hungarians: \u201cI\u2019ve had all the tests, and the doctor tells me there\u2019s no question, I\u2019m xenophobic. That\u2019s another bloody illness the Hungarians have given me.\u201d The Ukrainians on the (filthy rich but stupid) Russians: \u201cI\u2019ve just bought a tie for $3,000.\u201d \u201cIdiot! You could have bought the same one just down the street for $5,000.\u201d The Macedonians on the (corrupt) Greeks: A Greek motorist parks his car outside the parliament in Athens. \u201cYou can\u2019t park here,\u201d says the cop. \u201cThis is where our politicians work.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s OK,\u201d says the motorist. \u201cIt\u2019s fitted with an alarm.\u201d",
