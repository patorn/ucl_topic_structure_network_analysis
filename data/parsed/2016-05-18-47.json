  "body": "I\u2019m on the left and I want out of the European Union. Although Paul Mason made the same case in the Guardian this week, it is a rather lonely position to take these days. A generation ago that wasn\u2019t the case. In the 1980s \u201cGet Britain Out\u201d was up there with \u201cRefuse Cruise\u201d and \u201cCoal Not Dole\u201d as the good lefty\u2019s badges of choice, and leaving the EU was part of the Labour party\u2019s programme until 1988. I think that the EU poses a direct threat to democracy and to the British working class; I thought so then and I think so now.   Related: The leftwing case for Brexit (one day)    The trouble is that this means I am now on the same side of the argument as people I fundamentally disagree with, even on the subject of the EU itself. I have no problem debating with such people or sharing panels with them, but that does depend on showing a basic level of empathy and respect. And when it comes to Nigel Farage \u2013 I don\u2019t think he has it. I was asked to appear on the same panel as Farage at a debate organised by the Daily Mirror on whether we should stay or leave the EU. I realised that I might have some explaining to do when Mirror readers saw me on the same side as Farage, the Ukip leader, and the Tory MP Andrea Leadsom \u2013 while current and former Labour politicians Peter Mandelson, Ayesha Hazarika and John McDonnell were on the other, though McDonnell has had profound differences with Mandelson on defining subjects such as New Labour and the Iraq war. I expected all the issues to be examined in a free and lively debate but, perhaps naively, I was reckoning without Farage and the particular dynamic he brings to these occasions. He was civility personified before proceedings began, indeed, he was encouraging to some degree, recognising the challenges that face a non-politician like me on a highly charged political occasion. But once we were under way, his tone was different, as was his demeanour. He seemed less concerned about a debate in terms of an exchange of thoughts or ideas, and more concerned, consumed perhaps, with scoring points. No blow too low. \u201cYou wanted to rub our noses in diversity didn\u2019t you, Lord Mandelson,\u201d he said. The remainers were outraged and so, sitting right next to him, was I. You get a distinct and sinking feeling sat next to someone who wants to blame workers like your own parents for Britain\u2019s problems. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t we have people of different ethnic backgrounds, different colours?\u201d Mandelson shouted back at Farage, the two exchanging fire across me. \u201cYou\u2019ve shown your true colours and you owe her an apology,\u201d Mandelson added. Amid the hullabaloo, all the warnings from friends \u2013 who cautioned: \u201cDon\u2019t get into this issue, Dreda, you\u2019ll be fitted up by rightwingers\u201d \u2013 seemed right. I was also forced to take issue with Leadsom, my other fellow panellist, who spoke of public services being \u201coverwhelmed\u201d as a result of immigration. Some Brexiteers may choose to speak this way, but not in my\u00a0name.   Related: Labour Eurosceptics accuse Corbyn of reversing his position on EU referendum    When I suggested that the EU was actually a class issue, it was McDonnell, from the opposite camp, who picked up on the idea. I\u2019m fed up with hearing about what\u2019s good for big business and high-flying professionals; at street level, views are far more mixed. I don\u2019t know many kids from the estates who are excited about starting their own media company in Milan. McDonnell believes in a different kind of EU. I respect that position. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible. But at the same time, I was wondering if it was possible to swap chairs around so I could enjoy more congenial company. Farage and I didn\u2019t speak again, and after the event I stayed up late into the night responding to criticism from angry Ukippers. They accused me of being there just to embarrass Farage. That wasn\u2019t my intention. But I hope that\u2019s what transpired. I don\u2019t regret participating, and I\u2019ll be doing more debates, not least because I\u2019m unwilling to give the impression that women can\u2019t hack a little argy-bargy on a panel. I am also unwilling to cede the leave argument to rightwing Conservatives when there\u2019s a long and proud tradition of leftwing opposition to the EU. The arguments made by Tony Benn, Barbara Castle and Peter Shore a generation ago still stand as far as I\u2019m concerned. It\u2019s for other leftists to explain why they don\u2019t. And if not me, who like me? For often, when I\u2019m approached to appear on the media or at public events and have to decline, I am then asked: \u201cDo you know any other minority pundits who share your views?\u201d Or any who are working class, council-housed or comprehensive educated? Whether we leave or remain, the issue of diversity in public life \u2013 or the lack of it \u2013 will run and run.",
