  "body": "Dear Ms Morgan, On Wednesday, I sat with a child and my heart ached for her. It was SATs week and she was at her desk, brow furrowed, pencil in hand. She\u2019d written the numbers down several times but still they made no sense to her. It was the third day of this. The reading had been tough, arithmetic worse. And now this. I\u2019d been asked to administer \u2013 such a cold, clinical word \u2013 the test to the children who qualified for extra time: the statement children, the slow readers, those with special educational needs (SEN). As the minutes ticked by, I looked around the room and, unlike you, Ms Morgan, I didn\u2019t see representatives of data or progress \u2013 I saw children.    Related: Nicky Morgan accused of creating chaotic mess despite academies U-turn    I saw a girl who recently joined the British schooling system after moving from overseas. Behind her, a boy so painfully autistic, it\u2019s a miracle he makes it to school each day. And finally I saw the last boy in the row. A boy who, as I write, is undergoing aggressive chemotherapy for advanced leukaemia. He\u2019s lucky to be alive but he\u2019s tired, Ms Morgan. In fact, he\u2019s beyond tired. He\u2019s exhausted just from getting up in the morning. Each day is a battle for him: drugs, drips and side effects, which even without going to school, are enough to draw the life out of anyone.  He\u2019s missed two years of school, his attendance is sporadic and he doesn\u2019t always focus. But still, he spends his days learning about the subjunctive form, short multiplication and how to make better verb choices. All that on top of a cocktail of pills, multiple trips to hospital and the knowledge that the friends he made when he was first diagnosed are all slowly dying.  Yet still he tries, with all the energy he has left, to tick the right boxes. To be what he\u2019s supposed to be. But some things, even for the strongest of people, are just out of reach. So there I sat, looking around my room and suddenly, I too felt sick and exhausted, Ms Morgan. This week I have watched children cry; I have seen eager anticipation fade into confusion then embarrassment and finally shame. I looked on as children put their heads on their desks and, at 11-years-old, feel that they\u2019re just not quite good enough. That no matter how hard they try, no matter how hard they listen, they will never quite be good enough.

These children all attend a mainstream school and I\u2019m sure there are many others just like them all over the country. But that means nothing. In your data-driven eyes they are the same as their peers; they\u2019re expected to attain, function, perform and understand the same as their peers. But they don\u2019t, because \u2013 and this may be a revelation to you \u2013 children are all different. And that\u2019s when the anger came. I wanted to tell them to close their test papers and that it doesn\u2019t matter how many jars full of jam were made for the school fair. I wanted to march the children to Whitehall and for you to look them in the eye and tell them that despite all they have gone through, despite the living hell they face every day \u2013 the kind of hell that would bring most adults to their knees \u2013 that they still aren\u2019t good enough for you and your chums in parliament. But I couldn\u2019t. So the clock ticked on. The extra time supposed to help give these children a fighting chance had become nothing but a tool with which to prolong their agony. And now, as I write this, Ms Morgan, I\u2019m ashamed. Like my students, I went home and cried too \u2013 this time because of the shame I feel through supporting your regime. I didn\u2019t enter this profession to do this. I entered it to spark excitement; to share my love for learning and to give children the confidence to think big. What happened to catching mini-beasts? What happened to walking in rivers? What happened to getting messy? To painting pictures? To rolling down banks and grazing knees? Excuse me if I\u2019m speaking out of turn, Ms Morgan, but, as a person who spends 33-hours a week with children, that\u2019s what I thought childhood was supposed to be about. But what do I know? I\u2019m only their teacher. Signed,Anon Follow us on Twitter via @GuardianTeach. Join the Guardian Teacher Network for lesson resources, comment and job opportunities, direct to your inbox.",
