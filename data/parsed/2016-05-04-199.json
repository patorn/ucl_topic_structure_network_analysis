  "body": "The morning I am due to meet Grayson Perry for a discussion on masculinity, my own issues on the topic are brought into sharp focus. In particular, I think about my cold towel. It\u2019s cold because the rail on which it hangs no longer emits heat \u2013 the fuse has blown and I am waiting for my dad to visit so he can change it. If it is true that we are currently suffering a masculinity crisis, then could my cold towel and I be the perfect illustration? \u201cOf course I can change a plug,\u201d says Perry when we meet, with a hint of incredulity. \u201cBut my father would not only know how to change a plug, he could have rewired the house, built the back wall. It\u2019s a generational thing.\u201d Perry is possibly the perfect person to teach me how to man up, and not just because he knows how to avoid a 220-volt shock. His latest three-part television documentary, Grayson Perry: All Man, delves into the subject of masculinity by visiting people living out some of the most stereotypical macho roles in British society \u2013 from mixed martial arts cage fighters in the north-east to loadsamoney City boys via teenage gangs in Skelmersdale, west Lancashire. Given that Perry is best known for the slightly less stereotypically male tasks of making ceramic art and wearing homemade dresses, wasn\u2019t venturing into these macho environments a little bit \u2026 well, scary?   Related: Grayson Perry: \u2018Just because you don\u2019t have a dress on doesn\u2019t stop you being a\u00a0tranny\u2019    \u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cWith the young men in Skem, there was one moment where we go down the subway with them and I thought: \u2018If they\u2019re gonna rob us, it will be now.\u2019 I knew that at least one of them was carrying a knife \u2026\u201d But if you think Perry is an unlikely choice to interview subjects on masculinity, then you would be mistaken. For a start, it is a subject he has given a lot of thought to over his 56 years: \u201cWas there a flashpoint in my life that made me question masculinity?\u201d he says, a little amused by my question. \u201cWell, if you start putting on dresses when you\u2019re 12, it\u2019s a bit of a wake-up call. Being a transvestite does somewhat force the issue \u2026\u201d Perry also has an unusual affinity with his subjects that encourages them to open up to him, perhaps because, just like many of his subjects, he is a working-class male who needed to escape painful aspects of his past (albeit through art). During one heartbreaking moment in the first part, Hard Men, a cage fighter breaks down over his brother\u2019s suicide. Another occasion sees teenage gang members concede their fathers were useless role models. Rather than a gentle poking at the silly side of masculinity, Perry\u2019s show is a serious study of emotional repression and its devastating consequences.     Coming face to face with cage fighters in the first episode, Hard Men. Photograph: Channel 4    \u201cOften men don\u2019t even realise they\u2019re sad,\u201d he says. \u201cBoys are brought up to unconsciously feel they would be breaking their man contract if they were to cry too much. That\u2019s why men kill themselves more \u2013 they bottle up, bottle up, bottle up, bottle up, until they\u2019re overwhelmed by it.\u201d Perry thinks the shocking suicide rates in the UK \u2013 men aged between 20 and 49 are more likely to die from suicide than any other single form of death \u2013 is just one reason why we urgently need to address our view of what being a man should involve. In a world where manual labour is declining and technology is transforming the workplace, it is hardly surprising that traits associated with violent aggression are becoming increasingly redundant.   Related: All Man: Grayson Perry on masculinity    Such stereotypes are something Perry has fought since childhood. Rejecting the figures of masculinity he was \u201chanded by fate\u201d \u2013 in particular, a stepfather so violent that Perry recently claimed he fantasised about killing him \u2013 Perry invented his own ideal male role model, represented by his teddy bear Alan Measles: \u201cHe\u2019s an extreme example of what a transference object can do in the right hands,\u201d he laughs, \u201calthough he\u2019s just a lump of rather rotting foam now.\u201d Perry also embraced a female alter-ego called Claire, although \u201calter-ego\u201d is a term he now dismisses. \u201cIt\u2019s just me in a dress,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t make any claims to having any understanding of what it is to be a woman. I might walk with shorter steps, that\u2019s all!\u201d The idea of gang members putting on frocks and taking up pottery might be slightly farfetched, but Perry \u2013 who grew up through the androgyny of punk and the experimentation of new romanticism \u2013 thinks a lot of people could be freer if they loosened up about gender. \u201cGender is great,\u201d he says, \u201cand I\u2019m happy for anybody to celebrate wherever they are on the gender spectrum. It\u2019s got amazingly much easier in my lifetime.\u201d     Grayson does Australia: \u2018It\u2019s just me in a dress.\u2019 Photograph: Lisa Maree Williams/Getty Images    I ask where he stands on the debates about public toilets \u2013 whether people who identify as female should be allowed in women\u2019s toilets. \u201cWell, [in] all situations, you have to give and take,\u201d he says. \u201cIf the majority of women don\u2019t like it, then you have to listen to them. Because all identity is co-created. If I say, \u2018I am X\u2019, and you don\u2019t agree with me, am I really X? \u201cI can shout what I want from the rooftops,\u201d he continues, before diverting into a story of a meeting he had with someone who ran a gender-equality clinic in Charing Cross. \u201cHe told me his job isn\u2019t to transform person A into person B, but to get them to look like something that feels right to them, [so] that other people don\u2019t give them questioning looks all the time. It\u2019s getting them to a place where they feel happy and other people accept it. It\u2019s always about finding what really works. In the past, if you wanted to declare yourself whatever, and everyone said, \u2018That\u2019s ridiculous\u2019, then it was hard work.\u201d Back to the subject in hand \u2013 how men can embrace a healthier form of masculinity \u2013 and we run through a list of things men could do better at, from opening up more and embracing feminism to refiguring our definition of what bravery means (see below). As we skip through the list, I realise that it is probably not me who needs to sort out my masculinity issues. Instead, it\u2019s some of the cage fighters and City boys and gang members. Because the masculinity Perry thinks we should aspire to is not a traditional one; it is one that fits the modern world, where problem-solving and communication are more important than being able to kill your lunch with your bare hands. And if I am still left unable to change a plug at the end of it all, at least I no longer need to wait for my dad to visit. I can simply give Grayson Perry a call instead. Grayson Perry\u2019s 12 steps to becoming a modern man     Grayson Perry: \u2018Get me on a mountain bike and I love it.\u2019 Photograph: Channel 4    1. Open up \u201cBeing vulnerable is the absolute key to having good relationships. And good relationships are the key to being happy.\u201d 2. Bravado comes in many forms \u201cMen are very good at bungee jumping or driving fast, things that are physically dangerous, but they\u2019re not so good at emotional bravery, such as having that difficult conversation with a colleague or partner. Men often cringe; they can\u2019t handle it. I\u2019m probably better than most because, having been through many embarrassing situations, I\u2019ve learned that you don\u2019t die.\u201d 3. Don\u2019t get too hung up on identity issues \u201cThe idea of gender fluidity is an alien concept to the vast majority of people, even in Britain.\u201d 4. Look to the future \u201cMen are always looking back to a time when men were men and trying to bring that back. I\u2019m saying you\u2019ve got to look forward, mate. Women are always looking forward. Feminism always looks to how women can be \u2013 and that\u2019s fine. It doesn\u2019t stop them being women.\u201d 5. Embrace your costume \u201cAll men wear costumes \u2013 they just don\u2019t think of it as a costume. That\u2019s the thing about masculinity; it sees itself as this sort of default position, so therefore everything else is dressing up, whereas the man is just being normal. Men might not have frills and furbelows as women traditionally do, but they\u2019ve got spurious function: knobs on their watches or extra pockets on their jackets that are just as decorative as anything women wear.\u201d 6. Channel your painful past into useful things \u201cWe all find ways to comfort ourselves, or reinterpret experiences to make them seem OK. For me it was art; for other people it can be sport.\u201d 7. Feminism is your friend \u201cMen need not be scared of it. But the name puts them off \u2013 it has \u2018feminine\u2019 in it. I don\u2019t think enough is talked about the rewards for men from gender equality. Women have clear goals to gain from it that are easy to measure - such as pay - whereas men stand to gain emotional benefits and become happier, which is harder to measure.\u201d 8. Realise there\u2019s a problem  \u201cIt\u2019s difficult convincing men that there\u2019s a problem with masculinity because they are the least equipped people to realise they are lacking things on an emotional level.\u201d 9. Change can be subtle  \u201cMen need to learn how nice it is to be nice, how to be more empathetic to the world. It\u2019s a simple, sloshy thing to say, but lots of men are hooked into proving that they are men too much. It\u2019s to their own detriment, as much as everyone else\u2019s. I want them to be happier, that\u2019s all.\u201d 10. Taking risks is part of our nature \u201cMen are predisposed to taking risks, and that\u2019s fine \u2013 I love risks: get me on a mountain bike or a motor bike, I love it. I\u2019m an adrenaline addict. It\u2019s the same with public speaking or becoming a part of a public conversation \u2013 these are all risky strategies that can go terribly wrong.\u201d 11. Let your children be themselves \u201cParents in this country often know their child\u2019s gender before they are born, so they start the gendering process on the foetus. They\u2019re already talking to it in their stomach and getting their mindset on how they will treat their child.\u201d 12. Think about how macho pursuits affect the world \u201cJust look at Isis and what it promises to those young boys who go to fight. You\u2019re in a group, there\u2019s a clear goal - it\u2019s a real masculine adventure. There\u2019s not much negotiation going on!\u201d Grayson Perry: All Man is on Channel 4 on Thursday at 10pm.",
