For you, dear reader, have been watching me tapping away at my computer on these pages since 2001. When I began Let\u2019s Move To\u2026 George Bush was in his first year as president, S Club 7 and Destiny\u2019s Child were riding high in the charts. Leigh-on-Sea, our first visit, was the Next Big Thing, or so I thought. What a difference 15 years makes. Leigh was almost the Next Big Thing. It has an artisan gelato house nowadays, and if someone had told us in 2001 that there would be a \u00a31.2m penthouse for sale on Broadway in 2016 I\u2019d have choked on my Starbucks (still exotic back then). Leigh has an authentic Ealing Comedy feel, all stripy awnings and butchers that look like Terry-Thomas. And, I noted in 2001, it might usefully serve as an escape from the Smoke, because \u201cLondon house prices are criminal\u201d. Some things never change. The case against One can tire of the racks of 1920s semis. The old town is sweet as a cockle, but marred by the train line. Well connected? Trains: six to nine trains an hour; 48 mins to London Fenchurch Street via Barking and West Ham, and 10 the other way to Southend. Driving: 10 mins to Southend, just over half an hour to the M25 or to Chelmsford, an hour to Stansted Airport. The roads in and out can clog. Schools Primaries: Chalkwell Hall, Our Lady of Lourdes Catholic, Darlinghurst, Blenheim, Eastwood, Edwards Hall and Fairways are all \u201cgood\u201d, says Ofsted, with Leigh North Street and West Leigh Junior \u201coutstanding\u201d. Secondaries: Belfairs Academy and St Thomas More High are all \u201cgood\u201d. Hang out at\u2026 Cockle Row, munching on bivalves, looking across mud flats, followed by strawberry and black pepper ice-cream at Poco Gelato. Where to buy The river-front High Street with its cottages, cobbles and boatsheds is just the right side of twee. Up the cliff, the new town is mostly a late Victorian to 1950s affair. Between here and London Road, millions of terraces and semis. Bigger homes east to Chalkwell. Large detacheds and town houses, \u00a3800,000-\u00a31.2m. Detacheds, \u00a3450,000-\u00a3800,000. Semis, \u00a3350,000-\u00a31m. Terraces and cottages, \u00a3240,000-\u00a3500,000. Flats, \u00a3140,000-\u00a3375,000. Rentals: a one-bed flat, \u00a3550-\u00a3750pcm; a three-bed house, \u00a31,000-\u00a31,600pcm.

From the streets  Katie Cohen \u201cWe moved from London in 2013, looking for something bigger and more affordable. It was the best choice. I walk everywhere: beach, bars, coffee shops or galleries. It\u2019s easy to bump into friends.\u201d Dom Green \u201cRetains its small-town feel even with the influx from London.\u201d \u2022 Live in Leigh-on-Sea?
