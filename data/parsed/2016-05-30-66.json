  "body": "Lewis Hamilton has thanked his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg\u2019s former mechanics following his win in the Monaco Grand Prix, one which has put his ambition for a fourth Formula One world title back on track. Rosberg won the first four races of the season after it was announced that the two drivers\u2019 teams had virtually swapped for the year, with five changes on each side. But Hamilton\u2019s success on Sunday, his first since last October\u2019s US Grand Prix in Austin, cut Rosberg\u2019s lead from 43 points to 24 with the German driver only able to finish seventh. Hamilton said: \u201cI think this will be a boost for my mechanics, who have been nervous all year. It\u2019s not easy coming from one side of the garage to the world champion\u2019s car. It\u2019s the same if you\u2019re given Fernando [Alonso] or Sebastian [Vettel] as a driver. \u201cThat\u2019s just how it is. When you have the champion in the car you know you need to deliver and because of the issues we had they probably felt they weren\u2019t delivering. But they have been. It must be a great relief for them and I\u2019m grateful to them for sticking with me. Hopefully it will give them the confidence to know that I\u2019m as strong as I\u2019ve always been and I will be for the rest of the year.\u201d When the swap was made this year, a Mercedes spokesman said: \u201cIt\u2019s just to mix things up and keep things fresh. You need to do that because you don\u2019t want people doing the same thing for 15 years.\u201d Following technical problems with Hamilton\u2019s car in a number of the early races this season, Mercedes wrote an open letter to their fans in response to conspiracy theories circulating on social media. Mercedes assured them that there was \u201cNo \u2018A\u2019 or \u2018B\u2019 team here\u201d and told \u201cthe haters, the naysayers, the conspirators\u201d that \u201cif we can convince even half of you of what we really stand for, we\u2019ll consider that a battle well won\u201d.

Hopefully in the great atmosphere of Montreal I will be able to shine like I did the first time I won.\u201d That was in 2007, when he recorded his first F1 win in a chaotic race which featured Robert Kubica\u2019s spectacular crash. Hamilton feels there is still work to be done in the Mercedes team to iron out the glitches that marred his season before Monaco, along with his own mistakes. He was affected, as was Rosberg, by a fuel-pump issue in qualifying in Monaco, which saw him on the second row of the grid behind Rosberg and Red Bull\u2019s Daniel Ricciardo. \u201cThere are still issues, and mistakes being made,\u201d he said. \u201cWe really need to pull together as a team. Because we now have more pressure than ever on us, with the other teams applying that pressure. We are the greatest team, but we need to refine a few areas.\u201d Hamilton said his 44th victory \u2013 his favourite number \u2013 had special significance for him. \u201cIt\u2019s the number I had when I first started racing. I won my first championship with 44. \u201cAnd I just can\u2019t believe I have 44 wins in Formula One. I\u2019ve had a lot of help and hard work from so many people. Way, way too many people to name in a long career. So I\u2019m going to enjoy 44 as long as I can because it only happens once.\u201d Hamilton revealed that he planned to overtake Rosberg in Monaco if his team-mate hadn\u2019t been ordered to move over when he was struggling with a lack of pace in his car early on. \u201cI was looking at all the weak points, his weak areas, and I was waiting for the moment to be close enough. I was going to take him on Turn three, on the outside, which not many people do. But I didn\u2019t have to.\u201d As for the 19-point swing in his favour in terms of the championship, Hamilton added: \u201cI did not expect the points to have shifted as they have. But a swing goes both ways, and I\u2019m conscious of that.\u201d",
