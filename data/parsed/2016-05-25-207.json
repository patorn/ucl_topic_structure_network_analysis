  "body": "For James Fata, the transition from prescription painkillers to heroin was seamless. The 24-year-old came to Florida to shake an addiction to opioid pills, but trying to go through rehab in a region known as the prescription capital of America proved too much. When a government crackdown curtailed his supply of pills, Fata turned to readily available heroin to fill the void. \u201cThe pills were hard to get. They got to be very expensive. Heroin is cheap,\u201d said Fata, 24. \u201cAlmost everyone that I was close to, anybody that was doing pills with me, typically they would at least get to the point where pills were not an option. You were either snorting heroin or shooting heroin.\u201d Florida was the crucible of the opioid epidemic now gripping the US. Before deaths from opiates spiked nationwide, the state\u2019s south corridor earned the name \u201cOxy Express\u201d for its liberal access to the extraordinarily powerful synthetic heroin painkiller, OxyContin. But after Florida spent years trying to shake off its reputation by driving out of business the worst of the notorious \u201cpill mills\u201d, the twist came that state officials hadn\u2019t predicted.  When the addicts Florida facilitated could not get prescription opioids any more, they turned to heroin.   Overdoses kill more Americans than car crashes or guns \u2013 and experts say the crisis hasn\u2019t peaked. Data reveals how a local problem became a national epidemic   \u201cI\u2019d like to say it\u2019s getting better because I see at least things are being brought to the surface and there\u2019s an advocacy movement,\u201d Fata said. \u201cBut on a numbers level, it\u2019s getting worse. On the amount of deaths I see, it\u2019s getting worse. The amount of heroin use I\u2019m seeing, it\u2019s getting worse.\u201d As heroin deaths in the US have more than tripled nationwide since 2010, critics say Florida\u2019s efforts to contain an epidemic unleashed within its borders have only had limited effect in curbing one crisis while making another worse. Florida\u2019s problems started after OxyContin swept on to the market in 1996, just as medical authorities began pressing doctors to pay greater attention to alleviating pain. Unscrupulous businessmen in Florida spotted an opportunity. Within a few years, hundreds of pain clinics popped up around the state dispensing opioid pills to just about anyone who asked. Among the earliest and biggest was American Pain in the Miami-Fort Lauderdale metro area, with a pharmacy run by former strippers and doctors carrying guns under their white coats. It took in tens of millions of dollars a year selling OxyContin and generic versions containing oxycodone to people who travelled from Kentucky and West Virginia where painkillers were known as \u201chillbilly heroin\u201d. They came south along the \u201cOxy Express\u201d by bus or the carload, sometimes driven by dealers who took a cut of the pills. At one point, more than 90% of all the prescription opioids dispensed by doctors in the US were sold in Florida.     James Fata: \u2018On a numbers level, it\u2019s getting worse. On the amount of deaths I see, it\u2019s getting worse. The amount of heroin use I\u2019m seeing, it\u2019s getting worse.\u2019 Photograph: Chris McGreal for the Guardian    \u2018Nothing had ever brought me to my knees\u2019 Robert Eaton was introduced to opioids at the age of 24 after suffering herniated discs in 2009. After a couple of months of therapy and low levels of painkillers, his doctor said he had done all he could for Eaton. The doctor pointed him to the pill mills. \u201cHe recommended me to go see a pain management doctor. I started seeing him every month. Immediately he increased all of my prescriptions,\u201d he said. Eaton reels off a list of hundreds of oxycodone, methadone and muscle relaxants he was prescribed each month.    The pills were hard to get. They got to be very expensive. Heroin is cheap  James Fata     \u201cIt\u2019s a lot but by the time I got to him, the pills already had a stranglehold on me. A lot more just seemed better. I didn\u2019t realise at the time just how far this thing was going to take me,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing had ever brought me to my knees. Once the pills went into my body, it was over. As soon I took that drug I was like, \u2018whoa, this is good. I need more of this now\u2019.\u201d Those hooked on oxycodone say that they do not so much feel a craving for pills as a fear of not getting them and, as they put it, getting sick. If they don\u2019t get a fix, they get hit by increasingly intense pain from withdrawal much worse than the pain they were treating. \u201cBy the end, I was locking myself in a room, never getting that kind of high,\u201d Eaton said. \u201cNeeding this to not get sick and to be able to get out of bed.\u201d Eaton quickly came to realise that the doctor wasn\u2019t so much treating him as taking his money, writing a prescription, and getting him out of the door as fast as possible in order to get the next patient in. \u201cNot once did he ever ask me: \u2018Did your pain improve this month?\u2019 There was no intention to ever bring the medication level down at all. You\u2019re walking in and he\u2019s prescribing you the max,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you had insurance, it didn\u2019t matter. You paid cash to see the doctor.\u201d Eaton is still not sure how much he spent between the doctors and the pills but said it ran into hundreds of dollars a day.     Robert Eaton: \u2018Once the pills went into my body, it was over.\u2019 Photograph: Chris McGreal for the Guardian    He lost his job as a Budweiser delivery driver because the pills affected his work. He lost his house. He even sold his stepchildren\u2019s toys.  \u201cI would take the mortgage money. My wife at the time would try and scrounge up money to pay for things and I would steal it,\u201d he said. Eaton found another job training as an emergency medic with a fire department and managed to keep his addiction hidden for a while. \u201cOne day we walked into this lady\u2019s house. It was a grandma. She\u2019s sitting in her bed. She\u2019s dead and she had a pill bottle in her hand,\u201d he said. \u201cThat messed me up so bad I went and did roxies [oxycodone]. \u201cMy way to fix what I was experiencing was to go do the very drug that just killed her.\u201d    There was no intention to ever bring the medication level down. You\u2019re walking in and he\u2019s prescribing you the max  Robert Eaton     Oxycodone down; heroin up Florida started to crack down on \u201cpill mills\u201d in 2010. American Pain was shut down in an FBI raid and its owners were imprisoned. The Florida legislature passed laws to kill off other pill mills and curtail the largely unfettered prescription of opioids. Deaths from oxycodone in Florida dropped 69% in the five years from 2010. But the clampdown left those already addicted without a ready supply. It limited access to pills, forced up prices on the street, and made heroin a cheaper alternative. As the drug flooded in from Mexico, heroin deaths in Florida more than doubled in 2014 alone to a record 408. Doctors also reported an increase in the number of babies born addicted to heroin, and Florida leads the US in new HIV-Aids infections, attributed to needle-sharing by drug users. \u201cWhat was going on here in Florida was different to any other place,\u201d Fata said. \u201cThe pill mills were blatantly illegal. Anybody could walk in and get a prescription. When that stopped, those people either latched on to people who still had a prescription or they moved to heroin. As those people they could latch on to dwindled and dwindled because it got stricter and more restrictive, the shift was to heroin.\u201d The National Institute on Drug Abuse declared a heroin epidemic in south Florida two years ago. The Journal of the American Medical Association Psychiatry noted a shift toward greater use by white people from affluent backgrounds and said that most were drawn to heroin after becoming addicted to opioid painkillers.

Florida officials were as caught off guard by the rise of heroin as they were by the sudden boom of the pill mills in the late 2000s. Fata got hooked on prescription pills in his home state of Texas, where he grew up in what he describes as an upper-middle-class family. He began popping painkillers he found in his parents\u2019 cabinet when he was in his mid-teens, a pastime he said was common among his friends.  Before long he was hooked and taking even larger doses supplemented with heroin. He paid for his habit by dealing in drugs. But at the age of 20, after four years of drugs, his parents forced him to go to rehab in Florida.  \u201cIt got to a point where I was about to die and my parents said: \u2018You need to go to treatment\u2019,\u201d he said. Fata was clean for about six months but, surrounded by people with easy access to prescriptions painkillers, his resolve failed. \u201cI was living in a halfway house when I relapsed. Working in a menial job. I just felt stuck. There was nowhere for me to go,\u201d he said.    As soon as the prices of the pills went up, I knew I would just use heroin  James Fata     But already the pills were becoming harder to find. The federal authorities were moving against businessmen running Florida\u2019s pain clinics. Prosecutors called American Pain the US\u2019s largest illegal prescription drug ring, earning an estimated $43m in three years, and said it was responsible for at least 50 overdose deaths in Florida alone. Owner Jeff George was sent to prison for 20 years for the death of one of those patients. His brother Chris George received a reduced sentence of 14 years after testifying against doctors he hired. The Florida legislature passed a package of reforms five years ago requiring that pain clinics be owned and run by a doctor. It also established a system to allow doctors and pharmacies to track prescriptions in an attempt to put an end to doctor shopping. \u201cI already knew that the scandal was shutting the pill mills down, so there\u2019s no way somebody like me, without a legitimate ailment, to get pills,\u201d Fata said. Fata moved in with the man who would become his main supplier. His housemate had a prescription for back pain, still did a bit of doctor shopping, and sold some of the drugs. But it became more difficult as doctors became more wary with the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and prosecutors sniffing around. And the shortage drove the price of pills up on the black market. \u201cAs soon as the prices of the pills went up, I knew I would just use heroin,\u201d Fata said. \u201cI moved to heroin because the price of OxyContin turned to more expensive than the price per ounce of gold.\u201d     Residents from the House of Hope rehab center appear in court in Fort Lauderdale. Photograph: Miami Herald/MCT via Getty Images    Heron was about one-eighth of the price of pills for the same hit and more readily available. With its rise has come an increase in deaths from a drug authorities say is as much as 50 times more powerful \u2013 fentanyl, a synthetic opiate frequently laced into heroin. The DEA last year issued a nationwide alert over what it called an alarming increase in the number of deaths related to fentanyl and heroin. \u2018New addictions every day\u2019 But the rise of heroin does not mean the prescription opioid crisis is going away. Janet Colbert was instrumental in getting the pill mills closed down. Working as a neonatal intensive care nurse near Fort Lauderdale, Colbert had to deal with children born addicted to opioids through their mothers. \u201cIn years past we had a cocaine baby once in a while. All of a sudden our unit is full of these babies. We\u2019re all like, what\u2019s going on? We had no idea why there were so many. Screaming. It was bad. You couldn\u2019t feed them. They\u2019re in withdrawal,\u201d she said.    We\u2019ll never control the heroin if we don\u2019t control the opiates because there are new addictions every day  Janet Colbert     \u201cIf there is a heroin epidemic, nine out of 10 heroin users start with prescription opiates. We\u2019ll never control the heroin if we don\u2019t control the opiates because there are new addictions every day.\u201d Colbert points the finger at the drug manufacturers \u2013 led by Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin \u2013 and a medical establishment she said that puts too much emphasis on prescribing powerful drugs to deal with pain. In 2007, Purdue paid a $634m penalty for misrepresenting the drug\u2019s addictiveness. In December it reached a $24m settlement with Kentucky after the state claimed Purdue cost it \u201can entire generation\u201d to OxyContin. Colbert accuses the pharmaceutical companies and doctors of attempting to shift blame for the epidemic by accusing those hooked on prescription opioids of \u201cabusing\u201d the drugs. That was the experience of Eaton, who calmly recalls the trauma of his years of addiction but becomes visibly angry when talking about drug manufacturers and doctors.

Photograph: Orlando Sentinel/MCT via Getty Images    \u201cThis thing took me to a place where I didn\u2019t want to live any more, really. Do I have to accept responsibility? Yeah. I\u2019m a drug addict. Am I a bad person? No. I was going to a doctor who was just taking my money from me. He wasn\u2019t trying to help me get better at all,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a lot of friends who are dead who were getting prescriptions from doctors, and it\u2019s a doctor\u2019s job to protect them. It gets me really pissed off that they weren\u2019t protected.\u201d Florida\u2019s attorney general, Pam Bondi, called doctors working in pill mills \u201cdrug dealers in white coats\u201d. Some physicians have been called to account. A Lake Worth doctor, Sergio Rodriguez, was sentenced to 27 years in prison over more than four overdose deaths. But it has proved hard to convict others. Cynthia Cadet wrote more prescriptions than any other doctor at American Pain and was paid $1.5m. But a jury cleared her of criminal charges after she said she could not know if patients were lying about pain levels. She was later imprisoned for money laundering. Colbert said that jailing a few doctors does not go far enough when hundreds were employed in what she regards as a criminal racket. She would like to see the state medical authorities strip them of their licences to practice. Her organisation, Stopp Now, is also pushing for doctors to be required to use a monitoring programme that would tell them if a patient is obtaining prescriptions from another doctor. The programme is compulsory in 20 states but voluntary in Florida.    I was going to a doctor who was just taking my money from me. He wasn\u2019t trying to help me get better at all  Robert Eaton     Colbert said state legislators have told her they will not support the measure because it is opposed by the Florida Medical Association. \u201cThe doctors have a lot of clout and they don\u2019t want the legislation because somebody\u2019s telling them what to do,\u201d she said. The Florida Medical Association did not respond to a request for comment. Fata said he finally kicked heroin when he recognised it was going to kill him. He is studying to be a social worker and plans to return to Texas. \u201cI knew this past time, right before I got clean, that I was ready to kill myself,\u201d he said. \u201cI was at breaking point.\u201d  Eaton also shook his reliance on drugs with the help of a religious group and now runs a personal training business. But getting off the pills came at a price. His marriage broke up. Friends were dying around him. \u201cMy best friend died on just the prescriptions alone. His sister found him on the morning of his 30th birthday, dead in his room,\u201d he said. Eaton missed the funeral because he was on the hunt for a fix.",
