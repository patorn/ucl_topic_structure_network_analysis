  "body": "Even the Financial Times reviewer was impressed by the depth of research that had gone into The Mandibles, Lionel Shriver\u2019s latest novel, which imagines the aftermath of a major economic collapse. \u201cThe details of the financial meltdown are intricate and convincing,\u201d wrote Alex Preston. However, \u201cwhile Shriver\u2019s grasp of economics is impressive, I found myself wishing that she\u2019d had the confidence to allow her research to lie lower beneath the surface.\u201d Other reviewers agreed. For Hannah Rosefield in the New Statesman the novel was \u201cpsychologically flat\u201d, while in the Sunday Times, Claire Lowdon found that \u201cyou never really empathise with the characters, despite the terrible things that happen to them\u201d. But other reviews pointed out that it was worth persevering past a tricky first half. \u201cOnce the premise has been established as all too chillingly plausible, the novel revs up into a multifaceted family saga,\u201d wrote Stephanie Merritt in the Observer. And for Rosamund Urwin in the Evening Standard, \u201cby the end, The Mandibles had got under my skin.\u201d Kick: The True Story of Kick Kennedy, a biography of John F\u2019s sister by Paula Byrne received a critical drubbing from Robert McCrum in the Observer. \u201cIf Kick is a \u2018true story\u2019, we should also recognise what it\u2019s not. It is, for instance, scarcely a dispassionate biography.\u201d The author was \u201ctoo heavily invested in her subject for the usual considerations of objectivity\u201d, he wrote, and her account \u201crarely departs from a pop psychological narrative \u2026 Less a book than an uncontrolled magazine article, Kick reads like an unedited film treatment.\u201d For Ginny Dougary in the Daily Mail, however, the book \u201cquietly but devastatingly illuminates the shadows of America\u2019s own royal family \u2026 Byrne conjures such a vivid portrait of her enchanting heroine that one almost feels deprived never having met her.\u201d And for Sue Gaisford, writing in the Financial Times, it was an \u201cexcellent biography ... Kick herself must have been a great character, and her biographer showers admiring adjectives on her: sweet, effervescent, tenacious, witty. The facts, supported by impressive research, do seem to justify the praise.\u201d In the Evening Standard, Nick Curtis found \u201csomething uneven and erratic about the characters and plot\u201d of the latest novel from Marina Lewycka, The Lubetkin Legacy. But his biggest beef was, understandably perhaps in a London paper, the mention of a \u201cbus ticket\u201d. \u201cHonestly, Marina: when\u2019s the last time you saw one of those in London?\u201d Lucy Atkins, in the Sunday Times, was similarly dubious. \u201cThe wit and energy that felt fresh and engrossing in her debut now seem more strained,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe reliance on silly names and pratfalls can be more grating than hilarious and forays into the history of Jewish persecution or the injustices of the bedroom tax feel a bit patched in.\u201d But in the Times, Melissa Katsoulis was completely won over. \u201cPerhaps because she was first published when she was in her late 50s, Lewycka doesn\u2019t care about being on-message. She is a traditional, left-leaning lady of letters who simply wants to spin a good yarn with a social conscience. This lively novel is another example of her ability to do just that ... Here is one author for whom character and plot come first, and those honest values make The Lubetkin Legacy a joy to read, with just the right balance of light and shade.\u201d",
