The Mao-themed extravaganza was held in early May at the Great Hall of the People, a colossal granite edifice in Tiananmen Square that hosts China\u2019s most important political events.  Online footage of the spectacular showed giant images of Mao and the current president, Xi Jinping, being projected over the stage as dozens of choristers performed revolutionary \u201cred songs\u201d harking back to the days of Mao.            During a rendition of Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman - an anthem from the Cultural Revolution \u2013 the Great Hall\u2019s cavernous auditorium filled with the lyrics:   \u201cSailing seas depends on the helmsman, Life and growth depends on the sun. Rain and dew nourish the crops, Making revolution depends on Mao Zedong Thought. Fish can\u2019t leave the water, Nor melons leave the vines. The revolutionary masses can\u2019t do without the Communist party. Mao Zedong Thought is the sun that forever shines.\u201d  At another moment a banner appeared reading: \u201cPeople of the world unite to defeat American invaders and their running dogs!\u201d   Related: China's Xi Jinping denies House of Cards power struggle but attacks 'conspirators'    Beijing had hoped to ignore the 16 May anniversary of the start of the Cultural Revolution, a decade-long political upheaval that claimed up to 2 million lives. The party\u2019s official verdict on the period, delivered in 1981, said it had caused \u201cthe most severe setback and the heaviest losses suffered by the party, the country, and the people\u201d since its foundation in 1949.  But the highly controversial concert has triggered a bitter public debate that has thwarted the party\u2019s plans to gloss over the anniversary.      There have been accusations that President Xi Jinping is trying to build for himself a Mao-style cult of personality. Photograph: Jason Lee/Reuters    Some claim the decision to stage the show in such a politically symbolic venue is part of a high-level conspiracy designed to damage Xi. \u201cThis is a political trap to frame the top leader,\u201d Ma Xiaoli, the daughter of one party veteran who was persecuted and purged during the Cultural Revolution, claimed this week. She blamed \u201canti-Xi\u201d forces who wanted to portray the president\u2019s leadership as a Mao-style personality cult. Others suspect Xi, who has praised Mao and sought to stifle criticism of his own rule since taking power in 2012, might have had a hand in organising the show, which took place on 2 May.  \u201cI do not think others have set a trap for Xi; I think he has set the trap for himself,\u201d said Zhang Lifan, an outspoken historian and critic of China\u2019s president. \u201cGiven Xi\u2019s personality, it is the kind of thing he would do.\u201d Some political observers see the row as the latest hint of an internal power struggle that might be raging at the top of the Communist party, which has 88 million members. Writing in the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post, the political journalist Wang Xiangwei said: \u201cThe saga adds another interesting twist to the political manoeuvring playing out in the corridors of high power in Beijing as liberals and leftists wage an increasingly tense tussle to sway the leadership over the direction of the country.\u201d Wang added that it was disingenuous to suggest a concert could be held in such a politically significant venue without the collaboration of senior officials. Jude Blanchette, a Beijing-based scholar who is writing a book about the influence of Maoism on contemporary China, said the identities and motivations of the show\u2019s promoters was a mystery. \u201cThere are tonnes of rumours flying around right now,\u201d he said.  Blanchette described claims that the spectacular was an attack on Xi as \u201ctenuous\u201d, but added that it was also unlikely that the president had backed the event: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine that he could have supported it knowing that the reaction was going to be this intense.\u201d More likely was that the organisers had misread the political climate and failed to anticipate the backlash a Cultural Revolution-themed concert would cause, he said. \u201cGiven the climate now ideologically, given this resurgence of party history, given some of the dog-whistle signals Xi Jinping has given about the role of the party and the way that the neo-Maoists have interpreted those, I can see how someone overzealously thought that they could get away with a concert redolent of Maoist past glories and the Cultural Revolution, clearly misjudging the level of controversy that the [period] still has for so many.  \u201cCockup over conspiracy makes sense to me.\u201d Whatever the case, the show has exposed the chasm that still exists between those who view the Cultural Revolution as a catastrophe for which the Communist party has yet to fully atone, and a much smaller number of neo-Maoists who believe Mao has been unfairly demonised for what they continue to view as a golden period.     Delegates attend a session of National People\u2019s Congress at the Great Hall of the People, where the Cultural Revolution concert was staged. Photograph: ChinaFotoPress/Getty Images    China\u2019s party-run press has lent its voice to critics of the Mao revival concert, with one newspaper noting that the \u201cglorification\u201d of China\u2019s \u201cchaotic decade\u201d was unwelcome. But such attacks have met with an unflinching retort from the neo-Maoists, with one prominent figure accusing critics of using the period as a \u201cpolitical dagger \u2026 [with which] to slay our party and our nation\u201d.  \u201cAny such denunciation of the Cultural Revolution is entirely making public opinion preparations for the United States and other western nations in [plotting the] extinction of the Chinese nation,\u201d wrote Zhang Hongliang in an article translated by the University of Hong Kong\u2019s China Media Project. Blanchette said the row was a reminder of the long shadow the Cultural Revolution continued to cast over today\u2019s China.  \u201cFifty years later it is the single most controversial episode in modern Chinese history. It is the most divisive moment,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are two really entrenched, highly politicised sides on this issue. There are people who felt intense, searing pain, who felt like the party\u2019s effort to sweep this under the rug [denied them] an open, honest historical reckoning [about the Cultural Revolution]. \u201cAnd, on the other side, you have a highly motivated and organised populist group who thinks that the party\u2019s attempt to sweep this under the rug was the original sin of the Deng [Xiaoping] era. It\u2019s when they first sold out Mao Zedong and his revolutionary vision.\u201d The latter group was now on the offensive following the Tiananmen Square show, Blanchette said. \u201cA month ago things were quiet on the Maoist front in terms of historical remembrance. Now it has clearly, clearly picked up.\u201d Additional reporting by Christy Yao",
