  "body": "Well I have never known Nancy so cross with Dave, he\u2019s like, I was only saying what everybody thinks, she\u2019s like, Dad, do you know how long I SPENT crafting that Churchill speech \u201cthe serried rows of white headstones\u201d, total Project Fear gold, & now all anybody can talk about is Nigeria & tax havens & all because YOU could not stop showing off, you should be ashamed of yourself at your age :((( Dave\u2019s like, wait Nancy, the Queen did it too, how come I am in trouble when she did the exact same thing? Nancy\u2019s like, hello, was the Queen idiotic enough to call a referendum, honestly Dad you do not deserve to win, if you want to embarrass yourself go ahead, but have you thought how it makes ME look, & canunot check your phone while I\u2019m talking, there are weeks to go & we have already used up war, pestilence & famine, I was saving death for later, but so what, nobody seems to care :(   Related: Mrs Cameron\u2019s Diary: Poor Zac still totes deserves huge respect | As told to Catherine Bennett    I\u2019m like, IKR, actually Rosie says fashwise the horsemen of the apocalypse sound way more now than being on the same side as Mr Corbyn, & Mummy is like, absolutely, & at least skilled equestrianism is involved. Nancy\u2019s like, FGS, think, what else srsly frightens people, you first mum. I\u2019m like, oh I know, ghosts? She\u2019s srsly, mother, IRL?

Nancy\u2019s like, so listen \u2013 puts on Churchill voice \u2013 here\u2019s my draft: \u201cthe BBC in ruins, ditto the NHS, raging inequality, old people abandoned, developers off the leash, Etonians in charge, everything we hold dear either sold off or trashed by entitled goons who think Zac Goldsmith is electable. Think \u2013 before\u00a0you choose Brexit: is that a risk worth taking?\u201d Trust me Dad, this speech will make grown men tremble. Unless you think it\u2019s too alarmist? Dave\u2019s like, err, soz to be thick, how exactly is that terrifying?",
