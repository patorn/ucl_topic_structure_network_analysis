  "body": "I\u2019ve been receiving letters recently from parents, teachers and school governors telling me about the stress that children in year 2 and year 6 are under. This is because of the Sats tests and I don\u2019t get any sense from you or your colleagues that you realise how serious this is. When the Sats first came in, I was reassured by people responsible for them that they were just \u201cpencil and paper tests\u201d, which children would hardly notice. Schools would be assessed in ways that were nationally equivalent for the sake of us parents. Education was being held to account. This negated the possibility that a combination of teachers, their professional associations, the national inspectorate, officers and advisers in local authorities and parent representation could improve schools. It negated the possibility that this could be built on through giving teachers incentives to research their own practice and share the results.   Related: Parents and children take part in boycott of primary school tests    Under your government, this testing system has been ramped up. Tests have been created that are constructed entirely around right/wrong answers. This was to make the tests \u201creliable\u201d. The philosophy here is based on the input-output method of assessment, equivalent to testing the quality of petrol through the performance of a car. So long as you use the same car, load, driver, tyre wear, amount of lubrication, course, speed and weather, then driving a car first with one petrol and then with another will enable someone to say that one petrol is better than another \u2013 under those conditions. The output of the car will tell us something about the input \u2013 the petrol. This is the principle behind the tests that are giving our children such hell. The teachers\u2019 input \u2013 their quality of teaching \u2013 is rated according to the pupils\u2019 output \u2013 their test scores. And what\u2019s wrong with that, you say? Several things: to make the tests valid, education has to be narrowed down to facts that must not be debated or interpreted. There can be no debate or choice over what knowledge is being tested. The learner is reduced to a receptacle that either does or does not regurgitate the facts. Yet, it is not the receptacle being tested. It is the person pouring the input into the receptacle. And children are not receptacles or cars or machines. They are humans with views of what they are learning and how they feel. One ex-headteacher and now school governor wrote to tell me of \u201csix- to seven-year-old pupils who, during the testing period, were crying, visibly shaking and reportedly waking up at 4am unable to sleep\u201d. Any parent of children undergoing these tests has seen how it works. Children sit in school or at home with pre-tests. Then teachers, children or parents mark these tests and we see the looks on our children\u2019s faces as we mark this or that question with a zero. The child is wrong. It\u2019s a fail. And no matter how kind and encouraging we are, it\u2019s still a fail. And another fail. And another. Yet, it\u2019s not the child being tested. It\u2019s the input. Now, people not fully aware of what\u2019s going on here might wonder what finite material could be found suitable for these right/wrong tests for seven- and 11-year-olds? Capital cities? Lists of prime numbers? The years of the reigns of kings and queens? Quotes from Shakespeare? No, the material is \u201cGrammar, punctuation and spelling\u201d and, as teachers, parents and children are discovering, these do not always produce right and wrong answers. Plenty of experts dispute what is being presented as fact; to say that every one of these facts about language is right is to prescribe how language should be used rather than to investigate or describe it; the language in question is ripped from context in a way that language-in-use never is; the tests include questions that have several parts but such questions have to be entirely right to win one mark, if not, it\u2019s no mark. In these cases, this results in the possibility of a child being right about several things but being wrong about one more negates the right ones. This means the test isn\u2019t even testing what it\u2019s supposed to test. What\u2019s more, there\u2019s tons and tons and tons of it.   Related: The Tories\u2019 absurd school regime can\u2019t even set a spelling test | Simon Jenkins    A teacher told me about one particular question: \u201cThe children have to think of five suffixes [and write down words as examples]; they then have to spell every new word correctly. That\u2019s 10 elements for one mark. Just one letter out of place and the marks for the whole question are a big fat zero, even though the child understands what suffixes are and how to combine them with nouns.\u201d There\u2019s worse. Not only is this stuff proving to be distressing to thousands of children. It\u2019s being used as the means by which teachers are required to grade children\u2019s writing: good writing is supposedly writing that includes semi-colons, fronted adverbials, embedded relative clauses and expanded noun phrases. I\u2019ve got news for you, Ms Morgan: that\u2019s not what makes good writing. That\u2019s input-output writing. Last week headteachers offered to help you come up with a better assessment system in time for next year. I know so many others who\u2019d be willing to help. Yours, Michael Rosen",
