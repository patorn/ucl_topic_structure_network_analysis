  "body": "When I was growing up in India, a career in the civil service was considered to be one of the most prestigious careers one could go into. From a young age, I remember my parents and teachers pushing me towards it as the career choice. This was not in a controlling sense, but because they wanted the best for me and a job in the Indian public sector was just that: one of the most highly respected across society. Like a typical youngster I decided against my parents\u2019 advice and instead embarked on a career as an entrepreneur. This has taken me on a journey, not only from India to the UK, but to organisations such as Shazam and BCG Digital Ventures, via the Arts Council and then to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. So I\u2019ve ended up contributing to the public sector after all.   Related: I thought I was blazing a trail for minorities in Whitehall. I was wrong    Being part of the public sector is an absolute privilege, but unfortunately that word privilege still rings true for too many of the wrong reasons. Recent research conducted by youth employment charity Elevation Networks found that an overwhelming 96.5% of the public sector\u2019s senior leaders are white and, unfortunately, I can\u2019t say that I was shocked by the revelation. In today\u2019s multicultural world, it\u2019s easy to assume that discrimination is a thing of the past. Sadly, it\u2019s ever present, and our public sector is no stranger to it. It can still be an old boys\u2019 club \u2013 like a party you didn\u2019t get invited to \u2013 and an impenetrable maze for those who don\u2019t know someone at the top. With just 3.5% of people at the top coming from non-white backgrounds, it\u2019s easy to see why. That\u2019s not to say that people from black and minority ethnic (BME) backgrounds aren\u2019t attracted to the public sector full stop \u2013 quite the opposite. The Department of Health\u2019s workforce as a whole is broadly representative of the population, with 17% of staff from BME backgrounds. But there are nearly ten times the number of BME employees in administrative roles (39%) as there are in Whitehall\u2019s senior civil servant positions (4%). Compare this with tech entrepreneurs in the US: Indians hold some of the most powerful positions in some of the largest companies, including Microsoft, Google, Intel, Facebook, Cisco, Adobe\u2026 the list goes on. Clearly, we have a real problem with attracting and promoting diverse talent to the top. And this is a problem \u2013 for everyone. It\u2019s a problem for young people who won\u2019t be aiming for a career that could just be their passion, and for those of us in society that don\u2019t benefit from their skills, talent and leadership.   Related: 'The right sort of female chap' \u2013 the story of women in Whitehall    This must be changed. That doesn\u2019t mean creating an old boys\u2019 network of our own (for a start, we need more women, too) but it does mean, that whoever we are and whatever position we\u2019re in, we do everything in our power to educate, encourage and promote those around us, whatever their background. Parents and teachers ought to encourage young people to actively seek out roles in the public sector because they are jobs to be proud of, but also jobs that are within our grasp. What\u2019s essential is that people don\u2019t discount themselves for any role at any level because they are from a BME background. I hope that as we move forwards as a nation, the way can be paved for other individuals to achieve their full potential.
