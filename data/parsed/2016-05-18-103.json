  "body": "Usain Bolt has said that the announcement that 31 athletes from the 2008 Olympics have tested positive for banned substances after their samples were re-examined is \u201creally bad news\u201d \u2013 and marks another \u201crough\u201d moment for the sport. The Jamaican, who won gold in the 100m and 200m at the Beijing and London Games, added that it was clear that drug use was \u201csomething that has been tarnishing the sport for years\u201d.   Related: Russians expected to be among failed doping tests from 2008 Olympics    However Bolt insisted that the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada), which has been heavily criticised for failing to act when the whistleblowers Yuliya and Vitaly Stepanov sent the organisation 200 emails about systemic doping in Russia, was up to the task of policing international competition. \u201cThey are doing a very good job of cleaning up the sport,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019ve proven that anybody who has cheated, they\u2019re going to catch.\u201d Bolt, who was speaking in Prague a day after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) announced that 31 athletes were implicated after 454 samples from the 2008 Olympics were retested, confirmed he was fit again after a hamstring scare. The 29-year-old only ran a modest 10.05 seconds over the 100m in his season debut in the Cayman Islands last week, but said he believed he could run 9.8 at the Golden Spike meeting in Ostrava in the Czech Republic on Friday. \u201cI\u2019d be very happy with 9.8,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m feeling pretty good, I trained yesterday and everything was better.\u201d Bolt has always insisted that he would retire after next year\u2019s World Championships in London, but for the first time he dangled the prospect of continuing beyond 2017. \u201cI was always thinking it would be after the world championship next year but my coach keeps saying that I should stop saying that,\u201d he admitted. \u201cIf you could figure out a way to train less and still run fast, I would stay very long. Travelling the world and racing, it\u2019s the same fun, I really enjoy that \u2013 but training, it\u2019s only getting worse.\u201d His ambitions, he insisted, were still to \u201cgo under 9.10\u201d for the 100m and \u201cto run sub-19s\u201d for the 200m. \u201cI think anything is possible, that\u2019s my motto. I go there every day with that mindset,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to close it out as best as possible.\u201d Meanwhile the IOC president, Thomas Bach, has refused to be drawn on whether Russia should be banned from the Olympics following the New York Times\u2019 revelations that the country\u2019s anti-doping officials and Federal Security Service agents deliberately gave athletes banned substances and tampered with their samples at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi to ensure they were not caught. \u201cI will not rate Russia\u2019s chances,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are waiting for the results of the Wada inquiry and we are taking our decisions based on established facts and have to respect this procedure. It has to be a fair and open procedure that has to establish the facts.\u201d \u2022 The headline and standfirst on this article were updated on 19 May 2016 to remove ambiguity",
