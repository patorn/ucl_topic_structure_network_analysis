You can imagine, then, how excited I am for the Eurovision Song Contest to come to America. We can break anything.Because this is America and the contest has something resembling European in the title, you might rightly think it is ipso facto a horror and menace, but here you would be wrong, and you have no choice anyway. It\u2019s coming. You might as well know what you\u2019re in for and why. This year, Justin Timberlake is slated to appear as the \u201cinterval artist,\u201d which you might be forgiven for assuming means he runs annoyingly fast on a treadmill intermittently to power the stage lights, but here you would also be wrong. It means he\u2019s going to sing his new single in between the official acts, make about a jillion dollars, and within a year or two, America\u2019s going to be in the thing. Now, there are many reasons to dislike Eurovision. Artists offer a fusillade of ballad treacle that seems universal yet rootless, each nation vying for the distinction of creating this year\u2019s preeminent Kelly Clarkson. Winners deliver ear worms that seem instantly recognizable but unloved and unclaimed by posterity. It\u2019s like listening to hours of theme songs from straight-to-video James Bond films from former Soviet Socialist Republics. America can totally wreck this. The thing is, America already does. Our of sheer stereotypical jingoistic arrogance, I\u2019m not going to check global sales figures and will just assume that we are already the net global leader in surging-pop glurge export. (I will not find out if I am wrong about this, because I will refuse to learn anymore starting now.) Instead, America needs to copy Eurovision, give it a startlingly unique name like Amerivision, and make it much, much louder and more awful until it tears itself apart. Just going by social media, half of the audience joy of Eurovision seems to be just like the joy from the World Cup: leveraging deeply entrenched ethnic and historical resentments into pop critique. I don\u2019t know how a bassline becomes Gallic, but if you\u2019re a Catalan separatist, you have your reasons, you know? But imagine the possibilities among 50 independent American state Amerivision contestants. Imagine the luxuries of completely insane regional hatred. We\u2019re already exceptional at this when it comes to college sports. There is something grand about someone from the collapsed iron industry of formerly sharecropping Alabama trash-talking a Pennsylvanian for living in an economically gutted wasteland, and that\u2019s about a contest where the score is determined by actual physical acts. Picture the chaos inherent in a contest that\u2019s totally arbitrary. Better yet, imagine the intrastate outrage of the acts chosen. Imagine a Michigan represented not by a Motown heir but by a new avatar of Kid Rock, the product of a scientific experiment to combine a ferret, a 14-year-old\u2019s goatee and an El Camino. Florida would devolve into chaos, split by a cracker north that loves ballads about Jesus in boot-cut, a south that birthed the Miami Sound Machine, and a bizarre Gainesville outlier that somehow created both Tom Petty and Less Than Jake. That\u2019s even assuming it gets that far. Eurovision\u2019s nomination process relies on the individual state broadcasters from each country culling a field of entrants and picking a song to nominate. Ain\u2019t no way that\u2019s working here. Even assuming someone put NPR in charge, they\u2019d just pick 50 different bootlegs of shows from tours by The National. Robert Siegel, or Someone Like Him: We picked \u201cBloodbuzz Ohio\u201d for Ohio because it had Ohio in the title. For the rest of the states, we chose the song with the least guitar or instrumentation because it got in the way of joyless moaning. No, first we\u2019d devolve nominations to the states, which would hand over the process to commercial broadcasters, who\u2019d draw the nominee voting process out for months to maximize revenue. Then the national contest would fall to bits. Eurovision\u2019s policy of excluding votes for fans\u2019 own home state nominees and diluting fan votes with the votes of an unaccountable board would provoke cries of elite capture of the democratic process for the vested interest of an establishment cabal. Eventually you\u2019d have the California Contestant from iHeartMedia vs the Georgia Yum Brands Singer of the Year vs 48 others, drawn out over a span of seemingly forever, all compromised by the votes of some electoral college.  It\u2019d be hell on earth, fueled by the victimization of every imaginable balkanized identity group underserved and unrepresented by a featureless mass-appeal nominee, riven by the sense that every shred of recognizable authenticity has been sold out to a process beyond their control. The only thing that will save it is civil war.It\u2019ll be great. It\u2019ll make billions of dollars. Let\u2019s do this. Bring it on.",
