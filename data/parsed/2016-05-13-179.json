  "body": "The French comedian and actor who made a joke about rape at a Cannes film festival event attended by Woody Allen has claimed he had no knowledge of the sexual abuse allegations swirling around the veteran film-maker. Introducing Allen\u2019s opening night film Caf\u00e9 Society at the Lumiere cinema, master of ceremonies Laurent Lafitte told the director: \u201cIt\u2019s very nice that you\u2019ve been shooting so many movies in Europe, even if you are not being convicted for rape in the US.\u201d   Related: Woody Allen responds to Ronan Farrow: 'I never read anything about me'    In a piece for the Hollywood Reporter on the morning of Wednesday\u2019s premiere, Allen\u2019s estranged son Ronan Farrow restated his support for his stepsister Dylan\u2019s claims that Allen sexually assaulted her as a child. But Lafitte told the US trade bible he was unaware of the article when he made his quip, and had intended the comments on rape as a reference to Roman Polanski\u2019s 38-year exile from Hollywood. \u201cWhen I wrote this joke, it was more a joke about Europe and why one of the greatest American directors spent years in Europe, [while Allen] didn\u2019t have to because he wasn\u2019t accused of rape in his own country, compared to Roman Polanski,\u201d said Lafitte, who appears in Paul Verhoeven\u2019s in-competition drama Elle at Cannes. \u201cIt was as a joke about American puritanism and the fact that it is surprising that an American director wants to do so many movies in Europe. I didn\u2019t know about the other stuff.\u201d Allen said on Thursday he was not offended by the joke. \u201cI\u2019m completely in favour of comedians making any jokes they want,\u201d he told reporters at a press lunch for Caf\u00e9 Society, which has been well received at the festival. The film-maker also said he had not read Farrow\u2019s piece in the Hollywood Reporter.   Related: Caf\u00e9 Society review \u2013 Woody Allen's amiable, if insubstantial, tribute to golden-age Hollywood    Lafitte also revealed the Cannes director, Thierry Fremaux, had asked Allen if he was embarrassed by the joke, but the director confirmed he was not. \u201cI wrote the joke three weeks ago,\u201d said the comic. \u201cWhen you listen to Ricky Gervais at the Golden Globes, he says a lot of very nasty stuff. He\u2019s very funny, and I don\u2019t think anyone asks him to explain his jokes the next day.\u201d The actor suggested all his jokes had been carefully vetted in advance. \u201cWhen we did rehearsals the afternoon before the ceremony, Thierry Fremaux and [festival president] Pierre Lescure were pleased with the jokes and all the writing.\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a joke about Nicole Kidman, and Thierry Fremaux asked me if the joke could be embarrassing for her. I didn\u2019t want to embarrass anybody, so I didn\u2019t say the joke.\u201d",
