In the forthcoming work, edited by the backbencher Tristram Hunt, five failed and five successful candidates who stood in English seats at last year\u2019s general election, including the MP and former Ed Miliband adviser Jon Cruddas, reflect on their personal experiences on the doorstep as Labour drifted towards defeat \u2013 and warn that the party has increasingly lost touch with its working-class roots.   Related: A British politician lost her job over a tweet: how to explain it to someone outside the UK    Suzy Stride, who stood unsuccessfully for the Essex seat of Harlow \u2013 in a piece written with her campaign organiser Jacob Quagliozzi \u2013 says Labour\u2019s strategy was to bus in scores of middle-class activists, who looked and sounded very different from many voters. \u201cWithout doubt the most frequent thing people said to us on the doorstep was: \u2018You\u2019re all the same.\u2019 Increasingly, as time went on, we realised that \u2018You\u2019re all the same\u2019 really meant: \u2018You\u2019re nothing like me\u2019 or \u2018You know nothing about my life\u2019 \u2013 and to an extent they were right.\u201d They add: \u201cIncreasingly the Labour party was viewed like middle-class Ryanair passengers having to stomach a couple of hours\u2019 flight with people they shared little in common with. It could be uncomfortable but it got you where you needed to go.\u201d If Labour is to rebuild its electoral fortunes between now and the next general election in 2020, it will need to find a way of appealing to its traditional working-class base, argues the book. To Hunt, this means reclaiming English patriotism. \u201cIf we are in any way serious about taking on anti-politics and reclaiming the cultural affinity of the working class then unnecessary metropolitan squeamishness is simply unacceptable \u2013 nurturing a civic English patriotism is now absolutely essential,\u201d he says. Cruddas, who was responsible for drafting Labour\u2019s manifesto, says Labour concentrated too much on \u201cinstrumentalised economics\u201d, using phrases such as the \u201ccost of living crisis\u201d, instead of appealing to cultural or regional identities. He calls for \u201ca Labour politics of recognition that there is a space for an English Labour party to represent the interests of the English people\u201d. Jeremy Corbyn is carrying out a \u201cconstitutional convention\u201d to consider whether changes to the make-up of British politics \u2013 perhaps including more radical devolution than that promised by the government\u2019s Northern Powerhouse \u2013 should be part of Labour\u2019s appeal to the electorate. But there are also concerns about the attitude of some senior Labour figures. Naushabah Khan, who was the unsuccessful Labour candidate in the byelection for the Kent seat of Rochester and Strood in 2014, uses her essay to vent her fury at the photo tweeted by Emily Thornberry \u2013 then shadow attorney general \u2013 during the campaign of a local house festooned with St George\u2019s flags.           Emily Thornberry on Rochester tweet: I made a mistake     \u201cIn one image Labour had almost destroyed its foundations, displaying a growing detachment from our roots,\u201d she says. \u201cThe irony was not lost as, having grown up in an Asian household where the St George\u2019s flag could be found hanging out of the window during any sporting event, I had also spent the day with my team driving around the constituency in a white van as part of the campaign.\u201d Jamie Reed, the Labour MP for Copeland, warns that Labour has failed to find an answer to the \u201cdeliberately insulting insinuation\u201d, which caught the mood in the run-up to the Scottish independence referendum, that \u201cto be English was to be Tory\u201d. \u201cDaily life looks and feels very different in our deindustrialised towns, struggling rural villages and smaller cities and these communities are now engulfed in a quiet crisis \u2013 not just in the north of England, but in every part of our country,\u201d he said.",
