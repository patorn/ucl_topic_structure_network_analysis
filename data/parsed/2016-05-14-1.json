  "body": "Welcome to Rocky Horror Picture Show meets PGA Tour. As Jason Day stood on a Sawgrass podium on Saturday lunchtime, he had little interest in his breaking of a 36-hole scoring record at the Players Championship. Reaching No1 in the world clearly offers an enhanced level of foresight. Day realised the prospect of the course\u2019s imminent revenge. It duly arrived on a brutal afternoon during which the finest players in golf were made to look stupid as routine. \u201cThat was a bit of a shock,\u201d said Adam Scott. Keegan Bradley dubbed enhanced green speeds in a strengthening breeze as \u201cquestionable\u201d. Sergio Garc\u00eda five-putted on the 6th green. Martin Kaymer, a past champion here, took nine at the 14th. Justin Rose? Two sevens. Even Day was bitten, courtesy of a four-putt on six. \u201cJoke,\u201d was the term Day used to describe conditions at that point. Hideki Matsuyama\u2019s third-round 67 was astonishing, Ken Duke\u2019s 65 touching the realms of remarkable. \u201cIt was crazy tough,\u201d said a bashful Matsuyama. If there is debate to be had as to whether someone reaching Day\u2019s halfway tally highlights an inadequate test, only those of masochistic sporting mind could have enjoyed what transpired thereafter. Golf and entertainment were strangers for a Floridian afternoon. Day, it must also be noted, is hardly a club hacker, unaccustomed to displays of brilliance. Some kind of equilibrium between low scoring and the farce of round three would surely be preferable for all. To the bare statistics. With 18 holes to play, Day sits at 14 under, holding a four-shot lead over Matsuyama, Duke and Alex Cejka. Day\u2019s third-round 73 was saved in part by a chip in for par at the 15th.

McIlroy\u2019s 75 \u2013 including 37 putts \u2013 leaves him nine adrift and needing Sunday snookers. \u201cA few holes were borderline unfair,\u201d said the Northern Irishman. Further comment was not short in appearing. \u201cYou hit putts on the putting green and you get on the 1st green and it\u2019s like \u2013 shit, this is two feet quicker,\u2019\u201d said Ernie Els. Rose said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t have a lot of wind the first few days so the scoring was good. You saw guys in the morning score well and guys in the afternoon not score so well. The course didn\u2019t need that much protecting if you think that the leaders go out in the afternoon.\u201d Billy Horschel joined the party. \u201cI felt like I was putting on dancefloors,\u201d he said. Mark Russell of the PGA Tour offered a defence. \u201cWhat happened today was just kind of a perfect storm,\u201d he said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t expecting a 20mph all day, humidity 30%, not a cloud in the sky. The greens just sped up on us.\u201d Blame the weather forecast, in other words. This unseemly business perhaps allowed Jordan Spieth a much-needed grin. The Texan returned to Sawgrass on Saturday morning to complete a second round that had been disrupted by Friday\u2019s weather. Spieth missed the cut by a stroke, before saying his stunning success of 2015 was having an impact on his frustrations of this year. \u201cNo one ever wants to think that they can\u2019t match what they have done the previous year,\u201d said Spieth. \u201cYou believe that you can get better all the time. I believe that I can be a better player this year than I was last year. \u201cBut in the off days I just need to do a little bit better job of being positive with myself and smiling a bit more, having a bit more fun. I\u2019m beating myself up a little bit too much on the golf course, it\u2019s affecting me and I realise that now. I feel rested, I feel healthy. My ball striking feels great.

It just seems I\u2019m so tense and I just need to get back to the way I enjoy playing golf.\u201d Spieth denied his wounding experience at the Masters, where he let a comfortable lead slip on the Sunday closing stretch, continues to resonate. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s much of a connection to Augusta,\u201d Spieth said. \u201cI just didn\u2019t putt well. If I putted like I putted at the Masters I would be at 10 or 12 under right now. So, I just had an off week with the flat stick. But I had plenty of rest. Again, Augusta seems like a long time ago now, to me. This was a completely new week.\u201d Watching Saturday afternoon carnage unfold with feet up at home in Dallas, Spieth had cause to consider clouds and silver linings.",
