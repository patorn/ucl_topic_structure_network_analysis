  "body": "Four months after he declared a state of emergency in Flint over its toxic water crisis, Barack Obama\u2019s first visit to the Michigan city was as much about repudiating the philosophy of shrunken, hands-off government as it was about the lead-laced liquid that residents still have to drink and bathe in. The president\u2019s address to a restive crowd he called \u201cfeisty\u201d included an obligatory sip of Flint water. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a stunt,\u201d Obama insisted, while stressing that people could drink the water, if it is properly filtered. Flint has become shorthand for the neglect, racism and under-investment that has plagued many cities in the US. For many residents unable or unwilling to drink their own water, pragmatism rather than politics is what is required, sooner rather than later.   Related: Obama in Flint: water crisis is a 'tragedy that never should have happened'    But rather than focus on the practicalities of rebuilding Flint\u2019s water infrastructure two years after a fateful decision was made to switch the supply to the Flint river, without treating it for lead, Obama railed against the \u201ccorrosive attitude\u201d that government should remove itself from people\u2019s lives. \u201cThis myth that government is always the enemy; that forgets that our government is us. It\u2019s us, that it\u2019s an extension of us, ourselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThat attitude is as corrosive to our democracy as the stuff that resulted in lead in your water. Because what happens is it leads to systematic neglect. It leads to carelessness and callousness.\u201d In a pointed assault on modern Republican doctrine, Obama said the problems in Flint are \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg\u201d in a country where infrastructure, and lives, have been allowed to decay. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen bridges fall and levies break,\u201d he said. \u201cSo we\u2019ve got to break that mindset. These things aren\u2019t a coincidence. They\u2019re the same mindset that left Flint\u2019s water unsafe to drink. And it\u2019s self-destructive when we don\u2019t invest in our communities.           Obama drinks Flint water to show residents that it\u2019s safe     \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how hard you work, how responsible you are, or how well you raise your kids \u2013 you can\u2019t set up a whole water system for a city. That\u2019s not something you do by yourself. You do it with other people.\u201d  The merits of basic government functions have even been grasped by Rick Snyder, the Michigan governor who ran an administration that ignored, sidelined and even mocked reports of problems in Flint\u2019s water for more than a year. Thousands of children are at risk of growing up with developmental problems due to the lead poisoning.  Snyder, who ran for office with a promise to run the state more like a business, said he welcomed Obama\u2019s visit and was busy talking up public programs to improve \u201ceducation, medical care and nutrition\u201d in Flint.   The governor has pledged to replace Flint\u2019s lead water pipes and beef up the water testing standards, but it\u2019s clearly not enough for Flint residents. Obama persuaded Snyder to address the crowd en route to the rally. The governor was met with boos and jeers. Meanwhile, protesters were etching the chalk outlines of 12 bodies \u2013 representing those killed in a legionnaire\u2019s outbreak in Flint \u2013 outside Snyder\u2019s residence in Ann Arbor.  But Flint still resembles a city where the root causes of a disaster are being dug up before the symptoms have been treated.   More than two years after lead started to seep into the water supply of a city in the wealthiest country on Earth, people still have to rely on bottled water or filtration, often supplied through charity. Failing, outdated water testing procedures, which touch almost every city east of the Mississippi, are still in place and may only be slightly amended next year. Funding to help Flint has been the topic of unseemly congressional squabbles and delays.    Related: US authorities distorting tests to downplay lead content of water     Around 50 lead pipes have been removed in Flint. A further 500 are earmarked for removal, but the city is scratching around for the funding. More than 70,000 other pipes still need to be ripped up.  Residents are wary to accept promises \u2013 even from Obama \u2013 that the filters work. Showering, which should be safe as long as water isn\u2019t ingested, is also shunned. The response to the disaster was sluggish, maybe criminally so, but even under state and federal state of emergency conditions, the plodding pace has barely lifted.  Flint\u2019s water \u201csmells like bleach\u201d and can\u2019t possibly be safe, according to Lulu Brezzell, the mother of Mari Copeny, the eight-year-old girl who wrote to Obama to ask him to visit Flint.   Marlon Randle, another Flint resident, said Obama\u2019s speech was a boost to the city\u2019s morale but still hadn\u2019t made the water safe to drink. \u201cPeople are worried about the water,\u201d Randle said. \u201cI feel better. It was a good speech and it does reassure me that he\u2019s committed to trying to make a change and help our city get fixed. But it is going to be a process.\u201d Others were more pointed. Flint native and film-maker Michael Moore took to major TV networks to decry the lack of action. On Facebook, Moore said Obama\u2019s visit was \u201ctoo little, too late\u201d. \u201cYou say you\u2019re coming to \u2018listen to the people of Flint\u2019,\u201d Moore wrote. \u201cSir, they\u2019ve been poisoned for two damn years. You\u2019ve known about it since October. There\u2019s nothing to listen to.  \u201cUnless you\u2019re bringing the entire US Army Corps of Engineers to dig up and replace the 75,000 lead pipes, plus the attorney general to arrest governor Rick Snyder, then this is just another photo-op and half-baked list of new promises we don\u2019t need.\u201d On MSNBC, Moore said Obama\u2019s speech was a further example of \u201cthis attitude of not pushing too hard, don\u2019t say out loud what needs to be said. He said it\u2019s a poor city, he\u2019s not saying it\u2019s a black city.  \u201cThe governor removed the black mayors, put in his own cronies, gave the rich a billion-dollar tax cut and had to cut back on services because there wasn\u2019t enough money. One of the services they cut back on was clean drinking water.\u201d",
