  "body": "Wednesday 27 April was Administrative Professionals\u2019 Day, formerly National Secretaries Day \u2013 an annual celebration begun in the US in 1952. A heavily gendered date, it is traditionally an opportunity for florists and chocolatiers. But this year, a movie grabbed a slice of the pie. That movie was Ghostbusters, the forthcoming reboot of the beloved supernatural comedy that sees Melissa McCarthy, Kristen Wiig, Leslie Jones and Kate McKinnon don the jumpsuits once worn by Bill Murray, Dan Aykroyd, Harold Ramis and Ernie Hudson. In Ivan Reitman\u2019s 1984 original, the secretary was Janine: goggle glasses, pixie cut, questionable telephone manner (\u201cWaddya want?\u201d). In Paul Feig\u2019s version, it\u2019s Kevin: a ditzy blond hired for his hunkiness not his shorthand. The clips released to coincide with Administrative Professionals\u2019 Day \u2013 Kevin baffled by the phone, botching the tea run, eagerly drafting inappropriate logos (think busty ghosts) \u2013 brilliantly showcase the gender flip that is one of the movie\u2019s key USPs. The step-change can still leave you giddy. Twelve months ago, Chris Hemsworth, the actor who plays Kevin, was in every multiplex as Thor, he of the unreconstructed chivalry and massive mallet. Off screen, we were still in the early days of the gender inequality debate \u2013 sparked the previous winter by the revelation that Jennifer Lawrence was paid less than her American Hustle co-stars, and stoked by Patricia Arquette, who called for pay parity in her Oscar acceptance speech.         Clips from Ghostbusters released to coincide with Adminstrative Professionals\u2019 Day.    The debate faded a little as other industry inequalities took the spotlight, but it still smoulders on, , and reignited recently by Daniel Radcliffe and Scarlett Johansson. \u201cThe thing I can\u2019t help but think,\u201d said Radcliffe, \u201cis what guy is sitting in a studio somewhere thinking, \u2018Let\u2019s fuck the girls out of some money?\u2019\u201d New studies revealed only one in five European films is directed by a woman \u2013 and all movies being made by two major Hollywood studios (Sony and Paramount) over the next two years will be directed by men. Yet the schedules tell a different story: although most women may still be getting a rough deal backstage, at the cinema, female films are front-and-centre. Not just that. These are female-led films that don\u2019t just feature women mopping up after one another\u2019s heartbreaks, but exploring their own careers and, crucially, their friendships with each other. So we have the return of Bolly bezzies Edwina and Patsy in Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie; Tina Fey and Margot Robbie bonding beneath the bombs in Whiskey Tango Foxtrot; Kate Beckinsale and Chlo\u00eb Sevigny cackling happily in Love & Friendship, Greta Gerwig snuggling with one-time love-rival Julianne Moore in Maggie\u2019s Plan; Mila Kunis and Kristen Bell swapping horror stories in Bad Moms, and Bell (again) enjoying a slow-burn buddy-up with Melissa McCarthy (again) in The Boss.

Despite tepid reviews, it still proved victorious over Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice at the box office. Tina Fey can get a farce set in a contemporary warzone greenlit. McCarthy has star wattage enough to put even superheroes in the shade. The mother of these major summer movies is, of course, Ghostbusters. Anticipation for that reached fever pitch months ago, around the release of its first trailer, which has now been seen more than 60m times. This is a movie on which much rides. Its success would be a game-changer. Its failure would turn back the clock on much of the progress made so far. So who ya gonna call to find out how this kind of responsibility feels? Down the line from Los Angeles, Feig doesn\u2019t sound too fussed. He has been here before, after all: with box office-crushing Bridesmaids (2011) \u2013 still the best-performing Judd Apatow movie (he produced it) \u2013 and then at two-yearly intervals with The Heat (2013), the first truly funny female buddy cop movie, and Spy (2015), in which McCarthy out-ballsed James Bond. Yes, Feig says, \u201cmanaging and meeting and exceeding expectations\u201d is a challenge. \u201cBut I would hope we weren\u2019t being made the test case for whether women can star in tentpoles or not. That kind of litmus test just wouldn\u2019t be fair to women. If a movie starring a man comes out and bombs, people just think the movie didn\u2019t work. They don\u2019t say: \u201c\u2018Oh, well, OK! No more men in movies!\u2019\u201d     Kate Beckinsale and Chlo\u00eb Sevigny in Love & Friendship. Photograph: Westerly Films/Photoshot    But the fact that the film business does still react like this stems, he thinks, from its creation of a mythology to support the status quo. \u201cWhich is: men won\u2019t go to see these movies starring women. Hollywood\u2019s always looking for a way to get out of a risky situation and if people are still considering movies starring women to be risky \u2013 well, that\u2019s very unfair to the women.\u201d When he was starting out, Feig says, he would pitch a project with a female lead, only to be told it wasn\u2019t an option because: \u201cMen won\u2019t go see that movie, and in foreign markets movies with women don\u2019t do so well.\u201d The only way to refute this, he says, was to prove them wrong. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say there should be more great roles for women, but if you don\u2019t create them it\u2019s all lip-service. You gotta put your money where your mouth is and actually do it. Everybody in positions of power \u2013 especially men but women too \u2013 has gotta step up.\u201d The venom behind some of the reaction to the new Ghostbusters casting could be seen to confirm a sense that some men simply aren\u2019t interested in stories about the opposite sex. Last year, Feig called some of the comments \u201cvile, misogynistic shit\u201d; today, he questions the relevance of that backlash. The bigger problem, he thinks, lies with the internet \u2013 \u201cwhich puts a small minority of voices into a sort of bullhorn\u201d \u2013 and the media, which amplify this negativity. \u201cIt makes me sad that informs every article now. There\u2019s always some comment about how people are down on it. Well, somebody is down on everything. It\u2019s very easy once you\u2019re predisposed to be pissed about something to watch it and find fault.\u201d Plus, people are conditioned by what they see on screen. There is a duty to broaden that scope and try to persuade people out of such prejudice. \u201cHollywood has created a situation in which women come off as bad or subservient or unlikable or boring because those are the roles written for them. What character looks great telling the hero that he shouldn\u2019t be saving the world, that he should be spending more time with his family? Nobody!     Bad Moms. Photograph: Allstar/STX Entertainment    \u201cSo guys go: \u2018There\u2019s another woman doing what my mom does or my wife does, just browbeats me and yells at me all the time.\u2019 And it\u2019s like: \u2018Yeah, because somebody wrote it that way. They didn\u2019t give her another dimension.\u2019 So it all spirals down the vortex and you\u2019re stuck.\u201d McCarthy knows that claustrophobia. \u201cIf you don\u2019t give actors tools,\u201d she has said, \u201cinsecurities, bad habits and quirks and ticks, you\u2019re just playing \u2018blonde and leggy\u2019. Those aren\u2019t character choices, those are physical descriptions \u2026 All humans go up and down and have their good days and bad days; it\u2019s what makes them interesting.\u201d Yet there is a further curiosity here. This summer\u2019s female-friendship movies do not just share a theme and a gender but a genre, too. They are all comedies. Could it be that this is another reason women\u2019s stories can be taken less seriously? Cinema has long prized drama over everything else. The lighter something appears, the easier it is to dismiss. Feig isn\u2019t sure. Young adult franchises such as Hunger Games and Divergent changed the game too, he says; but rather than being female ensembles, they were films in which a leading lady is usually flanked by a couple of would-be boyfriends. He makes comedies, he says, because that seems the best way of allowing for the greatest complexity. \u201cI don\u2019t like this term \u2018strong female characters\u2019 because that implies if a woman is gonna be in a comedy she\u2019s gotta be tough and invincible and not vulnerable and to act more like a man. That\u2019s almost as bad as not having women in a movie.\u201d              Here, he thinks, lies the biggest pitfall in trying to fast-track progress: you need to start from scratch. \u201cProgress is not simply having women act like men. We need to make sure all the characters are fully fleshed-out. Men and women need to police each other to ensure stereotypes are dodged: crews must always be mixed, people must always speak out. I\u2019m still a guy. I\u2019m still going to come up with ideas I think would be funny and then a woman will say: \u2018We would never say that.\u2019\u201d One of the funniest moments in the trailer for the new Ghostbusters involves Wiig and McCarthy apologising for speaking over one another. The line in the original film regularly voted the best involves Murray calling someone \u201cdickless\u201d. How swiftly insults can sound like assets.",
