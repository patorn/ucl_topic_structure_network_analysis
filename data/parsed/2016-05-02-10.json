The awards are unique in focusing on the arts in their entirety and are due to take place in London on 5 June. Other nominations include an embroidery of the Magna Carta by artist Cornelia Parker, Northern Ballet\u2019s 1984 and the Almeida theatre\u2019s politically charged contemporary production of Aeschylus\u2019s Oresteia. There are 10 categories, including dance, opera, comedy, TV drama, literature, classical music, pop, film, visual art and theatre, along with the Times breakthrough award, which recognises up-and-coming talent and an outstanding achievement award.

In a statement, Bragg said the awards are a snapshot of a unique moment in British cultural history. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s when 30 nominees in 10 categories meet to celebrate the best work being done by artists in this country across a wide range of ages and backgrounds. There are world-class performances, the awards of scholarships to new artists on top of the awards to the winners, judged by an independent panel, all resulting in a 90-minute programme that gives us a rich picture of where we are now in an area of achievement in which at the moment Britain can claim to be in a dominating position.\u201d Phil Edgar-Jones, director of Sky Arts, said the awards \u201cbring together probably the most inspiring room full of creative people it\u2019s possible to assemble\u201d. Twenty years ago, in the inaugural awards, classic sitcom Father Ted won the comedy award, while performances from David Suchet and Diana Rigg in Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? secured a win in the theatre category and Matthew Bourne\u2019s retelling of Swan Lake won in the dance category. Through the years, other winners have included Seamus Heaney, Amy Winehouse, Alan Bennett, Gilbert and George, Grayson Perry, FKA Twigs, Rachel Whiteread, Antony Gormley, Florence + the Machine, Kate Bush, Ted Hughes and Hilary Mantel. Winners of multiple South Bank Sky Arts awards in their individual categories include artist Anish Kapoor, director Shane Meadows, band Arctic Monkeys, director Sam Mendes, author Ian McEwan and playwright Michael Frayn. Frayn also went on to win the outstanding achievement award in 2012. Other outstanding achievement award winners over the years include Peter Hall, Harold Pinter, Tom Stoppard, Helen Mirren, Richard Attenborough, JK Rowling, the Who, Judi Dench, Julie Walters, Tracey Emin and last year\u2019s winner, Sylvie Guillem.
