  "body": "A foregone conclusion in the battle for Brisbane is that the winner will not be a straight man. Sexuality, gender and military experience are threads linking what is likely to be the most diverse set of campaigners in a single seat this federal election. In short, the field in one of the country\u2019s key battlegrounds is a bigot\u2019s nightmare.  It is the first time both major parties have fielded openly gay candidates in the same seat. Trevor Evans for the Liberal National party is the intellectually precise, diplomatic National Retail Association boss, a one-time interrogator of business shonks for the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission who cut his teeth running political campaigns as chief of staff for Peter Dutton. Pat O\u2019Neill is the ebullient former cavalry commander and Iraq veteran who has had a nine-month head start campaigning for Labor, and for a fleeting moment this year was relishing the prospect of taking on former Brisbane mayor and Queensland premier Campbell Newman. O\u2019Neill\u2019s campaign manager, Lucy Finlay, is a transgender woman whom he first met in their first year together at the Australian Defence Force Academy 18 years ago.   Related: Queensland: up to 10 LNP seats could change hands in federal election    Then there is Bridget Clinch, a transgender former army captain who served in Timor-Leste and has found an unexpected platform for an array of progressive stances in her first tilt at politics with the Veterans party.  It was Clinch who cleared a path for the likes of Cate McGregor when she singlehandedly forced the military to abandon its former policy on gender reassignment \u2013 that it was a \u201cpsychiatric disorder\u201d and grounds for dismissal \u2013 in a David and Goliath battle against the brass and their lawyers. Standing for the Greens is Kirsten Lovejoy, a climate change policy analyst with the state\u2019s environment department. She has the party\u2019s best shot to date at making Brisbane one of its lower house seats, alongside Melbourne. By the Greens\u2019 reckoning, taking just under 4,000 primary votes from Labor would do it. Lovejoy says the field \u201cshows how progressive we are, that so many people with diverse backgrounds can stand up and represent their parties regardless of who they are\u201d.  The seat takes in the city\u2019s central business district and its inner northern suburbs, including its wealthiest postcodes. Evans, meeting Guardian Australia at a Paddington cafe where the morning latte sippers include the rugby league legend Darren Lockyer, entered the fray just a month ago after the abrupt resignation of incumbent Teresa Gambaro, who held Brisbane with a 4.3% margin. He says the electorate is part of a south-east Queensland region distinguished by its status as a \u201cgreat egalitarian melting pot\u201d.

Photograph: Carole Margand    \u201cThe reason that the prime minister and the opposition leader made Brisbane their first stop [of the campaign] is that compared with most other places around Australia, there are a lot of marginal seats here and [that] is because the suburbs are so blended and egalitarian,\u201d Evans says. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a great lifestyle here, where on the same street and around the same suburbs you find all sorts of people from different walks of life. What that means is naturally it\u2019s marginal electorate territory.\u201d The gentrification of the one-time inner blue-collar suburbs including New Farm and Fortitude Valley means this is less so than in the past.  Lovejoy points out that the electorate is Queensland\u2019s homelessness capital, with four times the rate of people sleeping rough than in the rest of state. Clinch says they include some veterans at the sharp end of post-service trauma, whose needs, of better-funded support and mental health services, are part of the solutions for a much broader group. \u201cThe way I see it is, all the veterans\u2019 issues \u2013 suicide, homelessness, mental health and healthcare \u2013 they\u2019re definitely real veteran issues and the stats are pretty horrible, but unfortunately they\u2019re wider societal issues too,\u201d she says.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got PTSD in society, DV victims, all sorts of emergency services and first responders, so if you\u2019re looking after one you\u2019re looking after all.\u201d O\u2019Neill says the voters of Brisbane are \u201cswitched on\u201d and party loyalty has given way to a focus on policy delivery, values and future vision. Political analyst Paul Williams says a decisive class of voter is likely to be the \u201cdoctors\u2019 spouses\u201d who are \u201cstraight, with kids, very high household incomes, big house in an inner-city suburb \u2013 well-heeled but soft-left social\u201d. \u201cThose people will swing it, I think \u2013 they\u2019re the sort of people that Malcolm Turnbull originally had and should still have but seems to have lost his grip on because he\u2019s compromised with the right in that party.\u201d     Kirsten Lovejoy, the Greens candidate for Brisbane. Photograph: Ben Pennings/Queensland Greens    Marriage equality is important to them, Williams says, and is an obvious issue to address given the make-up of the ballot sheet. All four candidates are in favour. But Evans argues its best chance of introduction is with Turnbull as prime minister getting it over the line in a plebiscite in the next term of government.  \u201cIf it wasn\u2019t achieved in that way, if there were groups around the community that felt like their voices were not heard or were marginalised, the very real risk that we run is that will delegitimise the outcome and the issue will continue to be a contentious one that continues to play out in politics for years or even decades afterwards,\u201d he says. \u201cI understand there are people who feel very strongly about this on both sides and nobody should be in doubt about how strongly held those views are.\u201d O\u2019Neill fires up at the thought of opponents casting a vote on what he sees as his and others\u2019 fundamental right to equality, denied by a Marriage Act he rates as \u201cone of the most un-Australian pieces of legislation currently\u201d. \u201cThose bigots and bullies are the people who have been marginalising LGBTI Australians,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that I have to go and ask permission to be treated equally in the country that I spent 18 years representing in the army. \u201cIf Malcolm Turnbull wants to force me to go doorknock and ask people one by one for permission to be treated equally, to be honest, he can go and get stuffed.\u201d  Lovejoy says the mood she detects in Brisbane is \u201cmake it happen already, what\u2019s the delay?\u201d A plebiscite would \u201conly raise the ire of people and the potential for hatred, and people in the LGBTI community are really worried about that. We\u2019re already talking about a vulnerable community.\u201d  Clinch says the Veterans party, likewise, thinks the government should \u201cget on with it\u201d without a plebiscite, adding that Labor \u201ctotally fumbled marriage equality\u201d when last in power. When she first looked at the Veterans party, Clinch admits, she was \u201cscared, thinking we don\u2019t need another rightwing, single-issue party\u201d but was surprised by the breadth and progressive nature of its policies. This includes ending offshore detention for asylum seekers \u201cbecause they see it as not meeting our requirements under the [UN] convention and wasting a lot of money to be cruel\u201d, as well as no new coalmines. These issues put the Veterans party on the same page as the Greens, clearly separating both from Labor and the LNP in a seat where that policy daylight could matter. Williams says Brisbane is \u201cwhat you might call a groovy seat, full of post-material voters, fairly young, better educated and [they] earn more money than the average, probably live in single households or with a partner and no children\u201d.  \u201cThat\u2019s why Greens do so well there, they\u2019re concerned about refugees, gay rights, women\u2019s rights and the environment, etc,\u201d he says. O\u2019Neill insists there are \u201cdefinite points of difference between the LNP and Labor\u201d on asylum policy, \u201ca really complex issue on which there are a broad variety of opinions [but] no neat solution\u201d. \u201cNobody wants to see people drowning at sea, everyone wants to see people treated with dignity and respect,\u201d he says. \u201cNobody wants to see people pouring petrol over themselves and lighting a match.\u201d Asked if Labor can do anything about that, O\u2019Neill replies: \u201cAbsolutely [but] there\u2019s no simple solution. [We should] work towards a regional solution, funding the UNHCR, decreasing the times that people are kept in detention, which have doubled under the LNP [which] does nothing for their mental state.  \u201cI\u2019d like to have a simple neat solution or a defined opinion but I think it\u2019s something that needs to be discussed, it needs to be worked through in a pragmatic manner, because it is a subject that people get emotional about and I think it\u2019s an important subject to talk about.\u201d  O\u2019Neill, whose last act before retiring from the Australian military this week was to receive a filling at the dentist, did two tours of Iraq. They involved providing security for the Australian ambassador in Baghdad, Japanese engineers and training the Iraqi army. He says the experience shaped his view of how the \u201cwar on terrorism\u201d has played out domestically and concerns that the Coalition\u2019s national security campaigns taint the Muslim community. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the reasons I want to go into politics, because marginalising elements of society does nothing for security,\u201d he says. \u201cWe improve security by finding things that connect us as Australians and communities rather than pointing out the things that make us different.\u201d Evans, who hails from a long line of shopkeepers and retailers and was the first in his family to go to university, speaks of concerns such as managing growth in Brisbane and the role of the commonwealth in backing road and transport projects through investment and planning assistance. He says that while openly gay, \u201cI don\u2019t wear my sexuality on my sleeve,\u201d and that it \u201cclearly didn\u2019t play a role\u201d in his preselection. \u201cAnd I hope it doesn\u2019t play too much of a role at the upcoming election as well. \u201cIf I\u2019m successful being elected, I\u2019m confident that there\u2019ll be enough meaty policy issues to get involved with whereby I\u2019ll become known as the one who fights for all sorts of local issues like jobs and growth and property prices, you name it,\u201d he says. \u201cI think that my record as it becomes established will sweep away any impressions or labels that people might be attracted to and people instead see somebody who\u2019s really hard-working, really involved in the local community and is accessible and broadly speaking a good local representative.\u201d Evans faced a minor blip at the start of his campaign when BuzzFeed came across a biography page that contained chunks of a template from a fictional US senator which the candidate says he thought was being developed on his website beyond public view. \u201cI assume it took someone with some serious IT skills who managed to reach in behind the public website,\u201d he says. \u201cWe live and learn. We move on.\u201d Williams says Evans is \u201cno dud\u201d but is nevertheless a \u201cJohnny come lately\u201d to the campaign after Gambaro\u2019s 11th-hour departure, with a \u201cparticularly well-suited\u201d candidate in O\u2019Neill giving Labor an advantage. \u201cThe cynic might wonder about the other side preselecting a certain candidate in response to what the other side have done, as part of a zero-sum game of politics,\u201d Williams says. \u201cI\u2019m not saying they did but the cynic might think that.\u201d The loss of the incumbent Gambaro echoes the Brisbane city council election in March, when the Greens snagged their first local government representative in Queensland off the back of a retiring popular Labor member. The development gave Labor strategists serious pause for thought. Williams says the Greens\u2019 prospects in Brisbane, while not quite as strong as in Melbourne or Sydney, are now \u201cin the ballpark, they\u2019re at least in the neighbourhood\u201d. He calls Brisbane a \u201cmust win\u201d seat for Labor. \u201cLabor has a head start with O\u2019Neill, an appealing candidate. He\u2019d be leading by a pretty big margin, I would\u2019ve thought, because he\u2019s been in the field a lot longer. \u201cThat makes the task for the Greens that much harder because he will be a tough candidate to beat. They\u2019ve picked him well. The LNP haven\u2019t picked a dud either but the Labor candidate is particularly well-suited. \u201cBut the Greens, if they double their vote and Labor falls a couple points behind, will win on Labor preferences. It\u2019s still unlikely at this stage but it\u2019s never been more possible.\u201d That\u2019s partly due to the changing demography of the inner city, the \u201cfairly lacklustre appeal of both major parties this time around\u201d, and the lack of \u201cgripping, polarising election issues\u201d that galvanise voters to back the traditional parties. Lovejoy is taking heart at this. \u201cFor a long time, people thought, \u2018Yes, we agree with Greens policies but what\u2019s the point?\u2019 \u201cWell, now there\u2019s a point, now they can feel they can actually get their voice heard in parliament and they are signing up to get involved because they know there could be a very real prospect here of having a Greens voice in the lower house.\u201d",
