  "body": "I\u2019m still summoning up the courage to tell my daughter how old I am. At six, I think Flora suspects. She keeps asking me \u2013 and I keep deflecting her. \u201cSo what do you want for your birthday?\u201d Or: \u201cLet\u2019s skip down the road.\u201d We need a proper conversation, not just a number. I need to tell her why I\u2019m older than other mothers at her school (and after writing this, I had better get on with it). But goodness me, I\u2019m not as old as Daljinder Kaur, who is reported to have given birth last month at 70. She had two years of treatment using donor eggs from the National Fertility and Test Tube Baby Centre in Hisar, in India\u2019s northern state of Haryana. Kaur is quoted as saying: \u201cI feel so full of energy.\u201d Now, I\u2019m not going to cast aspersions on any woman\u2019s right to have a baby (or even if the reports are accurate). How could I? Kaur may be older than me, but her egg would have been younger than mine. Would I have a baby at 70? I can\u2019t imagine doing so. It would magnify the concerns I had about giving birth at 48 to an unfathomable size. My pregnancy \u2013 which I wrote about in a column for the Guardian \u2013 was unplanned and a shock of considerable proportions. First, I feared I would die of a haemorrhage, leaving my other four children motherless. Second, I thought I would be a hideous embarrassment to my child, in ways that would only rise in a linear fashion for ever. Maybe straight off I should pretend to be the granny? But mixed with my self-obsession was the awareness of my ingratitude. Some women, such as Kaur, live their whole lives yearning for a child. \u201cShe\u2019ll be a blessing,\u201d my friends said at the time. Turns out she was. Meanwhile I repeatedly run the maths in my head \u2013 will I make it to see her reach 30? My husband and I virtually gave up drinking in pursuit of this aim after celebrating her birth. Occasionally, we say \u201cwe\u2019re too old for this\u201d if she comes into our room at 6am on a Saturday. But generally we keep up with her. The parents at Flora\u2019s school are lovely people who pretend they don\u2019t notice I\u2019m nearly old enough to be some of their mothers. And I bloody love it. I love the chance to have another go at motherhood, knowing there is more slack in the system than I thought. That giving her chocolate for breakfast, letting her wear dressing-up costumes in winter to the shops \u2013 that none of it matters. I enjoy \u2013 I really do enjoy \u2013 the every moment of her. When the teenagers, whom you swear were only six a blink of a moment ago, are complaining that you are killing their vibe, it makes you extremely grateful to have a child who wants to cuddle you. What does Flora get out of this? A mother and father who are better parents than they used to be and older sisters who adore her. Last week I heard Flora praying: \u201cI hope mummy never dies and that I always stay a child.\u201d Amen to that, Flo.",
