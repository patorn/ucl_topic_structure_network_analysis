  "body": "When Claudio Ranieri was appointed as manager last summer I was buzzing. With my family being Italian, I was thinking: \u201cThis was going to be incredible.\u201d My prediction was that we could finish in the top 10 and we could win a cup. But everybody thought I was insane. I started getting texts from my pals \u2013 which I\u2019ve saved \u2013 saying: \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What are they thinking?\u201d   Related: Leicester City and the greatest underdog story ever told: a primer for Americans    The stars have aligned because for the past 12 years Kasabian has missed huge chunks of the season by being away on tour \u2013 watching games in Tokyo hotel rooms. But this season Tom Meighan, our singer, and I have managed to see most of it. We\u2019ve been to home games and, with friends having magic boxes that stream away games, I\u2019ve seen every kick. There have been so many great moments. Jamie Vardy making history with the goal against United was such a special moment. When he did it there was the kind of cheer you hardly ever hear \u2013 everyone knew it was special. And beating Manchester City away 3-1 and the manner in which we did it \u2013 that was when you felt the bubble wasn\u2019t going to burst. I first started thinking we could qualify for the Champions League when we were still top at Christmas, then carried on picking up points in January. I thought that if we kept everyone fit until the end of the season, I didn\u2019t see why we couldn\u2019t finish in the top four. But you always worry something mad will happen \u2013 what if we lost Riyad Mahrez for weeks? \u2013 because I didn\u2019t think we had the depth in the squad if it did.           \u2018Walt Disney wouldn\u2019t script this\u2019 \u2013 Leicester City champions    The emotions at the games in the last few weeks have been incredible. Those 1-0 wins against Watford, Palace. You grind away and then you get that one chance on the break.  The last 10 minutes of these games have been horrendous \u2013 it reminded me of our experiences at Wembley in the playoffs and that horrible feeling when your whole season rests on those 90 minutes. The games have been hard to watch because they have meant so much, although watching Spurs against West Brom was the worst I\u2019ve felt \u2013 probably worse than watching Leicester. We need to mention Andy King, who\u2019s been with Leicester 10 years through the hard times in the lower divisions. He\u2019s a wonderful player and when he does come in and play he\u2019s slotted in and dug it out. That link he has to the past creates a bond with the fans.    Related: The season of the fearless foxes, Leicester City \u2013 in pictures    And it mattered that we didn\u2019t spend a lot of money on players, even in the January transfer window \u2013 we were right in the mix and we could have had the owners demanding a marquee signing.  But we didn\u2019t do that. We didn\u2019t sign anyone. That was a real turning point because the players who were there felt they had been trusted. I could feel the players respond. I hope they continue that way. I think they\u2019re clever enough to realise what they\u2019ve built, because we\u2019ve all seen other sides make that mistake of going out and spending too much.  But winning the Premier League? After that, even if we get relegated and we\u2019re in the conference in 10 years, I won\u2019t care. We\u2019ll always have that.  As for next season: we all live in Leicester so all my pals are coming in and we\u2019re having a Champions League draw party \u2013 it\u2019s already on the calendar. As soon as we find out who we\u2019re playing it\u2019s straight online to book tickets and flights. I fancy Bar\u00e7a or Real and it would be nice for Ranieri to go back to Roma. Everyone loves us this year but I know as soon as next season starts, all the other fans will be singing: \u201cWhere were you when you were shit?\u201d And we\u2019ve got the perfect answer: \u201cBeating you when you were shit.\u201d  Serge Pizzorno is guitarist and songwriter for Kasabian",
