In an interview with the UK\u2019s Daily Star, Clarke said, \u201cI have a lot of unrealised dreams. I would love to play Jane Bond. My ultimate leading man would be Leonardo DiCaprio. No doubt about it.\u201d   Related: It's Bond, Jane Bond: Gillian Anderson throws hat into the ring to be next 007    Clarke made the comments while promoting her drama Me Before You, the 29-year-old\u2019s first major leading romantic role. The self-nomination comes on the heels of The X-Files star Gillian Anderson retweeting a fan made poster casting her as the next 007 agent along with the words: \u201cIt\u2019s Bond, Jane Bond.\u201d Not everyone is interested in a gender swapped version of Bond. The Guardian\u2019s film editor, Catherine Shoard, said in an editorial that the campaign to make Bond female \u201csits oddly\u201d with a vision of a world in which women leaders effect progress by adopting an approach not previously applied. \u201cShouldn\u2019t we be cooking up new heroines, rather than just sticking old ones in a frock?\u201d      But among fans speculation over who will nab the coveted role from the current Bond actor, Daniel Craig, remains rife. At this point it is hard to find a British actor of a certain vintage who hasn\u2019t been mentioned, with Tom Hiddleston, Aidan Turner, Idris Elba, Damian Lewis and Billy Elliot star Jamie Bell all having their names tossed around by both fans and film industry pundits. The franchise\u2019s outgoing director, Sam Mendes, recently told audiences at the UK\u2019s Hay festival that the decision lay in the hands of producer Barbara Broccoli and that the final choice \u201cwill not be what you expect\u201d. \u201cThere\u2019s this constant debate about who\u2019s going to be the next Bond,\u201d he said. \u201cThe truth is \u2013 and here\u2019s the headline \u2013 it\u2019s not a democracy. It\u2019s not the X Factor, it\u2019s not the EU referendum, it\u2019s not a public vote.\u201d   Related: Jane Bond is just James in a frock. We need a new heroine | Catherine Shoard    Bookmakers recently suspended betting on Hiddleston landing the gig after reports he was seen meeting with Mendes and Broccoli in London. The most unexpected person to play Bond may be Craig himself who \u2013 while not exactly sounding keen on it (at one point he said he would rather slash his wrists) \u2013 has not actually ruled out returning to the role.",
