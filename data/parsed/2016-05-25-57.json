  "body": "When I read the Arthur Ransome books in the late 1950s Titty, while not a familiar name, had no other connotations, and certainly not for someone of my age (Titty\u2019s family \u2018furious\u2019 over name change for Swallows and Amazons film, 25 May). Now, I suspect that any 10-year-old would hear it and snigger, which militates against the innocence that the Altounyan family are aiming to preserve. Given that the second letter of the name has to be a vowel, Tatty seems about the only plausible alternative, even if it does suggest a degree of dishevelment.Henry MaltBythorn, Cambridgeshire \u2022 There is a DIY recession that George Osborne has forgotten (Letters, 25 May; Report, 23 May). In 1988 Nigel Lawson cancelled mortgage interest relief at source for unmarried couples, but delayed its introduction for a year. This resulted in a unsustainable spike in house prices as the deadline loomed, followed by a crash, leaving a huge number of people in negative equity. The Conservatives always called it a \u201cworld recession\u201d, but it was a uniquely UK one, made by Lawson himself.Andrew PalmerLondon \u2022 Growing up in the 1940s and 50s, I\u00a0was unaware of these \u201cinfection parties\u201d (Letters, 25 May), but as my grandmother was the first child in her family to make it to adulthood, three siblings having died of \u201cthe usual childhood infections\u201d (measles, scarlet fever and whooping cough), I doubt if they would have cut much ice with my parents. These diseases can kill.Isabel MonkLondon \u2022 Stuart Heritage (G2, 25 May) thinks David Cameron\u2019s purchase of a Micra was an attempt to look normal? And there was me thinking it was a pitch for a post-prime-ministerial job as Top Gear presenter.Sue WallaceThame, Oxfordshire \u2022 Eric Cantona hits 50 and gets a crossword (24 May). Bob Dylan reaches 75 and barely a mention. Come on, Guardian. Billy MorrisonAyr  \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
