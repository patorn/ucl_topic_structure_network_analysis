  "body": "Virgil Hunter has said Amir Khan can be boxing\u2019s \u201cnew No1\u201d if he defies all predictions and beats Sa\u00fal \u201cCanelo\u201d \u00c1lvarez here on Saturday night \u2013 but the Californian trainer admitted: \u201cIf he loses focus, it could be over in a blink.\u201d   Related: Amir Khan, the road to Vegas \u2013 in pictures    Hunter, one of the sport\u2019s cannier individuals, sounded as if he were drawing up a get-out clause for himself and his fighter, adding: \u201cHe has to take one round at a time. That\u2019s what I will be saying to him this week and on fight night. He\u2019s a joy to train and his instinct is to fight his way out of situations \u2013 not to manoeuvre, not to think his way out, fight his way out. \u201cA lot of times, you can\u2019t change that. But you can train him as to what part of the terrain to fight on and what part of the terrain not to fight on. In the end, you have to let him be himself and hope that what you drilled him on shows up in the fight. \u201cIn all great fighters like him, there\u2019s a great fight in him somewhere. It just takes a moment like this and it can be called up. From the time he started boxing, from the Olympic silver medal to the first world title to his second one, that fight is in him and he can beat anybody in that moment. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve seen the best of him yet because he\u2019s never been out-boxed in a fight. \u201cHe could be the new No1 but, in boxing, the promoters and the media, they can say what they want to say. What a fighter\u2019s peers say, that is most important because that\u2019s where the most respect comes from. He can be the man if he wins and he should feel like he\u2019s the man. It can do a lot of good things for him and his career, however long he goes. It would be a catapult to bring everything to fruition, from the first day he started up to this point.\u201d There are some encouraging thoughts there, but Hunter turned a few heads when he proclaimed recently that Khan could have been a global superstar on a par with Floyd Mayweather Jr had he been part of his stable from an early age. It was a put-down for all his past trainers, including Freddie Roach, who remains bitter about his split with Khan four years ago. Roach made his name with Manny Pacquiao. Khan\u2019s latest gnomic muse gets his self-belief from his attachment to one fighter, Andre Ward, one of the sport\u2019s elusive geniuses, who has been with him since he was nine years old.           Amir Khan: it\u2019s my time to hold WBC middleweight title    Did Hunter reckon he had improved on Roach\u2019s work with Khan? \u201cThat\u2019s already been proved in my estimation,\u201d he replied. \u201cWhen you look at what we have done and how he\u2019s done it, I think it proves what we have worked on is beginning to show and has shown. But Saturday night, because of the name and magnitude of it all, will be much more significant.\u201d It is a fight that could end Khan\u2019s career or push him to a level he cannot have imagined was within his grasp down at welterweight. Hunter admitted he was not initially keen on the fight because of the difference in weight and power. \u201cI hadn\u2019t seen him in a while and the first thing that came into my mind was the size disparity. But he came in pretty good shape. One of the conditioning coaches went over to see him eight weeks before he got here. He was here five weeks before they even confirmed the fight. When he told me what he wanted, his answers let me know we could dare to go for it and be great. \u201cThe [Luis] Collazo fight and the [Devon] Alexander fight proved that, when his mind is really locked in, he can pull out a fight which makes it very hard to beat him. I think he\u2019s got more levels to that and in this fight, because there are elements of danger in every minute and every second, we could see that.\u201d   Related: Amir Khan and Canelo \u00c1lvarez team up against Donald Trump    Khan said earlier in the week he would not quit boxing until he won another title. Hunter is not convinced. \u201cI pay more attention to the walk than the talk, but I encourage him to back up everything he says. I would like to support him on that. Time will tell; it\u2019s hard for me to look past Saturday. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what Canelo truly weighs because he is weighed before a fight with his clothes on. They do that. Once you\u2019re 160lbs and you can fight, it really doesn\u2019t matter what weight the other guy is. A middleweight can knock a heavyweight out. I think he\u2019s big enough, whatever Canelo weighs. \u201cAmir can use his speed to win on points, which is logical. I\u2019ve seen kids cut up by Amir. If Canelo gets hit in an area where there are nerve endings, you may see something happen. Catch him on the temple, behind the ear, on the point of the chin \u2026 you never know.\u201d Fighters and trainers win together. They should lose together, as well, but sometimes that does not happen. While Hunter might not like to admit it, he is fighting on Saturday night too, for his vaunted reputation.",
