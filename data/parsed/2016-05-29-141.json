  "body": "The Rautio Piano Trio, which specialises in period\u00a0performance, was established at the Royal Academy of Music and at the International Musicians Seminar, Prussia Cove in Cornwall. This is their debut recording for Resonus. Pianist Jan Rautio here plays a fortepiano (tuned to A=430\u00a0Hz in unequal temperament), with cellist Adi Tal and violinist Jane Gordon using gut strings and lighter, shorter bows. The result is playing of great agility and intimacy which immediately solves some of the balance problems in Mozart\u2019s trios when played on a modern grand, especially in accompanying figures. It\u2019s an impressive achievement, a disc to return to often.",
