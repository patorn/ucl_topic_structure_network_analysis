  "body": "Three places loom large in Mujila\u2019s award-winning debut, translated by Roland Glasser. The City-State\u2019s train station is a great, gutted metal structure where writer Lucien arrives from the Back-Country, on the run from the \u201cfog of his past\u201d. Tram 83 is a pulsating bar, fuelled by dog kebabs, great music and bad booze, where his old friend Requiem takes him for a drink. And Hope Mine is the source of the City-State\u2019s prosperity and misery, its tunnels holding diamonds and cobalt. The City-State is based on Lubumbashi, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and while Lucien\u2019s attempts to publish an elaborate play about Africa\u2019s collective memory supply a narrative arc, the book is really about a dark, surreal place and its denizens. There\u2019s the singer who looks like Maria Callas and speaks Wolof and Etruscan; the police chief who pumps Bach and Shostakovich into cells on a strict schedule; the drunken gangster obsessed with French cinema. At once a grim account of neocolonialism and a comic tale of late-night urban mayhem, this vigorous, hip and brilliant work takes a while to warm up but ends up gripping like a vice. \u2022 To order Tram 83 for \u00a37.19 (RRP \u00a38.99) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.
