The Everton manager is expected to lose his job before the final game of the campaign against Norwich City on Sunday following a dire run of form and a second poor Premier League season. David Unsworth, the under-21s coach, is in line to take charge for that match. Mart\u00ednez\u2019s team have won only one of their past 10 matches and their latest anaemic away performance, Wednesday\u2019s 3-0 reverse at Sunderland, came with the manager demanding a reaction to a feeble 3-1 loss at Leicester City on Saturday. Mart\u00ednez and his players were on a scheduled day off from the club\u2019s Finch Farm training ground on Thursday.   Related: Frank de Boer to leave Ajax after agent says Dutchman would love Everton job    Mart\u00ednez\u2019s three-year tenure will be brought to end when Everton have finalised the terms of his exit with the Spaniard\u2019s representatives. The 42-year-old has three years remaining on the lucrative contract he was given by Everton at the end of his first season in charge in 2014. The manager is believed to earn at least \u00a33m a year and the club\u2019s hierarchy faces a substantial severance payment for the remainder of Mart\u00ednez\u2019s contract and those of his backroom staff. Until the exit is confirmed, the manager remains scheduled to attend the club\u2019s end-of-season awards dinner at St George\u2019s Hall in Liverpool on Thursday. Supporters, who have turned against Mart\u00ednez in increasing numbers in recent weeks, have planned a protest outside the venue and there will be further calls for his departure at Goodison Park on Sunday should the club\u2019s owners retain the 42-year-old until the end of the season. Frank de Boer\u2019s agent, Guido Albers, said at the weekend that his client \u201cwould love to join a club like Everton\u201d. De Boer\u2019s departure from Ajax was announced by the Dutch club on Thursday after his team blew the chance to win the championship on the final day of the season. Farhad Moshiri, the British-Iranian billionaire who acquired a 49.9% stake in Everton in February, has promised investment this summer but his first major call at the club will be a new managerial appointment. Everton are 12th in the Premier League and lost both domestic cup semi-finals this season. Last season\u2019s 11th-place finish was the club\u2019s lowest in nine years and Mart\u00ednez\u2019s record over the past two Premier League campaigns stands at 22 wins from 75 matches.",
