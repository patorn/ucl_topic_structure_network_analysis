If you don\u2019t go to school you don\u2019t know your future, your past and your present. If you go to school you\u2019ll make something good of your life, you will think well and react well. Education is at the root of everything.   LL According to the Overseas Development Institute 75 million children aged between 3-18 living in 35 crisis-affected countries don\u2019t have access to adequate education.   JNO\u2019R I\u2019m Joseph Nhan-O\u2019Reilly and I\u2019m head of education policy and advocacy at Save the Children. We\u2019ve done this project called Hear It From The Children and we go to these situations and we ask people what\u2019s at the top of their list of needs; and 98% of respondents, children and their parents and communities say they want education. They end up in a place and the girl said, \u201cWe eat, we sleep and there\u2019s nothing else.\u201d   LL I\u2019m Lucy Lamble. This month\u2019s podcast looks at why we still have so many children out of school globally. Ahead of the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul we also look at a new initiative to raise funds to deliver education for all children, especially those whose learning is being disrupted by emergencies. And we hear from children directly affected from both Syria and Central African Republic. The names of the children in this podcast have been changed for their protection.   JNO\u2019R The average length of displacement for someone who moves across a border because of a humanitarian crisis is now eight years; and 17 years is what people are saying that they should plan for. So that\u2019s a whole lifetime in school for a child. But in a way, we haven\u2019t quite accepted that reality.   H My name is Hamza. I am 13 years old. I am the eldest boy here. There are two other boys who are younger than me. We work here. My other younger brothers, one of them is 12; the other is 11 years old. We love school but no one is feeding us. I work on the machines.   LL 13-year-old Hamza is a refugee in southern Turkey. His family fled from Syria two years ago when his father was reportedly killed by Isis fighters. Hamza\u2019s mother works as a housekeeper; and along with his brothers he works 12 hour days, six days a week, sewing shoes. In order to survive the whole family must work and the boys just can\u2019t go to school. Displacement and poverty can force children into child labour. Kevin Watkins is the executive director of the Overseas Development Institute in London.    Related: Central African Republic's children dream of education \u2013 and peace     KW The kids out of school because of the Syria crisis are now working in very dangerous sectors in Turkey, in Lebanon, in Jordan. In other cases, of course, you have longstanding issues like early marriage, which is pushing huge numbers of girls out of school. One of the biggest factors, and we see this in the total number of out of school children, is armed conflict.   ROSE The crisis we had here in central Africa, it was really hard. So many things happened to us. We couldn\u2019t even go where we wanted. We stayed at home. Even if you had nothing, even if you were hungry, even if you had no money, you stayed at home. And then when it was over you could go out and do what you wanted to do; look for food and buy it and bring it home to eat. That\u2019s what I can say about this crisis.   LL That\u2019s the voice of 16-year-old Rose from Central African Republic speaking to reporter Cl\u00e1r N\u00ed Chonghaile in the capital, Bangui.   KW If you look at the parts of the world that are suffering the greatest intensity of armed conflict, the greatest state fragility you think of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, Central African Republic, parts of Pakistan; and in some cases it\u2019s because kids are being targeted for the crime of being at school by groups like Daesh, Boko Haram. In others it\u2019s because the schools have been destroyed. In other cases it\u2019s because of parental fear. If you\u2019re living in North Kivu you\u2019d be very concerned about sending a young girl on a 1km journey to go to a school.   These conflict-affected countries have really become the frontline, if you like, of the struggle to deliver on the 2030 development goals; one of which is universal secondary education. Now frankly you can forget universal primary education unless we get to grips with this problem. Universal secondary education is such a remote possibility for these kids at the moment.   LL Despite the evident need and repeated calls for greater funding for education, the humanitarian system has, up until recently, focused instead, mainly, on urgent lifesaving demands such as food, shelter and water. Professor Pauline Rose leads the Research for Equitable Access and Learning Centre at the University of Cambridge.   PR What I find quite amazing is the humanitarian system has almost explicitly ignored education. Education has not been seen as lifesaving, so in the framework, education is not considered as lifesaving. Even though the millions of families that are affected by conflict who are displaced because of conflict themselves call for education as one of the top priorities. And as a result of that less than 2% of humanitarian aid has been spent on education.   Related: Schools reduced to rubble and ruins by conflict \u2013 in pictures     KW The current situation is dire. If you look at the average over the last few years, only around 2% of overall humanitarian funding goes into the education sector. Education is typically the most underfunded part of any humanitarian appeal. If you look at the current appeals for the Democratic Republic of Congo over a million children are out of school. Central African Republic, the Burundian refugees who are living in Tanzania, the refugees from the Democratic Republic of Congo who are living in Uganda \u2013 the current commitment for education in those appeals is zero. So that tells you something about how bad it is.   So at the moment we\u2019re trying to tackle a systemic problem which involves long-term displacement by very short-term appeals \u2013 often three months to six months \u2013 and a high level of unpredictability. Because when the next crisis comes along everyone\u2019s attention will shift somewhere else. But it\u2019s also because of a tendency of the humanitarian system to work through channels that it knows, feels comfortable with and is familiar with and that\u2019s the big international NGOs, it\u2019s the big UN agencies. It\u2019s not the small communities, the diaspora groups, who are actually risking their lives to do what the international community says it wants to do, which is to get education for every child. And that\u2019s why we need to reform the system and we need to get behind this new fund which Gordon Brown and others have argued for.   LL Crepin Namdenganana is head of War Child\u2019s projects in the Bossangoa district in Central African Republic.   CN After three lost years without school, without education, many children have lost the rhythm of going to school and few schools are training teachers. We do not have enough teachers. There are lots of children without teachers.   KW The overall funding for the Syria appeal is 16% for inside Syria; education is just 7%. Now there are teachers and communities across that country who are working really hard to keep these bombed out schools open, who are running classes in basements, in shelters, and the international community is not getting behind them. These people are heroes and they deserve our support, and they\u2019re not getting it.   CN If today our country is going from conflict to conflict it\u2019s because the level of illiteracy is very high. Fewer people go to school and even fewer than that understand the importance of school. So the Central African Republic has many people who do not go to school and the illiteracy rate is too high.   LL As forced displacements continue to increase around the world, the long-term impacts such as the lack of access to education have started to gain more attention on the world stage. The world humanitarian summit this month will see the formal launch of the Education Cannot Wait fund. This is designed to fulfil the right to education for young people affected by crises.    Related: Children fleeing conflict deserve more than razor wire and border fences | Carsten V\u00f6lz and Andreas Papp     KW The estimated financing requirement over a five-year period is between \u00a34bn to \u00a35bn. I\u2019m a great believer that the real challenge here is we need to get this thing working and we need to show that it can produce results; because I could sit here and throw a number at you. I mean, clearly we need more than \u00a35bn if we\u2019re to make a serious inroad here, but with \u00a35bn we could reach between 13 and 20 million children; that would make a material difference.   LL A credible mechanism is crucial for constructive and efficient cooperation between all the parties involved and, ultimately, to attract further funds.  KW But my belief is that once this facility is up and running, the private sector will look at it, philanthropists will look at it, and actually see it as an opportunity to address a very real problem. Because the great challenge for a philanthropic organisation or a private sector company now is if you want to set up a facility in the Central African Republic or Burundi you\u2019re taking very high levels of risk. You don\u2019t have an organisation on the ground. This is a facility that does have organisation on the ground and it could be used to support local NGOs and local organisations that can really make a difference without incurring the massive transaction costs that often come with this rather cumbersome, UN-led response to the crises.   SB I\u2019m Sarah Brown and I\u2019m the president of the children\u2019s charity TheirWorld. Nothing has been more important for us than to look at those children who are caught up in some of the world\u2019s greatest emergencies.   LL I asked Sarah Brown what she hopes will be achieved at the world humanitarian summit. Is this yet another talking shop?   SB As a charity we\u2019re regulars at a lot of the international meetings and this first world humanitarian summit represents a moment where we can really focus on the critical issues for children and their families; and really look at what\u2019s been happening to children around the world, the crises that they\u2019re facing and the great challenge that brings for governments but also for civil society around as to how we address what feels like a kind of continuing, unrolling crisis after crisis, conflict after conflict around the world. So I think the humanitarian summit brings all the different interested parties together to look at how we can look more innovatively at what we do to address these crises and how we fund it.   H Education is very good. It helps to study and become someone in life. We are the people who will replace those in power in the future.   LL Professor Rose points to huge amounts of evidence that education is important for children\u2019s futures, and especially for girls.   PR As a result of educating girls we see a reduction in child deaths, of malnutrition in children. We see that girls themselves are more likely to get married later and to have children later, which also is better for their own lives but also those of their children.   LL According to Kevin Watkins, education can also be a broad support for children in conflict situations.  KW I think education does a number of things. First of all, it helps kids to process what has often been a very traumatic experience. I\u2019ve spoken to a lot of children who are now working in the Bekaa Valley, some of whom were coming from the suburbs of Damascus where they\u2019d been bombed. They\u2019d seen family members killed, they\u2019d often suffered very first-hand. Now school is not a perfect environment to address trauma but it\u2019s better than the alternative of sitting on your own at home or working when you\u2019re 12 years old.   The second thing that education does is it re-establishes a sense of normality. And in the life of a child that\u2019s incredibly important. And I think any parent who\u2019s got a child will understand that \u2013 the ability to send them in safety and security out to school to get an education, it\u2019s part of a routine, it\u2019s part of their daily calendar.    Related: 30 million children have lost their homes \u2013 they must not lose their education | Kevin Watkins     The third thing it does and you really can\u2019t overstate the importance of this is that it enables them to build for the future. These are kids whose families have lost everything. What education can do is to give them the skills and the competencies to go out into the workplace when they\u2019re 18 or 19 as literate, motivated, skilled people who will be in a position to find a resilient livelihood. Now the flip side of all of this is if you take away education you\u2019re consigning these kids who are 10 years old, 11 years old, 12 years old to not just a few years of poverty but to a lifetime of poverty and deprivation.   LL Joseph Nhan-O\u2019Reilly from Save the Children again.   JNO\u2019R There\u2019s no doubt in the international community or the domestic policy-making community about the importance of education. It\u2019s axiomatic that we know that kids need to go to school, they need that for their futures. And there\u2019s this huge body of evidence about benefits both for the individual but for society as a whole; it\u2019s benefits for HIV prevention, for delivering messages to children around other infectious diseases, for economic growth. And critically, in a lot of these crisis-affected communities or countries, for peace and stability.   JN I\u2019m Jean, I am 17. There is really a poor education in our country. Many people don\u2019t know why they live and it is easy to manipulate them and that\u2019s why we are here. And that\u2019s why education is so necessary for us.   LL Marius Mobia works with children like Jean and is from Enfants sans Fronti\u00e8res, a local partner with War Child in Central African Republic.   MM A child has a right to survive, a child has the right to development, a child has the right to protection and the child also has the right to education. For example, if my child goes to school tomorrow he will replace me. That child will know how to read and write and will also help the country. If my child does not go to school it means I don\u2019t want the country to flourish. So it is a cornerstone, it is inescapable in life. Someone who can read and write and go other places, he will be able to carry out what we call changing the mindsets of others.   SB I think we\u2019re learning that having left education out of that mix there\u2019s been a higher price to pay. Where you can put education in at the forefront of that humanitarian response you have children with a place to go to, there\u2019s a place to stabilise life quite quickly. There\u2019s an opportunity to provide a meal and provide vaccinations in that same space. But also the psychosocial support, the learning, the return to normalcy; and I think the cost of not doing that is far greater.   LL That\u2019s all for this month. My name is Lucy Lamble.
