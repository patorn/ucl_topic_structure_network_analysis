  "body": "A high court judgment last week against the largest civil service employer, the Department for Work and Pensions, has exposed just how political and short-sighted the government\u2019s increasingly vicious and vindictive approach to trade unions has become. The case concerns the previously unremarkable and little noticed issue of how union members send their monthly subscriptions to unions like ours, the 200,000 member Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union. For decades, like many other public and private sector workers, civil servants had been able to pay their subs to PCS through their salaries, in the same way they can give to charity or pay for sports and social club membership. That began to change under the coalition when former Cabinet Office minster, Francis Maude, wrote to departments to demand they consider scrapping this arrangement, known as check-off, because the Tories no longer deemed it \u201cdesirable\u201d. Never mind that it was cheap and easy to administer, and some of the UK\u2019s largest and most successful private sector companies, including British Airways and Jaguar, continue to use it, because they recognise it has benefits for employees and employers alike.   Related: Five reasons why public servants should join a union    So, despite a failed attempt by the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG), after which the government was ordered to pay \u00a390,000 in costs, at expense to the taxpayer, other departments started ending check-off at the end of 2014. This was despite the warning from then chief secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander that there was \u201cno fiscal case\u201d for doing so and it would be \u201cat their own legal risk\u201d.  Like DCLG, theDWPnow has a clearer understanding of that risk after judge Elisabeth Laing ruled in our favour that denying staff access to check-off was a breach of contract. We are now preparing papers for a substantial claim for damages from DWP and our legal advice is we have very strong grounds to also pursue other government departments. Over the past 18 months we have been forced to spend a significant amount of time and money effectively re-recruiting tens of thousands of members to pay by direct debit. The arbitrarily short timescales imposed on us before switchovers have meant we have inevitably lost members and subscription income. The implications should not be under-estimated. Let\u2019s call it what it is, this is a highly political attempt to undermine our finances and break our organisation. But it has succeeded only in public money being squandered on legal fees and, in all probability, compensation. What a legacy for Maude to ponder. Banning check-off across the public sector formed part of the Tory\u2019s trade union bill, but this clause was dropped before that horrible piece of legislation received royal assent. We believe this judgement should kill the issue off for good and that this is very much a victory for all unions. It is proof again, if proof were needed, of the importance of independent trade unions. But also it shows two things: that the Tories will try anything to shackle us, and that ultimately they will fail.
