  "body": "Doctors in India have raised concerns about IVF treatment in the country, after a couple in their 70s had their first child after 46 years of marriage. Daljinder Kaur, who does not have a birth certificate but is thought be in her 70s, gave birth to a boy last month after two years of fertility treatment using donor eggs at a clinic in the northern state of Haryana.

Dr Kamini Rao, a leading obstetrician and gynaecologist, said she would not have performed the procedure on Kaur. \u201cAt Kaur\u2019s age, the body cannot cope with pregnancy,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd even if it does, what will her quality of life be? Will she be able to wake up in the middle of the night to change diapers? \u201cDoctors can\u2019t do [IVF treatment] at the expense of a child. It gives false hope to other couples, who will spend their own money on this very expensive procedure. Who benefits from this apart from the doctor?\u201d  Others have urged the government to take action to prevent more older women becoming pregnant. \u201cThe whole world is looking at India and saying we can\u2019t regulate ourselves,\u201d says Dr Narendra Malhotra, head of the Indian Society for Assisted Reproduction. \u201cWe put forward guidelines for ART (Assisted Reproductive Technology) clinics seven years ago. No government has taken them seriously, and a bill has been pending for seven years.     Arman Singh. There is no legal age restriction for couples who want to have IVF treatment in India.

Just because we can do something doesn\u2019t mean we should do it, just to make world records.\u201d Some argue that self-regulation is the best way forward. Dr Soumya Swaminathan, director general of the ICMR, said she was appalled by the Kaur case. \u201cBut making law takes a long time, and implementation is a challenge. It is much more effective to have voluntary self-regulation among doctors,\u201d she said. \u201cThese are experienced practitioners. They shouldn\u2019t allow this kind of procedure. They should offer counselling to their patients.\u201d Embryologist Anurag Bishnoi, who performed the procedure for Kaur and her husband, Monhinder Singh Gill, said this week he had been initially reluctant because of Kaur\u2019s age and because she looked so frail. But when medical tests showed she was healthy, he agreed to go ahead.   Related: Are you worried about your fertility? Young people share their stories    \u201cFor them [the parents] it is a time of great happiness,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cEspecially because her brother, also, didn\u2019t have any children. They were two families, and both didn\u2019t have children.\u201d Bishnoi said he recognised that some people may consider IVF in older women unethical, but argued: \u201cMy point is, if you put a restriction [on receiving IVF treatment] of 45 or 50 years, you will have to put a restriction on the males also. If they are talking about ethics, the [age] should be the same for both.\u201d     Daljinder Kaur: \u2018I am looking after the baby all by myself. I feel so full of energy.\u2019 Photograph: Raminder Pal Singh/EPA    Bishnoi, who set up the clinic after gaining a master\u2019s in clinical embryology at the University of Leeds, has carried out successful IVF on several geriatric couples. In 2008 one of his patients, Rajo Devi Lohan, became a first-time mother at 70 when she gave birth to a girl. Another woman became the mother of triplets at 66. Asked how the the couple would cope with the challenges of parenthood, he said: \u201cThey have relatives who are ready to help take care of the baby.\u201d Kaur told Agence France-Presse she decided to have IVF after she saw a TV ad for the procedure. \u201cGod heard our prayers. My life feels complete now,\u201d she said, speaking from the northern city of Amritsar. \u201cI am looking after the baby all by myself. I feel so full of energy. My husband is also very caring and helps me as much as he can.\u201d Kaur and Gill\u2019s son, Arman, was born \u201chealthy and hearty\u201d and weighing 4.4lb (2kg).   Related: I\u2019m an older mother \u2013 and I bloody love it    Regulation on IVF varies from country to country. In the UK, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recommends that National Heath Service clinics should not provide IVF to women over the age of 43 \u2013 a similar policy to Japan, Israel and other European countries. However, those not eligible for NHS treatment have the option to pay for treatment in private clinics, which are not bound by Nice and which usually provide donor eggs.  The Human Fertility and Embryology Authority, which regulates IVF provision in Britain, does not impose an age limit in such cases, but clinics will not take risks with mothers or babies, which means that they mostly treat women under 45. There are, however, exceptions. In March, 55-year-old Sharon Cutts became a mother of triplets after reportedly paying for treatment at a private London clinic.  There is little regulation in the US, where there are no subsidies for fertility treatments. Gynaecologists there are guided by their own ethical position and what is medically possible.",
