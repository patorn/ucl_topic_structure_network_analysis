  "body": "Waheed Zafar was fast asleep when the orders came in to flee. Winds had whipped up a nearby wildfire, sending it unexpectedly towards the northern Alberta city of Fort McMurray. Within a few hours, flames were flickering in the trees that surround the city, making the jump on to some residents\u2019 front lawns. A phone call from a frantic friend woke Zafar, who works night shifts as a shuttle bus driver. \u201cI looked outside and all I could see was smoke and orange.\u201d He jumped in his car and after an exhausting drive through sheets of flame, heavy smoke and gridlocked traffic, he ended up in Calgary, 400 miles south.  His first instinct was to find a hotel and head back to sleep, but he didn\u2019t have enough money. He called the Red Cross, who directed him to a reception centre at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology, where evacuees are being housed in student residences, and given three meals a day.  \u201cI think we\u2019re going to be in limbo for awhile,\u201d says Zafar with a sigh. Tuesday marks one week since the blazing inferno reached the doorstep of the oil sands city, forcing the frenzied evacuation of some 88,000 people.   fort mcmurray alberta canada wildfires   For years high oil prices turned Fort McMurray into a boomtown, attracting workers from across Canada and the globe. Now \u2013 one week after their collective adrenaline-fuelled escape amid encroaching flames \u2013 evacuees can do nothing more than wait, dogged by doubts over whether their homes and jobs still exist. \u201cI\u2019ve been told that our home is OK. I\u2019ve also been told it burned to the ground,\u201d says Gene MacGillivray. \u201cSo we don\u2019t know. We\u2019re all alive, that\u2019s the main thing.\u201d Like many in Fort McMurray, MacGillivray works in the oil sands. The wildfire forced as much as half of Canada\u2019s oil sands production capacity offline, according to estimates, leaving many residents wondering if and when they\u2019ll be able to return to work.  The wildfire continues to grow in the region, although at a much slower pace. By Tuesday it had swelled to 229,000 hectares \u2013 an area more than 22 times the size of Manhattan \u2013 but winds were pushing it east, away from communities. Officials say they could be fighting the fire for months to come.  Cooler weather helped crews keep the fire at bay, away from Fort McMurray, Anzac and the Suncor Energy oil sands facility, where MacGillivray works. The shifting nature of the blaze has kept him glued to the news. \u201cWe try to change the channel, but you end up going back to it.\u201d  His wife Velvet said she was struggling to reconcile her memories of the home they left behind with television images of the devastation. \u201cIt won\u2019t really hit you until you actually drive through there,\u201d she said. Others weren\u2019t as sure they would ever return. \u201cIt looks like everything is burned,\u201d said Farhana Mukhtar, as her five-year-old son proudly showed off a colouring book \u2013 given to him at the reception centre \u2013 about firefighters. \u201cI don\u2019t want the kids to go back there.\u201d She and her family had arrived in Calgary on Wednesday, one day after a harrowing escape from the flames. \u201cWe walked out of the house, we couldn\u2019t breathe. There was so much smoke outside.\u201d Flames licked the highway as their seven-seat van \u2013 crammed with eight people \u2013 crawled along in bumper-to-bumper traffic. \u201cIt was horrible. Thank God we left the house when we did. If it had been later, I don\u2019t know if the kids would still be alive.\u201d The van became unbearably hot as the flames closed in. Worried about running out of gas, they tried to hold off on turning on the air conditioning. It took six hours to make it to the nearby community of Grasslands \u2013 three times longer than normal. Every day since the family left, Mukhtar has had to reassure her three-year-old daughter that everything is OK. \u201cShe keeps on asking me, \u2018Is my house safe, is my house on fire?\u2019\u201d While she and her husband had hurriedly gathered a few possessions before fleeing the city, her daughter had used the time to carefully lay out her Barbie dolls on her bed, kissing them good night before the family left the house. \u201cEvery day she asks me, \u2018Are my Barbie dolls OK?\u2019\u201d Mukhtar doesn\u2019t know the answer. Pictures taken near her house show that some parts of her neighbourhood have been burned to the ground. The family lives near a gas station that has also been burned badly. \u201cWe\u2019re just not sure about our house.\u201d Concerned about the health of the children, she\u2019s asked her husband \u2013 a bus driver in Fort McMurray \u2013 to start looking for a job in Calgary. \u201cThey say the water is red, because they were trying to sprinkle some chemicals to stop the fire. We don\u2019t have gas and water in the city.\u201d The past week has been stressful, emotional and depressing, she says, but the thought of a new job in a new city helps her feel the family is moving forward.

In Calgary, more than 2,000 people are being housed in reception centres, with thousands more thought to be staying with friends and family in the city.  Many of those staying in the reception centres are immigrants \u2013 from countries such as Pakistan, the Philippines and Eritrea \u2013 who found jobs in Fort McMurray but lack the social networks of Canadian-born evacuees. On Monday, Calgary\u2019s emergency management said the centres in the city would soon reach capacity. On Monday, officials said it could be two weeks before evacuees are given a timeline on when they can return home. In the meantime, the province plans to issue pre-loaded debit cards, with C$1,250 per adult and C$500 per dependent, to help evacuees meet their immediate needs. Residents are also being urged to keep receipts for any expenses incurred, in order to claim them with their insurers.  The federal government has also said it will streamline the process of applying for unemployment insurance, in order to provide struggling evacuees with a cash flow while they wait.  It\u2019s a rare bit of good news in what has otherwise been a tough week, says Noor Badshah, who has been wearing the same thin sweatshirt, jeans and trainers for the past week. The shuttle bus driver was at work when the evacuation orders came, forcing him to flee with nothing more than the clothes on his back. After a few hours on the highway, his car ran out of fuel. Now it sits on the side of Highway 63. \u201cThis is all I\u2019ve got,\u201d says Badshah, motioning to the clothes he has on. Some evacuees are trying to avoid thinking about what comes next. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d says 44-year-old Ricky, who asks that only his first name be used. \u201cEven when I walk by people and I hear people say, \u2018It\u2019s gone, it\u2019s gone,\u2019 I try to avoid them. I\u2019m not watching the news.\u201d He couldn\u2019t bear to think about how the stress might be affecting his two infant children. \u201cIt\u2019s been a lot, especially when you have kids with you,\u201d he says. \u201cI just want to take a break from it.\u201d     Kirby Abo, a member of Ironworkers local 720, grills up bologna outside an evacuation center in Lac La Biche. Photograph: Rachel La Corte/AP    As evacuees settle in for what will probably be weeks of waiting, officials have urged evacuees to register their children in local schools where they had ended up. Sid Aboughoche\u2019s hopes his twin nine-year-old daughters will soon settle into their new school in the town of High River, where he has family.  The owner of a pizza shop in Fort McMurray, Aboughoche\u2019s hands shook as he described how the fire could have taken his home and his business. So far, though, it seems to be good news: his internet provider has confirmed that power and internet continue to flow into both. \u201cThere\u2019s probably smoke damage though \u2013 it\u2019s going to be lots of work,\u201d he said.  The news has allowed him some breathing space to focus on his daughters who \u2013 exhausted and traumatised from the events of the past week \u2013 have been begging to go home. \u201cThe kids have been crying, \u2018We miss home, we miss Fort McMurray. Is our house OK, is the school burned?\u2019\u201d The 47-year-old shrugs as he explains the answer he has taken to giving. \u201cI tell them, we don\u2019t know. It could be a month. Maybe less. Maybe more.\u201d",
