  "body": "Arkansas TV reporter Mitchell McCoy recently got an email that he wanted to share with the world. \u201cI\u2019ve been holding back for months but I can\u2019t stand your gayness,\u201d a viewer complained. \u201cOur children should not be watching people like you. You are a disgrace to Arkansas and I will be asking your boss to take you off.\u201d The outraged viewer went on: \u201cDo not be offended but society is not ready for gay men reading the news.\u201d Of course, whether they knew it or not, America has been ready for a gay man reading the news for about 20 years now. What the viewer was really objecting to was McCoy\u2019s refusal to stamp all traces of gayness out of his speech before going on the air, to \u201ccode-switch\u201d and put on a blander, straighter-sounding voice in order to sound more acceptable. Perhaps that viewer \u2013 like the faction of the right wing that is suddenly, violently alarmed that trans people may be sharing their bathrooms \u2013 does not understand that LGBT people have always been a part of the media landscape, not to mention their churches, their schools and their families. It\u2019s just that now, to a certain extent, the social stigma has eased to the point that some of us are comfortable devoting less energy to \u201cpassing\u201d. Two weeks ago, I ran my first 5K, a nighttime race with flashing lights, fluorescent body paints, blacklights and foam cannons, like a rave. It sounded like distraction enough to keep me from noticing that I was running for more than three miles without stopping. The race was south of Atlanta and my two friends and I stopped at a gas station convenience store in Jonesboro, Georgia, on the way. As we stood in line for the bathroom, an older man came up behind me, then looked me side-eyed and said \u201cfaggot\u201d under his breath. I just shrugged it off, a momentary twinge of annoyance. I was glad my two friends \u2013 burly gay boys from the country who like a good fight \u2013 didn\u2019t hear him because we\u2019d have all gone down in a hail of fists and ended up in jail, and I really wanted to run that race. I\u2019m not sure what triggered the old guy. Maybe it\u2019s that my butt looks especially good in that pair of black running shorts \u2013 I made sure to wiggle it at him on the way out the door \u2013 or, well, I don\u2019t know what. What I really want to say to him \u2013 and to people like the angry viewer who \u201ccan\u2019t stand\u201d our \u201cgayness\u201d is: \u201cGet used to feeling like this. It\u2019s our world now. We\u2019re not hiding any more.\u201d As a man who was once frequently addressed as \u201cMrs Ferguson\u201d and \u201cma\u2019am\u201d on the phone before my voice changed, I know that whether you\u2019re gay, lesbian, trans or just trying things out, being a gender-nonconforming kid is a tough row to hoe. It gets easier as an adult, but even in the gay community, as bell hooks pointed out, masculinity is prized over femininity, the trappings and symbols of patriarchal power are sought after and eroticized. To Mitchell McCoy, I say, good on you for being exactly who you are and not feeling like you have to talk like a lunk-headed former quarterback to report the news. Your example may give courage to a lot of boys and girls who are finding out that they maybe don\u2019t quite fit the Barbie and Ken gender norms set out for them. Hopefully, more and more, they\u2019ll get the message that for them to be exactly who they are is perfectly OK.",
