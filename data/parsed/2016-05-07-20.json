With the mercury nudging the low 20s, the city had a carnival feel that seemed to have blown in all the way from Rio. The world had come to pay homage to one of sport\u2019s more remarkable stories and Leicester was in welcoming mood. Buildings were cloaked in blue and white, with virtually every shop, bar and restaurant proudly displaying a Foxes scarf or flag in its window. Near lifesize images of the Leicester City players hung on flags draped from streetlights as fans marched proudly through the centre, chanting: \u201cWe\u2019re all going on a European tour.\u201d   Related: Leicester City prepare for Premier League coronation    The town hall boasted four huge Leicester flags and the adjacent square, where a newly married Muslim bridegroom in a blue-and-white tie received the congratulations of his family, was bedecked in City bunting. Even the small-scale version of the Statue of Liberty on Upperton Road, near City\u2019s King Power stadium, was resplendent in a Foxes scarf. In the covered market, flags and scarves were in demand. Helium-balloon sellers were doing a brisk trade in inflatable trophies. Fireworks accompanied the roar that erupted around the stadium when the real trophy was presented to captain Wes Morgan, alongside manager Claudio Ranieri, after an easy 3-1 victory over Everton. The only sour note in the match occurred when hero striker Jamie Vardy skied a penalty in the 72nd minute, which would have completed his hat-trick. But the party atmosphere quickly resumed on the pitch, as it had done leading up the game. The Blue Ink tattoo parlour, where Vardy spent seven hours being inked before watching the Chelsea-Tottenham match that confirmed Leicester\u2019s triumph, was operating at full throttle. \u201cI\u2019m having to charge my phone twice a day,\u201d said tattoo artist Nik Moss-Glennon, whose Instagram account (nik_tattooist) has been deluged with requests. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been this busy.\u201d By 11am, queues 200 long were forming outside the stadium\u2019s club shop as fans counted down to the last home match of the season and the crowning moment when Leicester would be presented with the Premier League trophy \u2013 confirmation for those worried that they were still dreaming that their side really was the best in England. Pam had come from Manchester to soak up the atmosphere with her eight-year-old grandson, Sam, a Leicester fan. They planned to watch the match at home, but Pam wanted to make the pilgrimage to the stadium. \u201cThis is fantastic,\u201d she said. \u201cEveryone\u2019s so friendly. In my city, there are two teams and you just feel the players are out to further their careers. But Leicester, they play for each other.\u201d Tikumporn Teepapal, a 29-year-old animator who works in London, was one of many Thais who had come to pay tribute. Was he there because the club has Thai owners? \u201cNo, I\u2019m a Liverpool fan. But it\u2019s important to be here. They\u2019re champions who have done it not with much money but with teamwork.\u201d     Leicester fans display an image of Gary Lineker in his underpants in honour of the former Leicester player and TV pundit\u2019s promise that he would present Match of the Day wearing underwear if Leicester City won the Premier League title. Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP/Getty Images    Edoardo, Marco, Chiara and Diego, four ebullient twentysomethings, had flown in from Florence. They didn\u2019t have tickets for the match but had come, they explained, for the party, one that has been heavily promoted on the Italian Ugly Footballers Facebook page, many of whose 1.2 million members have adopted the Foxes as their English club of choice. \u201cWe have come to celebrate Leicester win the Premiership,\u201d Marco said. \u201cThis is a historical event.\u201d Had they bought into the fairytale because Leicester are underdogs or because  Ranieri is Italian? \u201cHalf and half.\u201d And what of the way Leicester play? There was a collective shrug, then big grins. \u201cIt\u2019s functional, but it works. They win.\u201d Outside the ground, Leicester Sikhs had set up a stall congratulating the club with a poster that declared \u201cBoth Fearless\u201d. A minibus decanted the De Montfort Gospel Choir as Nessun Dorma competed on the PA system with David Bowie\u2019s Heroes. \u201cWe were singing carols in the city at Christmas and some Leicester fans joined us and we sang: \u2018We are top of the league\u2019,\u201d explained the choir\u2019s pastor, Samuel Gapara. \u201cWe never believed then that we\u2019d be here now.\u201d He wasn\u2019t the only one. Leicester\u2019s miraculous achievement has forced the city\u2019s grandees to scramble into emergency planning mode. In 2014, when Leicester won promotion to the Premier League, 30,000 people celebrated in the Town Hall Square. But the Premier League victory parade \u2013 on 16 May, when thousands more are expected \u2013 means the square will be nowhere near big enough, so a new route has been swiftly\u00a0drafted. Not all fans are impressed by the outpouring of devotion. \u201cWhere were all these fans when we were playing Stockport County on a wet and windy Tuesday night in the third division?\u201d one complained online. But many others believe their team\u2019s success proves what many in the smallish city \u2013population 300,000 \u2013 have long claimed: that Leicester is the true sporting capital of Britain. A bronze sculpture in the city centre depicting a batsman, a footballer and a rugby player recalls the historic 1996-97 season when City won the Coca-Cola Cup, Leicester Tigers the Pilkington Cup and Leicestershire cricket\u2019s County Championship. The Foxes\u2019 triumph has given Leicester bragging rights that stretch around the world. Already the club\u2019s owners are talking about expanding the 32,000-capacity stadium \u2013 sold out for every game this season \u2013 or even building a new ground. However, Ellis Cashmore, visiting professor of sociology at Aston University and author of Studying Football, urges Leicester to heed the example of Southampton, whose performances both on the pitch and off suffered after a move to the St Mary\u2019s stadium. \u201cWithout taking any credit away from Leicester, they got knocked out of domestic cup competitions early on, which reduced their workload,\u201d Cashmore said. \u201cThe established elite were playing in European and domestic competitions, which was fatiguing for players and costly in terms of injuries and suspension.\u201d In the season when Aston Villa were relegated, Cashmore concedes that Leicester\u2019s success is helping to restore the Midlands\u2019 battered reputation as a footballing powerhouse. But as Wolverhampton Wanderers and Nottingham Forest confirm, the fortunes of clubs can, like the local industries that employ their fans, decline. Yet could the opposite be true? Perhaps Leicester\u2019s success off the pitch can generate a feelgood factor that spreads to the wider community? \u201cWhen Stoke got promoted, I got carried away and said it was a great moment to put the Potteries back on the map,\u201d Cashmore said. \u201cBut nothing happened.\u201d And yet, at a cultural level, Leicester\u2019s triumph will linger. This season will go down in history as the one when Leicester City became everyone\u2019s favourite second team. \u201cLeicester is the most heterogeneous city in the country \u2013 it\u2019s a melting pot,\u201d Cashmore said. \u201cYou can\u2019t help but rejoice. Everyone\u2019s happy. Except Spurs fans.\u201d   Related: Claudio Ranieri proves nice guys do not always come second | Owen Gibson",
