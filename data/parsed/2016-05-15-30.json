  "body": "Campbell Newman has cost Queensland taxpayers more than half a million dollars in costs to settle a defamation suit over his comments when premier that lawyers for bikies were \u201cpart of the criminal gang machine\u201d. Newman and his former attorney general Jarrod Bleijie are understood to have settled a suit brought by solicitors Chris and Daniel Hannay with a $525,000 payout, Guardian Australia can reveal. It is understood Newman and Bleijie declined to offer public apologies to the Hannays that could have reduced the amount taxpayers would pay on their behalf, instead offering only to make face-to-face apologies, which were rejected.   Related: Clive Palmer and Campbell Newman to go to mediation over defamation dispute    Taxpayers\u2019 exposure to the case will be greater than the $525,000 payout figure, as they also have to wear the cost of legal teams for Newman, Bleijie and the Hannays. Under political convention in Queensland, the government indemnifies politicians who are sued in the course of their duties. Legal sources told Guardian Australia that a $525,000 settlement was large for a defamation suit, and a public apology may have reduced taxpayers\u2019 exposure. Newman was targeted by the libel suit after responding in February 2014 to a question about reports the Hannays had advised clients not to appear in court together for fear of being arrested under anti-association laws.  The then premier told a media conference: \u201cI\u2019m sure that\u2019s completely disingenuous from the defence lawyers concerned and I am sure they have ways of dealing with that. That is just nonsense.\u201d \u201cThese people are hired guns. They take money from people who sell drugs to our teenagers and young people. \u201cYes, everybody\u2019s got a right to be defended under the law, but you\u2019ve got to see it for what it is, they are part of the machine, part of the criminal gang machine and they will see, say and do anything to defend their clients and try to get them off or indeed progress their sort of case, their dishonest case.\u201d Bleijie was also targeted in the lawsuit over his comments a day later that Newman was responding specifically to a question about Hannay Lawyers on the Gold Coast. The Hannays alleged Bleijie\u2019s remarks helped identify them as the targets of Newman\u2019s attack, despite the attorney general\u2019s lawyers arguing they were \u201cmade generally with respect to unidentified lawyers and criminal gang members at the Gold Coast\u201d.   Related: Queensland taskforce told bikie laws will never secure a conviction    The Hannays, represented by prominent defamation lawyer Stuart Littlemore, filed a claim seeking $1.2m in aggravated damages from Newman and Bleijie in April 2014. Newman and Bleijie filed a defence that accused Chris Hannay of \u201can attempt to interfere with the administration of justice\u201d and contempt of court by advising clients not to front court together. The case went to mediation with former high court judge Ian Callinan.  It is the second high-profile defamation case involving Newman as premier which has concluded since he was unseated in the January 2015 election that cost the LNP government. Days before that election, Newman sued Alan Jones over the broadcaster\u2019s comments the LNP government had \u201cprostituted\u201d itself in support of a donor\u2019s controversial coalmine. Guardian Australia revealed that while this suit was being drawn up, Newman\u2019s lawyers in the Hannays matter tried to have a deadline of his defence pushed back to the day before the election. The suit, funded by the LNP, was dropped months later. Newman did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday.  Bleijie declined to comment when contacted by Guardian Australia. Neither of the Hannays could be reached for comment. Newman\u2019s remarks about lawyers provoked widespread ire in the legal community, with the Queensland Bar Association and the Queensland Law Society calling for him to withdraw them and apologise.   Related: I don't like Campbell Newman, but here's something I Can Do: defend his awful book | Gay Alcorn    Peter Davis, the then president of the bar association, said he was contacted by Bleijie at the time and told there would be no apology from Newman. \u201cThe idea that a lawyer, by representing someone who is accused of a criminal offence, is somehow or other joining the criminality is just misconceived,\u201d Davis told the ABC at the time. The fracas came at the height of the former Liberal National government\u2019s political campaign against outlaw motorcycle gangs and uncertainty in the legal community over the scope of the anti-association laws. A solicitor, Adam Magill, said he was forced to send home witnesses threatened with arrest by police at the Maroochydore magistrates court in late 2013. Another solicitor, Andrew Bale, had written to the police commissioner and the director of public prosecutions five months before Newman\u2019s remarks asking if clients would be arrested for facing court together but received no reply.",
