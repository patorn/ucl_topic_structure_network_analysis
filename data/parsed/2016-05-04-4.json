  "body": "The health benefits of cycling and walking outweigh the harm from inhaling air loaded with traffic fumes in all but the world\u2019s most polluted cities, according to a study. An international team of researchers who have modelled the effects say only 1% of cities in the world have such high levels of air pollution that cycling or walking could make a person\u2019s health worse.

Even here the benefits of walking or cycling can often outweigh the harm caused by traffic fumes. Photograph: Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty Images    Air pollution in major cities including London is of increasing concern, particularly to those who are regularly exposed to it when commuting to work. In February, the Royal College of Physicians published a report looking at exposure to air pollution across a lifetime and concluded that 40,000 people die as a result of it every year. The report linked polluted air to cancer, asthma, stroke and heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and dementia, and calculated that NHS, business and other costs in the UK came to more than \u00a320bn a year. The college called for tougher action against polluters and for local authorities to be given powers to close roads and divert traffic when pollution levels were high.   Related: The truth about London's air pollution    The authors of the study, from the UK, Switzerland, Spain and Brazil, say their findings published in the journal Preventive Medicine are not a reason for complacency. \u201cWhile this research demonstrates the benefits of physical activity in spite of air quality, it is not an argument for inaction in combatting pollution,\u201d said Dr James Woodcock from the Centre for Diet and Activity Research. \u201cIt provides further support for investment in infrastructure to get people out of their cars and on to their feet or their bikes \u2013 which can itself reduce pollution levels at the same time as supporting physical activity.\u201d The researchers modelled the effects of cycling and walking at different levels of air pollution and established a tipping point \u2013 the length of time after which there was no further health benefit, and a break-even point, when the harm from air pollution began to outweigh the health benefit.  For Delhi, the most polluted city on the World Health Organisation\u2019s database, the tipping and break-even points for cycling were 30 and 45 minutes per day respectively, while for walking they were 90 minutes and six hours and 15 minutes respectively.  While the researchers looked at the levels of particulates \u2013 PM2.5 \u2013 in the air and not NO2, which has also been established as harming health, \u201cwe did lots of sensitivity analyses and the message would have been the same\u201d, said De Nazelle.",
