I explained how I\u2019d been attacked. I\u2019d had some very aggressive, negative critiques there [in Turkey], the kind of thing I hadn\u2019t received anywhere else. So I loved his response. First of all, he said that lots of people around him had seen it, and liked it. Then he said: \u2018But you will be attacked.\u2019 And he explained why. After all, he knows: he\u2019s had plenty of violent criticism himself. \u2018Don\u2019t get depressed,\u2019 he told me. What he was saying was: keep going.\u201d    I loved his [Orhan Pamuk's] respsonse. He said, 'Don't get depressed' ... he was saying, keep going    Erg\u00fcven is certainly doing that. Mustang, nominated for best foreign language film at the 2015 Oscars and the winner of four C\u00e9sar awards in France, has opened countless new doors for its director and, as a result, her appetite for work is more voracious than ever. Even so, she finds it hard to imagine working in Turkey again. Her second feature, which she is shortly to start shooting, is an English-language picture set in Los Angeles at the time of the 1992 riots. \u201cI detested the response [to Mustang] in Turkey, and so I withdrew from it.\u201d Not that such a turning away is a new experience for her: \u201cMy father was a diplomat in the 80s, at a time when there were many assassinations, when the country had problems with every one of its neighbours, when there was a permanent sense of conflict. Every once in a while, I do feel like taking a break and going to the other side of the world.\u201d     Ilyada Akdo\u011fan, centre, as Sonay in Mustang. Photograph: Allstar/Canal+    The extraordinary Mustang is set in rural Turkey. It tells the story of five orphaned sisters, who live with their grandmother in a large and remote house. The family is not poor, but it is conservative, and when the girls are seen by neighbours splashing around in the sea on the shoulders of a group of local boys \u2013 the gossip is that they have been \u201cpleasuring themselves\u201d on the boys \u2013 an uncle steps in, telling his mother (the girls\u2019 grandmother) that things must change. The family\u2019s respectability is at stake. The sisters, having first been beaten for their misdemeanour, are removed from school, and thereafter kept like prisoners at home, where they are taught to cook and to sew the frumpish \u201cshit-coloured\u201d clothes with which they must now cover their bodies. One by one, it seems, they are to be married off, whether they like it or not. The older girls can do little to resist. But Lale, the youngest, is rebellious and courageous and increasingly determined not to submit. Some critics have likened the film, with its dream-like intensity and mostly female cast, to Sophia Coppola\u2019s The Virgin Suicides. Its director, though, thinks it\u2019s more like Escape from Alcatraz \u2013 with frocks.    Some have likened the film to The Virgin Suicides. Erg\u00fcven thinks it\u2019s more like Escape from Alcatraz \u2013 with frocks    Where did it come from, this story? Erg\u00fcven, talking from her home in Paris, says she had long had an abstract desire to tackle the question of what it is to be a woman in Turkey. \u201cBut it only became concrete when one of my cousins married. Everything that happened around the wedding was beautiful, synergetic, especially the vividness of the young Turkish people who were present at the celebrations.\u201d Suddenly, the film\u2019s opening section came to her, an image of carefree, innocent girls perched laughingly on the shoulders of boys: a scene taken from life. \u201cI\u2019m the youngest in a family in which two generations are constituted of girls, so there are many little details that are true. There are no forced marriages in my family, but we always had conservative figures. There was one father-in-law who was very conservative: an unmarried couple could not enter his house, and I never, ever told him I had a boyfriend \u2013 or not until I was 56. [She laughs: she is 37.] The little scandal in the film did take place in my family, albeit not as violently. The girls being beaten in order of age: that was something that happened in my mother\u2019s generation.\u201d         Watch the trailer for Mustang    What, then, does her family make of her film? \u201cPeople\u2019s relationship with fiction and reality and the connection between the two is interesting, and surprising. In my generation, every girl knows what I am talking about. But in my mother\u2019s generation, they regard it as fiction. There are some things they just can\u2019t see, perhaps because they have no distance.\u201d Five of the keys to Mustang\u2019s success are G\u00fcne\u015f \u015eensoy, Do\u011fa Do\u011fu\u015flu, Elit I\u015fcan, Tu\u011fba Sun Guro\u011flu, and Ilayda Akdo\u011fan \u2013 the girls who play the sisters \u2013 only one of whom had ever acted before. \u201cIt took us nine months to cast. I saw Elit, the only one who\u2019d acted before, straight away. I found Tu\u011fba in an airport, and then the others auditioned. I was indifferent to training, and to experience. I was looking for certain qualities. They had to be great listeners, and I had to see both the scope of their imagination, and the limits of it. I needed to know the capacity of their ability to dive into a scene, and stay in it for a long time. \u201cAfter they were cast, we did two boot camps: one to give them acting tools, and the other to immerse them in the story. We spoke about the backstory, about what happened between scenes, and we played games and did other exercises. It was very playful. It was about group building. And it worked. The solidarity between them was amazing, the way they protected each other. They became one body with five heads: a single rebellious entity.\u201d Did she ever worry for them? She must have known the film would attract heat in Turkey. \u201cYes. The one time I was really unhappy, we\u2019d had threats that involved them. But they were proud of what they were doing, and I never had the impression we were stealing from them. On the contrary. There are directors who steal something from [young] actors, and it is problematic. What Larry Clark [the director of the controversial Kids] does upsets me. But we always had their consent, and that of their parents.\u201d Mustang\u2019s international success has brought with it some extraordinary experiences for its young stars. Erg\u00fcven wasn\u2019t able, in spite of her best efforts, to bag them tickets for the Oscars (they had to stay back at the hotel). But at least they managed to get themselves photographed with George Clooney at the Toronto film festival.     \u2018It took us nine months to cast\u2019: G\u00fcne\u015f \u015eensoy, Do\u011fa Do\u011fu\u015flu, Tu\u011fba Sun Guro\u011flu, Elit I\u015fcan and Ilayda Akdo\u011fan in Mustang. Photograph: Allstar/Canal+    Erg\u00fcven was born in Ankara, but when she was six months old she moved to Paris with her father, a diplomat, where she remained for the next nine years. \u201cThen we went back to Turkey, after which there were a few years that were extremely important: me and my sister were out on the streets all the time, window-breaking creatures, hardened criminals.\u201d She grins. \u201cWe went back to live in France later, but we spent all our holidays and many weekends in Turkey. My family life was completely Turkish.\u201d She studied literature and African studies at university, after which she enrolled at film school in Paris, one of only two women in her class (the other was Mustang\u2019s co-writer, Alice Winocour). Is it harder to get a movie made, even in France where the film industry is still subsidised, if you\u2019re a woman? \u201cI never feel like complaining about it but, yes, I think it is. There is something animal in the way we evaluate people. And I have a soft voice, and I wear clothes with flowers on, and heels, and I come across as fragile, even if that is not the case at all. If I had the body and the voice of an alpha male, it would be easier. It took nine years from leaving film school until Mustang was screened at Cannes, and those years were demoralising. It\u2019s difficult not to be affected. You work for the minimum, to have your roof and four walls, so you can write. It\u2019s not super fun. But it\u2019s more than demoralising. I think [she jabs at her forearm] I took my ego out, literally. It\u2019s gone. After a while, I was almost stammering, as if my voice had disappeared.\u201d What about the awards? Didn\u2019t her ego rampage straight back? \u201cNot really. My mother taught me good lessons. You have to keep your core intact, unmoved, regardless of whether you are praised or criticised.\u201d Still, she has the impression that she has \u201cpassed through the glass in the mirror\u201d at last. Things that were impossible for years are now possible: \u201cActors are actually coming to me.\u201d    [Erdo\u011fan] is making people hate each other. We were always a heterogeneous country, but we lived together in peace    Meanwhile, she worries for Turkey, increasingly autocratic under its present leader, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan. \u201cThe one good thing is that Turkey was a democracy \u2013 yes, you can say it in the past tense now. It remains [as a result] extremely vigorous. The population is youthful, and literally simmering. Its cross-currents are moving deeply. You can feel that it will go in one direction, or another. The current government doesn\u2019t tolerate any kind of criticism, not even the smallest joke. People come and go, and he [Erdo\u011fan] will go eventually, too. But the problem is what he\u2019s doing to the fabric of the country. He\u2019s polarising, making people hate each other. We were always a heterogeneous country, but we lived together in peace. Now he\u2019s attacking that. His corruption has been revealed, but he hits back harder and harder, repeating as a mantra absolute lies, and eventually people might start believing him. He\u2019s messing with people\u2019s minds.\u201d The situation for women in Turkey is, she believes, now very grave, for which reason she is happy for her film to be regarded as a contribution to the increasingly muscular and conflicted debate surrounding their rights, their freedom. \u201cThe way he [Erdo\u011fan] speaks: he makes them [women] fragile with his messages, whether subliminal or explicit. There is a certain way, he says, of being a woman: you have to be a mother and at home, and that\u2019s all. When you see a man, you should blush and look down. It\u2019s like something from the middle ages. The subtext is that women are only seen as sexual. That\u2019s why they must cover every inch of their skin. This is dangerous because it generates more violence against them, it makes it OK for men to act like assailants. Rapes happen everywhere, but in Turkey women come out on to the streets to protest because such attacks only seem to echo what the government is saying.\u201d     Women protest in Ankara, February 2015, over the Turkish government\u2019s inadequate response to the murder and alleged rape of \u00d6zgecan Aslan. Photograph: Adem Altan/AFP/Getty Images    This, she notes, is exactly what happened last year, after the murder of \u00d6zgecan Aslan, a university student who was murdered in Mersin after attempting to resist rape by a minibus driver, his father and his friend; protesters were furious at what they saw as the government\u2019s inadequate response to the crime, and to its supposed normalisation of rape, particularly with regard to non-conservative women. Astonishingly, Erdo\u011fan in turn attacked protesters for their behaviour; some of them, un-Islamically, had been seen dancing. Erg\u00fcven\u2019s voice as we discuss all this is light, but somehow it is steely, too, her smile a distraction. My guess is that she will one day make another film in Turkey. For all her watchfulness behind the camera, she is not, I think, one of life\u2019s bystanders. When her country calls \u2013 as it did during the Gezi Park protests of 2013 \u2013 she tends to come running. \u201cFilm is my tool,\u201d she says, more firmly now. \u201cIt\u2019s how I switch people\u2019s minds on to something. It\u2019s how I participate.\u201d Mustang is in cinemas now",
