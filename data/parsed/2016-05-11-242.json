When bread contacts the plate, a pattern is transferred by scorching. Why? Create your own Shroud of Turin and eat yourself for breakfast. Mmm, sacrilicious. Well?     The narcissist\u2019s grill \u2026 Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian    The end times are here again, as proven by this toaster that can print your face on bread. The narcissist\u2019s grill is manufactured by Burnt Impressions (other \u201cVermont Novelty Toaster Corporations\u201d are available. Not really), to whom I had to email a photo of myself. I am intrigued by the plasma-cut metal stencils that arrive a few weeks later. Should you tire of self-cannibalism, other templates thrown in include I \u2665 you, a CND logo, a crab and a lobster \u2013 these the biggest mystery (why two crustaceans? WHY TWO?). I slot my portrait-plate into the internal brackets, followed by two white slices. They pop out, the most rudimentary Polaroids of all time. I look like a \u201cMissing\u201d poster of an Italian boxer. (A friend suggested the likeness would be better on wholemeal bread, which, after a tense conversation, we decided wasn\u2019t racist.) It is weirdly impressive. But should I be making toasten images of myself, to ritually consume every morning? It is idolatry, unhealthy in every way. (\u201cEat well and eat toast!\u201d the box encourages, recognising one can\u2019t simultaneously do both.)            Or is the toaster satirical, reflecting a nutritionally empty culture in which we subsist on a diet of ourselves? Did Yoko Ono invent it? I\u2019m actually in favour of plated art. People who tell you not to play with your food merely lack imagination. I doubt I\u2019d have achieved GCSE English without Alphabetti spaghetti. The issue here is the picture is rendered in chiaroscuro, achieved by selective burning. This leads to wildly uneven toast: undercooked in parts, charred in others. The clearer the image, the more inedible. There is no defrost setting or bagel slot. It is, to be honest, a crap toaster, which is the real sin. Give us this day our daily bread, but golden-brown all over, and soft inside. Not this boasty-toasty aberration, a vain slice of life and relic of an age best forgotten.     \u2018A friend suggests the likeness would be better on wholemeal bread.\u2019 Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian    Redeeming features? The action of the crumb tray is surprisingly smooth. It\u2019s not enough though, is it? Picture the euology: \u201cHe was a war criminal and a drunk, but his crumb tray was surprisingly smooth.\u201d Counter, drawer, back of the cupboard? The most shameful chamber of our hearts. 1/5",
