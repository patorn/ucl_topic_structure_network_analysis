Victory for Jamala, the Crimean Tatar jazz singer who won with a distinctly un-Eurovision ballad about the 1944 deportation of the Crimean Tatars, caused as much joy in Kiev as it did anger in Moscow, with Ukraine\u2019s president, Petro Poroshenko, thanking the singer on behalf of the whole country. Prior to Saturday evening\u2019s final, Russian entry Sergei Lazarev had been favourite to win. He eventually finished third, behind the Australian entry, Dami Im.

Crimea was annexed by Russia two years ago, but while many in the peninsula celebrated the event, the Crimean Tatar minority have largely been strongly opposed to Russian rule. Maria Zakharova, Russia\u2019s foreign ministry spokeswoman, wrote on her Facebook page that next year the Russian entry should be about Syrian president Bashar al-Assad, and even offered a bizarre English-language chorus for the potential song: \u201cAssad bloody, Assad worst. Give me prize, that we can host.\u201d Dmitry Rogozin, the deputy prime minister, suggested sending Sergei Shnurov, a rock singer known for his foul-mouthed lyrics, to next year\u2019s Eurovision: \u201cDon\u2019t know if he\u2019d win, but he\u2019d have some choice words for everyone,\u201d the politician wrote. Jamala, whose real name is Susana Jamaladynova, pleaded for \u201cpeace and love\u201d as she collected her award on Saturday night. She admitted her song was highly politically charged in an interview with the Guardian the day before the contest. She has not been home to Crimea in nearly two years, saying she fears arrest, but most of her family still live there, and she said that although her song was inspired by the events of 1944, it was also about more recent tragedies.  \u201cOf course it\u2019s about 2014 as well,\u201d she said. \u201cThese two years have added so much sadness to my life. Imagine, you\u2019re a creative person, a singer, but you can\u2019t go home for two years. You see your grandfather on Skype who is 90 years old and ill, but you can\u2019t visit him. What am I supposed to do: just sing nice songs and forget about it? Of course I can\u2019t do that.\u201d Accepting her Eurovision trophy, she said: \u201cI know that you sing a song about peace and love, but actually, I really want peace and love to everyone.\u201d She then thrust the glass microphone prize and yelled: \u201cThank you, Europe \u2013 welcome to Ukraine!\u201d     Jamala arrives at Borispil airport near Kiev after her Eurovision win. Photograph: Sergei Chuzavkov/AP    While voting in the Eurovision song contest has always been subject to political and diplomatic intrigue, Ukraine\u2019s entry takes things to a new level. The rules ban performances containing \u201clyrics, speeches or gestures of a political or similar nature,\u201d and last year an Armenian entry about the 1915 genocide was deemed too political, while in 2009 Georgia did not take part after organisers deemed its song \u201cDon\u2019t wanna put in\u201d was a play on president Vladimir Putin\u2019s name.  Jamala\u2019s song was titled 1944 and was about the deportation of the Crimean Tatars. The entire population was rounded up, put on trains and exiled thousands of miles away from Crimea, for allegedly cooperating with the Nazis during the war, despite the fact that many Crimean Tatars, including Jamala\u2019s great-grandfather, fought for the Red Army and died at the front.    Related: Ukraine's Eurovision singer urges voters to show Crimea solidarity    The Tatars were allowed to return to Crimea only in 1989, and the majority of them strongly opposed the annexation of the peninsula by Russia in 2014. While some Crimean Tatars have joined the Russian government, many Tatar activists have been jailed or have simply disappeared; a Tatar television station has been chased out of Crimea and a climate of fear prevails. \u201cOf all the ways for Ukraine to win, Europe chose the most exquisite and just option \u2013 at the last moment calmly and cold-bloodedly dashing the hopes of the Russians who stole the homeland of this daughter of the Crimean Tatar people,\u201d wrote Ukrainian MP Mustafa Nayyem on Facebook. \u201cIt is historically very apt. And, don\u2019t forget that next year, the Russians will have to come to Eurovision in Kiev.\u201d Already, some in Moscow have called for Russia to boycott the 2017 contest. In a sign, however, that for all the political tension and military conflict between Russia and Ukraine in the past two years, affection between the two peoples has not completely evaporated, in the popular vote Russians gave the Ukraine entry 10 points, while Ukraine gave the Russian entry the full 12 points.",
