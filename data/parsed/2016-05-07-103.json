  "body": "I love historical fiction. There are all sorts of historical continuities in life, but the past is always strange. My new novel [Donoghue\u2019s first since 2010\u2019s Room] is about a little girl in Ireland in the 1850s who doesn\u2019t eat, before anorexia was identified. Back then if you had a kid who wasn\u2019t eating, all sorts of theories would swirl around her. Some would see her as physically sick, others emotionally sick, others superpowered. I\u2019m \u201cIrish Canadian\u201d, which means I\u2019m totally Irish. I lived in Ireland until I\u00a0was 20, then England for eight years, then Canada. It\u2019s just a handy way of saying I have a foot in two camps. Ideally I\u2019d want British newspapers, the weather of the south of France, American television and the polite manners of Canada. No one country can satisfy me now. I never really had an adolescence. I\u2019ve never been drunk, never been arrested. I was always interested in pleasing adults and scoring 10/10 in tests, and I have been diligently reading and writing since I was eight. Back in Canada I\u2019ve got a treadmill desk. It sounds mad, but you get the hang of it. If you\u2019re successfully distracted by writing you don\u2019t even notice the kilometres. We\u2019ll all be on them in 10 years. I am religious, but it is the most embarrassing subject to talk about in detail. You sound pompous or confused as soon as you open your mouth. I don\u2019t know how to defend it in rational terms, but that\u2019s how my world turns. The issue of diversity in film starts with the script. I try to be political as a writer. I always stop and think: \u201cDoes this character have to be a white man?\u201d Sometimes you think: \u201cYes he does.\u201d But I ask myself the question. There has been such a change for gay people in my lifetime. When I think about how embarrassed and sheepish so many gay people felt around 1990, it\u2019s unrecognisable. I\u2019ve ended up having a family [Donoghue has two children with her partner Chris] as well as being a lesbian \u2013 when I was younger I really thought it would be one or the other. In a relationship there is a lot to be said for the prompt apology. Even at the micro level, if you drink the last of the coffee in the pot and she wants some. There\u2019s a lot of emphasis on the autobiographical in fiction at the moment. It can make you very preoccupied with what you\u2019ve lived through yourself. I prefer to inhabit other people\u2019s lives and worlds. I like it when my readers don\u2019t realise they\u2019ve read three of my books because they think of them as separate stories or styles. The great thing about parenthood is that it limits your free time. It gives you a great enthusiasm for work. You rush into the office to get away from the pram in the hallway. I\u2019ve had a great last year \u2013 the film of Room was successful and made lots of money. Now I\u2019m living in Nice, where Chris is researching 19th-century literature. I don\u2019t see how my friends can do anything other than hate me. Perhaps all my bad luck is round the corner. Room is available to watch on DVD and Blu-Ray from 9 May",
