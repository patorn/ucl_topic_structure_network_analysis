  "body": "It appears that the New Orleans Pelicans guard Bryce Dejean-Jones was shot dead on Saturday after entering the wrong apartment on his daughter\u2019s first birthday.  Dejean-Jones had been visiting his girlfriend to celebrate his daughter\u2019s birthday and had gone for a walk according to his agent, Scott W Nicholls. ESPN reported that Dejean-Jones and his girlfriend had been arguing beforehand. It was the first time he had been to the building in Dallas and went to the third floor instead of the fourth when he came back. When he began kicking at the bedroom door, the apartment\u2019s occupant, who had been asleep, called out but received no response and shot Dejean-Jones dead. It is legal to use deadly force against intruders in Texas.

He spent time at three colleges \u2013 USC, UNLV, and Iowa State \u2013 averaging 10.8 points per game over four seasons.  Dejean-Jones was waived by the Pelicans in October but was re-signed to back-to-back 10-day contracts two months later. He signed a two-year deal with the Pelicans in February and finished his rookie season having averaged 5.6 points and 3.4 rebounds in 14 games.  \u201cThe NBA family mourns the tragic loss of New Orleans Pelicans guard Bryce Dejean-Jones,\u201d said the NBA commissioner, Adam Silver, in a statement on Saturday. \u201cBryce inspired countless people with his hard work and perseverance on his journey to the NBA, and he had a bright future in our league. Our thoughts and sympathies are with Bryce\u2019s family and the entire Pelicans organization during this difficult time.\u201d",
