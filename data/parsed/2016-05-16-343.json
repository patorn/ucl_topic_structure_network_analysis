  "body": "The Turnbull government has promised \u201cthe most significant package of education quality reforms in a generation\u201d worth $73.6bn. Labor has promised a needs-based \u201cYour Child. Our Future\u201d plan, which adds another $3.8bn. What is this about? The Coalition\u2019s $73.6bn figure sounds grand but it is simply the total amount the commonwealth gives to states for schools over four years. It is the normal funding package, minus the 2014 Abbott budget cuts. The cuts amounted to $30bn over a decade from 2014. This election, the Coalition has promised an extra $1.2bn top-up of needs-based funding over three years in 2018-20.   Related: Indigenous education would suffer if Gonski funding scrapped, experts warn    This will be delivered using state and territory assessments of the neediest schools \u2013 as recommended by the Gonski review. The Coalition also attached conditions, including standardised year 1 school assessment of reading, phonics and numeracy skills, annual reports to parents on literacy and numeracy attainment against national standards, and a minimum standard of literacy and numeracy skills for year 12 school leavers. Education expert and policy fellow at the Mitchell institute, Victoria University\u2019s Bronwyn Hinz\u2019s verdict on the Coalition\u2019s new money: \u201cThe \u2018new\u2019 money is just the result of ditching the paltry CPI index rate introduced by the Abbott government in favour of a slightly higher \u2018education specific indexation rate of 3.56%\u2019 which is still below the higher indexation rates (up to 4.7%) that the Coalition removed in its 2014 budget,\u201d Hinz writes. \u201cThis funding package is better described as a partial restoration of the funding cuts of 2014.\u201d Who is promising more money? Labor has promised $4.5bn over two years from 2018-19 compared with the Coalition\u2019s $1.2bn over three years. Labor states its funding will include $1.8bn in regional and country classrooms for Australian schools. Labor is definitely promising more cash but the catch with this policy is that Labor cannot determine exactly where that money is spent \u2013 rural or city \u2013 because it is up to the states to determine where the money goes based on their measurements of needy schools. Hinz says: \u201cLabor can say they are allocating that much but the commonwealth doesn\u2019t have final say on funding any school gets.\u201d For example, New South Wales and Tasmania have put more money into needier schools first up, whereas Victoria has dribbled the funding out to all schools more evenly. It is for the states and territories to decide where the money goes best, so when Labor promises a certain amount to your local school, it is not in the bank. Yet. Does more money produce better results?  The Coalition says: \u201cWhile Bill Shorten has promised more money for schools, Labor is ignoring the decades of significant funding growth yet declining performance.\u201d  The Coalition argument against Labor\u2019s larger school funding promises that have been in place since the Gonski reforms has been that increased funding has not produced results.  But the catch here is the results were based on on Naplan results which only included the first year (2014) of the increased needs based \u201cGonski\u201d funding. In the first year, schools received their smallest amount \u2013 as the funding agreements grew over time. For example NSW schools had received 3% of their Gonski funding in 2014, 9% in 2015 and 18% in 2016. The NSW (Coalition) education minister, Adrian Piccoli, told the Australian the Turnbull government\u2019s argument that \u00adrecord spending had failed to improve student results over the past decade was based on an old funding system that failed to target disadvantage. Awks. \u201cIt\u2019s unreasonable to expect to see systemic changes after two and a bit years of a needs-based funding formula \u2013 it\u2019s way too early,\u201d Piccoli said. \u201cThese [Gonski] reforms should have been done 15 years ago \u2026 [and] we would be reaping the rewards now. \u201cUnfortunately, people haven\u2019t got the patience for that investment to pay off.\u2019\u2019 Hinz says results have been going down because in the past, \u201cmore school funding isn\u2019t going to schools that need it the most in the correct dosage.\u201d And, \u201csome schools get money they don\u2019t need\u201d. So what exactly is this Gonski money? Schools policy has been dominated by the name Gonski for three years now. People understand it as something to do with equitable funding but not many know why. The independent Gonski review recommended a School Resource Model to provide the same funding to all students, with top-ups for known factors of disadvantage, such as rural and remoteness, Indigenous background and disability. In 2013 Labor reached agreement with all states and territories apart from Western Australia, Northern Territory and Queensland. At the 2013 election, Tony Abbott and his education minister, Christopher Pyne, promised the same deal as Labor but subsequently reneged.  The remaining states and territories were signed up later by the Abbott government, with fewer conditions than Labor had required. The funding agreements expire at the end of the 2017 school year and the commonwealth and states have already begun negotiations.    Related: It's a no-brainer \u2013 if you want school funding to be needs-based, fund Gonski | Lucy Clark    So the argument over the life of this Coalition government has been around what happens in 2018-19. Hinz says while the Gonski review did provide a solution, the Gonski report itself was \u201cmaimed\u201d by its limited terms of reference which said no school could lose a dollar. This meant the existing funding could not be redistributed, from schools with too much funding to schools with less funding.  In this election, the best the Coalition can hope for is to again neutralise the issue. While education is seen as a winner for Labor, expect to see Bill Shorten coming to a school near you.            Tanya Plibersek talks up Gonski and takes swipe at Greens",
