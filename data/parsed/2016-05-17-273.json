  "body": "The bedroom is where our pop dreams began. Backlit by a bedside lamp, we honed our dance routines and made our pact with S Club 7: we won\u2019t stop moving. We can\u2019t. For most of us, the bedroom is also where those dreams died. Probably for the best. That wasn\u2019t the case for Oscar, a mononymous 25-year-old from Harlesden, north-west London, who has just released his debut album. While still at art school, Oscar began writing and recording music inspired by lo-fi dream-pop artists such as the Radio Dept, using GarageBand and \u201ca cracked version of Logic Express\u201d. The 10 patchworked tracks he uploaded to SoundCloud got him signed by indie label Wichita, but Oscar always intended to make pop. \u201cI\u2019ve tried writing darker, more serious songs but they don\u2019t go anywhere,\u201d he says. \u201cEverything revolves around the chorus for me.\u201d            Increasingly, this feels like a familiar story \u2013 a number of new artists like L\u00e5psley, FEMME, Ronika and Tala profess to have started out similarly. Whereas making music with a laptop was once the preserve of dance music DJ-producers, and pop was traditionally made in expensive studios with teams of writers, now those boundaries have broken down. Technology has democratised the process, which is why an album such as Grimes\u2019 self-produced Art Angels doesn\u2019t sound out of place on Radio 1.   Related: Grimes: 'In my life, I'm a lot more weird than this'    Just as the internet has mixed up genres, so the remit for who can make pop has blurred. \u201cI think there\u2019s something antagonistic about bedroom pop,\u201d agrees R&B-tinged electronic pop musician Shura. \u201cWe\u2019re reappropriating pop and saying you don\u2019t have to be an ex-Disney star to make pop music. You can be from Shepherd\u2019s Bush and have spent most of your life listening to the Smiths and still make a pop record.\u201d This wave of bedroom pop has an underlying economic logic: after all, why put together a band and traipse around playing gigs when today\u2019s talent scouts are at home listening to Hype Machine? Even major label-signed Shura says that she was never pressured to give her demos an expensive sheen. \u201cQuite the opposite,\u201d she says. \u201cLabels go: OK, great, you can make the track in your bedroom. That means we don\u2019t have to invest \u00a3150k recording it. You can just make it at home, co-write with a couple of people to get the singles, and then we\u2019ve got an album for nothing.\u201d With recording costs down and production values up, no wonder pop\u2019s dream factory has been outsourced right back to teenage bedrooms. Best to knock before you go in. Oscar\u2019s Cut And Paste is out now on Wichita; Shura\u2019s Nothing\u2019s Real is out on 8 July via Interscope     Oscar. And a dog. Photograph: Bella Howard",
