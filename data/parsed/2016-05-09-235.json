  "body": "I like The Princess in Black by Shannon Hale, because the main character has a secret identity.  One day she\u2019s a perfect princess - Magnolia - but whenever her glitter stone ring \u201crings\u201d, she\u2019s off, transforming into the Princess in Black and fighting monsters. All the while Duchess Wigtower is snooping around the castle looking for any clues to Magnolia\u2019s secrets.  Also, Frimplepants, Magnolia\u2019s horse - is just laying around when her glitterstone horse shoe also \u201crings\u201d. Immediately she dives through a tree and turns into Blackie!         The most interesting part for me was when the Princess and Blackie defeated the blue monster, who was trying to eat the goats.  I would recommend this book to people who like fantasy and adventure.
