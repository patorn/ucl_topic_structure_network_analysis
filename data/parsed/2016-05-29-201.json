  "body": "On the verge of elimination, Klay Thompson would not let the Golden State Warriors\u2019 season die. And so he shot and he shot and he shot. Normally he has been the sidekick to MVP Steph Curry, but with Curry struggling for much of the Western Conference finals, it was Thompson who came though on Saturday, hitting an NBA playoffs record 11 three-pointers in the Warriors 108-101 victory over Oklahoma City in Game 6.   Related: Golden State Warriors beat Oklahoma City Thunder: NBA playoffs \u2013 as it happened!    \u201cNobody wanted to [go home],\u201d Thompson said after the game, his 41 points having silenced a roaring crowd in Oklahoma City\u2019s Chesapeake Arena.             On the verge of elimination, Golden State, who set a league record with 73 regular-season wins, salvaged a season that was slipping away by overturning a seven-point deficit with 5:00 left, and by doing something they hadn\u2019t done much in the previous 5 \u00bd games: play defense. They held the Thunder to just one basket and three free-throws in those final five minutes. Now the Warriors go back to Oakland\u2019s Oracle Arena for Monday night\u2019s Game 7, where they will be heavily favored to earn their second-straight finals appearance. On the verge of elimination, Curry turned back into Curry. His struggles in the first games of the series disappeared on Saturday night when he hit two smooth, confident three-pointers in the final five minutes. The kind he used to make before the Thunder began knocking him around the court. He scored 10 points in that last burst, batted away Oklahoma City players\u2019 passes, and looked everything like the player who had been missing the last two weeks. Just when the Warriors needed him. \u201cAbout time we have a stretch where we opposed our will,\u201d he later said. The Thunder, though, collapsed. This has been all too familiar a script for Oklahoma City in recent years. But the Thunder thought those days had passed. Behind new coach Billy Donovan, they had transformed themselves into a rugged defensive team that crushed the league\u2019s most beautiful, free-flowing offense. Then it was gone. Oklahoma City began to miss the shots that had fallen earlier in the series. The Warriors became more aggressive defensively, and the Thunder\u2019s Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook tried to force passes and shots late. What should have been a celebration on the way to a meeting with Cleveland in the finals tuned into a panicked rush to save the series. Under pressure, Oklahoma City fell apart. \u201cWe missed some shots and they got hot from three,\u201d Durant said. But more than the Thunder\u2019s late-game tumble, Game 6 will be remembered for Thompson\u2019s three-pointers. \u201cHe was ridiculous,\u201d Golden State coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cHis shooting was some of the most incredible shooting I will ever see.\u201d He hit shots from the corner. He hit shots off passes from the side. He hit shots seemingly without even looking and he even hit a a shot just two steps in from center court \u2013 normally Curry\u2019s domain.            He has always been one of the best shooters in the league, but as the guard who plays beside Curry, he is a second option, overshadowed by the MVP. On Saturday, the Warriors needed him to be Curry until Curry could find his missing shot. Even Curry shook his head later and said: \u201cHe made some great shots.\u201d On the verge of elimination, Thompson, and then Curry, came through. The Warriors were the Warriors again, and now with a trip back to Oakland that the Thunder do not want to make, Golden State suddenly seem back on the path to the finals once again.",
