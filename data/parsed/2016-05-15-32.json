  "body": "This year\u2019s Derby appears the kind of race for which new contenders announce themselves every other day and The Gurkha stuck his name in the hat with a comfortable success in the French 2,000 Guineas on Sunday. Ridden by Ryan Moore for Aidan O\u2019Brien, the colt powered five and a half lengths clear of a dozen rivals and is now 6-1 from 20s for the Epsom race. The Gurkha\u2019s performance came just six weeks after his racecourse debut, when he was third in a Leopardstown maiden. In between, he had hacked up in another maiden at Navan. Being a son of Galileo, The Gurkha is surely worth a try at the Derby distance of a mile and a half and he did not appear to be stopping at the end of Deauville\u2019s mile on Sunday but O\u2019Brien was keeping his options open. \u201cHe has three options now: the St James\u2019s Palace, the French Derby and the Epsom Derby,\u201d the trainer said. But O\u2019Brien has struggled to come up with a convincing Derby candidate in the recent trials and it would be quite surprising if he skipped Epsom with such a talented and progressive animal. O\u2019Brien\u2019s US Army Ranger remains the 9-2 favourite for the Classic on 4\u00a0June, with John Gosden\u2019s recent Dante winner, Wings Of Desire, on 5-1.

Another son of Galileo, he is out of Light Shift, an Oaks winner, making him a strong Epsom contender on breeding. \u201cHe won very nicely and has taken the race very well,\u201d said Alan Cooper, racing manager for the Niarchos family, owners of Ulysses. \u201cAs for plans, we will regroup with Sir Michael [Stoute], Ryan and the racing team and see what Sir Michael thinks we should do next. He\u2019s in the Derby, but he\u2019s just won his maiden. We are going to give his programme good thought and when we know, all will become clear.\u201d But there will be no Epsom for Foundation, a good third in last week\u2019s Dante, when he may not have had the clearest of runs. Harry Herbert, chairman of his owning syndicate, said the colt would go to the French Derby on 5\u00a0June. \u201cWilliam [Buick] wasn\u2019t able to extricate himself when he needed to, but he ran very well and was only beaten a length and three-quarters by the winner,\u201d Herbert said. \u201cWilliam felt we should stick to a mile and a quarter for the time being and the French Derby looks a very good target for him. \u201cIt will be very exciting for everyone involved to have a runner in the French Derby. I don\u2019t think Highclere have ever had a runner in the race before.\u201d",
