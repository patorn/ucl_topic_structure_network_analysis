Gertrude \u2026 Naomi Watts. Photograph: George Pimentel/WireImage    Oscar-nominee Naomi Watts is named to play Queen Gertrude in the film, which is an adaptation of Lisa Klein\u2019s young adult novel. Shakespeare\u2019s original text will be discarded, but the new version will retain the original\u2019s late middle ages setting.  Australian director Claire McCarthy, best known for 2009 adoption drama The Waiting City, is taking charge of the cameras. Klein\u2019s novel imagines an Ophelia who does not die in a stream, and is secretly married to Hamlet. In a 2006 review for The Guardian, critic Ad\u00e8le Geras noted that the love affair between Ophelia and Hamlet is the backbone of the novel. \u201cThere are too many clich\u00e9s, and a plodding weight to the prose, but this won\u2019t stop readers revelling in a fascinating sidelight on Hamlet,\u201d she wrote. Ridley recent signed up to star in fantasy thriller Kolma for her The Force Awakens producer JJ Abrams. Watts is due to play a single mother who decides to put her son\u2019s ambitious rescue plan into action in the drama The Book of Henry for Jurassic World\u2019s Colin Trevorrow.  This article was amended on Thursday 5 May 2016. We mistakenly referred to Naomi Watts as an Oscar winner. This has been corrected.",
