  "body": "A \u201clegendary\u201d first edition of Alice in Wonderland \u2013 one of just 22 known copies in existence, after Lewis Carroll withdrew the entire print run \u2013 is due to be auctioned in New York next month, where it is anticipated to fetch between $2m and $3m (\u00a31.3-\u00a32m).     The first edition of Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland (Macmillan, 1865, with 42 wood-engraved illustrations by John Tenniel). Photograph: Christie's Images Ltd    Two thousand copies of the first edition of Carroll\u2019s classic children\u2019s story were printed in June 1865. Macmillan & Co was planning to release it on 4 July, and sent 50 advance copies to the author for him to give away. But shortly afterwards, the book\u2019s illustrator, John Tenniel, told Carroll that he was \u201centirely dissatisfied with the printing of the pictures\u201d, so the author recalled the print run and asked for the advance copies he had sent out to be returned. On 2 August, Carroll would write in his diary: \u201cFinally decided on the reprint of Alice, and that the first 2,000 shall be sold as waste paper.\u201d In an introduction to a later edition of Alice in Wonderland, Carroll scholar Morton N Cohen writes that the author \u201cwould probably have been content to leave the first edition stand and, at most, would have wanted the later impressions printed more carefully. For him it was simply a case of making concessions to his uncompromising illustrator.\u201d Cohen records that Carroll \u201csuffered most by the need to reprint\u201d, with it costing him \u00a3600 to do the book a second time. Carroll wrote in his diary that \u201cif a second 2,000 could be sold it would cost \u00a3300, and bring in \u00a3500, thus squaring accounts: any other further sale would be a gain. But that I can hardly hope for.\u201d The book became one of the most beloved stories in children\u2019s literature, and Cohen writes that \u201cso choice\u201d has the \u201cinferior\u201d first edition now become, that \u201ccollectors would trade whole segments of their libraries for a single copy of the \u2018first\u2019 Alice; bibliographers dream of uncovering an unrecorded copy; and literary chroniclers are at a loss to explain how, even in the heyday of Victorian publishing, such extravagant decisions could be made over a single children\u2019s book as were made over this one.\u201d Christie\u2019s, which will auction the text on 16 June in New York, says that surviving copies of the \u201clegendary\u201d 1865 edition are \u201cexcessively rare\u201d. Sixteen of the known copies are in institutional libraries, and six in private hands.     One of the illustrations in the first edition of Alice in Wonderland. Photograph: Christie's Images Ltd    The edition Christie\u2019s is selling was personally given by Carroll to his Christ Church colleague George William Kitchin, who gave it to his daughter Alexandra. She sold it at auction in 1925, when it was acquired for the Pforzheimer library. It passed through the hands of different private owners until it was acquired by the Carroll scholar and bibliographer Jon Lindseth. The book is being sold along with a photograph of Alexandra Kitchin taken by Caroll himself \u2013 she was one of his favourite models. The book is \u201cin its true original state, with the text and binding as they were when the book was first produced\u201d, says the auction house, and \u201cno other copy in the original binding in this condition exists in private hands\u201d.",
