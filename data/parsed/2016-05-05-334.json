  "body": "The government has now spent two-thirds of its emissions reduction fund but has only achieved 7% of the emissions cuts it would need to reach its 2030 target, according to analysts. Today the Clean Energy Regulator announced the results of its third Emissions Reduction Fund auction, the centrepiece of government climate policy by which it pays polluters to pollute less. In the auction, it bought 50.5m tonnes of carbon abatement for an average of $10.23 per tonne \u2013 a drop from $13.50 it paid in its first auction in April 2015.  \u201cOur objective is simply to purchase as much abatement as we can with the funds available. All three auctions have exceeded our expectations in this regard,\u201d said the chair of the Clean Energy Regulator, Chloe Munro.

Instead it would rely on accounting rules for \u201ccarry-over\u201d from an earlier period and international carbon credits. It estimated that avoiding just 186m tonnes by 2020 would be enough, leaving just another 43m tonne for the ERF after today. But to meet its 2030 targets agreed to in Paris, which are 26 to 28% below 2005 levels, the Climate Institute estimated the three auctions amount to only 7% of the task. But the 2030 targets themselves aren\u2019t enough to keep the world under 2C. If Australia were to act on that objective, the auctions only account for 3% of the abatement needed by 2030, said the Climate Institute CEO, John Connor. In the latest auction, the vast majority of carbon reduction came from vegetation projects such as avoiding land clearing and revegetation schemes \u2013 they accounted for more than 93% of the carbon abatement bought in the auction.   Related: The time has come to turn up the heat on those who are wrecking planet Earth | Bill McKibben    Recent analysis from the Wilderness Society showed that a land-clearing surge going on in parallel \u2013 particularly in Queensland \u2013 was completely undoing the ERF\u2019s abatement work. That analysis came before the NSW government released a draft of its overhauled land-clearing laws, which aimed to cut red tape for farmers wishing to clear their land. \u201cAt the current rate of tree clearing, the entire 98.5m tonnes of abatement from tree projects bought in the latest ERF auction will be wiped out in just under two years,\u201d said the Wilderness Society national director, Lyndon Schneiders. And Hugh Grossman, from energy analysis firm RepuTex, said national emissions were mostly rising as a result of the biggest industrial emitters, which weren\u2019t engaging with the ERF. \u201cIn isolation, it is doing a really good job \u2013 it\u2019s doing what it\u2019s expected to do and purchasing abatement,\u201d Grossman said. \u201cBut what we\u2019re seeing is that national emission are growing in parallel, despite the ERF.\u201d Munro said another auction was expected to be held before the end of the year, with details to be announced in the coming months.",
