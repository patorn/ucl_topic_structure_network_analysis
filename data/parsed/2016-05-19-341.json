Related: The world adores Justin Trudeau. In Canada, we're still reserving judgment | Rebecca Shapiro    Footage from inside the House of Commons showed Trudeau striding purposefully across the floor of the chamber and into a group of MPs, pulling Conservative Gord Brown by the arm to lead him to his seat so that parliament could begin a procedural vote. Trudeau swore as he made his way to Brown, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, reportedly telling MPs to \u201cget the fuck out of the way\u201d. As Trudeau led Brown from the group, he elbowed New Democrat MP Ruth Ellen Brosseau in the chest. Parliament descended into mayhem as MPs heckled and pounded their desks while New Democratic party leader Tom Mulcair shouted at Trudeau. \u201cWhat kind of man elbows a woman? It\u2019s pathetic! You\u2019re pathetic!\u201d Mulcair can be heard shouting. Once order was restored, Trudeau apologised. \u201cI admit I came in physical contact with a number of members as I extended my arm, including someone behind me who I did not see. \u201cIf anyone feels that they were impacted by my actions, I completely apologise. It was not my intention to hurt anyone.\u201d      New Democrat MP Ruth Ellen Brosseau said she had been overwhelmed by the clash and had needed to leave the chamber. Photograph: Sean Kilpatrick/AP    Brosseau said she had been speaking to her colleagues when Trudeau came marching into the group. \u201cI was elbowed in the chest by the prime minister and then I had to leave,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cIt was very overwhelming and so I left the chamber to go and sit in the lobby. I missed the vote because of this.\u201d Her remarks prompted Trudeau to stand up and apologise to her directly. \u201cI want to take the opportunity \u2026 to be able to express directly to [Brosseau] my apologies for my behaviour and my actions, unreservedly. \u201cI noticed that the whip opposite was being impeded in his progress, I took it upon myself to go and assist him forward, which I can now see was unadvisable as a course of action that resulted in physical contact in this House that we can all accept was unacceptable,\u201d he said.  \u201cI look for opportunities to make amends directly to the member and to any members who feel negatively impacted by this exchange and intervention.\u201d New Democrat Peter Julian described the incident as unprecedented in his 12 years as a politician. \u201cI have never seen any member of the House act towards another member or members as he just did,\u201d Julian said. \u201cPhysical force in this House is never permitted, it is never welcome, and it is entirely inappropriate.\u201d  His outrage was echoed by New Democrat Niki Ashton. \u201cI witnessed the prime minister walk over and manhandle the whip of the official opposition,\u201d she said. \u201cI am ashamed to be a witness to the person who holds the highest position in our country do such an act.\u201d She later added: \u201cIf we apply a gendered lens, it is very important that we recognise that young women in this space need to feel safe to come here and work here. \u201cNot only was this the furthest thing from a feminist act \u2026 He made us feel unsafe and deeply troubled by the conduct of the prime minister of this country.\u201d   Related: Canada's proposed assisted-dying law to preclude suicide tourism    Conservative Peter Van Loan said Trudeau strode across the floor with \u201canger fierce\u201d in his eyes. \u201cWhat took place was the prime minister physically grabbing people, elbowing people, hauling them down the way,\u201d he said. Tempers have been running high in Canada\u2019s parliament all week, as the Liberal government seeks to use its majority to limit debate on a controversial bill on assisted dying. Elizabeth May, the leader of Canada\u2019s Green party, described Trudeau\u2019s actions as unacceptable but pushed for some perspective on the elbowing incident, calling it an accident. \u201cHe had not seen her behind him. That is the truth. Now you can like it or not like it.\u201d She called for cooler heads to prevail. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be the House of Commons that some other country watches on CNN, and wonders what happened.\u201d  As he left parliament, Trudeau refused to speak with reporters. Wednesday marked the second time that Trudeau has apologised over his conduct in Canada\u2019s parliament \u2013 the first time was in 2011 after he called a government minister a \u201cpiece of shit\u201d. \u2022 This article was amended on 19 May 2016 to clarify that Tom Mulcair is the leader of the New Democratic party.",
