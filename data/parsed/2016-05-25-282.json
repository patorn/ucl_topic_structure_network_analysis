  "body": "Debut novelist Hannah Rothschild has pronounced herself, in the words of PG Wodehouse, \u201cterribly gruntled\u201d to win an award for comic fiction named after the Jeeves and Wooster creator.   Related: The Improbability of Love by Hannah Rothschild review \u2013 Baileys-shortlisted art world caper    Rothschild was revealed on Wednesday as the joint winner of the Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse prize for her first novel, The Improbability of Love. She shares the award with Paul Murray\u2019s The Mark and the Void. Named after Wodehouse, the prize is for a novel that best captures the \u201ccomic spirit\u201d of the much-loved novelist. \u201cIt was impossible to separate these two books, because they made us laugh so much. And between them they produce a surfeit of wild satire and piercing humour about the subject that can always make us laugh and cry. Money,\u201d said judge and broadcaster James Naughtie. Murray\u2019s novel tells of a Dublin banker who decides to rob his employer with the help of a struggling novelist. Naughtie and his fellow judges \u2013 Everyman\u2019s Library publisher David Campbell, Hay festival director Peter Florence and comedian and writer Sara Pascoe \u2013 called it \u201can achingly topical, clever, delightful tale of folly and delusion\u201d. Rothschild\u2019s debut, which is also shortlisted for the Baileys women\u2019s prize for fiction, is set in the London art world, and is \u201ca wonderful satire on the art trade, preposterous billionaires, Russian oligarchs and much else, a brilliant conceit faultlessly carried off\u201d, said judges.   Related: The Mark and the Void by Paul Murray review \u2013 messy, profound and hilarious    The prize comes with the added bonus for its winners of a Gloucestershire Old Spot pig named after the winning title, with previous porcine honorees including Snuff, taken from the late Terry Pratchett\u2019s Discworld novel, and Fatty O\u2019Leary\u2019s Dinner Party, from Alexander McCall Smith\u2019s winning title. Organisers confirmed that this year, the first time the prize has been split, there would be two pigs presented to the winning authors at the Hay festival on 4 June. The winners will also both be given Bollinger champagne, and the complete Everyman Wodehouse Collection. \u201cTo use a word that my hero PG Wodehouse invented, I am terribly \u2018gruntled\u2019 by winning this prize; sharing it with the great Paul Murray; and by the prospect of drinking Bollinger while reading an Everyman Classic,\u201d said Rothschild. In 1938, Wodehouse wrote in The Code of the Woosters that \u201che spoke with a certain what-is-it in his voice, and I could see that, if not actually disgruntled, he was far from being gruntled.\u201d Murray, who has been shortlisted for the Wodehouse award in the past, said he was \u201cdelighted and honoured\u201d to win this year. \u201cI first read PG Wodehouse as a boy and have kept returning to him ever since, longer than any other writer \u2013 which makes this award very special,\u201d said the Irish author.",
