The legislation follows publication of the government\u2019s counter-extremism strategy which also promised a full investigation into the application of sharia law in the UK. The review has already been announced, but the Home Office is expected to appoint a chair shortly. A Downing Street spokesman said he would not speculate on the contents of the Queen\u2019s speech, to be held at the state opening of parliament on 18 May, but sources said that legislation was required to introduce the measures announced in October as part of the strategy.
