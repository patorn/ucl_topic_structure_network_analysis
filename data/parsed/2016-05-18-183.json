His comfortable win in Oregon, meanwhile, shows that the Vermont senator, while lacking the apparent means to achieve the necessary delegate count, is still in the game \u2013 both in terms of message and of illuminating the enduring lack of enthusiasm for Clinton, now within 100 delegates of clinching the nomination.  Bernie Sanders takes Oregon primary while Clinton claims Kentucky Clinton\u2019s divisive standing crystallised into outright dislike, even vitriol, at a Democratic rally in Nevada over the weekend. The party\u2019s head, spooked by the rapid dissolution of party loyalty, blamed Sanders and his supporters for the disruption, including throwing chairs at the stage. Sanders condemned the violence but rejected accusations that his supporters were prone to it and refused to apologize. \u201cParty leaders in Nevada \u2026 claim that the Sanders campaign has a \u2018penchant for violence\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is nonsense.\u201d Sanders condemns Nevada convention violence but refuses to apologize Trump releases financials, makes nice with Megyn Kelly Donald Trump has released a limited financial disclosure but said, in so many words, that it was huge. Meanwhile, Trump and Fox News host Megyn Kelly sat down for a highly publicized interview, after reaching a truce that ended a feud which dated back to the first Republican presidential debate last August. He told Kelly that he\u2019d clean forgotten he had called her a bimbo, offered a limited apology for the more extreme aspects of his behavior and, later, proposed engaging in direct talks with North Korea in the still distant likelihood he wins the White House in November. We look at the impact of Latino loathing of Trump, and consider his Latino appeal.           Megyn Kelly questions Donald Trump for calling her a \u2018bimbo\u2019.    Donald Trump pleads ignorance to Megyn Kelly over \u2018bimbo\u2019 tweets: \u2018Did I say that?\u2019 Porn star fights back James Deen, the adult film star, is taking on regulators who say his production company flouted condom regulations, exposing performers to sexually transmitted diseases. The star \u2013 who the Guardian\u2019s Eva Wiseman considers a failed feminist fantasy \u2013 argues that if California contends that his adult company has broken the rules, the state should also go after Bellator MMA and other forms of entertainment. He also accused California of enacting a \u201cpolitical and moral agenda\u201d against pornography and \u201csexual free expression\u201d. James Deen takes on MMA, saying porn faces \u2018unfair\u2019 government scrutiny Obama\u2019s gift to the underpaid The Obama administration has proposed almost doubling the threshold at which workers qualify for overtime pay to $47,476. The pay upgrade, which could affect more than 4 million Americans, won\u2019t come into effect until December. Today just 7% of workers qualify for overtime, compared with 62% in 1975.  Millions could get a raise under Obama administration\u2019s new overtime rules Senate grants 9/11 victims right to sue Saudi Arabia Lawmakers have passed legislation that gives families the right to sue the Saudi government for any role it may have played in the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks. The legislation sets Congress on a collision course with the Obama administration. It could also trigger a sell-off of Saudi-held US treasury bonds that are estimated at well over $100bn. The Saudi foreign minister, Adel bin Ahmed Al-Jubeir, complained earlier this month that Congress is \u201cstripping the principle of sovereign immunities, which would turn the world for international law into the law of the jungle\u201d. Senate grants September 11 victims the right to sue Saudi Arabia Munich ascendant? Bayern Munich is a giant of soccer, but Barcelona, Real Madrid and Man United have a bigger global reach. Getting knocked out of the Champions League in the semi-final could be no hindrance to the German team becoming an American favorite, considers Joshua Kloke. The club will play three matches this summer in Chicago, New York and Charlotte as part of the International Champions Cup.  Can Bayern Munich become America\u2019s favorite football team? American shakedown  Florida congressman David Jolly\u2019s Stop Act seeking a ban of political fundraising has garnered national attention but limited support from his political peers. He tells the Guardian that there\u2019s a \u201chistoric scandal going on in Washington DC and the American people are its victims\u201d. Instead of making laws, he says, \u201cmembers of Congress are undertaking oppressive telemarketing fundraising when they should be on the clock solving our nation\u2019s most pressing problems. This is depriving the country of leadership through their elected representatives, and it\u2019s cheating taxpayers.\u201d \u2018Members of Congress \u2013 like me \u2013 shake down Americans every single day\u2019 Texas: the next trans battleground Tom Dart in Houston writes that Texas is on the verge of joining southern states looking to rebuff the Obama administration\u2019s promotion of transgender rights. Yesterday, on International Day against Homophobia and Transphobia, the Texas governor, Greg Abbott, sent a tweet that\u2019s hard to interpret except as a rebuke to the president: \u201cJFK wanted to send a man to the moon. Obama wants to send a man to the women\u2019s restroom. We must get our country back on track.\u201d Texas is poised to be the next bathroom battleground in transgender fight Who ya gonna call? The real ghostbusters  In a moment of spooky inspiration, the Guardian tracks down an all-women team of ghostbusters, AKA \u201cparanormal investigators\u201d, in Pennsylvania. \u201cI\u2019ve been fascinated with the paranormal, God, probably since birth,\u201d says Morgan Maguire, 24, who now works in Gettysburg, which some say is one of the most haunted cities in the US. \u201cWhen I was little, I didn\u2019t have any female ghost hunters to look up to.\u201d As the women-led remake of the Ghostbusters hits the big screen, Maguire hopes more women will join her profession. \u201cI am so ungodly excited for the new movie, it\u2019s not even funny,\u201d she says. Forget the movie \u2013 meet the real female ghostbusters fighting spirits and sexism And in case you missed it \u2026 The island of Koh Tachai, in the Andaman sea, which Thai authorities fear is being ruined by tourism pressures is not alone in being closed off to visitors, writes Simon Usborne. Caps are becoming common. After all, islands, cathedrals and museums aren\u2019t getting any bigger. Only 1.5 million people will be allowed to visit the Cinque Terre UN world heritage area this year; the mayor of Barcelona is threatening to put a tourist cap on the entire city; Iceland is considering a national limit; and Peru is about to set controls on numbers of visitors to Machu Picchu. Says Rachel O\u2019Reilly of UK tour operator Kuoni: \u201cDestinations need to take a long-term view on how to keep their assets intact and fresh.\u201d Thank you for not visiting: tourist hotspots that have done a Koh Tachai",
