  "body": "Related: Troublemakers: The Story of Land Art review \u2013 sculptors who shaped the American wilderness    Somewhere in the deserts of New Mexico, a nail is embedded into a type of flat-topped mountain known as a mesa. The positioning of this nail, shielded from the elements by a tin can, took days of trial and error, with astronomical measurements provided by the US Naval Observatory and the help of a surveyor. Finally, the correct spot was located: exactly in alignment with the axis of the Earth from the south pole to the north. This nail \u2013 which I braved rattlesnakes to find, on a mountaintop strewn with slabs of granite \u2013 was fundamental to the success of Star Axis, an extraordinary naked-eye observatory that is the brainchild of artist Charles Ross. Only when Ross was sure he had the orientation precisely correct could he begin to build the structure he had dreamed about \u2013 an obsession that has consumed him since 1971. Star Axis is one of the world\u2019s defining earthworks, otherwise known as land art. In the late 60s, a generation of young, New York-based artists, inspired by the space race but also by the turmoil of Vietnam, decided that galleries weren\u2019t big enough to house their visions. So they struck out, choosing instead to make works on an epic scale, sculpted from the elements, in the astounding desert landscapes of the US south-west.     \u2018Anything can happen there\u2019 \u2026 Star Axis, the observatory in New Mexico    The results \u2013 some of which could only be viewed properly from a plane \u2013 include Robert Smithson\u2019s Spiral Jetty, a swirling basalt outcrop surrounded (before Utah was struck by drought) with vivid red water. This, says Virginia Dwan, the land art patron whose gallery helped facilitate it, makes the work feel almost satanic. Walter de Maria\u2019s Lightning Field, meanwhile, features 400 stainless steel rods arranged in a grid in an area of high desert in New Mexico known for its electrical storms. Their appearance, during lightning flashes, is as dazzling as it is unearthly.

Displacing 218,000 tonnes of rock, Heizer cut two enormous grooves \u2013 1,500ft (457 metres) long \u2013 into a mesa in the Nevada desert. He followed this with City, also in the Nevada desert. Stretching over a mile, City is a staggeringly ambitious work full of sculpted pits and peaks. Heizer started it in 1972 and last year told the Guardian it was \u201c98% finished\u201d. Pretty little watercolours these are not. Made by bulldozers and dynamite instead of a paintbrush and easel, the works \u2013 often sited on baking sandscapes \u2013 fuse minimalism and modern industrial aesthetics to evoke the otherworldly structures of ancient civilisations, from Stonehenge to Mayan temples and the Egyptian pyramids.     Satanic \u2026 Robert Smithson\u2019s Spiral Jetty, seen from the air    \u201cThe desert is a metaphor for fate \u2013 anything can happen there,\u201d says James Crump, director of Troublemakers, a gripping new documentary film about these land artists. \u201cThere\u2019s danger, but there\u2019s also this possibility of enlightenment. The desert\u2019s like space.\u201d When Heizer refused to participate in Troublemakers, Crump contemplated filming City with a drone. But such is Heizer\u2019s gritty cowboy demeanour, he \u201cwould have probably shot the drone down\u201d.   Related: Artist James Turrell: I can make the sky any colour you choose    The works were often undertaken at great risk to the artists themselves: Smithson was killed in a plane crash in 1973 while surveying sites for new work Amarillo Ramp. \u201cYou have to ask yourself which young artist is willing to go out and make work in these kinds of conditions,\u201d says Crump, \u201cand challenge themselves with the possibility of death?\u201d Too large to be bought, sold or moved, these works can only be seen if you\u2019re willing to travel. But be warned: the desert terrain can be hostile, and the works are not always easy to locate. British artist Tacita Dean made a work about failing to find Spiral Jetty on her first visit in 1997. These days, she says regretfully, it\u2019s signposted. \u201cSpiral Jetty,\u201d she told the Canadian Art Foundation last year, \u201cwas very much about relating to some sort of hidden place beneath Great Salt Lake, the universal core.\u201d She called her visit \u201ca true pilgrimage\u201d. And like any pilgrimage, the journey is an integral part of the experience.     Bulldozers, not paintbrushes ... Charles Ross building Star Axis. Photograph: Elizabeth Ginsberg/Supplied    Which brings us to the extraordinary experience of seeing Star Axis. Like City, the work is still not finished \u2013 one reason it\u2019s not yet open to the public. The other is that the site has its perils, including several places where the unwary visitor could take a serious fall. Some railings will, apparently, be installed this summer. According to Crump, Ross himself once toppled off one of the structure\u2019s high points while holding an 80lb bag of cement. \u201cThere\u2019s an element of sacrificial danger to his piece,\u201d says the film-maker. The site is not suitable for daytrippers, which is why Ross has asked me not to divulge its exact location. When Star Axis finally opens \u2013 which Ross estimates will be three to four years from now (though one associate says he\u2019s been saying that for the past 20 years) \u2013 six people will be admitted at a time, staying in a guesthouse down the hill so they can experience Star Axis by day and night. Ross spent four years looking for this site. Then one day he was parked in the New Mexico desert with no one for miles around when a cowboy came riding up \u201clike the Marlboro Man\u201d. Ross explained that he was looking for land for a project and the cowboy said: \u201cOh, my dad would be interested in that.\u201d He gave him a business card.     Under construction \u2026 Spiral Jetty    Ross called the number and spoke to rancher WO Culbertson who, much to his surprise, said that his proposed observatory \u201csounds like just the kind of thing we need around here\u201d. How much land did he need? About a square mile. \u201cWell hell, we got plenty of those,\u201d declared Culbertson. \u201cDrive around the ranch and pick one out.\u201d Ross took 400 acres in the end \u2013 50 for Star Axis and 350 for the mesa on which his house is situated, which he shares with his wife, the artist Jill O\u2019Bryan.   Related: Michael Heizer: 'I\u2019m a quiet man. I just make art'    My friend Jess and I have driven through mountains and deserts to a prearranged meeting point: a postbox on a dirt road. We\u2019re early, so we drive down the road. Off in the distance we can see a stony point sticking out of the top of a mesa. Ominous and alluring, this is our first sight of Star Axis. At 5pm, a man called Harry Leippe arrives in a pickup truck. A sculptor based in New Mexico, Leippe is 90, and has known Ross, his junior by 12 years, since the late 1950s, when both were at Berkley, where Ross was studying mathematics. Leippe has collaborated on Star Axis \u201csince before the beginning\u201d, and looks after the site while Ross is away: the artist spends half the year here, the other half in New York. It\u2019s not difficult to see why Star Axis is taking so long. Despite the monumental scale of the project, it is being built by a surprisingly small number of people: between four and six locals. A greater number than that, says Ross, and people start to get in each other\u2019s way. Do people round here think he\u2019s nuts? \u201cMy foreman overheard someone in the general store say, \u2018Hey man, that guy up on the hill, he\u2019s crazier than we are!\u2019 A reputation I\u2019d like to keep.\u201d Leippe leads us down five miles of dirt road. We go through two gates warning away trespassers and bumpily ascend the mesa. At the top is a granite pyramid, glowing pinkish in the late afternoon. Much of the granite was donated by a company in Texas: Ross estimates its value at a million dollars. When I ask if the project has been easy to fund, he shouts with laughter. \u201cMy god, no! We\u2019re still struggling to get funding and I don\u2019t have the money to finish it. But we\u2019ve had some generous donors and I\u2019ve funded more than half through sales of my work.\u201d Ross\u2019s other pieces include prism installations, which he started making in 1965. Exploring light has been his life\u2019s work.     Inside the Hour Chamber at Star Axis, with the north star visible at the top of the triangular opening    Inside the pyramid, a curving flight of steps leads to the Hour Chamber. This is a pyramidal room with a triangular opening nearly 30ft tall. Jess and I sit on a bench at the back and wait for night to fall. It\u2019s a cloudless evening, with a sliver of new moon low in the sky. Before long, as promised by Ross, Polaris appears, clear and bright at the apex of the triangle. Polaris, the north star, is around 430 light years from Earth, directly above the north pole. It\u2019s the star that travellers have used to orient themselves for millennia. Because of the alignment of the work, Polaris doesn\u2019t move, but the stars below it arc round from one side of the triangle to the other, each taking exactly an hour. On this still night in the desert, thickly speckled with stars thanks to the absence of light pollution, we\u2019re experiencing the rotation of the Earth as never before. It\u2019s a cosmic experience \u2013 both literally and figuratively. On the eastern side of the pyramid are two more lines, the higher of which points to the position of the sun at noon on the summer solstice; the lower to the sun on the winter solstice. There are steps to the top of the pyramid, which offers astounding views of the empty plains stretching out for miles around. At the bottom of the pyramid is a ledge. Jess and I peer over it and gasp: using dynamite, Ross has cut a steep-sided basin into the top of the mesa. At its base is the start of a real stairway to heaven: 163 steep steps leading back up to a circle cut into the pyramid and ringed with stainless steel. Through this, at night, you can see the north star. This staircase, which rises through a tunnel, is the point of Star Axis. Exactly in alignment with the Earth\u2019s axis, it demonstrates a phenomenon called precession, the slow cycle of change caused by the wobbling of the Earth. Because of this wobble, Polaris won\u2019t always be due north: over the course of 26,000 years, the axis will move to point to different stars, each becoming the pole star until returning to Polaris.     \u2018There\u2019s danger, but there\u2019s also this possibility of enlightenment. The desert\u2019s like space\u2019 \u2026 Star Axis Photograph: Kerry Loewen/Supplied    The ancient Egyptians knew about precession. Using nothing more sophisticated than a plumb weight and horsehair, they measured the north star\u2019s movement so accurately that, thousands of years later, the Naval Observatory told Ross: \u201cWe can only better their measurements by the thickness of a few horsehairs.\u201d And this is one of the most moving things about Star Axis: it demonstrates the connection between the tiniest details and their grand consequences in the universe. Ross realised that it would be possible to build a tunnel aligned with the Earth\u2019s axis which, by moving up it, would allow visitors to trace the progression of the north star over this 26,000-year cycle. At first he envisaged a staircase on the front of the mesa, but then started having recurring dreams that said: \u201cYou have to enter the Earth to reach the stars.\u201d Ross says: \u201cMy attitude to those kinds of messages used to be \u2018What the hell\u2019s that?\u2019 and just plough ahead. But I\u2019ve learned to listen.\u201d     Charles Ross at Star Axis \u2026 he once fell off the work clutching an 80lb bag of cement    Climbing the long, steep and (as yet) bannister-free staircase after dark, looking at the north star through the circle, you\u2019re seeing the axial wobble, as Polaris moves further from its central pole. You\u2019re witnessing the star as it appeared at different stages through thousands of years of history \u2013 and how it will appear in the future. \u201cThe first step will be dated 2100,\u201d says Ross. That\u2019s the year when Polaris will be closest to its celestial pole. \u201cAs you go up and put more effort in, you\u2019re going further back and further forward. It approximately goes from 11,000 BC, around the recently proposed time for building the Sphinx, to 15,000 AD.\u201d This mindbending concept may be hard to grasp, but the genius of Star Axis is that it shows rather than tells. Though it combines architecture and science, Ross insists Star Axis an artwork first and foremost. \u201cWe\u2019re not making a measuring device,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re making a place for personal experience. It was always my intention that it should be a whole-body experience. That was the epiphany at the beginning \u2013 like, \u2018This is an interesting idea, but I don\u2019t just want this in my head, I want to feel it form around me. To me that\u2019s art rather than science \u2013 and all my scientific advisors would agree.\u201d He laughs.     Spinning worlds \u2026 the view from Star Axis at night    It\u2019s certainly a profoundly emotional experience, as is sitting in the chamber at the foot of the stairs and watching the stars move from one side of a rectangular opening to the other in a straight line \u2013 again, thanks to the work\u2019s alignment. You\u2019re suddenly hyper-aware of the movement of the heavens and the mystery of the universe. \u201cI\u2019ll put it this way,\u201d says Ross, \u201cif you spend enough time there, a different part of your awareness wakes up. I think there\u2019s a recognition within the body of these alignments that we\u2019ve had for ever. It\u2019s in our genetic code. A place like Star Axis lets that code express itself.\u201d Ross actually thinks of Star Axis as sky art rather than land art. \u201cI had never visited any ancient observatories when I started building this. But when I visit them now I realise \u2013 from my experience of Star Axis \u2013 exactly why they built them: to get a feeling for the sky. They wanted to touch it, make it personal. They wanted to have a sense that they were reaching out and making physical contact with those alignments. A sensory experience, that\u2019s what they were going for, and you get it immediately if you go to Mayan observatories. You\u2019re immediately in \u2013 mentally, spiritually, physically.\u201d Troublemakers depicts land art as a Promethean struggle between man and nature, but that is only part of Ross\u2019s experience. \u201cMoving heavy rocks and trying to get gravity to behave is a struggle.\u201d But the real point of his creation, he says, is sensing your place in the universe. \u201cI never feel small under the stars at Star Axis,\u201d Ross says. \u201cI feel more like, \u2018Wow, all of this has been made for me \u2013 for all of us.\u201d \u2022 Troublemakers is in cinemas from 13 May.",
