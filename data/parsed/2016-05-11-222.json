  "body": "Amazon\u2019s new motoring show starring Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May will be called The Grand Tour. In a statement, the former Top Gear trio thanked fans for taking the time to send in their suggestions for the name, which they said were \u201cmuch appreciated\u201d. \u201cThing is,\u201d said Clarkson, \u201cwe\u2019ll be travelling the world hosting each episode in a different country, from a giant tent. It\u2019s a sort of \u2018grand tour\u2019, if you like. So we\u2019ve decided to call it The Grand Tour.\u201d   Related: Ex-Top Gear trio Clarkson, Hammond and May to launch DriveTribe website    May said he was underwhelmed by the name. \u201cI wanted to call it \u2018Nigel\u2019, or \u2018Roger\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cWe needed a name, and they\u2019re names.\u201d Hammond was more positive. \u201cI already love camping,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is something else. We are like our pioneering and prospecting forebears, sallying forth into a new frontier of broadcasting, and making our home where\u2026\u201d  Clarkson tweeted just after the announcement:    So, the Grand Tour (GT for short) will come from a tent, which we will put up in a different location every week. Your town?\u2014 Jeremy Clarkson (@JeremyClarkson) May 11, 2016    Hammond also took to Twitter:    We've got a name. And it was bleeding obvious cos it's what we're doing: coming from a different place every weekhttps://t.co/T93o2M7dh9\u2014 Richard Hammond (@RichardHammond) May 11, 2016      ...Best of all, we've got a MASSIVE tent as our studio. Same tent, different view, different crowd every week on our Grand Tour.\u2014 Richard Hammond (@RichardHammond) May 11, 2016    May also commented:    I still think 'Nigel' was a better name.https://t.co/nIlrOaosXF\u2014 James May (@MrJamesMay) May 11, 2016      I'm sorry if your name wasn't used for our new show. But neither were any of mine. https://t.co/nIlrOaosXF\u2014 James May (@MrJamesMay) May 11, 2016    The Grand Tour\u2019s Facebook page features a video showing some of the spoof names that were under consideration, including \u201cAutomates\u201d, \u201cA Small Puddle of Excellence\u201d and \u201cThe Ace Biscuit\u201d.      The Grand Tour\u2019s naming video   It also features the video Clarkson released of the trio brainstorming the spoof names, plus photos of filming in Portugal, Barbados, north Africa and London.  Early reports had suggested the show might be called Gear Knobs, but in April Clarkson claimed the BBC had a legal right to stop the new show using the word \u201cgear\u201d in the title.  The name the trio chose fits with their ambition to do something different to the BBC series, moving further away from the traditional car show format with studio segments and big set-pieces. The Grand Tour is set to debut this autumn on Amazon\u2019s video service. It is not yet clear whether all the episodes will be released in one go, as Amazon and rival Netflix have done with many of their drama series, or follow a more traditional scheduled pattern, though May has previously said it is likely to be the latter.   Related: Is Jeremy Clarkson's Amazon show turning into a car crash?    Amazon is paying \u00a3160m for three series of the show, which is being made by a production company set up by the three former Top Gear presenters and long-time producer Andy Wilman called W Chump & Sons. The streaming service\u2019s European video boss told the Guardian last month that the trio were \u201cworth big money\u201d. The unveiling of the show\u2019s name comes just weeks before the BBC is due to launch the new series of Top Gear fronted by Chris Evans, along with co-presenters including former Friends star Matt LeBlanc.  The show has been beset by reports of production problems including controversy over filming near London\u2019s Cenotaph memorial and allegations Evans is a bully.  However, Evans and the BBC have both denied there is friction among the cast.",
