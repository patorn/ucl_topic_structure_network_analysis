  "body": "Wolf Hall director Peter Kosminsky has said he is \u201cnot reassured at all\u201d by the government\u2019s proposals to radically overhaul BBC governance, saying they could mean the BBC \u201cdrifts dangerously close to becoming a state broadcaster\u201d.  The Bafta award-winning director told the Guardian that plans for the government to appoint six members of the new unitary board were an \u201canathema\u201d and represented a direct attack on the corporation\u2019s editorial independence.  \u201cI am not reassured at all,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce we start to have that number of people on the editorial board put there by the government you can kiss goodbye to the BBC\u2019s reputation for independence.\u201d   Related: BBC white paper: key points at a glance    Kosminsky\u2019s comments stood in contrast to those of other celebrities following the announcement. Armando Iannucci, whose landmark speech defending the BBC in Edinburgh last year led to meetings with John Whittingdale, tweeted his support.    This has been a long, tough dialogue. Now's time to celebrate and support a brilliant broadcaster. #BBCwhitepaper\u2014 Armando Iannucci (@Aiannucci) May 12, 2016    However, earlier he had joined calls to \u201ckeep up the pressure on editorial independence of the BBC\u201d. He went on to call for everyone to \u201cstart thinking now of Channel 4\u201d, a reference to the fact that the government is still considering partial privatisation of the state-owned broadcaster which is commercially funded.  Science presenter Brian Cox, who had warned against interference in the BBC, tweeted earlier on Thursday: \u201cBBC charter renewal now looks sensible, subject to reducing ministerial influence over appointments to the board.\u201d The Great British Bake Off\u2019s Sue Perkins tweeted: \u201cI\u2019d happily hog-tie and paddle Mr Whittingdale for what he has done \u2013 only I suspect he\u2019d rather enjoy it\u201d. Kosminsky described the governance proposals as \u201ccentral and most troubling issue\u201d, adding that the fears were not party political and referring back to previous disagreements between the BBC and the then Labour government over the Hutton inquiry.  \u201cImagine if this had happened when there was a terrific spat over the dodgy dossier,\u201d he said. \u201cThe BBC must be independent and perhaps more importantly must be seen to be independent.\u201d Kosminksy\u2019s support for the BBC and comparisons with North Korea at the start of Sunday night\u2019s Bafta awards ceremony provoked a standing ovation. \u201cWe have a fairly unusual thing and it\u2019s very very previous and fragile,\u201d he repeated after the white paper was published.",
