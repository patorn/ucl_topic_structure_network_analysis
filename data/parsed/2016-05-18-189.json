In an escalation of the trade spat, the US has raised its tariffs on imports of cold rolled steel from China to 522% from 266%, citing a refusal to cooperate with anti-dumping investigations. By comparison, the EU has imposed provisional tariffs on China of 16% for cold rolled steel, which is used to manufacture cars and appliances and in construction. The UK is one of 14 countries that have been blocking EU plans to impose tougher sanctions on cheap Chinese steel imports. Sajid Javid, the business secretary, has said it would not be right for the EU to scrap regulations known as the \u201clesser duty rule\u201d, which some countries want to end in order to allow higher tariffs on Chinese steel. Gareth Stace, director of UK Steel, welcomed the US move. He said: \u201cThe United States has quickly identified the problem with China dumping steel and imposed effective and robust trade barriers. The EU has been slower and the result is we\u2019re still haggling over tariffs and action to prevent unfairly traded Chinese steel. Britain and the EU need to stop treading on egg shells and take decisive action following America\u2019s impressive lead.\u201d A spokesman for the Community trade union said that unfairly traded Chinese steel was still hurting UK and European steel producers.  \u201cWe have repeatedly said that there needs to be swifter and more robust action by the European commission but unfortunately, it\u2019s the UK government that is among the countries preventing this happening due to its continued opposition to ending the lesser duty rule.\u201d At the Unite union, Tony Burke, assistant general secretary with responsibility for manufacturing, said: \u201cThe continued failure to agree to tariffs for Chinese steel reflects really badly on the UK government. It sends out all the wrong signals while we are working day in, day out to try to secure a future for the sector. \u201cOn this, the UK government cannot face two ways. It has to decide where its priorities lie: in giving this core industry a fighting chance or cosying up to the Chinese? When it comes to steel it cannot do both.\u201d US and EU unions, including Unite, will meet at an event in Frankfurt next week to come up with a common approach to China. China\u2019s steel exports reached a record 112.4m tonnes last year, up 19% \u2013 but their value fell 10.5% to $62.8bn (\u00a343.2bn) as a result of falling prices. This has led to a global steel glut, which has plunged European producers into crisis. India\u2019s Tata has put its UK steel factories up for sale, putting thousands of jobs at risk across the country, including more than 4,000 in Port Talbot. There are seven bidders jostling for the business: a management buyout team, steel and property group Liberty House, three foreign steelmakers and two private equity firms. In defiance of the US move, China, the world\u2019s largest steel producer, said it would push on with controversial tax rebates to steel exporters to support the sector\u2019s restructuring after a slowdown in demand at home.  China\u2019s ministry of finance said it would continue to implement a tax rebate policy on steel exports to fund a costly capacity closure plan. It plans to eliminate 100m-150m tonnes of annual production \u2013 more than the US produces every year \u2013 over the next five years. The US commerce department said on Tuesday the new duties would in effect increase by more than fivefold the import prices on Chinese-made steel products, which totalled $272.3m in 2015. The department found they were being sold in the US below cost and with unfair subsidies.   China\u2019s commerce ministry hit back by expressing its \u201cstrong dissatisfaction\u201d with the move. It said: \u201cThe United States adopted many unfair methods during the anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigation into Chinese products, including the refusal to grant Chinese state-owned firms a differentiated tax rate.\u201d  Analysts said the US duty increase would not have a big impact on China\u2019s overall steel exports because its shipments to the US account for just 2% of the total.  The Group of Seven leading industrial countries plans to discuss the steel glut when it meets in Japan this month.  China denies that its mills have been dumping their products in other countries, arguing that its steelmakers are more efficient.",
