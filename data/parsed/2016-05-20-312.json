  "body": "Lenore Taylor has been appointed editor of Guardian Australia. Taylor, who is currently political editor, is replacing Emily Wilson, who is returning to London after two years in Sydney to become assistant editor of the Guardian. A founding member of the Guardian Australia team, Taylor has 30 years\u2019 experience in reporting and two Walkley awards to her name, and has twice won the Paul Lyneham award for excellence in press gallery journalism. \u201cThe opportunity to lead Guardian Australia is a huge honour,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cWe\u2019ve come so far in just three years and my aim is to expand our quality, independent coverage of all the issues that are important to our readers. I\u2019m following two inspiring editors in Katharine Viner and Emily Wilson and I have the great privilege of leading a dedicated and talented team.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, said Taylor had been an integral part of the success of Guardian Australia the past three years. \u201cShe is a brilliant journalist and the ideal person to take Guardian Australia to the next stage of its development,\u201d Viner said. \u201cI can\u2019t wait to see what she does as editor.\u201d In her new UK role, Wilson will have responsibility for global themes including environment, technology, global development, cities and global aspects of science and health. Viner said: \u201cUnder Emily\u2019s leadership Guardian Australia has gone from strength to strength, with unique browser numbers increasing by over 40% in the last two years. She has been instrumental in developing the Guardian\u2019s position as an independent and highly credible voice in Australia\u2019s political and cultural landscape and her team have produced some fantastic journalism that we should all be proud of.\u201d",
