A film about Jesse Owens, it depicts the legendary African-American athlete training at Ohio State University, then his controversial participation in the 1936 Berlin Olympics. The Nazis hoped the Games would serve as perfect propaganda, not only for their regime, but for the concept of Aryan ethnic superiority. Instead, Owens became the hero of the event, winning four medals, making him both the fastest man on earth \u2013 and the most famous. From segregated changing rooms at home to Hitler\u2019s (historically disputed) refusal to shake his hand in Berlin, the film makes clear that Owens had to battle racism every rocket-fuelled step of the way. With the Black Lives Matter movement \u2013 not to mention the rise of Donald Trump \u2013 forcing America to confront its treatment of African-Americans, Race seems especially timely, though it lacks the finesse of Selma, another recent film that explored an even more pivotal moment in black American history.   Related: Race review \u2013 reverential middle-of-the-pack drama    Stephan James, the 22-year-old Canadian actor, was in both movies: he stars as Owens in Race, and in Selma, he played civil rights activist John Lewis. \u201cWhen we started making Selma,\u201d he says, \u201cthe Black Lives Matter movement didn\u2019t exist. The parallels between Martin Luther King staging these marches, suffering police brutality \u2026 we weren\u2019t even aware when making the film that these sorts of things would start to happen again in 2015.\u201d Movies such as Selma and Race show, he says, \u201cthat we\u2019ve been dealing with these sorts of things for a long time. So when are we going to change it? When are we going to look to our past and find a way to better ourselves, and the way we do things?\u201d     Stephan James. Photograph: Bernard Weil/Toronto Star via Getty Images    However, James has no desire to be spokesman for a whole community. \u201cI don\u2019t want that pressure. Everything I do is just an opportunity to tell a great story. Who says no to playing Jesse Owens or John Lewis? It\u2019s just stories of incredible moments in time that don\u2019t just affect people who look like me, but people who look like you, who aren\u2019t American, who aren\u2019t black, who aren\u2019t athletes. These stories are universal, so to me it\u2019s bigger than Black Lives Matter or the Civil Rights movement.\u201d It\u2019s a sunny Monday lunchtime in New York, and James has just flown in from Toronto, his home, where he has been hanging out with his family on a break from his next project, the Fox TV drama Shots Fired, in which he will play a prosecutor from the Department of Justice in a case involving a black cop who has shot dead an unarmed white teenager. Softly spoken, with a goatee beard, rock-star shades and a black leather jacket, he adds a dash of glamour to his chosen interview venue \u2013 the business centre of the Mandarin hotel in New York. As the photocopiers clatter, James enthuses about the new mood in Canada, which seems to be enjoying a moment of political and cultural hipness ranging from the Weeknd to Justin Trudeau. James voted for Canada\u2019s young prime minister; the first time he was old enough to do so. \u201cI think he\u2019s hopeful, he\u2019s a visionary, he\u2019s sort of futuristic, he gives us a different edge than we\u2019ve had in the past, and to see some of his ideals already starting to come to fruition \u2013 it\u2019s encouraging,\u201d he says. \u201cI think we needed someone like him. Certainly this newer generation, someone they can relate to and hopefully grow with.\u201d Does he think there will be a massive influx of disaffected American liberals attempting to cross the border if Trump gets in? \u201cI think so,\u201d he laughs, \u201cbut there\u2019s no room in my house.\u201d A massive sports fan (\u201cbasketball, football, baseball means a lot to us in Toronto\u201d) James went to Beijing to watch the Athletics World Championships after shooting Race, where he met Owens\u2019s modern-day equivalent, Usain Bolt. \u201cTo hear the way he spoke about Jesse \u2026 everybody who runs, he has impacted in some shape or form.\u201d     James in pre-Games training sessions. Photograph: Allstar/SOLOFILMS    James had to train hard to play Owens credibly. \u201cIt was long, man,\u201d he says. \u201cAbout two months before we started shooting, I went to Georgia Tech and started training with track and field coaches there, and continued my training throughout the whole filming process. It was about five months of being in the best shape of my life and obviously getting much faster to make myself believable as Jesse.\u201d James can run the 100m in just over 12 seconds \u2013 Owens\u2019s record was 10.3. James also spent time with Owens\u2019s daughter and grandchildren, who told him that the sprinter rarely talked about his victories at the Berlin Olympics. The film is framed as a fairly standard inspirational triumph against the odds, and doesn\u2019t allude to the sprinter\u2019s subsequent difficulties. Stripped of his amateur status in 1940, he was reduced to running against racehorses for money. After Berlin, says James, Owens \u201ccame back to an America that was still very flawed. So him being so famous didn\u2019t mean anything: he was still black. But it\u2019s a testament to the kind of man he was \u2013 a classy, upstanding guy, who just picked his head up and did what he had to do.\u201d     Jesse Owens takes a practice jump aboard the S.S. Manhattan, en route to Berlin in 1936. Photograph: Joe Caneva/AP    The film is at its most provocative when it compares America in the 1930s to Nazi Germany; at the Olympics, Owens is surprised to discover that the dormitories are not racially segregated, even while Jews are being rounded up and bundled into trucks. German film director Leni Riefenstahl also features, played by Carice van Houten from Game of Thrones. She is almost depicted as a feminist hero, battling Joseph Goebbels, Hitler\u2019s propaganda chief, to realise her film, Olympia. \u201cShe just had a duty to document these games and create a film that would last for ever,\u201d says James, like the film, distinctly downplaying Riefenstahl\u2019s role as one of the Nazis\u2019 most potent propagandists. \u201cAnd she did an incredible job, obviously.\u201d James says he grew up fascinated by acting \u2013 \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve always been an actor\u201d \u2013 taking theatre classes in school, going for auditions, and then making the trajectory from bit parts to guest slots and, finally, leading roles. He\u2019s also gone through that traditional rite of passage for Canadian actors, a role on the high-school TV drama Degrassi, though sadly his and Drake\u2019s time on the show did not coincide. Given that it was the lack of Oscar nominations for Selma, and the absence of people of colour from the best actor categories that kicked off the #OscarsSoWhite debate, I ask James whether he thinks things are changing. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem of diversity,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are women who can\u2019t get jobs in film or television, there are people who are getting discriminated against because of age, it\u2019s not just people of colour who have issues getting nominated, or even seen, to begin with. And I think that that starts behind the scenes in the filmmaking process. We have to start creating more material that gives a platform for people of colour, for women, for old people and young people alike to be able to showcase their talent. It\u2019s much bigger than a black or white thing.\u201d     James as Jesse Owens in Race. Photograph: Courtesy Eve/REX/Shutterstock    James says he admires Sean Penn, Denzel Washington and Daniel Day-Lewis, and adds: : \u201cI\u2019ve been watching Leonardo DiCaprio my whole life.\u201d The last movie he saw was Captain America: Civil War: \u201cThat\u2019s another thing I\u2019d like to do \u2013 a superhero movie.\u201d Hollywood\u2019s lack of diversity directly affects him, and he is aware that there are roles that are closed to him. \u201cOf course it affects me,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not something I\u2019m making up, it\u2019s just facts. Look who\u2019s represented every single day, whether it\u2019s television or film. And if you do the math, it doesn\u2019t add up. Of course I have to work double times harder, of course I have to be that much smarter about my choices and take advantage of every opportunity that does come to me, knowing that the opportunities that do come to me are probably limited.\u201d Race concludes by showing Owens and his wife attending a dinner at the Waldorf Astoria in their honour, then being told by the doorman that they have to use the tradesman\u2019s entrance. James\u2019s entry into Hollywood has not involved that level of humiliation, but the way his career, and those of other talented young actors of colour, is allowed to develop, will be the real test of whether things are changing in the film industry. \u2022 Race opens in the UK on 3 June. \u2022 This article was amended on 27 May 2016. An earlier version said that Jesse Owens ran 100 metres in 9.4 seconds, rather than 10.3.",
