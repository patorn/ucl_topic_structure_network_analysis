On Monday morning he did so again \u2013 this time literally. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing in Atlantic City encapsulates the ugliness and the greed,\u201d the Democratic hopeful told a crowd just off the famous casino strip in the New Jersey gambling town, \u201cthe greed and the recklessness we have seen from Donald Trump and Carl Icahn.\u201d Interrupted by howls of disapproval from the crowd, he asked: \u201cOh, you know Donald Trump? Well, I take it you don\u2019t think he is a brilliant, successful businessman who can bring the kind of prosperity to America that he has brought here.\u201d If American voters want to know what a United States ruled by Trump might look like, they could start by looking here. Boardwalk Hall, the ornate art deco hall where Sanders spoke, is steps from the now-shuttered Trump Plaza casino, where a boarded-over marquee is notably absent Trump\u2019s name. The presumptive Republican nominee sued to have it removed. It\u2019s also just a mile from the Trump Taj Mahal casino. This is one of America\u2019s most distressed cities. It is about a week from bankruptcy, still rebuilding from \u201cSuperstorm\u201d Sandy and reeling from consecutive casino closures.  It\u2019s also a town molded by Trump, whose name stomps across the top of the nearby Taj Mahal casino. He has sued to have his name removed from that building too, but had a 10% stake in the business now owned by billionaire Icahn until this February.   Related: Bernie Sanders adds more delegates, but chances of winning are still slim to none    Nevertheless, though many of Sanders\u2019 supporters knew the odds were stacked against their man in an increasingly untenable bid for the White House, they refused to relinquish hope. \u201cPeople who say the Sanders campaign can\u2019t make it \u2013 it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Riley Rooster, a 27-year-old New Orleans native who has traveled across the country for the last two months to volunteer for Sanders. \u201cIt\u2019s about reinvigorating the youth vote,\u201d he said. Sanders supporters, he said, have \u201clegitimate hope, and compassion, and love in their hearts \u2026 and we\u2019re hoping to use that hope and love as our weapon\u201d. Less than a month out from New Jersey\u2019s 7 June primary, things increasingly look desperate for the Vermont senator. As things stand, former secretary of state Hillary Clinton needs 155 delegates to secure the Democratic nomination, and Sanders needs 929. Although Clinton only leads Sanders by about 300 delegates, she has a huge advantage in superdelegates \u2013 party elites who are not bound by primary results and favor her in vast numbers. In this state, an average of two polls conducted by New Jersey\u2019s Rutgers and Monmouth universities put Clinton ahead of Sanders by 18.5%. As elsewhere in the Democratic race, New Jersey\u2019s 126 delegates will be awarded proportionally, meaning even if he wins, Clinton\u2019s delegate count will also increase.  As Sanders pointed out at the Atlantic City rally, however, he fairs better than Clinton in general election polls. On average, Clinton has a 6.5% average lead over Trump. Sanders has a 13.4% advantage.  Poker face off Atlantic City\u2019s connections to the presumptive Republican nominee seem endless.  The state\u2019s unpopular governor, Chris Christie, who is attempting to take over the city\u2019s government in a fashion similar to Michigan\u2019s takeover of Detroit, was just appointed to Trump\u2019s \u201ctransition team\u201d.  \u201cGovernor Christie is an extremely knowledgeable and loyal person with the tools and resources to put together an unparalleled transition team,\u201d said Trump in a statement. At Sanders\u2019 local campaign office on Atlantic Avenue, the city\u2019s main commercial street, volunteers rustled up support for Monday\u2019s rally inside a stuffy storefront normally home to Unite Here Local 54, a service workers\u2019 union. That storefront is feet away from the road that leads directly to the Taj, where workers this winter lost a court case to Icahn, the casino\u2019s new billionaire owner who purchased the asset from Trump. Trump\u2019s remaining ownership stake was negotiated after a lawsuit to remove his name, that was settled with a 10% piece of the business and an agreement to leave the Trump name plastered on and throughout the building.  \u201cI let them use my name, but I have nothing to do with it,\u201d Trump told NPR in 2014, when he started his lawsuit to get his name removed from two casinos. \u201cI got out seven years ago \u2013 my timing was impeccable.\u201d      Inside Trump Taj Mahal, branding related to the Republicans frontrunner is inescapable. Photograph: Jessica Glenza for the Guardian    Trump, as much as any Borgata or Caesar\u2019s mogul, has shaped the landscape of the city. The first casino to bear Trump\u2019s name opened in 1984 \u2013 the Harrah\u2019s at Trump Plaza, according to the University of Las Vegas Center for Gaming Research. Trump Castle opened in 1985, and was renamed Trump Marina in 1996. Trump Taj Mahal opened in 1990.  Trump did successfully have his name removed from Trump Plaza, and the hulking black shell of a building now mars the city\u2019s boardwalk, with no evidence of its previous owner visible.  The city was the scene for three of Trump\u2019s four bankruptcies. The first came just one year after the Taj opened, when the $1bn casino (financed by Trump) had $3bn in debt. Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts, the group that held the Taj and Trump Plaza before Icahn, restructured in 2004, becoming Trump Entertainment Resorts. That went bankrupt in 2009, according to PolitiFact, leading to the Icahn takeover. For local business owners in Atlantic City, construction companies and investors in the casinos, these bankruptcies meant personally losing thousands of dollars so Trump could escape debt. Many counted reduced retirements and construction debts in their losses.  The Press of Atlantic City reported contractors viewed Trump \u201cas a jerk and a bum\u201d. \u201cIt was a joke among all the [subcontractors] that you\u2019d tack on an extra 10% on to your bids\u201d to balance against delayed payments, Dave Farragut, president of United States Roofing Corporation of Norristown, Pennsylvania, told the newspaper about a $600,000 roofing job he picked up at the Trump Taj Mahal. \u201cHe was slow pay, everybody knew.\u201d  The Trump brand Inside Trump Taj Mahal, branding related to the New Yorker is inescapable. The casino\u2019s frequent visitors enjoy Trump One membership, which gives you access to special offers. A monumental black and white portrait of the man hangs in the first store seen from the escalator to the shopping level. Above the photograph is a Trump quote: \u201cYou have to think anyway, why not think big?\u201d  Each receipt for a bottle of water or a muffin bears Trump\u2019s name. In bright lights, \u201cDonald J Trump presents the Taj Mahal\u201d adorns the valet entrance. Trump\u2019s name is on the ice buckets.     They bet everything on the casinos and now they\u2019re losing  David Peter Alan, Sanders supporter     But when New Jersey residents voice their displeasure with the city\u2019s former baron, they are equally outspoken. This winter, an 18-foot homemade Trump lawn sign in nearby Egg Harbor Township was defaced twice in a month then set on fire.  \u201cThese jobs were good jobs back in the early 80s,\u201d said Valerie McMorris, a cocktail waitress and member of Local 54, at the Sanders rally Monday, referring to casino work. \u201cThat was a time when the owners were hands on.\u201d \u201cThen you have people like Donald Trump,\u201d she said, to a chorus of boos. \u201cI was a cocktail waitress, I had a pension, I had job security \u2026 All these things are gone because a billionaire from Wall Street used the bankruptcy laws to strip the workers of all these things,\u201d she said, referring to Icahn and Trump.  Away from casinos, small businesses are also suffering income losses in Atlantic City, not only from casino workers but from municipal employees who delayed their paychecks for a month when the city couldn\u2019t pay its bills. \u201cEconomy is bad, very bad,\u201d said Trupti Shah, one of a family of proprietors of Peter\u2019s Convenience Store on Arctic Avenue. \u201cI got robbed in a week two times.\u201d Shah used to supervise slots at a Hilton-owned property, but lost her job when the company reorganized. She then took a position at the ill-fated Revel, which lasted only two years before the $2.4bn casino shuttered and sold for just $82m. \u201cWhen we had only the casinos, that was good. But when they give permission to Philadelphia they screwed Atlantic City,\u201d she said. The native of Gujarat, India, blames the government entirely for this. \u201cNobody cares about Atlantic City.\u201d     A boarded up house stands just steps from the casino. Photograph: Jessica Glenza for the Guardian    At one time, Atlantic City seemed to mint money.  A losing hand Though the town is famous for its casinos, they have been here for less than 40 years. Casino gambling was legalized in New Jersey in 1978 through a constitutional amendment that restricted casinos to Atlantic City. The measure was billed as a way to revitalize the town, which lost tourism when travel to destinations such as Florida and the Bahamas became easier. Other taxes on casino revenue, such as an 8% tax on gross casino revenue to aid senior citizens and the handicapped, eased the transition.  In 2006, thousands of visitors spent $6.5bn at casinos alone, a marquee year.  But by 2011, that had fallen to $4.5bn. The number of slots alone reduced by a quarter, from nearly 36,000 to around 27,000. In that space of five years more than 10,400 people lost casino jobs.  Now, the city is at a roughly 32-year low number of casino employees. The latest estimates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for Atlantic City put the number of hospitality employees at about 34,700. In 1984, the second year the Center for Gaming Research began tracking it, casinos alone employed 33,681.  Unemployment in Atlantic City hovered at 7.8% in March. That is significant progress from a year earlier, when the city\u2019s unemployment rate was 11.6%, but it is still above the national average.  \u201cThey bet everything on the casinos and now they\u2019re losing,\u201d said David Peter Alan, a 68-year-old socialist and Sanders supporter from South Orange, New Jersey. In 2014, he traveled to Atlantic City to watch the closing of Trump Plaza.  \u201cI saw the empty room with its 1980s garishness with one slot machine after another doing nothing,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to see it, I made the trip to AC to see it.\u201d  Problematically, Atlantic City\u2019s fortunes are beginning to impact the rest of New Jersey.    Related: Sanders is bad on detail, but he has what Hillary lacks: the spirit of protest | Jill Abramson    Alan, a transit activist, said he is now concerned because limp casino revenues have halved grants transit authorities use to provide buses to the disabled and elderly.  New Jersey\u2019s bond rating, essentially its creditworthiness, has been downgraded eight times by three separate agencies since Christie took office. Many now fear that if Atlantic City isn\u2019t bailed out, it could worsen all New Jersey\u2019s cities lots by making it more expensive to borrow money.  That has precipitated a state takeover of the city, with the likes of Detroit\u2019s former emergency manager Kevyn Orr, who shut off families\u2019 water in Detroit, and George Norcross, south Jersey\u2019s most notorious Democratic powerbroker, advising the governor.  \u201cSo, we\u2019re either going to do it, or Atlantic City is going to bankrupt,\u201d said Christie about his state senate-backed takeover bill. A separate takeover bill that would have bought the city more time and installed an advisory committee with local leaders, but the bill was defeated last week. \u201cI know there are many in the Republican caucuses who believe that might be the best option.\u201d And despite that many attribute flagging revenue in AC to fierce casino competition in neighboring states, a referendum this year allows voters to decide whether to put more casinos in North Jersey, and end Atlantic City\u2019s monopoly in the state.  \u201cWe\u2019re in trouble. We\u2019re a community in deep trouble,\u201d said 28-year-old Alex Stein, a Sanders supporter. \u201cWe\u2019re on life support. We\u2019re staring down the barrel of a state takeover \u2026 I\u2019m watching a lot of businesses close down around the area. We\u2019ve had five, six casinos close, heroin\u2019s become a huge problem.\u201d  Still, he said, Sanders\u2019 goal does not seem out of reach. \u201cThis is far better odds than I\u2019m used to.\u201d   Democratic delegates",
