  "body": "Andrew Davies\u2019s next historical novel adaptation for the BBC will be Victor Hugo\u2019s Les Mis\u00e9rables \u2013 but nothing like the \u201cshoddy farrago\u201d of the musical. The adapter of Pride and Prejudice, Middlemarch and most recently War & Peace gave his frank opinion of the stage and film musical to an audience at the second day of the Hay Festival. His version of Hugo\u2019s epic novel will a straight adaptation. \u201cNobody sings. Well they might sing the odd song but they don\u2019t yell great things like they do in the musical.\u201d     Andrew Davies in 2007, winning the Bafta Cymru Special Award for outstanding contribution to film and television. Photograph: Huw John/Rex    Davies was asked whether it was too close to the Tom Hooper-directed movie in 2012, an adaptation of the Boublil and Schonberg musical. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a few years and I have a dreadful memory of the musical and for people who think that\u2019s all there is, I thought it\u2019s important that people realise there is a lot more to Les Mis\u00e9rables than that sort of shoddy farrago. The book needs a bit of a champion.\u201d Davies, now 79, was in Hay to speak about the hugely successful War & Peace which starred Paul Dano, Lily James and James Norton. He was asked to adapt Tolstoy\u2019s novel by BBC Wales, even though he had never previously read it. \u201cI had been waiting until I was old and then I realised I had been old for some years so it was a good little nudge.\u201d Davies said he read it and was immediately excited by Andrei, later played by Norton, and by Pierre (Dano). \u201cHe\u2019s like a blundering idiot but he\u2019s got a lot of heart.\u201d Davies said he was pleased with how it turned out, although if he could do it again he would have made it longer than the six one-hour episodes. \u201cWe didn\u2019t realise quite how it would spread, in retrospect I think maybe I was wrong, it should have been seven or maybe eight.\u201d",
