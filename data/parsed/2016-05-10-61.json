  "body": "Eddie Jones is ready to push forward with plans to call up the Ospreys flanker Sam Underhill in the \u201cnext few months\u201d, despite potential disquiet from Premiership clubs.   Related: Wales tour squad puts Warren Gatland on collision course with French clubs    Underhill this month ruled out playing for Wales on residency grounds in the future, insisting that he wanted to play for England at senior level after captaining the under-18s. Jones is believed to be keen to involve the 19-year-old in the autumn Tests this year and perhaps even the summer tour of Australia as the head coach seeks a long-term solution to England\u2019s issues at openside. However, the stumbling block is the Rugby Football Union\u2019s policy of picking players based in England, a frustration for many during the World Cup with the Toulon flanker Steffon Armitage left out of the squad by Stuart Lancaster. The RFU can call up players \u2013 based outside of England \u2013 in \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d and Jones is hoping the fact that Underhill is studying economics at university in Cardiff, while playing for Ospreys, fulfils that criteria. \u201cHe\u2019s [Underhill] been playing very well for the Ospreys,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got the situation that he\u2019s playing outside of England and we have to sort that situation. I think we\u2019re coming to a resolution and there\u2019s no doubt he\u2019ll be selected in the England squad in the next six months.\u201d Armitage could well be back in Jones\u2019s thoughts if speculation of Wasps\u2019 interest in him is true. \u201cIf he comes back and manages to get in the Wasps side, which is going to be difficult to do, if he gets fit and wants to play for England, then we\u2019ll consider him,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHe\u2019s certainly a talented player.\u201d Jones believes the summer tour will give him a better understanding of where England are in world rugby as he looks to his ultimate goal of taking his side to No1 in the rankings. Asked if he would consider his tenure a failure if he did not achieve that, Jones replied: \u201cOh 100%. The reason the RFU appointed me is to change the England national team. And the resources and the number of players we have here, demands that England should be No1 in the world. There\u2019s no reason we shouldn\u2019t be No1 in the world and that\u2019s what we\u2019re working towards. It\u2019s all set up for England to do well in Japan [at World Cup 2019]. \u201cIt would be great for us to be on the second of November in 2019 at the Yokohama Stadium in the World Cup final, and that\u2019s where we\u2019re aiming to be.\u201d   Related: Maro Itoje: \u2018Disappointments sharpen the desire \u2013 Saracens want to go all the way this year\u2019    Jones also picked out the Worcester-bound centre Ben Te\u2019o as a player who could feature for England, backing the rugby league convert to succeed where Sam Burgess failed and become a long-term success after crossing codes. \u201cBen Te\u2019o\u2019s definitely a possibility,\u201d Jones said. \u201cYou speak to people in Australia and they talk of him as a demi-god, so those sorts of players if they have the right attitude can come across to rugby and have an immediate impact. And he\u2019s one of those guys that could do that. \u201cI think Sam was in a difficult situation where he was playing two positions. If Sam came across to union again and he was put in the situation where he specialised in one position, I\u2019m sure the outcome would be very different.\u201d Jones is also keen Jonny Wilkinson continues his coaching role with England. \u201cI\u2019ve had a couple of chats to Jonny. He is very keen to continue. He likes to work behind the scenes. He is the most humble guy in the world. The effect he\u2019s had on Owen [Farrell] and George [Ford] had been significant. With Henry Slade coming into the squad, there\u2019ll be another guy to work with.\u201d",
