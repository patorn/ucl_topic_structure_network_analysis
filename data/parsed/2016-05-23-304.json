I\u2019m a mayor for all of the city,\u201d says Marvin Rees. \u201cBut my story of growing up here as a mixed-race kid does matter. There is something special about that.\u201d Earlier this month, Rees defeated the incumbent mayor of his home city of Bristol with a final vote-share of 63%. In London, Sadiq Khan\u2019s win was being held up as a huge moment for Britain\u2019s Muslim population, and welcome proof that divisive, borderline-hateful campaigning is often more likely to backfire than succeed \u2013 but 120 miles up the M4, an equally dazzling story was playing out. Rees, after all, had become not just the local elections\u2019 other big Labour story, but also the UK\u2019s first directly elected black mayor. Moreover, in a city with a history intertwined with slavery and the black community\u2019s fight for rights and recognition, his arrival in power was deeply symbolic. \u201cFifty years ago, my dad arrived here from Jamaica to signs saying: \u2018No Irish, no blacks, no dogs\u2019,\u201d Rees tells me. \u201cAt around the same time, we had the Bristol bus boycott because they wouldn\u2019t employ black and Asian people. And now they\u2019ve elected a mixed-race guy to be mayor. That says something about the journey Bristol has been on.\u201d He checks himself, wondering aloud whether to carry on in this vein, and referring to what tends to happen to his quotes in quickfire news stories. There\u2019s a pause. \u201cI\u2019ll be open, \u2019cos this is a longer piece, isn\u2019t it?\u201d he says, eventually. \u201cI grew up in Bristol, and I would walk to school and have guys drive past me calling me a nigger. This was not unusual; this was normal. Normal. But it was strange, because, for me, there was a strange cocktail of race and class.\u201d His mum and extended family, after all, were white, and at primary school he was the only black kid in his class. \u201cSome of the closest people to us were poor, white kids. They were our natural cohort. My primary carers were white, and from a really well-known, old Bristol family. My great grandad was one of Bristol\u2019s first taxi drivers.\u201d When there were riots in the St Pauls area of the city in 1980, \u201ca black kid said to me: \u2018Marv \u2013 whose side are you going to be on in a war between black and white?\u2019 I couldn\u2019t answer. I didn\u2019t know how to.\u201d His complex background, Rees says, puts him in a good position to navigate tensions in the city that still linger. \u201cI got to a point where I thought, \u2018You know what? If the world can\u2019t cope with my identity, it\u2019s not me that\u2019s the problem,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m here and I\u2019m present. It\u2019s the categories that are a problem, and the way they box us in. That\u2019s where I stand now. I talk to mixed-race kids, and I think there\u2019s a really rich seam there to be mined, about identity, Britishness, belonging and not belonging, and how we make peace after historical injustices.\u201d How would he characterise what he has had to contend with? \u201cOh, where do I fit? And do I fit?\u201d And how does he feel now? \u201cWhen I was growing up, I probably thought it would have been really nice to have just slotted into a box. We all want that, don\u2019t we? \u2018It would be really nice to get rid of this complexity that I don\u2019t have words for, and not be a problem for anyone.\u2019 But now, no: I think there\u2019s something really rich in it.\u201d Rees is a 44-year-old father of three who lives on the southern edge of central Bristol. He has a fascinating backstory. Before he went to Swansea University, he came close to signing up as an officer in the Royal Marines (\u201cThey kept on telling me: \u2018You\u2019ll be the first British-born black Royal Marine officer\u2019\u201d), before a minor eye defect ruled him out. After graduation, he spent time in the US working for campaigning and community-organising groups \u2013 including Sojourners, a famous church-based organisation rooted in Washington DC and largely focused on inner-city poverty. This experience clearly shaped how he does his politics: rather than use the dried-up vocabulary of many UK politicians (\u201chard-working families\u201d and all that), he tends to talk in incisive, inspirational terms that link specific issues to great causes, in the manner of someone running for office in the US.     Rees at the St Mark\u2019s community cafe in Easton, Bristol. Photograph: Adrian Sherratt for the Guardian    Rees joined the Labour party in 2004, having spent time with the campaign group Operation Black Vote, one of whose founders presented him with a simple argument: \u201c\u2018You\u2019ve got a great analysis of why the world is rubbish. But what are you going to do about it?\u2019 The challenge was: join a party, get yourself elected and take up a position of influence.\u201d When Bristol was the only English city to vote for a mayoral system in the referendums of 2012, he stood as the Labour candidate for mayor and lost \u2013 to George Ferguson, an independent, who spent four years as a vivid figurehead for the city and an unquestionably creative politician, but was criticised for doing too little about Bristol\u2019s rising problems with housing and inequality. This year, by contrast, Rees\u2019s win was portrayed as a loud shout from the city\u2019s more neglected neighbourhoods, and a sign that Bristolians had belatedly accepted the mayoralty\u2019s importance: turnout rocketed from 24% to 45%, and, whereas Ferguson\u2019s win had been based on 31,000 first-preference votes, Rees got 56,000.   Related: Bristol campaigners to disrupt auction of council homes    He is taking office just as Bristol faces testing circumstances. Two years ago, the Sunday Times hailed it as Britain\u2019s best city to live in, praising its \u201cgreat shopping, great scenery and great social scene\u201d. Bristol remains a byword for admirable social diversity and vibrant community politics, based on a shared idea of defying convention and doing it yourself (as seen in everything from food recycling co-ops to self-built community centres). Last year, it was Europe\u2019s official green capital. But as word of the city\u2019s wonders has spread, it has also thrown its problems into sharp relief. As a 40-minute walk around its central neighbourhoods \u2013 from, say, opulent Clifton to down-at-heel Lawrence Hill \u2013 proves, it is a city characterised by glaring inequality, which seems in many ways to be getting worse. \u201cWe have a story to tell,\u201d says Rees. \u201cAnd it\u2019s a fantastic story; it\u2019s a true story. But the integrity of us telling that story is undermined by the fact that 25% of our kids are in poverty, inequality is increasing and the city is increasingly unaffordable. That\u2019s no way to run the place. I think it\u2019s a challenge for all of us \u2013 for our moral integrity and our future economic strength. At the moment, we haven\u2019t cracked it. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s easy. But the first thing you have to do is recognise it and not pretend it\u2019s not an issue.\u201d As in other rapidly changing cities, gentrification is a charged issue, with many long-term residents feeling pushed out. The basic story is simple: people (and companies) fleeing London contribute to double-digit house-price inflation, rents soar and the character of renowned areas of the city \u2013 particularly St Paul\u2019s, the byword for Bristol\u2019s black community where Rees spent some of his childhood \u2013 is said to be under real threat. Rees is all too aware of the issue: his own sister, he says, recently decided to move back to Bristol from London, but discovered it was prohibitively expensive. \u201cWhen I was in the US in the 90s, in Washington \u2013 that was when I first came into contact with this idea of gentrification,\u201d he says. \u201cColumbia Heights, the neighbourhood where I was living, was being gentrified. And then I came back to Bristol, and I had a sense that this stuff was bubbling away. In the last year, I\u2019ve heard people here start to use the word a lot. \u201cIt breaks down communities, it creates instability. There\u2019s a tangible sense of resentment. And it\u2019s not the fault of individual people. Some people have been very sensitive to being at the forefront of that gentrification. But it\u2019s about a system. Because of the way housing markets work, everyone\u2019s being pushed around. It\u2019s poor people and middle-income people \u2013 and now even people who earn good money \u2013 who can\u2019t afford to live in a place.\u201d     Hitting the streets in Bristol. Photograph: Adrian Sherratt for the Guardian    Rees is about to appoint a dedicated \u201clead\u201d on housing, who will try to get to grips with all this. As well as pledging to protect children\u2019s centres, increase school places and concentrate on apprenticeships, his campaign promised a drive to build 2,000 new homes a year by 2020, including 800 that would be \u201caffordable\u201d \u2013 with, he assures me, a particular emphasis on rented social housing. If that seems modest, he says he has complex planning issues to deal with, as well as edicts from central government \u2013 such as a push to sell off publicly owned land. But he talks about the challenges with an energetic sense of purpose \u2013 particularly when it comes to the paltry share of new housing developments given over to \u201caffordable\u201d homes. The city council has an official target of up to 40% \u2013 but, as was recently revealed by the super-vigilant city news outlet the Bristol Cable, many projects have delivered nothing at all. \u201cI went to meet one developer, and I asked them: \u2018Who\u2019s going to live here?\u2019\u201d Rees recalls. \u201cAnd they came up with a beautiful description that sounded like something from an estate agent: \u2018Forward-looking people, after something different.\u2019 I said, \u2018No \u2013 who\u2019s going to live here?\u2019 And a colleague of mine said: \u2018Are there any affordable homes?\u2019 They said, \u2018No.\u2019 They just kept on saying they\u2019d come up with a community building for local people. But who\u2019s going to live in a place where you can do salsa or pilates for \u00a320 an hour? We need homes for people, not more community venues. That\u2019s Lazarus economics, whereby rich people sit round a table and a few crumbs fall off.           Flatpack democracy: the new English political revolt    \u201cI said to them, \u2018If you build a development with no affordable housing, it has an impact. It\u2019s not a neutral act. It\u2019s actually harmful. And if I become mayor, I\u2019ll end up spending money on the social consequences of you doing a development that compounds our inequalities. Inequality costs money, right? So what you\u2019re doing is asking me to support something I think will hurt Bristol.\u2019 It is not an option to come here and expect to do development without making sure there are houses for real people.\u201d While Jeremy Corbyn was hardly in the foreground of Khan\u2019s London campaign \u2013 and Khan followed his win by further distancing himself from the Labour leader \u2013 he seem to have a much more harmonious relationship with Rees. Corbyn visited Bristol a few times during the mayoral campaign and returned hours after Rees\u2019s triumph, praising him as someone with \u201ca fantastic personality [with] this ability to unite the whole city to face the problems you all have\u201d. Rees voted for Andy Burnham in last year\u2019s leadership election, but gives Corbyn his due. \u201cJeremy has been fantastically supportive to me, and I really appreciate that. I think he understood my story and what it could potentially represent.\u201d He then pauses. \u201cBut my thing was, this was a Bristol election, and some of the people who mobilised around me were people who have known me since I was a kid. They weren\u2019t thinking about that conversation that happens in the Westminster bubble.\u201d Signifiers for the troubling aspects of Bristol\u2019s past are not hard to find: one thinks, for example, of Edward Colston, the 17th- and 18th-century slave trader and philanthropist whose statue stands in the city centre, and whose name adorns the Colston Hall, one of the city\u2019s key arts venues. At a time when Oxford University students have demanded the removal of the now-infamous statue of Cecil Rhodes, I suggest, such features of the cityscape are more highly charged than ever. Rees won\u2019t be drawn on the Colston statue (\u201ca landmine question,\u201d he says), so I try another tack. Is further addressing the slave era\u2019s legacy on his agenda? \u201cIt\u2019s always on my agenda. But I think something has already been done.\u201d He cracks a smile. \u201cI got elected.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 23 May 2016. An earlier version described Marvin Rees as the UK\u2019s first black mayor; that has been amended to say he is the first directly elected black mayor.",
