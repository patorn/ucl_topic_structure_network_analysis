From a selfish point of view, it saved me from spending this summer trying to drum up excitement for a battle between Tony Lloyd and Ivan Lewis (if you have to Google them both, you\u2019ll see my point). But more importantly, it was a sign that finally Labour\u2019s big dogs were waking up to the opportunities offered by the new mayoralties, which will arguably have more power than anyone on Labour\u2019s front bench, including Jeremy Corbyn \u2014 particularly the Greater Manchester mayor, who will have jurisdiction over far more than Sadiq Khan by many measures, most crucially the \u00a35bn integrated health and social care budget. So, why is it that no women appear to want to enter the mayoral races? Chatting to a Greater Manchester MP the other week, I asked if any plausible women candidates had come forward. \u201cForget plausible: there haven\u2019t even been any mediocre women putting themselves forward,\u201d the MP said.   Related: Where are the women? The \u2018pale, male\u2019 council leaders driving the northern powerhouse    The new mayoralty is the most controversial condition of a series of devolution agreements brokered first between George Osborne and Greater Manchester and then a series of other \u201cmetro\u201d regions: the Sheffield and Liverpool city regions, the Tees Valley, the North East, the West Midlands and Greater Lincolnshire. Ever since he coined the northern powerhouse concept in 2014, the chancellor made clear he was only willing to devolve power to elected mayors, whom he has called \u201ca single point of accountability, who takes the decisions and carries the can\u201d. Negotiated behind closed doors, the first the general public generally heard about these not insignificant deals was when the local leaders posed for awkward pictures with Osborne to sign the document. I kept tabs on these uncomfortable photographs, playing a depressing game of \u201cspot the woman\u201d. Occasionally, there was one, but usually not. \u201cThe leaders in Greater Manchester were very embarrassed when I was on holiday for the photo,\u201d says Liberal Democrat Sue Derbyshire, who, until she lost her seat in the recent local elections, led Stockport council and was the only woman in charge of one of Greater Manchester\u2019s 10 councils. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly a problem they are aware of, but whether the Labour party in particular is doing enough to nurture young women coming through is another question.\u201d Derbyshire thinks that Labour\u2019s rooting in the traditionally male-dominated world of trade unions has led to a \u201cmacho\u201d culture that favours bruising election battles. \u201cIt creates a male-oriented way of doing things. Women often do things differently. For a start, men tend to think they ought to be leader, whereas women ask themselves: \u2018Would I do a good job?\u2019 That sort of self-questioning can make women sound unsure, which is unhelpful if they are coming up against men who sound absolutely sure they can do it.\u201d Ruling himself out a few months back, Sir Richard Leese, who has run Manchester city council for 20 years, wrote on his blog: \u201cI hope we see a range of potential candidates that reflect the wonderful diversity of our city, but having said that, a pen picture of my ideal candidate would probably be 20 years younger [than me] and a different gender.\u201d Interviewing Burnham at the People\u2019s History Museum in Manchester last week, I reminded him of Leese\u2019s comments. Wasn\u2019t it a bit depressing that Labour was basically looking at a battle between three middle-aged white guys? This, in the city of the Pankhurst family and \u201cRed Ellen\u201d Wilkinson, who led the Jarrow march. \u201cYeah, I think so,\u201d he agreed. \u201cAnd that goes back to a failure to bring through enough women candidates and councillors a generation ago. But Labour was doing something about it at that time, with all-women shortlists. It is changing, but it will still take time to see those changes feed all the way through. But we do need to make sure that more women are more involved at a higher level in Greater Manchester politics, without a doubt, and as mayor that\u2019s what I would do, and make sure there was that representation at the highest level, because there can\u2019t be any sense that it\u2019s a macho world or closed world in any way. This has to be a moment of change for our politics in Greater Manchester.\u201d Two weeks ago, the residents of London, Bristol and Salford all voted for new mayors. In each race, the victors \u2013 and the candidates from the main two parties \u2013 were men. Elsewhere in the country, notably Doncaster, Watford, Mansfield and North Tyneside, voters have chosen women as mayors in different election cycles. But so far, the confirmed candidates for the new \u201cmetro\u201d mayors, who will run big combined authority areas from May 2017, are all blokes. Luciana Berger, Labour MP for Liverpool Wavertree, is reportedly considering running for mayor of Liverpool city region, and Caroline Flint, MP for the Don Valley, is said to be interested in Sheffield, but neither are yet confirmed. It\u2019s not as if there aren\u2019t significant female Labour MPs with seats in Greater Manchester, although all are fairly new to their jobs. Lucy Powell, shadow education secretary and MP for Manchester Central, has ruled herself out. So has Lisa Nandy, MP for Wigan and shadow energy secretary. Kate Green, shadow minister for women and equalities, who represents Stretford and Urmston, doesn\u2019t fancy it. Same with the shadow pensions minister, Angela Rayner, of Ashton-under-Lyne. Talk of Hazel Blears coming out of retirement came to nowt. Although Manchester city council now has more female councillors than men for the first time in its history, nine out of 10 leaders in Greater Manchester\u2019s constituent councils are men. The lonely woman is Jean Stretton, who took over Oldham in January. She is the first Labour leader of a Greater Manchester council since Baroness Bev Hughes ran Trafford for two years in the 90s. \u201cI think it does matter that no women seem to want to be mayor,\u201d she said, while ruling herself out on the grounds that she has only just got her dream job. \u201cI suppose we still might get someone putting herself forward, but it\u2019s very late in the day [nominations for Labour in Greater Manchester close on 10 June]. I think that, while we do have some very good women MPs in Greater Manchester, they are mostly quite new to their seats and perhaps feel their futures lie in Westminster.\u201d In the 2015 general election, 191 women MPs were elected, 29% of all MPs and a record high. As of 2013, 32% of local authority councillors in England were women. Stretton is optimistic that change is afoot. \u201cWhen I first became a councillor in 2003, frequently the only other woman at a meeting would be taking the minutes. Now, my cabinet is fairly evenly split on gender. I\u2019ve actually been criticised in the local paper for relying on an \u2018old girls\u2019 network\u2019. Things are definitely changing for the better. It will just take time for those changes to filter up to the top.\u201d",
