  "body": "Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister I Gr-r- r \u2013 there go, my heart\u2019s abhorrence!Water your damned flower-pots, do!If hate killed men, Brother Lawrence,God\u2019s blood, would not mine kill you!What? your myrtle-bush wants trimming?Oh, that rose has prior claims \u2013Needs its leaden vase filled brimming?Hell dry you up with its flames! II At the meal we sit together;Salve tibi! I must hearWise talk of the kind of weather,Sort of season, time of year:Not a plenteous cork crop: scarcelyDare we hope oak-galls, I doubt;What\u2019s the Latin name for \u201cparsley\u201d?What\u2019s the Greek name for \u201cswine\u2019s snout\u201d? III Whew! We\u2019ll have our platter burnished,Laid with care on our own shelf!With a fire-new spoon we\u2019re furnished,And a goblet for ourself,Rinsed like something sacrificialEre \u2019tis fit to touch our chaps \u2013Marked with L. for our initial!(He-he! There his lily snaps!) IV Saint, forsooth! While brown DoloresSquats outside the Convent bankWith Sanchicha, telling stories,Steeping tresses in the tank,Blue-black, lustrous, thick like horsehairs,\u2013 Can\u2019t I see his dead eye glow,Bright as \u2019twere a Barbary corsair\u2019s?(That is, if he\u2019d let it show!) V When he finishes refection,Knife and fork he never laysCross-wise, to my recollection,As do I, in Jesu\u2019s praise.I the Trinity illustrate,Drinking watered orange pulp \u2013In three sips the Arian frustrate;While he drains his at one gulp! VI Oh, those melons! if he\u2019s ableWe\u2019re to have a feast; so nice!One goes to the Abbot\u2019s table,All of us get each a slice.How go on your flowers? None double?Not one fruit-sort can you spy?Strange! \u2013 And I, too, at such trouble,Keep them close-nipped on the sly! VII There\u2019s a great text in Galatians,Once you trip on it, entailsTwenty-nine distinct damnations,One sure, if another fails;If I trip him just a-dying,Sure of heaven as sure can be,Spin him round and send him flyingOff to hell, a Manichee? VIII Or, my scrofulous French novelOn grey paper with blunt type!Simply glance at it, you grovelHand and foot in Belial\u2019s gripe;If I double down its pagesAt the woeful sixteenth print,When he gathers his greengages,Ope a sieve and slip it in\u2019t? IX Or, there\u2019s Satan! \u2013 one might venturePledge one\u2019s soul to him, yet leaveSuch a flaw in the indentureAs he\u2019d miss till, past retrieve,Blasted lay that rose-acaciaWe\u2019re so proud of! Hy, Zy, Hine ...\u2019St, there\u2019s Vespers! Plena grati\u00e2Ave, Virgo! Gr-r- r \u2013 you swine!       Maybe because the trees are finally in leaf and it\u2019s almost stopped raining, I felt in the mood for a good hate-poem this week. Soliloquy of the Spanish Cloister (Dramatic Lyrics, 1842) is one of Robert Browning\u2019s brightest, punchiest, growliest anticlerical outbursts. Browning is writing in persona, of course, but not, I think, impersonally. In the epilogue to a later collection, Dramatis Personae, the final speaker argues powerfully for the interconnection of \u201cheaven\u2019s high\u201d with \u201cearth\u2019s low\u201d. In the dramatic monologue, Fra Lippo Lippi, the sympathetically portrayed Florentine painter declares: \u201cThis world\u2019s no blot for us / Nor blank; it means intensely, and means good ... \u201d There\u2019s no space for these ideals to flower in the Soliloquy.   Related: Robert Browning's new poem - review: from the archive, 14 May 1873    Through its comically enraged narrator, it focuses on iconic objects \u2013 Brother Lawrence\u2019s plants and his precious eating utensils, the cloister itself (probably Dominican \u2013 see the link to the footnoted edition below) and its trivialising, life-denying rituals. Browning might want to invoke an immanent, flesh-friendly, life-loving God \u2013 especially in the depiction of Dolores and Sanchicha \u2013 but, in the event, neither of his two male characters is capable of such representation. Each in his own way contributes only to a debased version of religion. Browning\u2019s 8-line, trochaic tetrameter stanza ironically echoes the formal four-square pieties of the hymnal. It seems to trudge and mutter as it goes, with a fine variety of sometimes polysyllabic rhymes adding a humour that\u2019s nonetheless quite lacking in lightness of heart. The rhythm sometimes punches like a fist: in stanza I some well-planned placement of stress heightens the fury: \u201cIf hate killed men ... hell dry you up.\u201d There\u2019s another echo, that of the ottava rima stanza used by Barry Cornwall rather than Byron. In fact, Cornwall\u2019s poem, Gyges (A Sicilian Story, 1820) has an instance of the same venture/indenture rhyme Browning employs in his mock-Faustian last stanza: \u201cI\u2019ve but small wit, and therefore will not venture / On wit; and fighting \u2013 \u2019tis a noisy game / By this too I\u2019m bound down by my indenture / (At least I swear I am, and that\u2019s the same).\u201d The location remains constant throughout the poem: we\u2019re outdoors (the refectory scene is only imagined) and, from the relative shelter of the cloister, the speaker is watching Brother Lawrence make his gardening rounds. His running commentary is interwoven with snippets of remembered commentary from Lawrence (always italicised) and brief scenes of everyday monastic life. The last three stanzas, or scenes, are given over to increasingly ludicrous revenge fantasies. Myrtle, roses and lilies have sacred associations in Milton\u2019s Paradise Lost, Book 4, but Brother Lawrence is clearly not diluting his horticultural interests with spirituality. Aestheticism seems to be Browning\u2019s new addition to the deadly sins. It\u2019s a route to damnation omitted from Paul\u2019s Epistle to the Galatians, where the list, although quite extensive, falls somewhat short of 29. Lustful, sensual and greedy, Lawrence may be mercenary, too. The cork oak (quercus suber) could be a source of income for the monastery, the cork being harvested for wine-stoppers. If the potential cork crop disappoints, the galls, used in ink and dye manufacture, might be hoped to provide an alternative source of profit. Named ironically for Saint Lawrence, the martyred deacon who oversaw the city treasury and gave generously to the poor, this monk seems to embody the luxuria of the simple materialist. He\u2019s no scholar (he doesn\u2019t know the Latin for parsley) and no saint. All the same, he hardly merits the hellfire wished on him. His detractor, who might at first seem bracingly candid, is the real sinner \u2013 an envy-ridden hypocrite whose extreme lack of self-awareness is both funny and disturbing. There has been much scholarly debate on the interpretation of \u201cHy zy hine\u201d. Theories about its source range from imitation bell sounds to the French satirical \u201cMass in Praise of the Ass\u201d. Could it be a cod-Greek charm for turning your enemy into a pig? Or a borrowing from the West Country dialect spoken by Browning\u2019s hated paternal grandfather? I think I\u2019d discount the bells, but the other ideas all have their attractions and limitations. For some commentators, the word reversal in the ensuing prayer to the Virgin implies the speaker\u2019s demonic possession. The glorious near-intelligibility of incoherence shouldn\u2019t be ruled out. Ultimately, the richness of the poem is in the range and registers of a voice increasingly unbridled by pious pretension and human decency alike. \u201cCoarse, vulgar, scurrilous, without any claim to rank as poetry,\u201d was the opinion of a Jesuit critic in The Irish Monthly in March 1913. For today\u2019s readers, who are inclined to be more lenient in poetics and morals, the shock of the Soliloquy still registers. Footnotes are available here.",
