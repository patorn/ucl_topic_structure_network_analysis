  "body": "Woody Allen was the first one in and the first one out at Wednesday\u2019s kick-off dinner for the 2016 Cannes film festival, held immediately following the opening night screening of the film-maker\u2019s 47th movie, Caf\u00e9 Society. A romantic comedy set in the mid-1930s, Caf\u00e9 Society features a bevy of glamorous party scenes that would feel right at home in a Baz Luhrmann production. But on the first night of the 69th edition of the festival, the famously reclusive director looked like he wanted to be anywhere else than at the big event.   Related: Cannes 2016 day one: Woody Allen, Kristen Stewart and Justin Timberlake \u2013 in pictures    His behaviour was understandable: earlier that day, Cannes was rocked by a piece in the Hollywood Reporter by Ronan Farrow, Allen\u2019s estranged son, restating his support for his stepsister, Dylan, who in the past claimed Allen sexually assaulted her as a child. Upon entering the banquet hall atop the Palais des Festivals, Allen and his wife Soon-Yi Previn, beelined to their table in the centre of the cavernous room, where they would later be joined by Cafe Society stars Corey Stoll and Jesse Eisenberg. (Stoll worked the room; Eisenberg did not.)     Woody Allen and Soon-Yi Previn arrive at the dinner.

They maintained gracious smiles as a pack of Russian-sounding women sporting very tight faces, hounded the famous duo with lavish praise.  Watts later joined Julianne Moore, Susan Sarandon, Eva Longoria and Caf\u00e9 Society lead Kristen Stewart (the most casually dressed of the evening, wearing a white T-shirt, skirt and flats), at a power women\u2019s table next to Allen\u2019s, where Chastain found herself sitting directly across from Previn.      Naomi Watts mingled with fans at the dinner Photograph: Gisela Schober/Getty Images     Related: Caf\u00e9 Society review \u2013 Woody Allen's amiable, if insubstantial, tribute to golden-age Hollywood    The pair chatted during the first half of the night, with Chastain probably juicing Allen\u2019s wife for details on the film-maker\u2019s upcoming project \u2013 a smart move. Allen and Previn darted out before the veal dish was served, accompanied by Stoll, who appeared to be acting as their minder. With Previn gone, Chastain shifted her attention to L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Nemes, the Hungarian film-maker who claimed last year\u2019s Grand Prix prize for his debut feature, Son of Saul, which later went on to net the Oscar for best foreign language film. Like many in attendance, Chastain doesn\u2019t have a film playing at the festival, nor is she serving on one of the juries. She told the Guardian she\u2019s in Cannes simply in support of the event, which she credits for launching her career in 2011 by screening her two breakthrough features, The Tree of Life and Take Shelter. \u201cI owe the festival everything,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a special place.\u201d  Nemes had a sound reason for dining: he\u2019s a member of this year\u2019s jury that will be deciding on the eventual Palme d\u2019Or winner. The same goes for Kirsten Dunst, who sat across from him at a table with fellow juror, George Miller.     Kirsten Dunst is happy to be a juror Photograph: Buckner/Variety/REX/Shutterstock    For Dunst, a Cannes best actress winner in 2011 for her performance in Lars von Trier\u2019s Melancholia, this marks her first time back at the festival since 2012\u2019s On the Road, which screened in competition. She told the Guardian she\u2019s more relaxed than ever this time around, elated by the prospect of just watching movies and not having to do days-worth of press. Along with Nemes, she was one of the last to leave.",
