  "body": "It took about two and a half minutes to run the Chester Vase here on Thursday, but the better part of an hour for the stewards to finish picking over the bones of a close and controversial race. The bare result shows that US Army Ranger, the 4-11 favourite, took the Classic trial to confirm his place in the field for next month\u2019s Derby, but the stewards also felt obliged to inquire into the running and riding of his stable companion Port Douglas, who was just a short-head away in second under Seamie Heffernan.   Related: Minding\u2019s 1,000 Guineas superiority prompts talk of gatecrashing Derby    Port Douglas was sent to the front after leaving the stalls, with Ryan Moore, on US Army Ranger, settled a couple of lengths behind. Heffernan was still in front on the home turn, but drifted to his right in the straight, allowing Moore to get up his inside. Heffernan used his whip twice and Port Douglas moved left for both strokes, but otherwise he gave the runner-up a hands-and-heels ride to the line. Port Douglas was still gaining at the line and would have been in front in another stride. Heffernan\u2019s ride on Port Douglas provoked a wave of criticism on social media, and as Aidan O\u2019Brien, the trainer of both horses, stepped up to receive his prize, an inquiry was announced both into the running and riding of the runner-up, and the possible use of \u201cteam tactics\u201d. The officials heard evidence from both O\u2019Brien and Heffernan, who said that he had taken a middle line in the straight \u201cto avoid getting his horse unbalanced by dragging him around the bend\u201d. Heffernan also told the inquiry that Port Douglas lugged left towards US Army Ranger when he used his whip, and as a result, he put down the stick and rode hands-and-heels to the line. Asked about his effort in the final 100 yards, he said that this was \u201chis usual style of riding and that, in his opinion, he had obtained the best possible placing\u201d. The stewards noted the explanations, and took no further action. Port Douglas was a Group Two winner as a juvenile and giving 4lb to the winner, who was unraced at two and making only the second start of his career. Both O\u2019Brien and Moore emphasised US Army Ranger\u2019s relative lack of experience afterwards, with Moore convinced that he will improve significantly for the run. \u201cHe travelled through the race like a very good horse and I wanted to teach him plenty today,\u201d Moore said. \u201cHe just wanted to hang left at the end and he didn\u2019t switch his leads and got a bit tired, but he\u2019ll come on plenty for it. \u201cHe\u2019s a beautiful mover with a good mind and a very well-balanced horse. The good ones move very well and he\u2019s one of those. \u201cI won that race on Treasure Beach when we beat [the subsequent King George winner] Nathaniel [by a head] and people thought it wasn\u2019t a very good race that day. These horses are still early days, we don\u2019t really know where the ceiling is yet so they\u2019ll have another race and we\u2019ll be a bit wiser then. \u201cI know the second was giving him 4lb, but he [Port Douglas] is a Group Two winner, he was fourth in the Racing Post Trophy and he\u2019s a hardened, fit horse that would probably give anything a test. It\u2019s quite hard for any horse on its second start to come out of a maiden and beat a horse of that ability, so these are all things that put it in perspective.\u201d When the bookmakers had finished adjusting their Derby prices, Midterm, the winner of the Sandown Classic Trial, had replaced US Army Ranger at the top of the market. Sir Michael Stoute\u2019s colt is top-priced at 7-2 with US Army Ranger available at 6-1 (from 4-1) with Paddy Power. Port Douglas, meanwhile, is now generally a 20-1 chance, having been available at 66-1 on Thursday morning. \u201cYou have to be very happy with them when they pull that far clear of the rest [seven lengths],\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cWhen you look at the trials every year, you don\u2019t know where the form is going to come out of. If someone told you coming into the race that they were going to pull seven lengths clear of the Sandown horses, around this place first time, you couldn\u2019t say I wouldn\u2019t take that.\u201d Hugo Palmer, the trainer of the 2,000 Guineas winner Galileo Gold, said on Thursday evening that his colt will miss the Derby after a genetic test carried out in Ireland suggested that his ideal trip will be a mile. Palmer wrote on his blog on the Betfair website that Galileo Gold will run instead in the Irish 2,000 Guineas at The Curragh later this month. The son of Paco Boy, a miler, had been quoted at around 10-1 by bookmakers for the Epsom Classic.",
