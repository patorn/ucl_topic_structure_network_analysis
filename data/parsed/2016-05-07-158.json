Yes, I know what he\u2019ll say, give or take, but we know what she\u2019s going to sing, don\u2019t we, plus thank God for a Corbyn reality check, with all those billionaires. The social justice line-up sounds incredible this year \u2013 pure luck our tipi is about five minutes from Left Field. Sorry, ours is full, but you might still get one \u2013 around \u00a32,000, but for that you get showers and decent toilets, plus proper security, worth every penny. And there\u2019s always this great atmosphere around the fire, loads of\u00a0debate \u2013 last year, we were up all night discussing the impact of neo-liberalism on entrenched inequalities with this amazing guerrilla gardener from Pricewaterhouse. It got quite heated, actually, after someone found out he sends his kids to private school. I\u00a0was like, I\u2019m saying nothing. Apparently John McDonnell\u2019s still a possible, which would be fantastic with the whole austerity theme, then I\u2019m booked for Owen Jones at Latitude \u2013 he can sign my copy of Chavs, plus they\u2019ve done this brilliant pre-festival reading list, so you arrive debate-ready. That\u2019s if there\u2019s time before Hay: I\u2019m not paying to see AC Grayling on Descartes unless I\u2019m totally up to speed with the whole mind-body dualism thing. Can you believe Yanis Varoufakis is already sold out? But we\u2019re in for the Gordon Brown Q&A. Sod\u2019s law it\u2019ll be back to\u00a0back with Slavoj \u017di\u017eek debating debt at How The Light Gets In \u2013 \u00a312, which isn\u2019t bad when you think he cost \u00a320 at Sidmouth, though that included a\u00a0buffet lunch and radical socialism.   Related: Modern tribes: the Elena Ferrante fan    Then we\u2019re doing Wilderness for the philosophy. There\u2019s a whole session asking if we\u2019re actually fictional characters, and the food, Raymond Blanc\u2019s 25-course tasting banquet \u2013 that\u2019s if it doesn\u2019t clash with Charlotte Church. We\u2019ve got a Royal Safari Tent in the boutique field, I know it\u2019s extravagant, but trust me, when you\u2019re trying to think, you need some decent lighting. I\u2019m just praying they\u2019ll keep the music down.",
