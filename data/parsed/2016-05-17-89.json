  "body": "Related: Thailand closes 'overcrowded' Koh Tachai island to tourists    The trouble for Koh Tachai was that its beaches were just a little too white, its coral reef too colourful, its marine life too dazzling. Now you can\u2019t go there, because Thai authorities have shut it to tourists \u2013 the latest and most drastic response to a booming and increasingly itinerant global population. The island in the Andaman sea is part of the Similan national park and is popular with snorkel- and scuba-toting daytrippers from the mainland hubs of Phuket and Khao Lak. But a quick scan of its TripAdvisor page suggests it has been consumed by a slick of Hawaiian Tropic. \u201cToo many divers are attracted to this site,\u201d Willow E from Staffordshire wrote on the site in February. \u201cGenerally there are 8-10 boats here on most sites with circa 20 divers a boat ... the mantas are being driven away by the hoards [sic] of divers now. Wake up national park admin \u2026 you are losing the attraction by allowing too many divers.\u201d And wake up they did. Thailand\u2019s national parks office has taken action to allow the island to recover \u201cwithout being disturbed by tourism activities before the damage is beyond repair,\u201d the authority told the Bangkok Post.

Photograph: Robert Harding World Imagery/Alamy    Almost 30 million people visited Thailand last year \u2013 a new record, but a drop in the crowded global ocean. According to the UN World Tourism Organisation, there were 1.2 billion international arrivals (foreign trips of at least one night) in 2015. That\u2019s 50 million more tourists than there were in 2014. But our islands, cathedrals and museums aren\u2019t getting any bigger, and the will to control crowds competes with the often irresistible lure of tourist dollars, not least when whole economies rely on them. Closures are rare \u2013 last October, the guardians of Palawan, an island in the Philippines, threatened to shut several diving sites \u2013 but caps are becoming common. Only 1.5 million people will be allowed into the Cinque Terre UN world heritage area this year, a million fewer than visited the coastal Italian destination in 2015. The mayor of Barcelona has threatened to put a cap on the entire city, while Iceland is considering a national limit. Peru will soon control numbers at its swamped Machu Picchu site. \u201cWe\u2019ve all been to places where traffic is such that it\u2019s obviously damaging,\u201d says Rachel O\u2019Reilly at Kuoni, a premium British tour operator, which is increasingly steering clear of \u201choneypot\u201d sites. \u201cDestinations need to take a long-term view on how to keep their assets intact and fresh.\u201d Last Christmas, Disneyland in California had to shut its gates when the theme park reached its safe capacity. When a destination that is effectively a crowd-management system with some rollercoasters on the side has to shut, you know we\u2019re getting close to our tourism limits.",
