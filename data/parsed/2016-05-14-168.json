The pictures show his reaction to the last over he bowled in the World Twenty20 final last month. The West Indies had just six balls to score 19 runs, a big ask. Even in the fast and furious world of Twenty20, the World Cup was there for England\u2019s taking. Stokes volunteered to bowl the final over, as he had done successfully in previous matches. The first ball went for six. As did the second. Then the third. And the fourth. And then it was all over. After the second six, hit by the inexperienced Carlos Brathwaite, Stokes stood hand on hips, angry and angular, defiant as a Roman centurion. But by the next ball he was broken, elbows on knees, head in hands, despairing. The West Indies were only a run away from the title. After the last ball, all we see is his perspiring arms cradling the back of his head. Stokes is oblivious to the comforting arm of his team-mate Joe Root around his shoulder. It is as powerful a series of images about the intensity of elite sport, and the pain of losing, as you\u2019re likely to see.     After being hit for four sixes in the World Twenty20. Photograph: Gareth Copley/Getty Images    A month on, I meet Stokes at the swanky Woburn golf club near Milton Keynes. He has been competing with fellow England cricketers Root and Stuart Broad to see who can hit the golf ball farthest. Of course, Stokes, England\u2019s very own Incredible Hulk, wins. He looks confident, strong, bullish. But he knows it\u2019s not long before he will be asked about those four balls that lost England the World Cup. And sure enough, he is. After the golf, he and Root sit down with a handful of sports journalists for a round-table chat. \u201cWhat are your thoughts on the last over?\u201d he is asked. Root instantly answers on his behalf, talking about the shared pain of team-mates and how his first reaction was to put his arm around Stokes. \u201cIt was a bit awkward, because you don\u2019t know how he\u2019s going to react when you get there.\u201d Everybody laughs, and the tension is punctured. Stokes is a fiery cricketer. Two years ago, he broke his wrist when he punched a changing room locker after getting out without scoring. But most of all he is a thrilling cricketer \u2013 the type who empties bars when he walks out to bat. He is an all-rounder with a superhuman capacity to hit sixes. He is often likened to Ian Botham and Andrew Flintoff, two former all-rounders who could also batter a ball to hell and back. Just three months before the World Cup, Stokes scored 258 in a Test match against South Africa. Not only was it a huge score (the highest by an England batsman playing at number six, the traditional all-rounder position), it was made in an outlandish manner: the second-fastest double century in Test history (163 balls), and the fastest 250 in history, with more sixes in one innings (11) than any other England batsman. It was brutal, glorious, breathtaking. Not surprisingly, this is what Stokes would rather be remembered for. Stokes is still only 24, though he seems older. At 6ft and 12 stone, he is not a literal heavyweight in the way Botham and Flintoff were at their peak, but he is famously tough. There is a story, possibly apocryphal, that during the Ashes series in Australia in 2013/14, when Stokes made his Test debut, Australian wicketkeeper Brad Haddin sledged him (tried to make him lose focus by insulting him on the field). The England bowler Graeme Swann took Haddin aside and told him he shouldn\u2019t do that. \u201cWhy not?\u201d Haddin asked. \u201cBecause he will fucking kill you.\u201d    I've got that competitiveness, which sometimes turns into frustration and an inside buildup of anger    Stokes speaks in a gruff, northern monotone, even though he was born in New Zealand and lived there until he was 12. His father, Gerard Stokes, was a successful rugby league player turned coach. His mother Deborah, who worked as a counsellor for victims of violent crime, loved her cricket and introduced him to the game. As a boy, Stokes played both sports to a high level. He says the men in his family \u2013 father, brother, uncle, himself \u2013 are ridiculously competitive. Go into a room full of people, he says, and you\u2019d instantly be able to spot a Stokes. \u201cThe sense of humour is the same. We take the mickey out of each other. My dad\u2019s a bit more moody, and my brother\u2019s a bit of a gorm when he\u2019s around people he doesn\u2019t know. He grunts a lot. That competitiveness, which sometimes turns into frustration and an inside buildup of anger, is what my old man has and what I\u2019ve obviously got. I\u2019ve got a lot of traits from my dad\u2019s side.\u201d Gerard was renowned for his steel, even in the macho world of rugby league. He used to tell Ben that he had lost a finger to a crocodile. He eventually told his son the truth \u2013 and that was no less dramatic. \u201cHe kept dislocating the same finger,\u201d Stokes says, \u201cso he went to the doctor, who told him it needed surgery. But he couldn\u2019t afford not to play \u2013 he needed to pay the bills \u2013 so he just got it cut off.\u201d Eleven days after Stokes was born, his father broke his neck on the rugby pitch and that was the end of his playing career. Stokes says he has few memories of his early life in New Zealand: just playing rugby and cricket, family holidays and being easily distracted at school. He couldn\u2019t concentrate in class for the life of him. Everything was a countdown to lunch or home time, when he could play sport. Stokes was one of the few white boys playing rugby league with and against M\u0101ori players. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Right, let\u2019s smash the white kid!\u2019 They were so much bigger than us.\u201d He laughs.     \u2018Normally I\u2019m never still, always walking around, giddy.\u2019 Photograph: Fred MacGregor for the Guardian    The family moved to Cumbria when his father was appointed head coach of Workington rugby league club. Stokes continued playing rugby league, representing England at schoolboy level. Then, one day, he just lost interest mid-game. \u201cI was playing full-back and I wasn\u2019t really that bothered about people getting past me and scoring. I thought, \u2018I don\u2019t really want to be playing this any more.\u2019 I told my dad, and he told me to ring my coach straight away. And I told him, \u2018Don\u2019t pick me.\u2019\u201d And that was it as far as rugby went; he never played again. It\u2019s a telling story. Stokes was, and remains, strong-willed and uncompromising, sometimes impetuous. As a precocious 15-year-old, he played cricket for Cockermouth, winning the North Lancashire & Cumbria Cricket League in 2006. He was desperate to succeed and took it badly when he didn\u2019t. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t do well, I\u2019d beat myself up. Especially when I was younger. I\u2019d just get angry.\u201d Was he a bad loser? \u201cI\u2019m not going to hate anybody who beats me. But. I. Just. Don\u2019t. Like. Losing.\u201d He says it with a conviction that brooks no dissent. At 18, Stokes told his father he wanted to become a professional cricketer with Durham. Fine, Gerard said, but if you do, do it properly. \u201cI was enjoying myself. I was 18 and out with all my friends, socialising a lot. But he said, you\u2019ve got to take it a lot more seriously. He\u2019d get me in the gym every day at 9am. My dad\u2019s a fitness freak himself. He\u2019s in there every morning. He\u2019s probably fitter than me.\u201d Stokes made his debut for Durham\u2019s one-day first team at 17. By the age of 20, he was playing one-day cricket for England. But then ill-discipline got the better of him. In 2013, he was sent home from Australia after ignoring a curfew and going out drinking. Could he imagine himself doing a similar thing again? \u201cNo,\u201d he says instantly. Because he doesn\u2019t want to? \u201cNo, I\u2019d love to. But I\u2019m more professional than I was back then.\u201d He was on the verge of destroying his career before it had barely started. \u201cThat was a time I could have blown it. I could have come back from that and not changed.\u201d    All the emotions of that tour got the better of me\u2026 I realised I\u2019d probably broken my wrist when I went out to field    Stokes returned home, determined not to let himself down again. There was another factor in his new sense of responsibility. At the age of 21, he became a father. He now has two children \u2013 three-year-old Layton and baby Libby. (His partner Clare Ratcliffe describes herself on Twitter as \u201ccricket widow and PA to Ben Stokes!\u201d) Did becoming a father change him? \u201cYes. Commitment was the hardest thing to get my head round. Me and Clare have got a very good relationship where she knows that, as important as the kids and her are, my friends are very important to me as well. She knows whenever I\u2019m away for a long period of time, I\u2019m desperate to see them also.\u201d That\u2019s very understanding of her, I say. So you can go out drinking just like you used to? He grins. \u201cNo chance, because I wake up with a three-day hangover now.\u201d He\u2019s a funny mix \u2013 in some ways much older than his years, in others still so boyish. I ask what his drink of choice is. \u201cJ\u00e4gerbombs!\u201d How many can he get through in one night? \u201cI\u2019ve lost count after 20,\u201d he says, but such nights are the exception now. Stokes, who bats left-handed and bowls right-handed, made his Test debut in the 2013-14 Ashes series in Australia, aged 22. Despite the thrills of Twenty20, Test cricket is still seen as the purer form of the game. Although England were drubbed 5-0, it was a successful series for Stokes. He made a century in only his second Test; in the final Test, he took six wickets in an innings.     \u2018I\u2019m more professional now. I could have blown it.\u2019 Photograph: Fred MacGregor for the Guardian Photograph: Fred MacGregor for the Guardian    But the price you pay for Stokes\u2019 explosive talent is inconsistency. When things are not going brilliantly for him, they tend to go disastrously. In 2014, he was picked for the one-day tour of the Caribbean and had a stinker. In the final match he was dismissed without scoring a run, and that was when he had it out with his locker. What happened? He looks sheepish. \u201cI wasn\u2019t planning on walking up the stairs and doing that. All the emotions and frustrations of that tour just got the better of me. I felt in good form, but couldn\u2019t get a run out in the middle. When you\u2019re not scoring runs and you\u2019re frustrated, you don\u2019t think about things like that. I didn\u2019t feel it for 10 minutes, because of the adrenaline. Then I was like, well, I\u2019ll be all right, get some tape, wrap it around it.\u201d Stokes didn\u2019t tell anybody what he\u2019d done and went out to field in the slips (just behind and to the side of the batsman, where the ball travels fastest off the bat). \u201cI realised I\u2019d probably broken my wrist and I turned to Jos [Buttler, the wicketkeeper] and was like, \u2018I\u2019m at second slip with a broken wrist.\u2019 He just laughed, because he didn\u2019t know if I was being serious.\u201d Stokes went to field in a safer position, and when the ball came to him he couldn\u2019t throw it back. At that point he had to leave the pitch, and \u2019fess up. Has he seen anybody else smack the locker in rage? \u201cYes. I\u2019ve seen people have tantrums, but I\u2019ve never seen anybody break their hand.\u201d It was daft, what he did, wasn\u2019t it? I expect him to agree, but he gives me a fierce stare. \u201cWell, people say that was daft, but you know, people who say it\u2019s daft wouldn\u2019t have played at the level we were playing at and they wouldn\u2019t understand the feelings of frustration I had at the time that were boiling up inside me.\u201d Were you embarrassed? Now he smiles, apologetically. \u201cYeah. Totally.\u201d Did anybody say you\u2019d been an idiot? \u201cYeah, Gilo [Ashley Giles, then head coach] called me a twat.\u201d Did you give him the lecture you just gave me about not understanding? Stokes grins and says no, that wouldn\u2019t have been appropriate. Though his intensity can be a problem, he says he worries more about trying to temper it. \u201cI\u2019ll never lose my passion. The day I do is the day I should retire.\u201d Many cricketers obsess about the tiniest flaws in their technique. The joy of Stokes is that he plays with such insouciance: bowl it straight and you eventually take wickets; if the ball is there for hitting, hit it. End of. His coaches realise there\u2019s little point in talking to him about the game\u2019s finer points. He admits he turns off when people get technical with him, just as he used to do at school. \u201cI keep it very simple. The management know what they\u2019re going to get from me. They know me as a bloke, and they know I\u2019m going to give them everything I\u2019ve got on the pitch.\u201d And yet Stokes admits he is a worrier. Perhaps it\u2019s not surprising when your form veers between such extremes. At times, he thought he would have to play more cautiously to sustain a career, and it paralysed him. The more he thought about his game, the worse he played. He says there have been two particular low points. The first crisis of confidence came playing for Durham early on. \u201cI was bowling well, but I couldn\u2019t get a run. Couldn\u2019t get over 30. Every time I walked out in the middle, I felt I was going to get out straight away.\u201d He hated how it inhibited his natural character. \u201cI was acting differently from how I normally did in the changing room. I wasn\u2019t as vocal or as stupid. Normally I\u2019m never still, always walking around, giddy.\u201d     Celebrating during his 258 runs against South Africa. Photograph: Julian Finney/Getty Images    The other low point was a tour of Sri Lanka in 2014, after the locker incident. He felt he was in the team only because he could bat, bowl and field a bit. \u201cI was batting at number eight. I felt like a really bad player. I just thought, I\u2019ve blown it with England.\u201d But last year England got a new coach, Australian Trevor Bayliss, and everything changed. He was told to play his natural game, entertain the crowd; it didn\u2019t matter if he was out cheaply. The effect was immediate and dramatic. Against New Zealand, he scored 92 in the first innings and followed up in the second with the fastest ever century at Lord\u2019s \u2013 100 runs off 85 balls. \u201cThat was the turning point for me. I\u2019d got back into the team, batting at six, where I wanted to be. I realised I could go out and score runs at an international level, playing the way that had got me there in the first place.\u201d Until then, he was not convinced he was up to Test cricket. \u201cThere is always that thing when you step up a level and you worry, am I going to be good enough? There\u2019s always doubt in my mind. I think you need doubt and nerves, otherwise it just doesn\u2019t feel like you\u2019re in the big occasion.\u201d That match against New Zealand gave him even more pleasure than his 258, he says. Look, Stokes says, progress is never going to be linear. \u201cThere\u2019s this one picture I always think of.\u201d He looks at the pen and pad in front of me. \u201cPass us the pen and paper. People want success to look like this.\u201d He draws a straight line. \u201cBut it\u2019s always going to be like this, up and down, up and up and down, and hopefully you end up at the top.\u201d He draws a diagram that works its way upwards via a series of squiggly dips and bumps. Does he still dream about that final World Cup over? \u201cNo. I do dream, but about jumping 300 foot in the air, then landing back and jumping again.\u201d Does he feel that he blew it? He turns his cap around back to front. \u201cThe first ball was crap. I just didn\u2019t execute it like I wanted to. The second and third ball, I was just trying to bowl yorkers [straight and low-down on the stumps, to restrict the batsman\u2019s chances of hitting the ball]. I didn\u2019t blow it\u2026\u201d He stops and starts again. \u201cWell, obviously I did blow it! People say, why didn\u2019t you bowl yorkers? And I\u2019m like, \u2018Well, I was fucking trying to bowl fucking yorkers, you dickheads, I just didn\u2019t execute it!\u2019\u201d You don\u2019t need to spend much time with Stokes to experience his explosive nature. Throughout that Twenty20 final, Stokes and the West Indies player Marlon Samuels were niggling away at each other. After the match, Samuels described him as a \u201cnervous laddie\u2026 who doesn\u2019t learn\u201d. What is their spat about? \u201cIt started off on a Lions [England\u2019s second team] tour, and it\u2019s just been a feud that\u2019s carried on and carried on. It\u2019s been a good one, because it\u2019s caught people\u2019s imaginations. It\u2019s a shame after the final, where he played a really good innings, that there wasn\u2019t a chance for him to stay around and shake my hand. But that was his decision. He won\u2019t be on my Christmas card list.\u201d Soon after the final, there was another spat when two presenters on New Zealand\u2019s Radio Hauraki mocked Stokes\u2019s role in the final. His mother Deborah phoned up to tell them they were being \u201cabsolutely unconscionable\u201d and that she was \u201ctotally brassed off\u201d. The presenters assured her she was off-air, when in fact the conversation was being broadcast live. The two presenters were reprimanded and suspended. Was Stokes himself upset by the prank? \u201cYeah. Mum was more annoyed about the fact that she\u2019d asked if she was off-air and she wasn\u2019t. But I\u2019ve left her to deal with that. I said, \u2018Just grit your teeth. I know you\u2019re looking out for me.\u2019\u201d The bottom line, he says, is he\u2019s big enough to take whatever anybody throws at him. He doesn\u2019t need his mother to stick up for him. Now Stokes has a new season to look forward to. Next week, England play their first Test of the series against Sri Lanka and he can\u2019t wait. Has his confidence not taken a dent? \u201cNo. Definitely hasn\u2019t.\u201d For starters, that Twenty20 final came as he was enjoying the best form of his life. And, if anything, it made him realise how popular he is as a player. \u201cThe amount of people who came up to me and said, \u2018It\u2019s not your fault. We\u2019re so proud of the fact that you got to the World Cup final, and we\u2019ll all be watching you.\u2019\u201d Has he been able to laugh about it yet? \u201cYes, I was the first person to laugh about it. We sing this song that the Indian barmy army made up about Stuart Broad getting hit for six consecutive sixes.\u201d (In 2007, again in the World Twenty20 Tournament, though not in the final.) I ask Stokes to sing it to me. He comes over all shy. \u201cIt\u2019s such a long song!\u201d He starts saying it, then quietly sings it, \u201c\u2018It\u2019s the first ball of the over, Stuart Broad, dududu/The mighty Yuvraj hit it out of the park.\u2019 I just started singing it about myself: \u2018It\u2019s the first ball of the over, Benny Stokes.\u2019 And everyone knew the song, and everyone was like, \u2018What?\u2019 And then they all started laughing and singing it.\u201d That was when Stokes knew he\u2019d survive the humiliation. \u201cI just took the piss out of myself,\u201d he says. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have it any other way.\u201d   The first Investec Test in the England v Sri Lanka series starts on Thursday.  \u2022 This article was amended on 20 May 2016. An earlier version suggested incorrectly that Marlon Samuels was the West Indies captain at last month\u2019s Twenty20 final.",
