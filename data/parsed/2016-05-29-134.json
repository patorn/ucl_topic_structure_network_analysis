  "body": "Much like fiction boils down to a few archetypal stories framed by genre strictures, rock albums have recurrent motifs. The Ride, Catfish and the Bottlemen\u2019s second album, finds this foursome \u2013 surprise winners of a Brit for breakthrough act, against far more house-trained opposition \u2013 at a tipping point. Having sold 250,000-odd copies of their debut, 2014\u2019s The Balcony, these north-westerners (plus token Geordie guitarist Johnny Bond) are on a quest \u2013 to become the new Oasis, this generation\u2019s purveyors of everyman tales, written to be hollered back by the\u00a0hordes. Catfish have an authentic, anthemic edge over the landfill indie rock that blighted the 00s, and a natural star in singing guitarist Van McCann, a man who exudes self-belief without the douchebag-ness that often accompanies it. Interestingly, there\u2019s also a Beatles to Catfish\u2019s Stones: the 1975 are not dissimilar in age, \u201covernight sensations\u201d a decade in the making, sharing the same dedication to the idea of being a rock band.    This is the well-worn tale of a band on the up, retold with slightly different detailing    The 1975\u2019s recent take on ambition involves the 80s, R&B and long titles. By contrast, Catfish and the Bottlemen are almost comically one-dimensional, keeping things tight. As with Catfish\u2019s debut, The Ride boasts one-word song titles and tunes that don\u2019t fanny about. \u201cShe tends to obfuscate, when it\u2019s black and white,\u201d spits McCann on Oxygen. He\u2019s half-appalled, but half-intrigued. The song\u2019s chorus, meanwhile, owes a debt to Noel Gallagher\u2019s \u201croute one\u201d approach. Naturally, our protagonists head off to America to get the widescreen treatment, this time courtesy of producer Dave Sardy (Oasis, Primal Scream). Subplots unfold. \u201cNew York surprised me,\u201d begins McCann on Emily, unwittingly summarising the plot of the 1975\u2019s album to boot: \u201cI must admit, I think I lost my way a bit.\u201d         Catfish and the Bottlemen performing 7.    This is, then, the well-worn tale of a band on the up, retold with slightly different detailing: of getting confused about the time difference, of being in love, \u201cbut I need another year alone\u201d, as McCann sings on 7. Of racing from soundcheck to catch a girl on her fag break, of picking someone special up from Heathrow, of love trouble. On Glasgow, McCann is plucking an acoustic guitar, being propped up on Sauchiehall Street, falling for the girl that makes him \u201cdo the shit that I never do\u201d. There is little original here. But McCann has his moments. The way he tinkers \u2013 as though off-handedly \u2013 with repeated lyrics belies attention to craft. Twice is a particularly likable high point. \u201cChrist!\u201d McCann sings on the chorus, \u201cI ain\u2019t ever going back to thinking straight.\u201d He\u2019s uncomfortably sober \u2013 regretting arguments, calling in sick on Mondays and mourning \u201cevery ex I didn\u2019t treat right\u201d. Bond\u2019s guitar solo on Anything, meanwhile, is an object lesson in pithy eloquence \u2013 this unadventurous but crowd-pleasing album\u2019s strongest suit.",
