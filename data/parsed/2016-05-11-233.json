  "body": "What\u2019s the secret of a great sex life? Unlike the old comedy joke, the answer is not \u201ctiming\u201d. Instead, it is almost certainly a good sense of humour. Because taking sex too seriously risks destroying all the fun, and replacing it with a sort of grim, Sting-like commitment to \u201cpleasure\u201d, a word only ever used by people who have never had a moment\u2019s genuine enjoyment in their calorie-restricted, wellbeing-obsessed lives. Which brings us to Gwyneth Paltrow, and more specifically, her infamous website, Goop.   Related: Leave Gwyneth Paltrow alone! Her website gives me joy | Brigid Delaney    Not content with being mocked for her fun-free recipes (her latest cookbook opens with a chapter entitled \u201cOn cooking, panic attacks and somatisation\u201d), or her predilection for vaginal steaming, she\u2019s now overseen Goop\u2019s first Sex Issue. As you\u2019d expect, it reads less erotically than the back of a chia seed packet, and its advice seems largely concerned with avoiding unlikely allergies during the act. Niche troubles to avoid include \u201csuper-toxic\u201d vaginal lube, which might contain parabens, glycerin (\u201cwhich can contribute to yeast infections\u201d) and chlorhexidine gluconate, which could kill healthy vaginal bacteria. It conjures an image of rows of women, tending obsessively to their \u201chealthy vaginas\u201d, while potential sexual partners grow old and withered waiting for them to look up from the fascination with their own glowing labia. That area, according to Goop\u2019s advice, will specifically benefit from Vitamin E oil or olive oil, to \u201cstrengthen the tissue\u201d. God knows, we all suffer from weak labial tissue. \u201cI could talk about endocrine disruptors all day,\u201d enthuses interviewee Dr Maggie Ney of the Santa Monica women\u2019s clinic. What could better sum up the wild, abandoned joy of female passion? She also suggests eating fermented food to support vaginal flora (\u201cJust coming, darling, as soon as I\u2019ve finished this jar of sauerkraut\u201d). Condoms are hideously toxic too, apparently, as they contain \u201cdairy\u201d, in the form of a protein called casein. \u201cIdeally, you want to find a vegan, paraben-free, glycerin-free, Nonoxynol-9-free, and benzocaine- and lidocaine-free condom,\u201d advises Dr Maggie. Potential lovers could write a six-volume sexual memoir while you\u2019re wandering round the shops looking for that golden ticket. But Goop sex isn\u2019t all joyless health fears and unnecessary vegan treasure hunts. There is also the option of \u201cbackground sensuality\u201d, a concept that would have the scribes of the Kama Sutra nodding in awe at its daring. It involves allowing your own hair to brush your shoulder, and appreciating your shirt. \u201cIf you move your shoulder and allow yourself to feel the rub of your shirt on your skin, or the brushing of your hair against your neck, those sensations are innately sensual, and pleasure that can be accessed any time,\u201d exults one of the tantric specialists on Gwyneth\u2019s speed-dial. Imagine how many of us, previously completely numb, can be freed by this. Closing our eyes, suddenly becoming aware of the rasp of M&S cotton on elbow \u2013 and boom, we\u2019re teetering on the precipice of a full body meltdown. Don\u2019t get too giddy, through, as Goop\u2019s advice on \u201cthe elusive orgasm\u201d, from a male doctor, takes us through his lengthy story of cancerous testicles before romping through abuse issues, medication and trauma. If you still feel turned on after this gloomy essay, you may qualify for a place in sex-addict rehab.   Related: Gwyneth Paltrow's got it right. Damn it | Victoria Coren    Gwyneth cheers us up, though, with a shopping section on Goop-approved sex toys, including the $535 (\u00a3295) Agent Provocateur cat whip (useful for pounding mung beans into a fermented paste) and a $15,000 gold dildo that might be handy if you tire of grinding wellbeing-friendly spices with an ordinary pestle and mortar. The Goop sex woman is, it appears, a rich, humourless, vegan neurotic, for whom successful consensual sex is just another hoop to jump through on the road to \u201ctotal wellbeing\u201d. There is no fun without a warning attached, no orgasm without an essay, and no intimacy without a shopping opportunity. Goop sex is, in short, joyless, box-ticking and anxious. Good sex, by contrast, is fun, joyful and untidy. It\u2019s not an Excel chart labelled \u201cPleasure\u201d and it\u2019s not about crafting a 17th-century knot garden in your vagina. If anyone offers you Goop sex, just tell them you\u2019re not that kind of girl. In truth, I\u2019m not sure that kind of girl even exists.",
