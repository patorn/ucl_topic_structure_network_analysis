  "body": "Diego Simeone was at the centre of another touchline flashpoint during Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s Champions League semi-final second-leg tie with Bayern Munich at the Allianz Arena on Tuesday when he was spotted striking one of his own members of staff.   Related: Diego Simeone\u2019s Atl\u00e9tico Madrid \u2013 a tale of heart, guts and togetherness | Jacob Steinberg    Simeone slapped assistant Pedro Pablo Matesanz on the side of his left arm as he prepared to lift up an electronic board, with the same arm, to signal an Atl\u00e9tico substitution in the second minute of stoppage time. The Spanish side lost 2-1 but ultimately celebrated given they did enough to progress to the Champions League final later this month on away goals. Simeone wanted to bring Stefan Savic on for Koke but, according to reports in Spain, had initially failed to get the substitution approved, hence the Atl\u00e9tico manager\u2019s fit of pique, which, as footage shows, shocked Matesanz. The incident comes less than a week after Simeone was given a three-match La Liga touchline ban after an extra ball was thrown on to the pitch during Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s 1-0 win against M\u00e1laga at Vicente Calder\u00f3n.",
