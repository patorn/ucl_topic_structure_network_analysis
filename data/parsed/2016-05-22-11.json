  "body": "Alan Pardew will turn his attention to restructuring Crystal Palace\u2019s squad and making a major signing after saying his team had demonstrated in the FA Cup final they are \u201ca force to be reckoned with\u201d. \u201cWe have shown that we have got talent in the group,\u201d Palace\u2019s manager said after a 2-1 defeat, after extra time, at Wembley. \u201cWe need to refine it a little bit, and we are going to try to do that in the transfer market. But we were a force to be reckoned with against Manchester United. We have given a real good, honest account of ourselves.\u201d Palace\u2019s \u00a312.5m purchase of Yohan Cabaye from Paris Saint-Germain last July was considered one of the coups of the summer, and Pardew said he is hoping to bring in players of similar international standing in the hope of improving on last season\u2019s 15th-place finish. \u201cI think we have got to get players who are better than this,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no point in getting players who are not potentially better than the ones we have got. Well, then they have got to be good players. So will there be a big name in there? There\u2019s going to need to be.\u201d Pardew credited Wayne Rooney with producing \u201cthe moment that won the Cup\u201d, after seeing his plans for countering United\u2019s key threats undone by one superb run from the England captain.   Related: Crystal Palace miss their big chance and have only themselves to blame | Jacob Steinberg    Palace had taken the lead with 12 minutes remaining, and restricted their opponents to few chances, but their hopes of clinging on to that slender advantage evaporated after Rooney picked up possession in midfield three minutes later and set off towards the penalty area, a run that culminated in Juan Mata\u2019s equaliser. \u201cAnthony Martial we marshalled really well today, we hardly gave him any moments, which we had worked on,\u201d said Pardew of his side\u2019s defensive organisation. \u201cWe knew Rooney would switch the play, and we had worked on that, but we didn\u2019t perhaps expect a drive from him of that quality. With all the things we had worked on and done, he hardly ever got in the box. And I do think that we would have seen that game out if it wasn\u2019t for that moment that he produced. \u201cHe drew everybody to him and then the cross really and truly is a very difficult skill, to get it to the back post. So of course he is a genius player and has been all his career, and he produced a moment today that in my view probably won them the Cup. Forget about the winning goal. \u201cThe two goals that United have come up with show the sort of level we are at. Their second goal, Jesse Lingard\u2019s hit, is an amazing goal. When I was on the sideline it just flashed in, but seeing it on the video, wow, I don\u2019t think you are going to see many better than that.\u201d The Palace captain, Scott Dann, who was substituted shortly before the start of extra time because of an ankle injury, said there had been a point in the game when he believed victory for his team had been \u201cwritten in the stars\u201d.

I think that we didn\u2019t play as well as we would have liked and especially in the first half we never really got into the game. We got ourselves in front and in a great position, and lose a goal straight after. Then they get a man sent off and you think it is written in the stars, and obviously the lad [Lingard] comes up with a great strike. It was not for a lack of effort and that is the only thing we can cling on to, that we tried our best.\u201d",
