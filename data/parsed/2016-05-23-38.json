  "body": "The last remaining member of a British quartet of Isis jailers who killed and tortured more than two dozen hostages in Syria has been named as a 27-year-old from west London. Dubbed \u201cthe Beatles\u201d by their captors because of their English accents, the cell\u2019s most notorious member was Mohammed Emwazi, whose murderous exploits were filmed in high definition and distributed by the Islamist terror group.  El Shafee Elsheikh, from White City, west London, was named as the fourth member of cell. He was born in Sudan, and his family came to Britain in the early 1990s.  His father, Rashid Sidahmed ElSheikh, a translator in London, said his son had travelled to Syria to fight for jihadists at the start of 2012. He described his son\u2019s radicalisation as \u201clightning fast\u201d. El Shafee Elsheikh is believed to be living in Aleppo.  \u201cWe thought this [his radicalism] was just a phase \u2026 the flavour of the month,\u201d the father said. \u201cFor me, understanding the images portrayed on websites and even in the news bulletins, deaths mounted by the western powers bombarding people \u2026 this ignited the sense of anger, of a drive to right things in their own way. \u201cBut understanding as well that this second generation [of immigrants] suffer from an identity crisis. They\u2019re no longer fully educated in their own background and heritage and culture and they are not fully accepted in the new society. Coming from a Muslim family, they are asked: \u2018What do you know about your religion?\u2019 So maybe this is the drive deep into understanding this part of their identity.\u201d The jihadist was first named by the Washington Post and Buzzfeed. According to western hostages who were later released, the so-called Beatles were allegedly responsible for beatings, waterboarding, mock executions and killings of a number of mainly western hostages. Emwazi was killed in a US drone strike last November. The other two members of the group, all from west London, are alleged to be Alex Kotey, whose whereabouts is unknown, and Aine Davis, who was arrested last year in Turkey. Elsheikh\u2019s father said the UK had not taken the threat of radicalisation seriously enough. \u201cUnfortunately the lenient way of our government here in tackling the radicalisation machinery in the mosques was complacent \u2026 So they go there [to the mosques] and they listen to a version of Islam which is synonymous to Isis and al-Qaida and all these radical terrorists. So they have the propensity to [believe] this erroneous version of Islam.\u201d He added: \u201cWe tried to handle this in a mild, considerate way, but before we could do anything he [his son] just left.\u201d After El Shafee left for Syria, his mother took his youngest brother, Mahmoud, to Sudan to try to keep him out of the clutches of London radicals. The move was unsuccessful. When she approached the UK embassy in Sudan to ask officials to confiscate Mahmoud\u2019s passport, Rashid said, they did not help. \u201cThey told her that he\u2019s an adult and he\u2019s entitled to have a travel document,\u201d and passed the request on to the Sudanese authorities, he said. Mahmoud later joined Isis and was killed in Tikrit, Iraq, in April 2015.  Salah al-Bander, a former Lib Dem councillor in Cambridge who first raised the alarm about El Shafee\u2019s journey to Syria in 2012, said that El Shafee had a stall outside Shepherds Bush tube station from which he used to preach, and had been \u201ccompletely transformed\u201d into a radical in a very short period of time. \u201cEl Shafee was a really very quiet, kind, reflective young person. [And] in a very short period of time, I mean weeks, he turned to be very radicalised, with very strong views about everything,\u201d Bander said. \u201cI\u2019m still very puzzled about the rapidness of the process myself,\u201d he added. He said there was too much focus on individuals but not on incubating factors that had given rise in the area to a \u201cproduction line of young jihadis\u201d. \u201cNobody is making any effort to look at the production line,\u201d he said.",
