  "body": "Shoes are, as many teachers might tell you, one of the battlegrounds in a school\u2019s uniform policy. Heel height, colour, whether or not a pupil\u2019s shoe could actually be classed as a trainer are all argued over. But research suggests schools should do away with shoes altogether. The issue has been looked at as part of the Learnometer project, examining the physical conditions of classrooms, including temperature, light, sound and CO2. In the project, children surveyed each other at other schools in different countries, and one of the things that appealed to them, particularly after speaking to children at schools in Scandinavia, is introducing shoeless classrooms. Stephen Heppell, professor of new media environments at Bournemouth University\u2019s Centre for Excellence in Media Practice, who is running the project, has observed many shoeless schools now, and has seen the effects, including better behaviour. Going shoeless also has a particular impact on bullying. \u201cIt seems to be difficult to be a bully with your shoes off,\u201d he says. \u201cAll the places we\u2019ve been where kids have their shoes off, they report calmness.\u201d The researchers had asked children where they read at home. \u201cNinety-five per cent said it was with shoes off, sitting in comfort on a sofa, bed, on the floor, on a beanbag.\u201d Making the classroom more comfortable and inviting, with clean carpets and no dirty footwear, could encourage reading, he says. It isn\u2019t just the children who should spend the day in their socks, says Heppell, the teachers must too. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a room that\u2019s shoeless unless everybody is shoeless.\u201d Whether any of this barefootedness translates into academic progress is difficult to say. \u201cThere are a lot more variables. These experiments are in schools that are improving anyway \u2013 they wouldn\u2019t be taking their shoes off if they weren\u2019t looking for ways to be better.\u201d Other teachers sound a similar note of warning. Secondary-school teacher Tom Starkey says he is intrigued by the idea but warns against falling for quick fixes. \u201cIt\u2019s the shoes [that are a problem], or the food, or the colour of the uniform. It\u2019s more complicated than that. It\u2019s about socio-economic background, what\u2019s going on in the school, teaching approach. Focusing on one thing \u2013 such as shoes, which is cute \u2013 sometimes shifts the focus away from things that are more important.\u201d",
