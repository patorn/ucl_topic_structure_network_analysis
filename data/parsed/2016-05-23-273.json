While the coronation of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho as the club\u2019s new manager looks a formality, opinions vary on how much he\u2019ll be given to spend, who he\u2019ll sign and with whom he\u2019ll fall out first. The Guardian\u2019s man on the Manchester beat says Mourinho has identified Andr\u00e9 Gomes, Jo\u00e3o M\u00e1rio, John Stones, \u00c1lvaro Morata, Mauro Icardi and Ezequiel Garay as the players he\u2019d like to take to the bagging area following a \u00a3150m summer trolley dash, while the Mirror say the names James Rodr\u00edguez, Marquinhos and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang also feature on his shopping list.    Related: Jos\u00e9 Mourinho targets John Stones in \u00a3150m Manchester United spree    It should go without saying that Zlatan Ibrahimovic\u2019s name has also been mentioned in dispatches, with Swedish media outlet Aftonbladet going so far as to suggest he\u2019ll take a role as Mourinho\u2019s assistant manager. We can but hope and pray such a box office appointment comes to pass.  Quite what the arrival of Mourinho and his back-room team of ref-bothering coaches will mean for Ryan Giggs remains to be seen, but the smart money seems to suggest that the 42-year-old will end his 29-year association with the club even if he\u2019s offered a coaching role under the new regime. According to our chief football correspondent Daniel Taylor, the Welshman will be missed a lot more by United\u2019s players than Mr Van Gaal.  In other news from the managerial merry-go-round, contrasting reports say that Everton have sounded out former Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini and current Sevilla gaffer Unai Emery with regard to taking over the position recently vacated by Roberto Mart\u00ednez, who is being linked with a move to Championship side Derby County. With Arsenal reported to have wrapped up a \u00a330m deal to bring Swiss midfielder Granit Xhaka to the Emirates from Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach, Bayern Munich\u2019s Moroccan defender Medhi Benatia is believed to be next on their Bundesliga wish-list. The Gunners will free up a dressing room peg for the centre-back by off-loading Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain to Premier League champions Leicester City, but plan to keep Theo Walcott on board despite ongoing speculation that his time with the club was drawing to a close. The Mirror say Arsenal are also ready to renew their interest in 17-year-old V\u00e9lez Sarsfield striker Maximiliano Romero and also want Juventus striker Morata. Esteemed German football organ Kicker reports that Ilkay G\u00fcndogan\u2019s \u20ac25m switch from Borussia Dortmund to Manchester City is as good as a done deal, despite the injury-prone midfielder dislocating a kneecap in training three weeks ago. The bearded German has since undergone surgery to have his patella put back in place, but is likely to be sidelined until mid-October at the earliest.  Meanwhile in Italy, Gazzetta dello Sport say Roma midfielder Miralem Pjanic looks likely to sign for Juventus, despite interest from Chelsea, Barcelona and Bayern Munich. They also report that Dinamo Zagreb\u2019s Croatian midfielder Marcelo Brozovic will end his loan spell at Inter and be moved on to an unspecified Premier League club. Reports elsewhere in Italy suggest that Chelsea and Manchester United fans hoping to see Napoli striker Gonzalo Higua\u00edn line up in the colours of their respective clubs next season are likely to face disappointment as the Argentinian is believed to have his sights set on a move to Paris Saint-Germain.",
