So this opening gambit \u2013 the kind of thing a hardened professional might say every night \u2013 bodes extremely well. And the happy portent is not misleading. By the end of a polished and ultimately engaging 80-minute show, even those who start out wondering if the space-jazz trappings of the Birmingham Conservatoire-trained Mvula\u2019s music \u2013 the harp, the cello, the euphorically out-there choral interludes \u2013 might be just so much window dressing, designed to convince a Later\u2026 With Jools Holland audience that this is something more interesting than routine post-Prince sophisto-pop, will have come to hear them as part of a well-integrated and satisfying whole. Mvula also manages to hold on to the crowd while playing all but one track of her imminent second album, The Dreaming Room, to a crowd that won\u2019t yet have heard more than a few tracks.    The show really comes to life when she introduces the song Kiss My Feet with a monologue about a romantic betrayal    Mvula\u2019s chatty, playful stage patter certainly helps with this connection, as does the fact that many of her new songs are \u2013 taking into consideration their expansive arrangements and penchant for baroque flourishes and swirling codas \u2013 unexpectedly short. The point where the show really comes to life is when she introduces the song Kiss My Feet with a monologue about a romantic betrayal (\u201cYou know, innit... heartbreak\u201d) that changed its meaning \u2013 \u201cWhen it was written, this was a love song, but it isn\u2019t now.\u201d All the evidence suggests that Mvula\u2019s opera-singing husband \u2013 the reason her brother and sister James and Dionne Douglas (contributing cello and guitar respectively in her well-drilled, intuitive backing ensemble) have a different surname \u2013 has ascended to the pantheon of inspirational musical exes.         Laura Mvula\u2019s Father, Father.    From Amy Winehouse\u2019s Frank to Adele\u2019s 21, the multi-platinum landscape of 21st-century female pop empowerment has usually been defined against a male other, and as Mvula telegraphs with engaging candour (\u201cHere\u2019s another song for that motherfucker who broke my heart\u201d), The Dreaming Room is no exception. But where Bj\u00f6rk (whose name is helpfully put forward from the crowd when Mvula lists musical influences including Queen, Nina Simone and Schubert) recently struggled to impose her individuality on the conventions of the breakup album, Mvula seems to have made an excellent job of it, with Kiss My Feet \u2013 \u201cI feel lost and found at the same damn time/ Made my bed but I can\u2019t rest/ I got losing on my mind\u201d \u2013 just one of several new songs to strike a winning balance between wistful regret and affronted ferocity.     \u2018Wistful regret and affronted ferocity\u2019: Laura Mvula at Gorilla. Photograph: Matthew McNulty/ Redferns    She expresses fulsome gratitude to her new album\u2019s producer, former Amy Winehouse drummer Troy Miller, now securely ensconced behind the kit at the heart of her band. The absent male who doesn\u2019t get a mention is Steve Brown, who helped get Mvula a record deal and produced her excellent (and rightly Mobo-laden) first album Sing to the Moon when she was, if not quite working as a waitress in a cocktail bar, then certainly on reception for the Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. Brown\u2019s shadowy presence as an enabler of upscale British female pop (he provided the same service for Rumer) is rendered no less intriguing by his parallel career as Harry Hill\u2019s musical director and stellar backstory as Alan Partridge\u2019s legendary band leader Glenn Ponder. The Dreaming Room\u2019s seductive Afro-futurist shimmer suggests it will avoid the ignominious fate that befell Rumer\u2019s second album when she too unceremoniously dumped Brown off the back of an award-winning set. Tonight\u2019s stellar solo performance of Sing to the Moon standout Father, Father \u2013 accompanying herself on giant antique 80s funk-style keytar \u2013 confirms that Mvula has what it takes to go it alone.",
