  "body": "First things first. Caroline Pidgeon, Liberal Democrat candidate for London mayor and for the 25-strong London Assembly, denies being the source of the cold that her fellow frontline candidates have all caught during the long months of campaigning all over the capital\u2019s 600 square miles. It is a baseless allegation from a rival, she indulgently maintains. \u201cIt was Zac Goldsmith who caught it first,\u201d Pidgeon says. \u201cUnfortunately, it was me who ended up needing antibiotics.\u201d It is unfortunate too for Pidgeon that the surpassing ugliness into which the battle between the frontrunners Goldsmith, the Conservative Party candidate, and Labour\u2019s Sadiq Khan has degenerated has meant her offer to the capital has received even less attention than it was always likely to.  Having already served two terms on the Assembly, she is entitled to claim that she has direct experience of how City Hall works that all others seeking the top job lack. Yet that job, its powers, responsibilities and potential, have been all but wiped off the media agenda, initially by the smear strategy of the wretched Goldsmith campaign, and now by the crass behaviour of Ken Livingstone. For all that, Pidgeon, her cold in the past, sounds as upbeat now as when I interviewed her back in January. \u201cOverall, it\u2019s gone well. Ordinary people are saying they like what I\u2019m saying on childcare and cheaper fares that are affordable. And that\u2019s not just in places where we are strong, like Sutton, or in Bermondsey, where I\u2019m known.\u201d The former Southwark councillor has been arguing for setting up a mayoral house-building company to directly deliver Greater London Authority equivalents of 50,000 council homes and to raise finance towards supplying another 150,000 dwellings. She\u2019s pledged to increase the congestion charge, pilot a new, separate scheme around Heathrow and place curbs on heavy goods and construction vehicles in Central London. She wants more vigorous action on cleaning up polluting buses and taxis too, along with stronger regulation of Uber.  The mother of a two year-old called Henry, she\u2019s also set out plans for improving childcare provision, which include raising \u00a350m through a voluntary \u201ctourism tax\u201d on London hotel guests. The cost of childcare remains an under recognised element of London\u2019s high cost of living, as the single parent charity Gingerbread has shown.  How will Pidgeon get on when Londoners vote on Thursday? Opinion polls have shown her, Sian Berry of the Greens and Ukip\u2019s Peter Whittle in a single-figure cluster vying for third place, although London borough by election results since last year\u2019s general election have seen the Lib Dem vote share pick up significantly.  In Europhile London, being passionately pro-Europe might work in her favour, though Khan and Berry are in the Remain camp too. She says it hasn\u2019t really been a factor when meeting people, though \u201clinking the two together motivates my campaigners.\u201d She adds: \u201cIt might affect Liberal Democrat voters\u2019 second preferences. Would you trust a candidate who wants to pull out of Europe?\u201d Goldsmith is for Brexit. Pidgeon is, as you\u2019d expect, disparaging about the campaigns of both Goldsmith and Khan. \u201cThey don\u2019t have much to say. They\u2019re almost fearful of saying anything.\u201d A chair and a vice chair of the Assembly\u2019s transport committee, she has maintained throughout that Khan\u2019s proposed across-the-board four year fares freeze is unaffordable. She expresses surprise that the fight between him and Goldsmith \u201cgot so dirty so early,\u201d and anticipates that it will cause regrets. \u201cI think both of them, but particularly Zac, will wish they hadn\u2019t done it. It\u2019s damaged their reputations. Zac has always been seen by most people as a decent kind of guy.\u201d We\u2019ll find out what Londoners have made of Pidgeon when results come through on Friday.
