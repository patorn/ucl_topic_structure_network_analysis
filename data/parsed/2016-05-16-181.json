  "body": "There are two marriages behind Loving, a new historical biopic which on Monday threw its hat into the race for this year\u2019s Palme d\u2019Or at Cannes. The first is that which the film shows: between Mildred and Richard Loving, whose interracial union was deemed unlawful in their home state in 1958. The couple were banned from Virginia for 25 years, moving with their children to Washington DC. Almost a decade later, their case reached the supreme court; the subsequent victory overturned miscegenation laws.   Related: Loving review: civil rights tale marries heartfelt drama with too much restraint    The second is that of director Jeff Nichols and his wife, Missy. Weighing up whether or not to take on the project, he emailed her the trailer for an HBO documentary about the Lovings, which had moved him to tears. As Nichols recalled at a press conference in Cannes, she wrote back to say: \u201cListen, I really love you, but if you don\u2019t make this film, I\u2019m going to divorce you.\u201d Duly motivated, Nichols first started working on the screenplay in 2013, as the supreme court began ruling on the same-sex marriage ban in the US; some of the constitutional changes were informed by by Loving v Virginia in 1967. Nichols hoped the film might be released in time to influence the debate; happily, this wasn\u2019t required, and same-sex marriage was ratified in 2015. But the director cautioned against the presumption such rulings lay to rest centuries-old prejudice that has been vindicated by legislation. \u201cSoon you get religious liberty laws added and other things, and you realise the supreme court can only do so much. The law sometimes gets it right, but it takes a long time for society to get it right. That\u2019s always been surprising to me. People are afraid of certain things and they feel it\u2019s necessary to legislate that fear.\u201d     Negga, Nichols and Edgerton at the press conference. Photograph: Andreas Rentz/Getty Images    Both the film\u2019s stars reiterated their surprise at learning that the state of Alabama only amended their constitution to allow mixed-race marriage as late as 2000; both also related the Lovings\u2019 case to contemporary struggles. Ruth Negga said she\u2019d been \u201cvery proud\u201d that her home country, Ireland, last year leant \u201coverwhelming support\u201d for gay marriage in a referendum. \u201cHaving a very, very Catholic history [it shows] it\u2019s possible to evolve, having discussions about equality.\u201d   Related: Ruth Negga: \u2018I never fitted anywhere \u2013 in\u00a0life or in Hollywood\u2019    \u201cWhat happens between two individuals is sort of nobody else\u2019s business,\u201d said the Australian actor Joel Egerton. \u201cIf people are doing things out of the spirit of kindness or goodness, if they\u2019re not damaging or affecting other people negatively, then what\u2019s wrong with the bond between two people \u2013 whatever they look like, whatever gender they are?\u201d           Loving: biopic of inter-racial couple\u2019s fight to decriminalise their marriage    In Australia, although same-sex unions are recognised, all attempts to legalise same-sex marriage have so far been unsuccessful. Egerton said he hoped the film would help illuminate people\u2019s thinking about the damage that can be inflicted by their own judgements. \u201cIt\u2019s quite astounding, the sort of latent, under-the-surface racism and negative opinion [in Australia]. To me, that\u2019s something that we really need to talk about. Let people sit and quietly watch an example of two people who really affected by the opinions of others.\u201d The film is due for release in the autumn, giving it a prime position ahead of awards season, and while Nichols, Egerton and Negga were modest about its prospects, the former called it \u201cone of the most pure love stories in American history\u201d while the latter hailed it as \u201cone of the most important films in history\u201d.       Yet unlike, say, Ava Duverney\u2019s Martin Luther King biopic, Selma, Loving is a consciously understated film, which focuses on the domestic fallout rather than the courtroom and soapbox fireworks. This was the intention, said the director, who described it as \u201cthe quiet film of the year\u201d. \u201cWhen we talk about politics and social issues such as race and racial equality we tend to join our platform of thinking \u2013 conservative, liberal; you go to your corners and spar, based on these political ideas. I think what people forget when they\u2019re so heated in their debates is the people at the centre.\u201d Egerton agreed, and said he hoped the film\u2019s lack of flashy spectacle and impassioned speeches wouldn\u2019t hobble its odds. \u201cI suspect sometimes things go unnoticed when they don\u2019t involve bloodshed or massive acts of violence. There\u2019s something so gentle about this, and yet, at the same time, there\u2019s such a hidden violence to the oppression of situations like this, where people are put into exile or forced into making choices that are inhuman.\u201d",
