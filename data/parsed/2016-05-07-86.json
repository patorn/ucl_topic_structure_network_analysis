  "body": "Jermain Defoe\u2019s instinctive and incisive finish settled an enthralling contest with last season\u2019s Premier League champions and lifted Sunderland to within a victory of guaranteed Premier League survival.   Related: John Terry red card rules him out of Chelsea\u2019s final two games    Their first opportunity to do so will come on Wednesday, when an Everton side clearly focused on the distractions of summer travel to the Stadium of Light, but given the latest failings of Newcastle and Norwich it is entirely possible that Sam Allardyce already has enough points in the bag to be sure of continuing his proud record of never having been relegated as a manager from the top division. \u201cI\u2019d be gutted if we didn\u2019t stay up from this position,\u201d said the Sunderland manager. \u201cBut still we\u2019ve got to be professional and driven on Wednesday night and make sure when we finish that game, we\u2019re safe. \u201cOur destiny is in our own hands and hopefully we won\u2019t jangle the nerves any longer than we need to. So many people \u2013 staff, fans \u2013 were biting their nails in the last few minutes. \u201cBut we needed that today and it was a miraculous way to get a victory, given the circumstances, the pressure we\u2019re under and the team we\u2019re playing.\u201d That team they were playing are a pale shadow of the Chelsea side that strode to last season\u2019s title and their miserable season was neatly summed up deep in injury-time when John Terry, possibly in the final month of his Stamford Bridge career, fouled Wahbi Khazri and was sent off for a second bookable offence which will carry a two-match suspension \u2013 as it is his second dismissal of the season \u2013 and end his campaign. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what his future is but, for this season, it\u2019s sad,\u201d said the outgoing interim manager Guus Hiddink. \u201cWe would have liked to have him in our last game at home to Leicester, the champions, and having a nice \u2018party\u2019 game.\u201d Terry had already played an underwhelming part in Chelsea\u2019s second-half surrender, although it owed as much to the forward Diego Costa, who twice found himself alone in the Sunderland area, with his team leading 2-1, and twice struck the ball too close to the impressive home keeper Vito Mannone. In the 67th minute, Sunderland, picking up a head of steam from their intense following, equalised as Fabio Borini was found by Patrick van Aanholt\u2019s neat pass and scored from just inside the area with a shot that Thibaut Courtois, unsighted by Terry, could only help into his own net. Then three minutes later, Defoe, who had previously scored only three home goals this season, was on hand 12 yards out to meet a DeAndre Yedlin cross, touched into his path by Mikel John Obi, before again scoring via a touch off the Chelsea keeper, his 15th goal of an extraordinary season. \u201cFor a team in the bottom three for most of the season, that\u2019s a miraculous return for Jermain,\u201d said Allardyce. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t been starved of service but, for me, the pleasing factor is he scores goals continuously while playing up front on his own. People have suggested all his career that he couldn\u2019t do that and he\u2019s proved everybody wrong.\u201a\u201c There had been no sign of the second-half fightback to come as Sunderland capitulated late in first half injury-time, gifting Chelsea a second goal within minutes of scoring a superb equaliser through Khazri. Deep into stoppage time, Allardyce\u2019s defence showed the same nervousness about which he had complained in last weekend\u2019s draw at Stoke, failing to deal either with Cesc F\u00e0bregas\u2019s upfield punt or the header from C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta that played in Nemanja Matic who finished neatly past the advancing Mannone. Khazri\u2019s equaliser had comfortably been the best goal of an entertaining contest as he latched on to a headed clearance from Yann M\u2019Vila\u2019s deep free-kick and beat Courtois with a stunning right-foot volley from the edge of the Chelsea area, a goal which had been sorely needed, cancelling out Costa\u2019s 16th goal of the season after 14 minutes.

But we\u2019re in a good position now. Newcastle drawing, Norwich losing, has put us in a very good position.\u201d",
