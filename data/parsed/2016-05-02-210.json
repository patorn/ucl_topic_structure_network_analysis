In my experience this isn\u2019t always simply due to being brainier or harder working (although, of course, these play a part). Very often it\u2019s simply down to technique; reading things carefully, knowing exactly what the exam question is asking, and what it is that the examiner wants to see in an answer. So as well as spending time learning all the different things in the curriculum for your exams, I think it is as important to make sure that your exam technique is a finely honed and sharp as possible. Believe me, I know. I\u2019ve spent many, many years of my life sitting exams!     Dr Christian: exam expert! Photograph: John Wright     The first thing I want to reassure you of is that some stress is not at all a bad thing; that slight feeling of anxiety, a wave of nausea and nervous excitement that you feel flooding through your body when you think about your exams looming only a few short weeks away can be a good thing. It is often the motivator that makes you get off line, switch off the telly, and knuckle down to some revision. Not being stressed may make it very likely that you don\u2019t bother preparing or revising much at all, and this, to me, should be more of a concern than a degree of motivating stress.   Related: Mental health and books: teenagers speak out     But I know that sometimes exam stresses can feel like they are getting out of hand, and you just don\u2019t think you will ever be able to cope with the mountains of work in front of you, the pressure from your teachers, and the anxious, hopeful, pleading expectation from your parents. Really extreme stress, that is causing you difficulties getting to sleep or waking up in the morning, unexplained aches and pains, poor appetite and headaches can adversely affect your performance and I advise you to talk to someone about it.  But believe me, you can do this. To start with, let me suggest that you already know more than you think you do. You also know the bit you are not so good at, have never been good at, probably really don\u2019t like at all, (for me it was maths!) and it is these bits that you should spend a good amount of time on, not the bits you are good at and really enjoy. Don\u2019t overdo the revision; take breaks, go and get some fresh air. If you can get out everyday and do some exercise for an hour or so you will achieve wonders \u2013 far more than locking your self away in your room all day. Make sure you are getting enough sleep at night too, and not staying up late revising. It is during these times that your brain will go on processing and laying down what you have been studying as memories \u2013I would argue that the periods you spend not revising are as important as the times when you are.

I remember some people at medical school announcing they had drawn up their revision timetables which involved a solid 12 hours of revision a day for the next four weeks. It made all of us worry that we weren\u2019t doing enough and it increased our anxiety massively. Should we all be doing that much? Shouldn\u2019t I be more worried \u2013 I wasn\u2019t planning on doing anything near that much! Don\u2019t listen or compare in this way. Do what you know works best for you. On the day before the exam, go through the final bits you always find tricky, read through your notes, have a look at some past papers and then STOP. Put everything away, and don\u2019t worry about it any more. You\u2019ve done it. You know it. It\u2019s in there, believe me. Desperately scanning through revision cards over breakfast the next morning or as you wait to go into your exam really wont make any difference. Some calm, and some respite is all you need now. One final thing; try your best to avoid going through the exam questions afterwards with your friends to see what they put. A post-mortem like this never helps. What\u2019s done is done. give yourself some time off, shake the dust off, stretch, and then start preparing for the next one. Believe me, they\u2019ll fly by, and get the work/life balance right and you may find you actually quite enjoyed your exams. Believe it or not, it is possible!
