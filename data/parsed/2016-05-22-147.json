  "body": "Spanish actor Laia Costa is the much-lauded lead in the German heist thriller Victoria, whose 138 mostly improvised minutes were filmed in one take by cinematographer Sturla Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen (given top billing in the end credits by director Sebastian Schipper). The film has been described by the New York Times as a \u201csensational cinema stunt\u201d and won six gongs at the German film awards last year (including best leading actress for Costa). Victoria is a foreigner alone in Berlin who hooks up with a group of young men as she is leaving a club in the early hours. At first there is much flirting and fun, but as the night unwinds she finds herself in darker territory, when she is co-opted to be their getaway driver in a robbery. Costa, 31, was included in the New York Times\u2019s breakthrough performances in 2015 and Victoria is her first lead role. Have you been that girl, dancing alone in a club in a foreign city?No, I\u2019m a very boring classic girl. That\u2019s why I love Victoria so much, we are so different. I have had a happy life with family and friends. I\u2019ve never felt alone. I love these kind of characters where I haven\u2019t had the experience, those kind of feelings. I loved robbing a bank. I was like \u201cWoah, I could do it now!\u201d When you first read the script did you find it believable?I never had a script, they just told me the story. But I have a lot of friends in Spain who are living abroad, working or studying just trying to be, and I talked to them a lot before doing the movie and everyone said that this feeling of loneliness is very hard. It makes you do things you wouldn\u2019t ever... you do it to survive. So I could believe that Victoria would [behave this way] because she is not robbing the bank to rob the bank, she is doing it because she has found some friends. They are showing her, for the first time, friendship with no limits, no conditions. A lot of the film was improvised, which must have been challenging. The club scene after the robbery is pretty wild.We rehearsed for 12 days before shooting [Schipper had three attempts at the film, which was shot between 4.30am and 7am in the Mitte district of Berlin. He released the third take]. It was a very unusual way of shooting, over a very short period of time. Every night we rehearsed one scene/location. For that club scene we were told, it\u2019s like a big party and you have to be crazy because it\u2019s a big moment... at first we weren\u2019t doing it very well and then we figured it out \u2013 it\u2019s not like going to party, it\u2019s like breaking the limits, it\u2019s about going crazy because you are feeling so free, you know? I have never been on drugs but I had the feeling that I was on drugs. We were doing this scene the whole night and in the end we couldn\u2019t stop. We were saying, \u201cWe have to do it again\u201d and everyone else was saying, \u201cNo, look guys, it\u2019s done.\u201d         Watch the trailer for Victoria    At the end of the movie you were so \u201cin the moment\u201d that you apparently just carried on walking [down a street] and the crew were shouting at you, telling you it was over, that you could stop.Yes I could hear them and it was like when you\u2019re sleeping and someone is waking you up and saying, \u201cCome on, you have to go to work and you\u2019re thinking\u2026 just five minutes, OK, just five minutes.\u201d It was the same sense. Quite an experience then?Yes. I really love the film. And when it came out everyone was crazy about it. I\u2019m shooting in Buenos Aires at the moment [starring in Black Snow (Nieve Negra) with Argentine director Ricardo Darin] and the crew asked me to go and see Victoria with them at their house. They talked about it for hours. Which is really nice \u2013 you don\u2019t get that reaction to all the movies. What do your family think of it?My boyfriend David, well my husband now, he\u2019s not an actor, we met at university in Barcelona 10 years ago and he\u2019s a company chief executive. He gives me good advice from the outside. When he saw Victoria he said \u201cthis is very good work because I cannot recognise you in this role. I cannot see you.\u201d Usually he says he can see me in there. You only became an actor recently?Yes, four years ago. I was working in a Spanish advertising agency [in Barcelona] and then I worked in a German agency and the hours were different. I was finishing at 6pm and it was very weird for me, very early, it was like, \u201cWhat am I going to do now before dinner?\u201d My sister said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go to this acting school?\u201d And I said \u201cLet\u2019s do it\u201d. My first job was on a TV soap opera in Madrid.     Isabelle Huppert in Michael Haneke\u2019s The Piano Teacher. Photograph: Allstar    What actors/films do you like?I have four top films that when I saw them I felt very touched\u2026 I spent some weeks just thinking about them. One is The Piano by Jane Campion. Isabelle Huppert in The Piano Teacher. I love Emily Watson in Breaking the Waves. Also Gina Rowlands in A Woman Under the Influence. I like movies where there is a strong female lead. So you are a feminist?In film there is a really big problem with women. I read about women who have been rejected because they are too old to play a role with a very old man and they are 35. And I\u2019m thinking, what? What kind of world do we live in? But actually that\u2019s a reflection of our society. I\u2019ve just seen a movie recently here in Buenos Aires and I had to leave the theatre because I was so angry about the way the girl was being treated. I was thinking \u201cWhy has this actress said yes to this role?\u201d You know movies are not the most important thing in our society, of course they\u2019re not, but movies are powerful sometimes and we need to fight or somehow speak about women in them. I\u2019m talking about when you really feel that the female character is being treated like shit. Do you think you will ever get another role as good as Victoria?When we had finished I talked to the cameraman and I asked him, \u201cSturla, will you ever be offered a project like this again?\u201d And I was so sad because he said no. No one is going to ask me to do a one-take movie of two and a half hours again. But later I thought, it doesn\u2019t mean that tomorrow someone isn\u2019t going to say \u201cLook, do you want to do this other thing?\u201d I want to think some good stuff is coming. Victoria is released on DVD/Blu-ray tomorrow",
