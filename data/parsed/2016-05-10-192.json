  "body": "Hundreds of non-Syrian asylum seekers deported under the EU-Turkey migration deal were not allowed to claim asylum in either Greece or Turkey, a group of European politicians has claimed. After interviewing 40 of the deportees, the three MEPs have concluded that, despite EU promises, the deal with Turkey is not being enacted according to international law.   Related: From war in Syria to a Turkish sweatshop for child refugees    \u201cAll refugees interviewed told us they were not given the opportunity to ask for asylum, neither in Greece nor in Turkey,\u201d Cornelia Ernst, Marina Albiol and Josu Juaristi said in a report released to journalists after they visited two detention centres in northern Turkey. \u201cAll said they did not know what will happen to them, and had received no information since they had arrived in Turkey.\u201d The trio are the first independent observers to corroborate the UN refugee agency\u2019s earlier claims that some of the refugees were sent back to Turkey by mistake. Throughout 2015, hundreds of thousands of asylum seekers were allowed to land in Greece by boat from Turkey, and then move onwards to northern Europe. This stopped in March, after the EU agreed a deal with Turkey to send back new arrivals. More than 300 have since been returned \u2013 the majority to the two camps visited by the MEPs, and around a dozen Syrians to a third camp in southern Turkey. Those Syrians told the Guardian by phone that they had returned willingly to Turkey, but had since been denied legal representation and were being held indefinitely.  \u201c[Officials] told me: don\u2019t give money to any lawyers to help you,\u201d said one pregnant detainee, who gave her name as Lara. \u201cThey said: the lawyers can\u2019t help you. Nobody can help you here.\u201d The MEPs, from the leftwing coalition European United Left\u2013Nordic Green Left, said the deal had come at great ethical cost.  \u201cI cannot see how an agreement such as the EU-Turkey deal, which builds upon such deportations, can be legitimate or legal in any way,\u201d said Ernst, an MEP from Die Linke, a leftwing German party. The MEPs\u2019 report also cited refugee testimony from southern Turkey, where Syrians claimed to have been shot at when crossing the border from their war-torn country. Hussein told the MEPs: \u201cI was approaching the border with my 11-year-old cousin when the Turkish [gendarmerie] shot me when I was about 500 metres away from the border, and the bullet crossed both my thighs \u2013 only muscles, no bone.\u201d In a separate report released on Tuesday, Human Rights Watch claimed that at least five Syrians had been killed while trying to reach Turkey in the past two months. Turkey says it neither shoots people on the border, nor deports refugees back to Syria, and maintains it operates an open-door policy towards Syrians.  \u201cTurkey is the largest refugee-hosting country in the world,\u201d the Turkish foreign ministry has said. \u201cIt is out of the question that the Syrians are encouraged to return to their countries voluntarily or forcibly. Turkey is bound by its obligations under international law and is determined to continue providing protection to the Syrians who have fled from violence and instability in their country.\u201d The EU has consistently maintained that deportees to Turkey were being returned in line with international law.  \u201cAccording to our information, all those persons who were returned were aware of their rights and had the opportunity to claim asylum,\u201d an EU spokesperson has said.",
