  "body": "Yesterday the leaders were dogged by questions about what a hung parliament would mean, with neither side ruling out governing if such an event occurred. Both leaders were also criticised for their lacklustre performances in the second leaders debate. Thankfully, last night\u2019s Q&A program contained a bit more excitement, with Jacqui Lambie, Nick Xenophon, the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, Labor\u2019s Terri Butler and the Liberal party\u2019s Steve Ciobo giving much less scripted performances. Di Natale told the audience:  The debate was a snooze-fest, wasn\u2019t it? It\u2019s an hour of our life we won\u2019t get back.  Many have said the same after watching an episode of Q&A. But Ciobo bit back, telling Di Natale that he was \u201carrogant\u201d:  I will tell you why the two majors are the two majors. It\u2019s because we share values and we share a policy platform that most Australians identify with. Richard, most Australians don\u2019t identify with Greens policies. They\u2019re not in favour of legalising drugs, they\u2019re not in favour of opening up our borders to bring as many people as possible from overseas.  Butler added: \u201cYou were not at the debate because you are not vying to become the prime minister\u201d. The big picture The ABC reports that the Liberal party has been left spooked by a poll published in the Australian on Monday. That poll suggested the Coalition has suffered large enough swings against it in two-party-preferred terms in Queensland, Western Australia and NSW to lose the election. The ABC reports that Liberal MPs blame, in part, a downturn in the WA economy:  The ABC has spoken to several Liberal MPs who are concerned and surprised with the apparent size of the swing. They attributed it to the downturn in WA\u2019s economy and voters being disaffected with the state\u2019s premier, Colin Barnett. One WA Liberal MP said recent speculation about Mr Barnett\u2019s leadership \u201cdidn\u2019t help\u201d. There is a view within the WA Labor party that the state\u2019s voters have made up their minds and the ALP should pick up at least three lower house seats and up to two in the senate.  But, according to Fairfax, political strategists for both major parties believe the Coalition is on track to lose about 12 seats at the July 2 poll, which would return the Turnbull government, albeit with a reduced second-term majority.  The prime minister\u2019s home state of NSW has emerged as the weakest link for the Coalition and the state where the most seats could change hands, but the ALP\u2019s push to claim as many as 11 Queensland seats of the 21 required for Labor to form government is flagging. Underscoring the vulnerability of Coalition seats in Sydney\u2019s west, Labor will formally launch its campaign in Penrith, in the Liberal-held marginal seat of Lindsay, on June 19.  Meanwhile the Financial Review reports that with this week\u2019s gross domestic product figures expected to show the economy slowed to a below-trend 2.7% in the first quarter, the treasurer, Scott Morrison, will ramp up his attacks on Labor\u2019s opposition to corporate tax cuts. Morrison told the Fin:  This is a very sensitive time for the Australian economy. Wherever the figures land, the policy objective doesn\u2019t change \u2013 and that\u2019s about securing growth in this economy. You can\u2019t increase investment by taxing it more.\u201d  In a similar vein, the Australian reports that Shorten\u2019s \u201cunrelenting attack\u201d on the Coalition\u2019s proposed business tax cuts \u201cis driving a deep wedge between the opposition and corporate Australia\u201d.  As the opposition leader yesterday declared he would not be \u201cdictated to by business\u201d, four of the nation\u2019s most respected business leaders called for a higher standard of political debate, questioning Labor\u2019s divisive election tactics. Former Business Council of Australia president Graham Bradley warned that Labor\u2019s recent policies gave few in business confidence the party had learned its lesson from the mining and carbon tax \u201cdebacles\u201d. Wesfarmers and Woodside chairman Michael Chaney lamented the \u201cscaremongering and divisive approach that\u2019s taken in modern political campaigns\u201d that was pitting \u201cbattlers versus well-off, rich versus poor, haves versus have-nots, rather than working to achieve a greater pie for all\u201d.  On the campaign trail Bill Shorten will campaign in Queensland for a second day in a row. Guardian Australia\u2019s Lenore Taylor writes that he will announce that $1bn from the Turnbull government\u2019s $5bn northern Australia infrastructure facility will be repurposed for tourism projects in the north under Labor. In north Queensland, Labor is fighting for the seats of Dawson, Capricornia, Leichhardt and the independent-held seat of Kennedy. Turnbull will remain in Sydney and commit $20m towards research for children with untreatable cancers.

According to Fairfax:  Luke Howarth defeated now-Queensland attorney general Yvette D\u2019Ath to claim the seat in 2013. It\u2019s the Coalition\u2019s second-most marginal seat in Australia and will be one of the first to fall should there be a swing to Labor. The electorate stretches north to Burpengary, east to Redcliffe, south to Aspley and west to North Lakes. Howarth has performed well locally, but it\u2019s hard to see Petrie\u2019s dissatisfaction with the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd era flowing through another electoral cycle.  And another thing(s) Some more details about the central coast man that NSW police have charged over allegedly posting racist comments on the Facebook page of outgoing Labor senator Nova Peris. Woy Woy-based chiropractor and osteopath Chris Nelson was arrested on Monday afternoon following an investigation by Brisbane police, after Peris shared the offensive post through her social media accounts. Part of the message said: \u201cYou were only endorsed by Juliar because you were black. Go back to the bush and suck on witchety grubs and yams.\u201d Peris responded in Facebook post:  I\u2019ll continue to wear ochre on my face just like my people have done for thousands of years! My skin is my pride.  Malarndirri McCarthy, a former minister in the Northern Territory government and ABC presenter, has won preselection to replace Peris. Trust the Twitterati to hold the pollies to account on Q&A    \"Our values are so different!\" protests @terrimbutler (except on concentration camps, data retention, jailing journos, going to war\u2026) #qanda\u2014 ABC News Intern (@ABCnewsIntern) May 30, 2016      Could the Liberal and Labor panelists be anymore patronising to the their fellow elected reps? Such a misguided sense of entitlement. #QandA\u2014 Jill Stark (@jillastark) May 30, 2016      Funny that a lot of men are tweeting that @terrimbutler was too \"aggressive\" or \"combative\" on #qanda tonight.
