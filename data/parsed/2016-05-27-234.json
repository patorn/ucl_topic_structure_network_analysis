But look around, and you will soon become aware that a town versus gown divide persists in many university towns. Universities are always looking for ways to combat tension between the academic and non-academic communities. And many students are also intent on bridging the gap, by volunteering or even setting up their own charities, to create sustainable networks.  Charity begins at your home away from home. If it\u2019s broke, fix it Hannah Gillespie, a fourth-year medical student at Queen\u2019s University Belfast, founded the charity SwotUp with three other medics. They had noticed that although Northern Irish students excel at GCSE and A-level, that potential doesn\u2019t correlate with successful medical school applications.  \u201cWe had experienced this problem ourselves and recognised that we could make a real difference for the students coming after us,\u201d says Gillespie.   Related: Why students should volunteer while at university    They devised a course to help with applications, which included mock interviews. Running the course costs money, so it\u2019s ticketed, but students who receive the Educational Maintenance Allowance, which still exists in Northern Ireland, pay a discounted price of \u00a330. Gillespie lists the charity\u2019s multiple beneficiaries: the applicants who take the course, the medical students who deliver the course and gain experience, and the two other charities to whom SwotUp donate all profit. Last year, that was over \u00a33500. It\u2019s a win-win-win situation. Global outlook, local needs Another medical student, Wigs Bateman from Sheffield University, set up Medsin in 1995. The now-well-established charity has a wide reach: its motto is \u201cglobal health, local issue\u201d. Despite its international scope, it has also done its bit to bring academic and non-academic communities together. One of its branches at Sheffield is the Teddy Bear Doctors, through which students help young patients feel more comfortable about hospital visits. The university seeks to \u201cincrease awareness of local community issues among students\u201d though charity work, and Medsin helps it to fulfil that aim. The secretary of the Teddy Bear Doctors, Ellie Lee, enthuses: \u201cWe\u2019ve had really good feedback from parents, children and doctors.\u201d Projects like these, she says, improve the image of university students, and break down stereotypes of young people being thoughtless. And the experience also helps students to stand out in competitive fields of employment.   Networking While SwotUp battled to raise funds initially, it has never had any problem attracting volunteers. There are networks that exist to help students looking to volunteer. Student Hubs is a charity founded in 2007 by students for students and brings local volunteer projects and university societies together.

Graham Read, its spokesperson, says it has a \u201cdouble benefit model\u201d, which means all programmes have to be beneficial for both the student volunteers and the community.  Last year, it put on over 600 events, involving 93 universities. Right now, it is teaching kids to code in Bristol and setting up reading classes for homeless people in Oxford. Slow progress Giving back takes time. Ceri Davies is a development manager at the University of Brighton and has worked with On Our Doorsteps, which supports charitable projects in the university\u2019s community. She stresses that it \u201ctakes time to invest in relationships\u201d and \u201cto develop a presence in community life\u201d. Putting the right infrastructure in place isn\u2019t glamorous. During SwotUp\u2019s creation, Gillespie recalls a lot of \u201ctedious behind the scenes work\u201d. It\u2019s a good time time to put those organisational skills gleaned at university to use. Davies says it\u2019s crucial that students go to local meetings, meet new people and explain the project. There are no short cuts to building relationships. Starting a charity isn\u2019t a piece of cake \u2013 though it helps if cake is actually included. Beth Thomas-Hancock, the manager of the University of Brighton\u2019s volunteering service, says food \u201csets the tone on welcoming different people, it can remove barriers and everyone can contribute\u201d.
