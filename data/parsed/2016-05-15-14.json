  "body": "The game was not a classic and, inexplicably, scores of supporters were still outside trying to collect tickets when Danielle Carter scored the only goal 18 minutes in, but it was difficult to come away from Wembley on Saturday without being optimistic for the future of women\u2019s football. A record crowd of 32,912 \u2013 large enough to mean hundreds were still queuing at the national stadium\u2019s east ticket office at kick-off, with the west office shut \u2013 bore witness to an event devoid of cynicism, a competitive final and, for those not left outside, a goal befitting any showpiece.   Related: Arsenal\u2019s Danielle Carter sinks Chelsea in Women\u2019s FA Cup final    It was important to remember among all the excitement that this fixture used to take place in the less glamorous surroundings of Dunstable Town, Glanford Park and Sincil Bank. When the domestic highlight of women\u2019s football ventured to Old Trafford in 1989, the crowd failed to reach four figures. Only three years ago, when Arsenal defeated Bristol Academy, 4,988 turned up. The landscape has altered to a remarkable degree. Fara Williams, the gifted Arsenal and England midfielder, spoke beforehand of how she would play Wembley \u2013 the street game \u2013 when growing up but dreaming of playing at the ground itself seemed too far-fetched. Yet the most important thing, as Emma Hayes, the Chelsea manager, was at pains to point out in defeat, is that Arsenal are no longer in a position to dominate as before. Long gone are the days when Arsenal, claiming their 14th FA Cup here, were scoring four and five on a yearly basis in finals lacking an edge. Instead they were the outsiders against last year\u2019s league and Cup winners, leaving a sense that this was the sweetest win of all for the country\u2019s most decorated club. \u201cThe past is the past but now we must look to the future because the future is different,\u201d the Arsenal manager, Pedro Mart\u00ednez Losa, said. \u201cFootball is evolving and we have to evolve back. It\u2019s going to be more competitive in future so we can\u2019t say we will win every league and cup. But the good thing in future is that it will be more competitive.\u201d   Related: Arsenal 1-0  Chelsea: Women's FA Cup final - as it happened    It might sound strange for a team who have won nine of the past 13 Cup finals but this is a period of reconstruction for Arsenal. They sit third in the Super League after an indifferent start to the campaign and getting in front of Chelsea and Manchester City will be onerous. The top two qualify for the Champions League. \u201cIn the club we have a clear idea,\u201d Losa said. \u201cWe know how more difficult it is to win now but this is a transition moment. We need to build a project and develop step by step. Obviously winning is helping for the mentality of the players. We must use experience like today to create our philosophy and develop our Arsenal way to play.\u201d Amid the Wembley glow it would be negligent to ignore that strides need to be made in other departments to continue the game\u2019s furtherance, of course. Losa referred more than once to how Arsenal were able to execute their game plan on a good pitch \u2013 a nod, perhaps, to the sub-standard surfaces they can occasionally come across. \u201cIt helped us combine better in the middle and get in behind them,\u201d he added. Certainly his wide players enjoyed an extra yard of space. The pace of Carter and Asisat Oshoala, complemented by the central figurehead of 37-year-old Kelly Smith as part of a three-pronged attack, ensured Arsenal had all the best chances and Chelsea\u2019s defence struggled in the first half, with their experienced centre-half Niamh Fahey not fit enough to be more than a substitute. Hayes said she would \u201cshut the world down\u201d, such was the pain of relinquishing the trophy, but admitted Arsenal were deserved winners. \u201cThere are an awful lot of teams that would have loved to be in our position to compete for it,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s an achievement in itself. The fact we\u2019re not victorious is disappointing but we are aware we are competing for the Continental Cup, working towards progress in the Champions League and looking to retain our league title.\u201d And above all they are ensuring that the sport\u2019s upward trajectory continues. \u201cI\u2019m no longer speaking to just one journalist after a game,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cWomen\u2019s football today isn\u2019t what it was 10 years ago.\u201d",
