  "body": "If imagining the NSW Origin selectors\u2019 meeting conjures an image of a round table of haggard faces, an overflowing ashtray and a knee-deep drift of crumpled notepaper, the Queensland equivalent brings to mind a convivial afternoon drink in the sunshine and a single beer coaster on which is written a list of names in permanent marker. A few of them may be followed by question marks, sure, but you suspect that\u2019s only so that the selectors can provide evidence of work \u2013 and thus claim their bar tab as a tax deduction.   Related: Queensland name two debutants for State of Origin opener    Accordingly, a new era in Maroons football \u2013 the post-Meninga era \u2013 has begun with an old look. Just one incumbent available for selection missed out when the Queensland Origin squad was announced on Tuesday evening; Jacob Lillyman was the unlucky player. The two debutants named, Corey Oates and Justin O\u2019Neill, are there to fill backline spots left vacant by the retirement of Justin Hodges and injury to Will Chambers. Why would new coach Kevin Walters stick so solidly to the old guard? \u201cWhy not?\u201d is a better question. Certainly the successful core of Walters\u2019 team is ageing but who was he going to drop just because of their dates of birth? Johnathan Thurston? Cameron Smith? Greg Inglis? Cooper Cronk? Matt Scott? Corey Parker? These players are in form, or never far from it, and some of them are all-time greats. Barring injury they pick themselves. Only a convincing series loss, perhaps, or an epidemic of arthritis, might usher in wholesale changes. It\u2019s a similar scenario with Maroon stayers like Nate Myles, Sam Thaiday, Matt Gillett and Darius Boyd \u2013 who will play fullback with Inglis returning to the centres to partner O\u2019Neill. Considering his club form cannot even please his grandfather, it was rumoured that Myles might be one old timer to face the chop but loyalty has again been shown. This means Myles, who made his debut in the 2006 series, is set to again partner Matt Scott in the front row for next Wednesday night\u2019s series opener in Sydney. Smith will play in between them when he makes his 37th appearance, beating Darren Lockyer\u2019s record. That\u2019s one experienced trio in one experienced forward pack \u2013 a pack NSW will, as usual, give themselves a chance of dominating, even though they so rarely managed it through the Meninga era. Loyalty has also been shown to interchange forward Josh McGuire, who made his Origin debut last year, winger Dane Gagai and Josh Papalii, who played off the interchange bench in Queensland\u2019s stunning 52-6 win in last year\u2019s deciding game three at Suncorp. Utility Michael Morgan and backrower Aiden Guerra will also get another shot at NSW, Guerra from the back row, Morgan off the interchange bench. Queensland\u2019s depth hits home when you see someone like Morgan as a bench player (and with other Cowboys players Gavin Cooper and Kyle Feldt not picked at all). The Cowboys five-eighth would be among the first Blues named had he grown up south of the Tweed. Or south of Macksville, NSW, even. The Maroons selectors\u2019 job appears to have been an easy one, but to be fair it was made somewhat easier by a 2016 Origin ban placed on, among others, Ben Hunt, Anthony Milford, Dylan Napa and Valentine Holmes. All would have surely come into consideration had they not been censured for breaking curfew in the Maroons\u2019 Emerging Origin camp in February. Any Blues supporter who thinks life will get considerably easier when Smith, Thurston, Inglis, Cronk and co. finally call an end to their reign of terror should take pause at these names, and others like Jake Granville, Cameron Munster, Moses Mbye and Dally Cherry-Evans. If NSW doesn\u2019t seem to know their halves combination from game to game, Queensland would appear to know theirs for the next 10 years. All in all there are no real surprises to the Maroons squad. Then again, there haven\u2019t been for years. It doesn\u2019t seem to have done Queensland any harm.",
