  "body": "Candidates across the Philippines are making their final appeals as Filipinos living in the country get ready to vote on Monday 9 May. Around 1.2 million people working abroad and registered as overseas voters have been able to vote since 9 April.  The main contest for president and vice president has candidates ranging from former US citizen Grace Poe; President Benigno \u2018Noynoy\u2019 Aquino\u2019s choice Manuel \u2018Mar\u2019 Roxas; and Ferdinand \u2018Bongbong\u2019 Marcos Jr the late dictator\u2019s son. Leading the poll for the presidency is Rodrigo \u2018Digong\u2019 Duterte who has been making headlines with his comments about rape and his promises to kill criminals (his children being no exception). Described as \u201cthe Punisher\u201d in 2002 by Time magazine, the support for the mayor of Davao suggests the desire for a change in the way the country is run. Despite recent allegations about his finances, the outsider\u2019s hard-hitting, can-do approach to politics is appealing to those desiring an end to the same types of politicians.  Whether you live in the Philippines or are an overseas voter we\u2019d like to hear from you. How do you feel about the election? Who do you think will win and why?
