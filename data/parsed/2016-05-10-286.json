  "body": "The Conservative civil war over Europe has come to a head, as Boris Johnson accused the prime minister of undermining public trust over immigration before being rebuked for his own comments about the European Union\u2019s impact on Ukraine.  Johnson, a leading Tory figure in the out campaign, and Cameron, who is leading the battle to remain, locked horns in speeches to mark the start of the final phase of the EU referendum campaign. Johnson ridiculed claims made by Cameron in a speech earlier in the day that there was a risk to peace in Europe if Britain left the EU, arguing that he did not expect \u201cworld war three\u201d to break out. Meanwhile, the former London mayor was described as a \u201cPutin apologist\u201d by Jack Straw for claiming that EU policy had led to \u201cbig trouble\u201d in Ukraine. The interventions intensified the battle raging within the Tory party over Britain\u2019s EU membership. Former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith is preparing to further criticise Cameron in a speech on Tuesday morning. In an interview with the Sun published on Tuesday, Duncan Smith accuses Cameron of having allowed Germany to \u201cveto\u201d key parts of his EU reform renegotiation. Duncan Smith said Berlin exercised the \u201cultimate power\u201d over what changes the prime minister sought from Brussels and was allowed to block the idea of a cap on foreign workers coming to the EU. He said a key demand was ditched, at the behest of Berlin, from the draft of a speech by Cameron just hours before it was due to be delivered. \u201cIt\u2019s like they were sitting in a room, even when they were not there. There was a spare chair for them \u2013 called the German chair. They have had a de facto veto over everything,\u201d he told the newspaper. In what is likely to be an impassioned speech, Duncan Smith will also argue that uncontrolled migration is hitting the poorest in British society by piling pressure onto schools and hospitals, and claim Cameron has failed to achieve any significant reform with his EU renegotiation. The unrest comes as Vote Leave and the Labour In campaign prepare to go on the road with battle bus tours throughout the final 44 days before the referendum.     Iain Duncan Smith is to make a speech arguing that migration is hitting the poorest in British society. Photograph: i-Images    Cameron used his speech to hit out at a cabinet colleague, Michael Gove, who he accused of being reckless and irresponsible for suggesting that the UK could leave the single market as well as the EU. However, it was the prime minister\u2019s decision to warn of potential European conflict, by asking if peace and stability can be \u201cassured beyond any shadow of doubt\u201d, that triggered a backlash among senior Conservative MPs and ministers.  The justice minister, Dominic Raab, said the prime minister\u2019s speech showed the remain camp had shifted from Britain being unable to survive to suggesting the EU would fall apart without the UK. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty desperate stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a house is on fire, most people would get out and try to douse the flames from there, not stay in and risk being burned.\u201d Graham Brady, who chairs the 1922 committee of Tory backbenchers, said it was the undemocratic EU that threatened stability, while Bernard Jenkin MP accused his leader of \u201cparroting propaganda\u201d. Johnson also accused Cameron of achieving nothing in his EU renegotiation, and added: \u201cIt is deeply corrosive of popular trust in democracy that every year UK politicians tell the public that they can cut immigration to the tens of thousands \u2013 and then find that they miss their targets by hundreds of thousands.\u201d He also said that he found it \u201coffensive, insulting, irrelevant and positively cretinous\u201d for critics to describe him as a little Englander, before singing a verse of Ode to Joy in German.           Boris Johnson sets out case for leaving EU ... then sings in German    But his diversion into the EU\u2019s role in the Ukraine crisis sparked controversy. \u201cIf you want an example of EU policymaking on the hoof and EU pretensions to running defence policy that have caused real trouble, then look at what has happened in the Ukraine,\u201d he said. When asked what Cameron thought of Johnson\u2019s comments, his official spokesman responded: \u201cThe PM is clear the annexation of Crimea was brought about [by] Russia alone and it is EU sanctions that are having a positive effect.\u201d Other politicians who joined Jack Straw in criticising Boris Johnson as a Putin apologist included former Swedish prime minister Carl Bildt and Labour MP Chuka Umunna. \u201cBoris Johnson has plumbed new depths today by joining the likes of [Ukip leader, Nigel] Farage, [France\u2019s National Front president, Marine] Le Pen and [Netherland\u2019s Party for Freedom chair, Geert] Wilders in blaming the EU, rather than Vladimir Putin, for what has happened in Ukraine,\u201d said Straw. Bildt waded into the row on Twitter, describing Johnson as \u201cignorant of the fact on Ukraine, EU and Russia\u201d. \u201cApologist for Putin,\u201d he added. Tom Valasek, the Slovakian ambassador to Nato, published a previous article in which Johnson had blamed Russia for the controversy. And Polish politician Rados\u0142aw Sikorskiasked if Johnson wanted to side with Barack Obama \u2013who has announced his desire for the UK to remain in the EU \u2013 or Putin. Supporters from the leave campaign also waded in, with a Vote Leave spokesman saying: \u201cYou can criticise the EU\u2019s inept and often bumbling foreign policy record without accepting the legitimacy of Putin\u2019s illegal annexation of the Crimea and aggressive campaign of fear and violence towards its neighbours.\u201d    I'm sorry to say, but @BorisJohnson is totally ignorant of the facts on Ukraine, EU and Russia. Apologist for Putin. https://t.co/awLF4wqAdN\u2014 Carl Bildt (@carlbildt) May 9, 2016      Looks as if @BorisJohnson missed that EU/Ukraine agreement was the wish of all four Presidents and 14 PM\u2019s of Ukraine since independence.\u2014 Carl Bildt (@carlbildt) May 9, 2016    Alexander Temerko, the Ukrainian-born British politician and Conservative party donor, said the backlash against Johnson was misguided. \u201cFar from being a \u2018Putin apologist\u2019, as some have put it, Boris was raising a legitimate concern about the role of Europe in the world. I am saying this as someone who has in-depth knowledge of the situation in Ukraine... The fact of the matter is that the EU has not been strong enough in supporting Ukraine in the face of Putin\u2019s aggression.\u201d Duncan Smith\u2019s speech on Tuesday morning will focus on claiming that Britain\u2019s membership of the EU drives social injustice. He is expected to argue that the middle classes can be more relaxed about migration because they are not hurt by it. Instead, it is the working classes that pay the price of unfettered immigration, he will argue. Duncan Smith also believes that migrants are not incentivised to travel to the UK because of a generous welfare system but high wages, which are boosted by the \u201cnational living wage\u201d. Despite his cabinet position at the time, he believed the prime minister\u2019s renegotiation, limiting access to benefits, was untested and would not reduce the number of new arrivals.",
