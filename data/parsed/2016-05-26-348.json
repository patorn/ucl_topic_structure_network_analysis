The Australian prime minister moved to assuage evident anger from the Indonesian government after the comments by Joyce, his deputy, on Wednesday night. During a debate on regional policy. Joyce said: \u201cMight I remind you when we closed down the live animal export industry, it was around about the same time that we started seeing a lot of people arriving in boats in Australia \u2026 I think it\u2019s absolutely the case that we created extreme bad will with Indonesia when we closed down the live animal exports.\u201d An Indonesian government spokesperson said: \u201cThere is no link between the policy of live export ban and the increased numbers of boats into Australia. \u201cIndonesia was and remains committed to being a part of the regional solution to the common challenge we are facing of people smuggling.\u201d    Dep PM @Barnaby_Joyce has linked 2011 decision to suspend live exports with more asylum seekers @abcnews #ausvoteshttps://t.co/fmy3IG2oR0\u2014 Matthew Doran (@MattDoran91) May 25, 2016    On Thursday Joyce sought several times to play down his remarks. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that this caused the Indonesians to start sending people across. I never suggested that. What I did clearly suggest that it made it difficult, it gave a real degree of difficulty in how we negotiate with Indonesia.\u201d At a press conference in Rockhampton, Turnbull was asked about Joyce\u2019s comment it was \u201cbleeding obvious\u201d it had been an insult by the former Labor government under Julia Gillard to cut off Indonesia\u2019s supply of meat. Turnbull said: \u201cYou\u2019re being unfair to my good friend, the deputy prime minister here. Let me be quite clear about this. There is no link between the Indonesian government and people smuggling.\u201d Turnbull described the live cattle ban as an \u201cincredible affront to Indonesia\u201d. \u201cNow, the only point that I want to stress is that our cooperation with Indonesia, in terms of stopping people smuggling, is very, very strong. They are as committed to stopping that trade as we are, and indeed all the other countries that are party to the Bali process.\u201d   According to Fairfax Media, Indonesia\u2019s former foreign minister Marty Natalegawa said any suggestion of a link between the ban and people smuggling was \u201cpatently false\u201d. \u201cAt best, it represents an over-analysis of the subject,\u201d said Natalegawa, who was foreign affairs minister at the time. \u201cWorse still, it is shocking to suggest that the Indonesian government would risk the safety and lives of innocent asylum seekers in making the treacherous journey to Australia simply to make a point.\u201d Joyce\u2019s opponent in New England, the independent Tony Windsor, said: \u201cWhat Joyce did last night was prove that he is unfit to be in a leaders\u2019 debate. He is unfit to be a leader. He has insulted Indonesia, our nearest neighbour.\u201d Windsor said Joyce had alleged that Indonesia would put people on the water in retaliation for the temporary live export ban.    Related: Live animal export rules to be reviewed by Productivity Commission inquiry    \u201cThis statement will do far more damage than anything that minister [Bill] Ludwig did at the time.\u201d Windsor called on Turnbull to clear up the statement by saying \u201cthis bloke just had a brain explosion, we apologise for him\u201d. Speaking on ABC News Breakfast on Thursday the Greens leader, Richard Di Natale, attacked Joyce\u2019s comments, saying it was a \u201cremarkable statement\u201d that suggested \u201cas a result of the actions that were taken, that somehow the Indonesian government were responsible for orchestrating refugees coming to Australia\u201d.  \u201cWhat it does is it compromises the relationship that we have with one of our most important trading partners and it just shows that here we are with this very toxic debate towards refugees and asylum seekers and we have a desperate deputy prime minister who tries to link that with the live animal export trade. \u201cTo effectively accuse the Indonesian government of deliberately orchestrating the movement of people \u2013 it\u2019s staggering.\u201d Asked about Joyce\u2019s clarification, Di Natale said it was \u201cnot at all\u201d reasonable to say the export ban had affected the relationship and Joyce\u2019s comments would do \u201cfar more damage than a domestic policy response that was the right response to live animal exports\u201d. On Thursday the treasurer, Scott Morrison, rejected the claim Joyce had suggested the live export ban caused the increase in refugee boats.  \u201cI don\u2019t accept that is the link that Barnaby made last night,\u201d Morrison told AM host Michael Brissenden. \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s what Barnaby has suggested \u2013 that\u2019s what you\u2019ve implied and what others have implied. \u201cWhat I do know is this \u2013 when Labor made the changes to the live cattle trade, overnight, in response to the Greens\u2019 revolt they got amongst their own support base, it cost Australian jobs.\u201d On Thursday, the minister for northern Australia, Josh Frydenberg, said: \u201cBarnaby Joyce was making the obvious point that you don\u2019t go and insult a most important and critical neighbour as Indonesia by undermining their food security, by banning, after a television show, a $1.5bn industry.   Related: Barnaby Joyce links live export ban to increase in asylum seeker boats    \u201cWhat\u2019s he\u2019s made clear is that that [the ban on] live animal exports ... was a disaster and, at the same time, we were seeking greater cooperation with Indonesia on the very difficult diplomatic and strategic issue of border protection. \u201cNow we\u2019ve cleaned up both issues: one, we\u2019ve ensured the live animal export trade continues to strengthen and provide food security to Indonesia and now we\u2019ve got much better cooperation with Indonesia and been successful at stopping the boats.\u201d",
