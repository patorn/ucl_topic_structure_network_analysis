Related: Chinese official tells Hong Kong not to seek independence    But when China\u2019s third most powerful man stepped off an Air China Boeing 747 at Hong Kong\u2019s international airport this week he appeared to have come bearing a message of peace. \u201cThe weather is nice today. The weather is very good in both Beijing and Hong Kong,\u201d Zhang Dejiang told reporters, adding that he had come to see, listen and speak. On Wednesday night, Zhang reiterated those glad tidings at a 10-course banquet at which guests were welcomed with pan-fried dumplings, steamed garoupa and an unusually conciliatory speech. \u201cWe would like to listen to the opinions and suggestions from all walks of life and communicate in various ways for the good of Hong Kong,\u201d Zhang, 69, told the audience. \u201cProlonged wrangling will not benefit Hong Kong, it will only adversely affect the economy.\u201d Veteran members of Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy movement reacted with cautious optimism to the address, which comes at a time of growing political tension in the former British colony. This year Hong Kong has witnessed one of the worst outbreaks of unrest in decades, outrage over the suspected abduction of a local bookseller by mainland security agents, increasingly vocal calls for independence, and the foundation of a new political party whose leaders have vowed to escalate their battle for democracy.  Democratic party chairwoman Emily Lau was one of four pro-democracy politicians given a rare audience with Zhang at a cocktail reception held before Wednesday\u2019s banquet.     Chinese leaders have never met with the pro-democracy legislators in such a way.  Emily Lau, Democratic party chairwoman     \u201cIt was unprecedented,\u201d Lau told the Guardian. \u201cI think the Chinese leaders have never met with the pro-democracy legislators in such a way. It was a very close encounter. I was standing right next to him. Actually, at first I thought he didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d Lau said she had been encouraged by the brief conversation during which she and her colleagues \u201cbluntly but politely\u201d expressed their anger over issues including China\u2019s meddling in Hong Kong\u2019s affairs, its refusal to grant democratic concessions and its alleged kidnapping of a bookseller who specialised in books criticising the Communist party elite. \u201cHe said, \u2018OK let\u2019s hear what you have to say,\u2019\u201d Lau said. \u201cSo I immediately leapt in and told him that Hong Kong people are very worried and are very agitated and some feel very desperate and hopeless because the governance is so bad, [chief executive] CY Leung is not capable of running Hong Kong and Beijing is also bad in not allowing us to have genuine democratic elections.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s got a reputation as being very hardline and very intransigent,\u201d Lau said of her Communist party interlocutor.  \u201cBut ... the way he spoke yesterday he didn\u2019t give the impression that he was here to lecture us like the old-day emperor talking to its subservient little people. I don\u2019t think we got that impression.\u201d     Pro-democracy protesters hold a yellow umbrella and a banner near the venue where Zhang Dejiang gave a keynote speech to Hong Kong\u2019s ruling elite on Wednesday. Photograph: Alex Hofford/EPA    Alan Leong, the chairman of Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy Civic party, said Zhang\u2019s visit had left the impression \u201cthat he is really trying to mend some of the broken relationship and [wanted] to project an image that he is quite willing to listen\u201d. Leong, who also met the Communist party leader, said he sensed Beijing was anxious at how Hong Kong politics had become increasingly radicalised in the wake of the 79-day \u201cumbrella movement\u201d protests in 2014.  China\u2019s leaders needed to understand the solution was dialogue and political reform, not arresting or pressuring its opponents, he said.  \u201cThings will get worse if there is nothing positive coming from the state leadership and Hong Kong people will continue to feel quite hopeless and helpless,\u201d Leong predicted. \u201cThen all those ideas about Hong Kong independence and the aggressive localism movement will gain more momentum I would think.\u201d In a sign of the complex and increasingly toxic relationship between Beijing and Hong Kong, Zhang\u2019s three-day \u201cinspection tour\u201d was the first to China\u2019s \u201cspecial administrative region\u201d by a top leader since 2012. Demonstrators greeted Zhang with banners reading: \u201cGo to hell!\u201d and \u201cEnd Chinese dictatorship!\u201d   Related: Hong Kong glues bricks to pavements as top Beijing official makes visit    Paving stones were glued down as part of a massive security operation designed to shield him from protest and injury.  On Thursday several prominent umbrella movement protest leaders, including Joshua Wong and Oscar Lai, were detained by police as they tried to block a road along which Zhang\u2019s motorcade was passing.  In an editorial before Zhang\u2019s arrival, Hong Kong\u2019s South China Morning Post urged pro-democracy legislators to seize Beijing\u2019s rare olive branch. \u201cIt is a significant breakthrough that could only have been made on Beijing\u2019s initiative. It is a positive signal that Beijing thinks meaningful communication with moderate pan-democrats remains possible,\u201d it said. The Global Times, a Communist party-controlled tabloid, took an almost identical line, describing Zhang\u2019s decision to engage with pan-democrats as \u201can act of good faith\u201d from Beijing. \u201cThis was an unprecedented interaction, which has provided hope for some people,\u201d an editorial in the newspaper claimed. For all the cautious optimism among pro-democracy lawmakers, members of the umbrella movement protest generation reacted to Zhang\u2019s advances with suspicion. \u201cI do not see any softer stance \u2013 it is just Communist tactics,\u201d said Billy Fung Jing-en, the former head of Hong Kong University\u2019s student union.  \u201cThe Communist party can have a soft line and a hard approach with its enemies \u2013 it is just strategy. I was not impressed and I do not think it represents any shift in policy from Beijing,\u201d Fung added.  Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a political scientist from Hong Kong\u2019s Baptist University, said Zhang\u2019s conciliatory tone was probably an attempt to calm tensions before key September elections for the Legislative Council at which China hoped pro-Beijing candidates would come out on top.  \u201cThey are trying a more approachable style but nothing has changed at all, really,\u201d Cabestan said.  \u201cZhang Dejiang has accepted to see the pan-democrats \u2026 He also has refrained from attacking or declaring illegal the newly formed pro-independence groups in Hong Kong. But this does not mean that there have been any concessions made.\u201d Speaking on Wednesday night, Zhang did little to suggest Beijing would relax its attitude towards electoral reform or street protests against Communist party rule. \u201cNo one can override the law, and no offenders can evade legal jurisdiction with any excuse \u2026 Society should severely condemn those actions which challenge the rule of law,\u201d he said, blaming calls for independence on a \u201cvery small number of people\u201d. Maya Wang, a Hong Kong-based activist for Human Rights Watch, also questioned whether Beijing was really modifying its \u201chardline position\u201d towards the former colony.  Zhang had offered no hint that Beijing might allow a debate over political reform to restart, Wang pointed out. \u201cSo is the softer stance rhetoric or a fundamental change?\u201d  Lau, the Democratic party chairwoman, said she believed her complaints had been heard \u201cloudly and clearly\u201d but admitted nobody was expecting a sudden U-turn from Beijing following Zhang\u2019s visit. \u201cI don\u2019t expect him to immediately issue a new policy \u2026 but if he would just take our views back to Beijing, talk to Xi Jinping and others and if he would come up with certain things \u2026 [such as] setting up a channel for regular communication with the pro-democracy people then I think that would be good.\u201d Was change in the air? \u201cMaybe,\u201d Lau said. \u201cWe don\u2019t know. We have to see. I don\u2019t think we have such high hopes but they should know that the way Hong Kong is being run right now is not OK.\u201d",
