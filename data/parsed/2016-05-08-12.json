  "body": "It is only a short step across the A316 from The Stoop to Twickenham but Exeter are on the verge of the biggest leap in their history. Keep playing this well and the notion of the Chiefs becoming champions of England a mere six years on from their Championship promotion will not be remotely fanciful. \u201cWe want to go all the way,\u201d their England winger Jack Nowell said. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked hard all season to get into this position. It\u2019s important to us not to let it slip now.\u201d The 10 imperious tries his side put past a sluggish Harlequins on Saturday are just the latest sign that Devon\u2019s finest have the Aviva Premiership final this month firmly in their sights. No team scored more tries or conceded fewer points in the regular season and only one side \u2013 Saracens \u2013 has beaten them at Sandy Park in the past 16 months. Given they defeated their semi\u2011final opponents Wasps 24-3 a week ago, any sense of West Country inferiority has long since disappeared. Nor is the Chiefs\u2019 sage head coach, Rob Baxter, in the mood to settle for gallant runner-up status, having spent the past month hammering home the message that anything is now attainable. \u201cWe started saying five or six weeks ago that the season\u2019s been so good we didn\u2019t want it to end. That\u2019s the sort of season you want. I genuinely think the whole squad are all enjoying it. It will be a bit disappointing when it all finishes.\u201d Both Baxter and Nowell reckon it now requires an extremely good side to upset them at home and the tempo of their game is blowing away sides displaying even a hint of weariness. Wasps, at least, will be forewarned but, having already lost home and away to the Chiefs in the league, will need their forwards to get an early grip. \u201cApart from the loss to Saracens we haven\u2019t lost at home, including in the Champions Cup,\u201d Baxter said. \u201cI would be disappointed if that home spirit doesn\u2019t continue.\u201d There are faint echoes of Leicester City in the way Exeter have challenged the establishment even if Baxter is not about to compare himself \u2013 \u201cWho\u2019s he?\u201d \u2013 with Claudio Ranieri. In Nowell, however, the Chiefs have their own Jamie Vardy-esque talisman and the former\u2019s hat-trick again underlined the Cornishman\u2019s maturing talent. His best try owed plenty to a wonderful long pass from the classy Henry Slade but the way in which he created the first of James Short\u2019s two scores, hunting expertly for a mismatch before surging into space, would have impressed the watching Eddie Jones. \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t reinforce his international credentials, nothing will,\u201d Baxter said.   Related: Exeter Chiefs and the rise from Devon minnows to England\u2019s big fish | Robert Kitson    Nowell, however, insists the credit is collective and senses a hunger to build on the club\u2019s A-league final victory last Monday. There is also a burning desire to reward those who paved the road to the top, not least the stalwart prop Brett Sturgess, who is leaving the club. \u201cThis is the business end,\u201d Nowell said. \u201cYou know what we\u2019re like at Exeter \u2026 once we\u2019ve got one thing we want the next. At the moment it\u2019s not the end of the journey. It\u2019s important for us to keep going forward and to keep attacking. As Rob says, we\u2019re now two games away from being Premiership champions. When we\u2019ve got the Sandy Park crowd behind us it\u2019s not the nicest place for opposition to come.\u201d This was definitely not the nicest of experiences for Quins, who have never leaked as many league points at The Stoop. Their Challenge Cup final this Friday offers a last shot at elite-level European qualification next season but Conor O\u2019Shea and his senior players all apologised to the club\u2019s fans after this pallid effort. If they can bounce back from this humiliation to defeat Montpellier in Lyon it will say much for the character of all concerned.
