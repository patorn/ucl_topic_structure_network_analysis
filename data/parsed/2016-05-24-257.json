  "body": "When Gary Neville opted to pack in his job as a highly regarded Sky Sports analyst in favour of a more fraught and less secure life as manager of Valencia, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho was quick to point out that the former Manchester United full-back would not have the benefit of touchscreen technology in the dugout during matches. \u201cOn the bench, you cannot stop the video, touch the screen and make movements happen,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a different story, but to accept the challenge proves he feels he is very well prepared.\u201d    Related: Ryan Giggs offered role on Mourinho\u2019s coaching staff at Manchester United     Little over a fortnight later, the then Chelsea manager found himself out of a job, while Neville\u2019s tenure at the Mestalla would last just four months. Now reports suggest he may be offered another challenge, to become part of Mourinho\u2019s backroom team when the Portuguese is formally announced as Manchester United manager. While Mourinho will arrive at Old Trafford with his regular fourth official-baiters, Rui Faria and Silvino Louro, in tow, assorted news outlets suggest he is ready to sound out both Neville and Brian Kidd about joining his coaching team. Both are likely to be intrigued by the possibility, although the former\u2019s close friendship with Ryan Giggs and the latter\u2019s recent three-year stint as No2 to Manuel Pellegrini at Manchester City are being mentioned as potential stumbling blocks. Giggs\u2019s future (or lack of one) at United has yet to be decided.   Despite making no mention of Monday\u2019s seismic upheaval at Old Trafford in his final blog of the season, lovable Spanish scamperer Juan Mata is understood to be ready to knuckle down and fight for his first-team place under the new regime despite having been moved on from Chelsea by Mourinho in a previous life. Chelsea midfielder Nemanja Matic may also make the switch from Stamford Bridge, while Everton central defender John Stones looks likely to pitch up at Old Trafford as Mourinho sets about what is likely to be a major rebuild.  The future of Joe Hart has been shrouded in doubt since it was announced that Pep Guardiola would be taking up the reins at Manchester City, with many suggesting the England goalkeeper may be moved on. The Sun say currently managerless Everton are about to make an \u201cambitious \u00a340m move\u201d for the least flaky scalp in Premier League football and will pay Hart \u00a3200,000 a week for his troubles. Pellegrini, the goalkeeper\u2019s former Manchester City boss, is one of many men believed to be under consideration for the vacant manager\u2019s job at Goodison Park, along with Ronald Koeman, Frank de Boer, Rafael Ben\u00edtez and Unai Emery. David Moyes is the latest to be linked with a return to his former gig, having apparently turned down an offer to shake Aston Villa out of their torpor. Whoever gets the Everton job will almost certainly have to make do without striker Romelu Lukaku, who is being linked with a return to Chelsea. Quite how such a move would tally with his ambition to play in the Champions League sooner rather than later remains to be seen.

In a bid to keep the spine of the unlikely lads who led their club to the most improbable title win in football history, Leicester City are ready to tie Robert Huth to a chair, stick a new and improved deal under his nose and tickle him until he promises to sign it. The Foxes are also ready to embrace Islam Slimani by splurging \u20ac30m on the 27-year-old Sporting striker, but could lose Jamie Vardy to any Champions League club prepared to trigger a \u00a320m release clause in his contract. N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 looks like he\u2019ll definitely be on his way out of the King Power Stadium and Leicester hope to maintain the quota of midfield apostrophes that served them so well by signing Sevilla midfielder Steven N\u2019Zonzi as his replacement.  The Albion Express & Star say West Brom have been linked with a \u201csummer raid\u201d for Aston Villa and Republic of Ireland defender Ciaran Clark, who will be bundled into the back of a van and driven to the Hawthorns. Recently relegated Newcastle left-back Paul Dummett may also be rescued from a life of Championship toil, with the Baggies among three different Premier League teams ready to offer him a top-flight reprieve. A native Geordie, Dummett has also attracted admiring glances from Crystal Palace and Stoke City.  And finally, sales of wet-look hair gel are set to plummet on the south coast as Southampton prepare to bid adieu to Italian striker Graziano Pell\u00e8, who they\u2019d quite like to replace with Juventus goal-getter Simone Zaza.",
