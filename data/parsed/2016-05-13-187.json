It was audacious and perfect.   The funniest person I know  Sometimes I am lucky enough to hang out with Tim Key and he is constantly funny. Every moment. When I haven\u2019t seen him for a bit I do his voice in my head to entertain myself. I wish I could copy him, just be a tribute act.  The funniest TV show I\u2019ve ever seen  I love Arrested Development and the American Office, but the funniest TV show I\u2019ve ever seen is Would I Lie To You? I watch it on my own while I\u2019m having a tidy and I laugh and grin away to myself and for a few minutes the loneliness abates. I mean, I enjoy it very much.    Related: Sara Pascoe and Amy Stewart on the female body \u2013 books podcast     The funniest dream I\u2019ve ever had  I have never woken up laughing from a dream, but I have tricked myself into thinking that I have written a whole sitcom episode and my first thoughts upon waking are: \u201cThat was easy, I\u2019ll just pop that down and email it to the BBC.\u201d Last night I dreamed that Eddie Izzard played my mum in a comedy-drama where we both played for the same netball team. I\u2019m just waiting to hear back from the commissioner now.   The funniest item of clothing I\u2019ve ever owned  I used to laugh at the Kappa symbol because if you put your hand over the top it looked like a woman with open legs, but I\u2019m a feminist now so I don\u2019t laugh any more. At anything.   The funniest heckle I\u2019ve ever had  My mum has shouted out a couple of times. She\u2019ll yell something like \u201cliar\u201d or \u201ctell \u2019em about your Dad\u201d and I\u2019ll say: \u201cThanks for coming, Mum.\u201d And then at the end she might remind me \u201cI got the biggest laugh of the night\u201d or \u201cthey only clapped at my bit\u201d.   The funniest joke I\u2019ve ever heard  I walked behind some children on a school trip last week and heard a boy asking his friend, \u201cWhat type of tea do footballers hate?\u201d I don\u2019t know, I thought, what kind of tea do \u2026 \u201cPenalty!\u201d he announced, without waiting for my internal call and response. Bloody good joke, that, and it\u2019s probably true as well. Factual and funny.   Sara Pascoe is at Soho Theatre, W1, Monday to 28 May; touring to 2 July",
