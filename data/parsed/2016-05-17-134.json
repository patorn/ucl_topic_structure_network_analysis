To the consternation of archaeologist Julian Bowsher, an internationally acknowledged expert on Shakespeare\u2019s theatres, the excavation of the foundations and a long stretch of the back wall of the stage prove that the theatre was rectangular, not the \u201cwooden O\u201d of the famous prologue to Henry V. \u201cThere is going to have to be a certain amount of revision of the chapter on The Curtain in my book,\u201d Bowsher said. \u201cIt now seems clear that the playhouse was a conversion of an earlier tenement \u2013 essentially a block of flats \u2013 and was later converted back into a tenement again. \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of scholarly argument about the shape of Tudor theatres, but the evidence from actors is that it made no difference to the performance of the plays, you could ask them to stand on a chair and they\u2019d just get on and do it.\u201d Finds made by the archaeologists from the Museum of London Archaeology include a battered piece of green pottery, like the stump of an egg cup. It is actually a bird call, which may have been used for stage effects \u2013 a haunting find at the site where Juliet may first have spoken the lines, pleading with Romeo to stay a little longer in their marriage bed: \u201cIt is not yet near day: it was the nightingale, and not the lark.\u201d     Archaeologist Paul McGarrity holds a 16th-century bird whistle, a possible theatrical sound effect, discovered at the Curtain. Photograph: Handout    Other finds include a lead token, probably used to pay for a pot of ale, and a broken-bone comb: \u201cMost people would need a comb to remove the wildlife from their hair,\u201d Heather Knight, the senior archaeologist on the excavation, said. There was also a handsome metal mount for a cloth purse \u2013 another suggestive find from a site where the records include the arrest of a cutpurse thief. Knight said the remains of the theatre were the best preserved of all the Shakespeare theatres they had excavated. Because the building was a conversion, and later reused, far more survives than Shakespeare\u2019s more famous theatres on the South Bank, the Globe and the Rose, where nothing remains except a confusing tracery of foundations.  Several brick walls up to 1.5 metres (4ft 9in) high remain of the Curtain, along with part of the sloping gravelled surface of the yard where the groundlings stood \u2013 including on one occasion, according to Bowsher, the Venetian ambassador. He caused scandal by considering it more fun to stand with the crowd than sit with the gentry in an expensive stage box, and was then nearly beaten up by the groundlings when he chatted in Italian with a companion, and was taken for a Spanish spy.     A comb was among the artefacts found at the site. Photograph: Handout    The Curtain\u2019s name had nothing to do with theatre: it came from the ancient Curtain Road, which flanked the old curtain wall of a medieval priory. It was one of two playhouses, 100 metres apart, described by one visitor as standing in a fair meadow, just outside the city walls. It is the least well documented of Shakespeare\u2019s theatres, but one of the few facts is that he was listed as an actor in the first performance of Ben Jonson\u2019s Every Man In His Humour, in 1598. The rectangular theatre, like the galleried inns where plays were also performed, cannot be the famous wooden O of Henry V: \u201cCan this Cock-Pit hold within this Woodden O, the very Caskes that did affright the Ayre at Agincourt?\u201d Bowsher suspects the prologue was added for a later performance at the Globe. The surviving records suggest that the area around the Curtain was a rowdy one. Richard Burbage, Shakespeare\u2019s friend and theatre manager, was regularly fined for running a shebeen, an unlicensed \u201ctippling house\u201d a stone\u2019s throw away.   Related: Shakespeare's Curtain theatre unearthed in east London     Two of his sons had their houses broken into and theatre costumes stolen \u2013 the culprit may not have been far away as a member of the company was convicted of receiving stolen goods, including costumes. There was also a punch-up at the door of the theatre between two actors and a Thames ferryman, who had possibly come for a little chat about his unpaid fares, since the actors had previously been arrested for an \u201caffray\u201d at the river. Although the approximate location of the Curtain was marked with a plaque almost a century ago, the actual site was only rediscovered five years ago, when buildings from the 1970s and 80s were cleared for redevelopment . The developers propose to retain all that remains as a visitor attraction, and to create a performance space. Excavation continues in the backstage area and archaeologists have also found that precious source of evidence, a nice cesspit. There will be free public tours of the site on Fridays until 24 June , but places must be booked on http://www.mola.org.uk/events.",
