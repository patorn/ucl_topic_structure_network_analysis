Chabon was interviewed in East Jerusalem for American Jewish newspaper the Forward during a visit to research a book on 50 years of Israeli occupation. He said he was \u201cnot so worried\u201d about alienating Jewish readers by writing about the occupation. \u201cOnce you see for yourself, it is pretty obvious, I think, to any human being with a heart and a mind, it is pretty clear what to feel about it.\u201d The author called the evidence of Israel\u2019s occupation he\u2019d seen while touring Hebron in the West Bank \u201cthe most grievous injustice I have ever seen in my life \u2026 this is the worst thing I have ever seen, just purely in terms of injustice. If saying that is going to lose me readers, I don\u2019t want those readers. They can go away and never come back.\u201d Chabon and his wife, writer Ayelet Waldman, are contributing to and editing the as-yet-unnamed book of essays that will be published to mark the 50th anniversary of 1967\u2019s six-day war, when Israel first entered the Palestinian territories: the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip. Nobel prize-winning novelist Mario Vargas Llosa, Dave Eggers, Eimear McBride, Hari Kunzru, Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn and Geraldine Brooks are among the group of international authors travelling to Israel and Palestine for a week each, to write and research essays for the book. It will be published in 2017 by HarperCollins in the US and Books in the Attic (Sifrey Aliyat Hagag) in Israel and is part of an initiative with the NGO Breaking the Silence, which publishes accounts by soldiers in Israel\u2019s military about their time serving in the Palestinian territories.

In the inteview with the Forward, Chabon also revealed his contribution to the book will be about Palestinian-American businessman Sam Bahour, who moved from Ohio to Ramallah to build the Palestinian economy after the Oslo peace accords. Chabon frequently writes about Jewish themes in his fiction: his 2000 Pulitzer winner The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay is about two Jewish cousins before, during and after the second world war, while 2007\u2019s The Yiddish Policemen\u2019s Union contains an alternate history of the diaspora that sees it relocated to Alaska. The author told the Forward he was finishing a \u201ca novel disguised as a memoir of my grandfather\u201d that \u201chas a lot of Jewish content\u201d and will be published in November 2016. \u2022 This article was amended on 9 May 2016. An earlier version incorrectly included the Golan Heights in the Palestinian territories.",
