  "body": "Government arguments with Conservative local authorities did not end when ministers backed down over plans to force the conversion of all English state schools to academies. In a fast-developing dispute in Tory Suffolk, the local authority is launching a judicial review to challenge Department for Education-approved plans for a new middle school by the Bury St Edmunds All-through Free School Trust.   Related: Government drops plan to make all schools in England academies    Furious local headteachers are wondering why, after the painful process in which the county has got rid of middle schools over nine years, suddenly a new one should be approved. They have written an open letter [pdf] to the education secretary, Nicky Morgan, arguing that the move undermines years of change from a three-tier set-up including middle schools to two tiers: primary and\u00a0 secondary. The free school group has argued that it has had approval to provide schooling for pupils from four to 18 since 2011, but opponents say the DfE asserted at the time that no new middle schools would be set up. This is a dispute to watch. Foreign languages \u2013 or\u00a0fancy buildings? Are teaching staff or buildings more important to the modern university? The question is being asked by critics of proposals, finalised last week, for cutbacks affecting highly praised modern languages and cultural courses at the University of Nottingham. Nottingham\u2019s plans to cut 11.5 teaching posts, in German; Spanish, Portuguese and Latin American studies;\u00a0Russian and Slavonic studies; theology; and archaeology have drawn fierce protests. Sixty British Academy fellows wrote a letter [pdf] opposing the cuts, and Nottingham\u2019s academics in German have described [pdf] them as \u201csavage\u201d. The academics are linking the teaching cuts to Nottingham\u2019s ambitious and costly building plans, a charge denied by the university. However, we have seen a transcript of a meeting between students and the university hierarchy that seems to show a senior member of staff linking funding for building work with staff cutbacks. Nottingham pointed out that the cuts\u00a0were going through with only the holder of 0.5 of a full-time teaching post having to be made compulsorily redundant. But the development will fuel fears of a crisis in higher education language teaching. Airport school hopes for a\u00a0flying new start What do you do if, as a free school, you have struggled to find a site for your buildings and so set up home next to an airport and then you have difficulty attracting pupils? Well, perhaps you rebrand with an \u201cinternational\u201d curriculum to match the \u201cinternational\u201d nature of air travel, and try to draw in foreign students. This is the latest twist to the strange tale of Parkfield school, the free school in Bournemouth that is due to move to permanent premises in a former air traffic control centre in September. Parkfield, currently housed in a town centre office block, had been due to open a sixth form last year, offering the international baccalaureate, but the plan was put on hold with student numbers seemingly a problem.   Related: Mid-year primary school reforms reverse election promise    But now it is back on the agenda, minutes from a Parkfield governors\u2019 meeting in February reveal. \u201cLooking to the future, it will be important to sell the school to a wider audience \u2026 potentially recruiting overseas students who will be attracted to the IB diploma. \u201cIn order to facilitate this [the principal, Terry Conaghan] would like the governors to approve a change of the school name and rebranding. The principal felt this would give the school a clear identity \u2026 the school would offer an international curriculum next to Bournemouth international airport.\u201d Conaghan told us the move to the airport provided the \u201cperfect opportunity to promote the school to a new audience\u201d, but that decisions on rebranding and renaming the school had since been put on hold. The saga of Parkfield, which last year saw its airport move delayed after a bat colony was discovered on site, may come to symbolise some of\u00a0the wackier aspects of the free schools project. Harris\u2019s \u2018ridiculous\u2019 teacher turnover An influential parent has complained about the turnover of staff in her children\u2019s primary school, which has had a succession of headteachers in four years \u2013 three \u201cexecutive\u201d heads and three heads of school, with the possibility of that becoming a fourth in September. Yet the school has not been through any\u00a0apparent crisis and is rated \u201coutstanding\u201d by Ofsted. It is part of the Harris Federation, often lauded by ministers.   Related: School\u2019s out for Harris academy teachers in\u00a0turnover that \u2018should ring alarm bells\u2019    Erica Rowe, who has two children attending Harris primary free school Peckham, south London, which opened in 2012, contacted us after she says she found out that the school\u2019s \u201cfantastic\u201d current head, who parents thought was a long-term appointment, was having to apply to make the position permanent. Rowe is chair of the school\u2019s (Harris-endorsed) parent association. Rowe also believes teacher turnover at the school has been \u201cridiculously\u201d high. Harris says three teachers are leaving the eight-class, 240-pupil school this summer, but offered no further comment on Rowe\u2019s complaints. We reported last October on seemingly high teacher turnover rates at Harris schools and wonder quite how unsettling all this change must be for young children.",
