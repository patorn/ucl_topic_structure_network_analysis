  "body": "With his debonair persona and neat moustache, Alan Whicker took television audiences to far-flung corners of the world long before the days of mass travel, a suave Englishman abroad who brought the famous and the infamous into Britain\u2019s living rooms with his original interviewing style.  Now, almost three years after his death, the documentary maker\u2019s entire personal archive has been donated to the public and will become available through the British Film Institute (BFI).  Nathalie Morris, the BFI\u2019s senior curator of special collections, spoke of the archive\u2019s \u201cwealth of material\u201d, while the archivist Catherine Kirby, who has been cataloguing the vast collection, said: \u201cIt\u2019s going to take them some time to get to grips with this collection because it\u2019s so big.\u201d     Alan Whicker on his travels in Hong Kong. Photograph: ITV/Rex/Shutterstock    Among the previously unseen material to be published are notes on unrealised projects including a 1993 letter to Diana, Princess of Wales, asking \u201cwhether you might consider allowing me to devote a programme to you\u201d. Other ideas included a programme on \u201cservants of the rich\u201d \u2013 \u201cto provide a worm\u2019s eye view of the exclusively wealthy and aristocratic and \u2026 to investigate the mentality of the exclusive servant in this do-it-yourself age\u201d.  Whicker, after serving as a captain in the Devonshire regiment during the second world war, was seconded to the army film and photographic unit, before he became a war correspondent, reporting on the Korean war. He joined BBC television in 1957, working on the Tonight programme, but soon had his own show, Whicker\u2019s World, in 1958. It ran for 36 years, during which time Whicker travelled hundreds of thousands of miles to interview an incredible array of world leaders and eminent characters.      A list of potential interviewees. Photograph: BFI National Archive, Alan Whicker collection    With disarming politeness, he got away with the most piercing questions. Interviewees included the Haitian dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier, known as Baby Doc, under whose regime hundreds of political prisoners died. In a shockingly direct question for a head of state, Whicker said: \u201cBut they say you torture people?\u201d In the archive, a list of questions includes: \u201cWould you say you were a ruthless man?\u201d  There is also a rare interview with J Paul Getty, then the world\u2019s richest man. The archive\u2019s full transcript has unused passages in which the billionaire confided: \u201cOne must remember that business is an art. It\u2019s not a science \u2026 There are probably 30 to 40 things one has to watch ... [including] competent people \u2026 good morale \u2026 and to be competitive \u2026 You can\u2019t be wasteful \u2026 Above all, you can\u2019t be emotional in business \u2013 there\u2019s no reward in business for emotion.\u201d  Whicker\u2019s subjects included San Francisco hippies and the archive has a 1967 letter telling him that Huw Wheldon \u2013 then controller of programmes for BBC television \u2013 had \u201crefused to put it out as it stands\u201d. \u201cThe nude party must go\u201d and the commentary needed to be changed \u201cquite radically\u201d, Whicker was told.      A 1967 letter from the BBC discussing a programme about hippies. Photograph: BFI National Archive, Alan Whicker collection    In another 1967 letter, David Attenborough, a senior BBC figure at the time, was apologetic and sympathetic towards Whicker, but explained: \u201cAs you know the drugs question has hotted up considerably here. In such circumstances we feel that we must examine with the utmost care what we say on the subject. We must bend over backwards to be balanced. \u201cIt is, without question, an excellent film, beautifully made \u2026 powerful arguments for transmitting it as it stands. And yet I am quite sure that to have done so would have been irresponsible. I was left with the impression that taking LSD is fun. The fact remains that to take LSD in this country is to break the law.\u201d Morris said: \u201cWe are thrilled that the Whicker\u2019s World Foundation have gifted [these] papers to the BFI national archive. Whicker was an icon of 20th-century television and a household name to millions of people. Fearless, incisive, but above all entertaining, Whicker\u2019s programmes took viewers to far-flung places and broke new ground in the development of television documentary. The Alan Whicker collection is a hugely important resource for anyone interested in 20th-century history and culture, as well as the history of television. The BFI is looking forward to making it available to researchers and to the general public.\u201d The collection will be available from this summer at BFI Southbank in London, with plans to make it available digitally in the future.",
