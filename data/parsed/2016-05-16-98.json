  "body": "More than 30 prominent Czechs including the former ambassador to London Michael \u017dantovsk\u00fd, the supermodel Eva Herzigov\u00e1 and the conductor Ji\u0159i B\u011blohl\u00e1vek have signed a letter to Sir Tom Stoppard urging the UK to stay in the EU. The letter, addressed to the Czech-born playwright \u2013 born Tom\u00e1\u0161 Straussler \u2013 says the UK plays an important \u201cbalancing role\u201d in European politics. Stoppard said he was \u201ccomplimented\u201d and \u201crather honoured\u201d to have received the letter and agreed with the sentiments expressed.   Related: Tom Stoppard to deliver Charles Wheeler lecture at award ceremony    Titled \u201cReflections on the referendum on the membership of the UK in the EU in a letter intended to have been sent to a gentleman in Dorset\u201d, the letter was written by \u017dantovsk\u00fd who, before being appointed as the Czech Republic\u2019s ambassador to the UK, was spokesman for the then president V\u00e1clav Havel. Other signatories include the former gymnast V\u011bra \u010c\u00e1slavsk\u00e1, the archbishop of Prague, Cardinal Dominik Duka, conductor Ji\u0159\u00ed Pe\u0161ek and the head of the Academy of Science, Ji\u0159\u00ed Draho\u0161. Stoppard said \u017dantovsk\u00fd was an old friend, which was why the letter had been addressed to him. \u201cI concur with the basic point in the letter but I was also rather touched by the way he wrote about the relationship between Britain and the Czech Republic,\u201d he told the Guardian.   Brexit companion   Stoppard said he too had signed a letter in support of Britain remaining in the EU. \u201cA lot of the debate in this country is about the arithmetic and it is as well to be reminded that arithmetic isn\u2019t everything. Geopolitics in the 21st century weigh more heavily than they ever have done,\u201d he said.  The letter says the referendum vote is \u201cobviously a sovereign matter for the people of the UK, and only for them, to decide.\u201d Nonetheless, the vote will affect the people of all the EU\u2019s member countries, the letter says. The letter explores what Europeans and Czechs have in common with the British, and \u201cwhy we believe that the long-\u00adterm considerations of shared culture, history, values and destiny prevail over calculations of short-term costs and benefits of the membership in the union.\u201d It touches on the second world and how many Czechs and Slovaks lost their lives fighting the Nazis serving in British and Allied armies, including Stoppard\u2019s father, Eugen Straussler, who died in Japanese captivity as a prisoner of war. When the Iron Curtain fell and Czechoslovakia became free under the leadership of Havel, \u201cBritain was one of the first countries to offer friendship and support.\u201d   Related: Phone survey finds 10-point lead for remain but web poll puts leave ahead    It continues: \u201cBritain was one of the first EU countries to have opened its borders to Czech workers, students and entrepreneurs, with benefits shared on both sides. Successive Czech governments shared the British ardour for free markets, open trade and international cooperation. Our troops served together in Bosnia, Kosovo, Afghanistan and other places. The last 25 years of partnership and cooperation were among the best in the history of our two nations.\u201d The letter says exit would be bad for Britain and bad for Europe. \u201cWithout the British legacy of democratic institutions, entrepreneurial spirit, common sense and pragmatic approach to problem-solving, the west as we know it would be much weakened, politically and spiritually. \u201cBritain, under the exit scenario, would fare no better. It would be stranded in the middle of the Atlantic, unable to draw on the synergies of the European project. It would be left alone to deal with the ever-present threats of nationalism, populist politics, migration issues and ethnic intolerance. Closing its doors to workers from the EU, it would have to look for manpower, most likely less qualified and less adaptable, in other parts of the world.\u201d",
