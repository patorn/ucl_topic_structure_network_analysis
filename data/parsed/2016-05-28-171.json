  "body": "The day you died, I\u00a0thought, will someone now tell me what the hell has been going on? It was like a film with a complicated plot, then at the end they tell you what was really happening. Except that no one did. What on earth were the last 12 years about? No explanations for the chaos that had defined our lives together. The times you went walkabout and I called the police, what did you do when you said you were going to an AA meeting and didn\u2019t, what were you up to the day I was at work and you were \u201cworking from home\u201d.   Related: 'Alcoholics Anonymous saved my life, but now I\u2019ve lost my faith'    For a man who told the whole world, whether they wanted to hear or not, how much you loved me, what an amazing woman I was, you always chose the bottle over me. You were a bright, intelligent man who had everything and more. You told me you were going to be a millionaire. We were both from Scottish working-class families so statements like that were bold. I\u00a0think I laughed. But you weren\u2019t just clever, you were a genius \u2013 and the no-common-sense variety of clever. Anything earthly was of no interest \u2013 organising a mortgage, clothes, planning our future \u2013 but give you a tome on gravity and your nose would be stuck in it until you\u2019d finished. I\u2019ll never forget when you shouted \u2013 right through to the living room \u2013 to tell me that there was a mistake in one of the equations, which was pages long. Really, I said, she who had failed first-year university maths. I still go to Al-Anon meetings and its nearly 17 years since you died. The story is the same \u2013 lives destroyed though booze. It\u2019s no different if it\u2019s in an upper-class borough in London where I used to live or in a working-class suburb of Glasgow. I only told a few members of our family and friends about what was going on. I was constantly lying for you. Even on the day of the funeral, I\u00a0was talking to your colleagues about your \u201cdepression\u201d.   Related: Other people were alcoholics. I just liked a drink \u2013 or so I thought | Lucy Rocca    There was little laughter in all of this, but we used to have an adorable Polish cleaner who told me that, after you died, she couldn\u2019t figure out why there were bottles of vodka in your shoes under the chest of\u00a0drawers. But the day that will remain in my mind for ever wasn\u2019t long before your death. You were starting to go yellow as your liver began to fail. We\u2019d not long had the conversation that went along the lines of, \u201cLook, there\u2019s a bottle of vodka\u201d (in the cupboard where the tea and coffee were) and you replied: \u201cWell, I didn\u2019t put it there.\u201d It was too exhausting to argue by then and solved nothing. So I remarked on the change in your colour and tried to persuade you to go to the doctor. You said, \u201cI\u2019ve got an appointment next week, I\u2019ll see about it then.\u201d That was a lie. You said, \u201cI\u2019ll take some milk thistle, that\u2019ll help.\u201d Too late for that, I thought. You said, \u201cI know what it is \u2013 I\u2019ve been drinking too much Fanta.\u201d To laugh, or to cry \u2026 It doesn\u2019t matter if I believe alcoholism is a disease or not. That day, I\u00a0realised how gripped you were by it and how much control it had over you. For this bright, intelligent man to stand there, say that and expect me to believe it. To be so deluded, words fail me. You died a few days later. Was it grief or relief that I\u00a0felt? Christina",
