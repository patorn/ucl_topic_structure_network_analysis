  "body": "Liverpool need leaders and to be stronger mentally So now Liverpool know what it feels like to concede three times in the second half of a European final. If Istanbul was a miracle this was pure misery for the Merseysiders, their hopes of a first European trophy in 11 years going up in smoke after an incredible second-half collapse. Some of the officiating did not help but the men in red did not help themselves either and what yet another thrown away lead by them this season proves is that J\u00fcrgen Klopp not only needs to bring in technically better players in the summer but mentally stronger ones too. Leaders are needed if the progress the German has made since arriving in October is going to lead to tangible reward.

The Ivorian was probably Liverpool\u2019s best player here, covering ground, blocking runs and shots and continuously communicating with his team-mates up until his substitution on 82 minutes. Tour\u00e9 is one of the few players to have won major honours in the squad and, aged 35, has been there and done that. His contract expires next month but on the back of this display, Klopp may decide that the centre-back should be kept on for another season at least. Captain Coke leads stunning Sevilla fightback The manner in which Sevilla took charge of this match after the interval was remarkable. They were helped by a meltdown in Liverpool\u2019s ranks \u2013 kickstarted by yet another moment of appalling defending by Alberto Moreno \u2013 but the Spanish club deserve credit for reacting to the referee\u2019s whistle with such gusto and ruthlessness \u2013 , led by their captain, Coke, who scored twice. There has been a sense of destiny about Liverpool\u2019s claims on this trophy after their run to the final but they came up against a very good team who know full well how to win this competition. The fact Sevilla finished seventh in La Liga also shows just how strong that league is.

Klopp was once again in full angry bear mode while, to his right, Unai Emery, who has guided his team to three successive Europa League titles, yet again showed all the skills of a hyperactive air traffic controller. Too much attention is paid to managers these days but sometimes it really is impossible to ignore them.           J\u00fcrgen Klopp defiant after Liverpool lose Europa League final to Sevilla.    Ugly reminder of darks days and Uefa\u2019s stadium folly Given Liverpool\u2019s modest allocation for this final \u2013 just 10,236 tickets for a club that sold more than 31,000 for February\u2019s Capital One Cup final \u2013 it was always going to be the case that some of their supporters would end up in Sevilla\u2019s section of this stadium. Sadly, and partly due to a lack of segregation, that led to clashes between a small group of fans from each club before kick-off and the involvement of riot police. There is no excuse for fighting but this ugly reminder of football\u2019s darker days was also a reminder that Uefa\u2019s decision to hold a match at a venue where demand was always going to outstrip supply \u2013 and especially so after Liverpool booked their place \u2013 was an idiotic one.",
