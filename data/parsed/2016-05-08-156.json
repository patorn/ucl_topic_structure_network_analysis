Writing in the Observer after becoming the most powerful Muslim politician in Europe, Khan says the prime minister and Goldsmith deployed tactics \u201cstraight out of the Donald Trump playbook\u201d \u2013 a reference to the anti-Muslim campaign of the Republican hopeful in the US.           Sadiq Khan: London\u2019s new mayor    Khan wrested control of the capital from the Tories after eight years under Boris Johnson, in what turned out to be a comfortable win. He said he had hoped the campaign would focus on issues such as housing, transport and air pollution. \u201cBut David Cameron and Zac Goldsmith chose to set out to divide London\u2019s communities in an attempt to win votes in some areas and suppress voters in other parts of the city,\u201d he said. \u201cThey used fear and innuendo to try to turn different ethnic and religious groups against each other \u2013 something straight out of the Donald Trump playbook. Londoners deserved better and I hope it\u2019s something the Conservative party will never try to repeat.\u201d His remarks came as senior Tories, including Mohammed Amin, chair of the Conservative Muslim Forum, broke cover to criticise their own party\u2019s campaign as divisive and deeply unpleasant. Khan chose Southwark Cathedral for his signing-in as mayor, where he said he was determined to govern for all Londoners and \u201cevery single community\u201d. His savage remarks about Cameron will infuriate the prime minister and stoke tension between the two, who will have to work together on security and other issues in the months and years ahead.   Related: What Labour can learn from my victory: we can\u2019t ignore the things most voters want | Sadiq Khan    During the campaign, run by Cameron\u2019s election strategist Lynton Crosby, the Tories tried to paint Khan as a radical, suggesting he had questions to answer because he had shared platforms with extremists in the past and defended them in his time as a human rights lawyer. Khan later said it was a matter for Cameron whether he wished to apologise for the content and tone of the Tory campaign, but vowed to work with the him in the interest of Londoners. The defence secretary, Michael Fallon, who described Khan during the mayoral election campaign as a \u201cLabour lackey who speaks alongside extremists\u201d, repeatedly refused to say whether he was worried about Khan\u2019s election and the safety of Londoners during an interview on Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Finally, under pressure from interviewer Sarah Montague, Fallon conceded that \u201cLondon is safe with a Conservative government working with the new mayor of London\u201d. In his Observer article, Khan, whose team were not keen on Jeremy Corbyn attending Saturday\u2019s ceremony, according to reports, also delivers a clear message to the Labour leader on how to win elections after a set of local, Scottish and Welsh results that left some Labour MPs questioning Corbyn\u2019s future. Labour suffered disastrous losses in Scotland, where it slipped to third place behind Ruth Davidson\u2019s Scottish Conservatives. In English local elections, however, the party avoided predicted losses in key strongholds in the south. \u201cI learnt a great deal throughout the course of the campaign \u2013 about myself, about London and about the importance of reaching out to all sections of society. But there are two lessons in particular,\u201d Khan writes. \u201cFirst, Labour only wins when we face outwards and focus on the issues that the people actually care about. And secondly, we will never be trusted to govern unless we reach out and engage with all voters \u2013 regardless of their background, where they live or where they work. \u201cSquabbles over internal party structures might be important for some in the party, but it is clear they mean little or nothing to the huge majority of voters. As tempting as it might be, we must always resist focusing in on ourselves and ignoring what people really want.\u201d Khan suggests Corbyn is failing to appeal to a wide enough electorate, including middle-class and disaffected Tory voters. \u201cLabour has to be a big tent that appeals to everyone \u2013 not just its own activists. Campaigns that deliberately turn their back on particular groups are doomed to fail. \u201cJust like in London, so-called natural Labour voters alone will never be enough to win a general election. We must be able to persuade people who previously voted Conservative that Labour can be trusted with the economy and security as well as improving public services and creating a fairer society.\u201d Khan, the Tooting MP, secured 57% of votes in the mayoral contest once second preferences were taken into account. Sources close to Corbyn said he was planning a public event with Khan in the next few days. The Labour leader is also expected to address his MPs at what could prove a difficult meeting of the parliamentary Labour party on Monday.",
