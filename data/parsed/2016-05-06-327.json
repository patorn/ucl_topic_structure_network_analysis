But if you\u2019re talking about critical gender theory, or critical race theory or feminism or transphobia, that\u2019s when people get a lot more touchy \u2026 \u201d Olly Lennard may not be your idea of an average YouTuber. Rather than playing games or giving makeup tips, his channel dishes out the syllabus from his masters degree in philosophy, one 5-10 minute video at a time. \u201cI was in the last year that paid the old tuition fees, so when the government tripled the fees, I knew there were a lot of people who maybe wanted to study philosophy but probably couldn\u2019t afford it,\u201d says Lennard. \u201cSo I decided to give away my degree for free, on YouTube.\u201d     YouTube chose 16 emerging channels in the UK for its NextUp initiative. Photograph: PR    Hence Philosophy Tube, which mixes sharp breakdowns of Cartesian dualism and Marx\u2019s views on labour and class conflict with more populist takes: 3 Kantian Reasons why the Friendzone is Bullshit, for example, or Overanalysing My Little Pony, Socialism and Ayn Rand.         Olly Lennard runs the Philosophy Tube channel: \u201cI\u2019ve written to universities saying \u2018Hey, I reach more students than you guys do in a whole year. Maybe you want to sponsor the show? They go: \u2018Who are you? Get out!\u2019\u201d    Lennard is one of 16 UK-based channels chosen by the Google-owned online-video service for its latest NextUp programme \u2013 an annual contest that has been identifying emerging talent on YouTube since 2011. This year, up to 360 YouTubers will take part, initially in Los Angeles and London with Tokyo, Sao Paulo, Berlin, Paris, Toronto and Mumbai to follow. In London, the week-long Creator Camp is held in the YouTube Space studio in Google\u2019s office. Its door is directly opposite the entrance to fellow building tenant NBCUniversal: a neat metaphor for the battle between the old and new television worlds. YouTube puts up the 16 contest winners in a London hotel, and runs training sessions in the daytime before taking them out for bonding \u2013 one night involves learning to make cocktails \u2013 and meals where they can meet more experienced YouTubers.  The 16 UK NextUppers are diverse in terms of the content they make. Alongside Lennard and his bitesized philosophy there\u2019s vegan vlogger Rose Lee, street magician Steven Bridges, musical parodist Anna Johnson and Pok\u00e9mon science-explainer Toby Hill.     Rose Lee runs the Cheap Lazy Vegan YouTube channel. \u2018A lot of people think veganism is expensive or a lot of work. I wanted to show that it\u2019s not.\u2019    Mike Boyd\u2019s channel, shows him \u201clearning how to do things as quickly as possible\u201d, from juggling in three hours and 44 minutes to learning to unicycle in two hours and 38 minutes. There\u2019s also animation, weight-loss vlogging, sketch comedy, crafting, baking, impressions and lifestyle channels.   Related: How toy unboxing channels became YouTube's real stars    The assembled group are up-and-comers rather than big online stars. Fashion, hair and beauty vlogger Hannah Leigh had the most popular channel at the time that the Creator Camp took place, with 91,000 subscribers and 14.3m video views, but many have less than 50,000 subscribers and views in the single-digit millions. Sara Mormino, the director of YouTube\u2019s global content operations, says: \u201cIt\u2019s about that moment where people are starting to take this a little bit more seriously. They\u2019re engaging with the platform, they\u2019re uploading regularly, they\u2019re engaging with their audience.\u201d She adds: \u201c10,000 subscribers seems the point where people are thinking \u2018hey, this is starting to work\u2019. From there up to 100,000 subscribers is a sweet spot where we\u2019re looking to inspire them to take it seriously, to continue to engage and to think about what they could do bigger and better with their channel.\u201d     Marcus Butler addresses the YouTube NextUp UK class of 2016.    The Butler did it NextUp provides a snapshot of young creators who are building audiences for their YouTube channels and hoping to make a career out of it. Inspiration at the Creator Camp comes from YouTubers who have done exactly that. Marcus Butler, for example, was at the lower end of the \u201csweet spot\u201d identified by Mormino when he took part in the first UK NextUp contest in 2011. Five years on, he has 4.4m subscribers and 323.4m video views. \u201cI think I had about 10,000 subscribers when I did the programme, so I was not in a place to do this as a job, but it gave me a vision and ambition,\u201d he says before his mentoring session with the NextUp class. \u201cI was like \u2018Oh, YouTube see something in me to progress\u2019. So it gave me the belief that I could turn it into something.\u201d It took another year before Butler quit his day job to focus on full-time vlogging. Since then his channel has grown steadily, while other opportunities such as a book publishing deal, various brand partnerships and an appearance with fellow YouTuber Alfie Deyes on TV show Saturday Night Takeaway have emerged.     Anna Johnson\u2019s channel blends parody songs and pranks: \u201cIf you\u2019re working in TV and you\u2019re the presenter or the actor, you\u2019re just one cog in the wheel of making that TV show. We get to do everything.\u201d    Butler delivers warnings, as well as encouragement. For example, he warns of the dangers of saying yes to any brand that waves its wallet at young YouTubers in the hopes of getting them to make sponsored videos. He says: \u201cThe first thing I got was literally some random company who wanted me to mention a certain chocolate bar in my video for \u00a350. I was like \u2018Oh my god! Yeah, of course!\u2019 If I look back at some of my first branded stuff, I think \u2018why did I agree to do that? \u201cIt was a learning curve, but you\u2019d never see me doing them now. You\u2019ve got to pick wisely. The advice I would give is don\u2019t just do it. If you get your first deal and see a bit of money, don\u2019t be like \u2018Yes, I am going to do that\u2019. You\u2019ve still got to keep it true to your brand.\u201d         Toby Hill runs the Bird Keeper Toby Pok\u00e9mon-themed channel: \u201cI have the kid audience but also the more adult audience like myself. Curating the comments section so it\u2019s a friendly environment can be challenging.\u201d    Butler also talks honestly about his experience with primetime TV, praising Saturday Night Takeaway stars Ant and Dec, who \u201cwere like \u2018we get you, we really like what you do, the TV world and the YouTube world can do something amazing.\u2019\u201d But Butler had criticism for some of the broadcast executives running their show. He adds: \u201cSenior people at ITV were more \u2018we don\u2019t really get what you do\u2019. We were being introduced as the little YouTube people, but we\u2019re getting the same amount of views that you\u2019re getting \u2013 and there\u2019s 400 of you!\u201d he says. \u201cThat was a really tough relationship: Ant and Dec, the stars of the show, were like \u2018stick at it boys!\u2019 But the senior people at ITV? \u2018Nah, we don\u2019t like you\u2019.\u201d \u201cThat still happens now, but it\u2019s just a case of educating, I feel. They just don\u2019t understand it: there\u2019s this massive thing and they\u2019re scared of it. There\u2019s these YouTube people getting massively bigger numbers than their TV shows and they just don\u2019t get it.\u201d     Cameron Sanderson releases new songs through his channel: \u201cI started when I was 12 and playing guitar at the pub surrounded by lots of old men. Mum filmed it on a camera and I put it on YouTube. Why not?\u201d    Full-time ambitions Butler\u2019s audience question him for more than 40 minutes, during a week that also sees them trained in filming and editing skills, as well as promoting their channels and attracting more subscribers.   Related: YouTubers hit mainstream as digital media become top choice for new talent    Most are in the same position: not quite making enough money to go full-time on their channels but eyeing that prospect with growing enthusiasm.  \u201cComing here and seeing all the people doing it full-time, it\u2019s like \u2018this could actually happen\u2019 whereas before I was like \u2018I don\u2019t really know\u2019. This opens up my mind to the possibility of doing it full-time,\u201d says Rose Lee. \u201cI still struggle with that mindset of it going from a hobby to a full-time job,\u201d admits Laura Payne, who currently vlogs for children\u2019s TV channel CBBC and runs the Laurbubble comedy channel. \u201cI still have to make myself think like a business, because I started this when I was a teenager for fun.\u201d     Matt Ley is an animator for other YouTubers while running his own Thelaserbearguy channel: \u201cIt\u2019s such new territory. That\u2019s why no one understands it. We don\u2019t as much as the TV exec don\u2019t! No one\u2019s covered this ground before.\u201d    YouTube delivers training on managing a business too, although Mormino is very clear that the service will not also boost the creators\u2019 earnings by promoting them \u2013 for example, bumping their videos to the top of its recommendations algorithm. She says: \u201cWe are not involved in promoting the content. That\u2019s not the business that we\u2019re in. We\u2019re a distribution platform, so what we try to do is to help people understand how best to leverage this opportunity.\u201d Butler offers more context, explaining that he regularly asks YouTube staff how he can get his videos recommended more often. \u201cWhen I have meetings with Google, I say \u2018how can I get to the next stage?\u2019 and they say \u2018I don\u2019t even know how the algorithm works!\u2019\u201d     Elisa Spigariol runs the doyouknowellie channel: \u201cI started in Italian then moved to England two years ago, so now it\u2019s bilingual. When I started it was just for fun, but now it\u2019s possible for YouTube to be your job.\u201d    Some of these young creators seem to understand it very well though. Animator Matt \u201cThelaserbearguy\u201d Ley gives me a two-minute blast of sharp insight into how YouTube works, explaining that the recommendation algorithm has moved on from the days when video views were the key metric. \u201cNow it\u2019s based on minutes watched and frequency of upload, so vloggers and let\u2019s say players who are uploading a video every day, or even three videos a day, are exploding, because of this frequency and the consistency with their watch-time,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you take YouTube in 2010 and 2011, you had a lot more filmmakers, musicians and animators: people who take longer to make shorter content, essentially. If you had an animated video that was two or three minutes long with 4m views, that was great. But things have changed. It\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, but that\u2019s how it is.\u201d         Mike Boyd\u2019s channel sees him learning new skills as quickly as possible: \u201cI\u2019m a one-man band and I intend to keep it that way as long as possible. The beauty of YouTube is that you have control over what you put out there.\u201d    The business of YouTubing Ley\u2019s insight into the dynamics of YouTube aren\u2019t unusual. These creators are likely to understand the ebb and flow of Google\u2019s online video service better than anyone.   Related: Your kids want to make Minecraft YouTube videos \u2013 but should you let them?    They also share an independent streak, which in 2016 appears to even extend to their wariness about working with a multi-channel network (MCN. These are companies that sign up young YouTube talents in their thousands, aggregating their views to attract brands and make them more money. At least, that\u2019s the promise. Yet while MCNs such as BroadbandTV and Maker Studios have some of YouTube\u2019s biggest stars on their books, at the level of the NextUp creators, there is more caution about this area. Most are staying independent or at least looking for a manager rather than a MCN. Baker Carly Holds says: \u201cI haven\u2019t joined a network: there seems to be nothing but bad things said about networks even from the big YouTubers. I get emails every single day saying \u2018join our network!\u2019 They\u2019re almost like spam. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem worth joining any network: they take more money off you \u2013 up to 50% of your earnings \u2013 and you don\u2019t get anything in return for it at this stage. If you\u2019re a huge YouTuber they can offer you more benefits and perks I suppose.\u201d     Carly Holds (left) runs a baking channel: \u201cI did this one-off chocolate balloon-bowls video, but I didn\u2019t think it would do very well. Now it\u2019s got 8.4m views.\u201d    Mike Boyd agrees: \u201cThey make it sound great, but I\u2019ve never heard a good review of the network side of things from a creator. I\u2019ve just avoided it: I can\u2019t imagine they would push my views or subscriber rate much more. But a manager, that\u2019s something I could definitely use: talking to businesses.\u201d YouTube isn\u2019t specifically encouraging young creators to avoid MCNs. However, some of its moves in recent years \u2013 from the launch of its online Creator Academy training materials to allowing channels to add Google ads to their videos \u2013 have removed some of the reasons for emerging channels to sign up with an MCN too early. \u201cMulti-channel networks oftentimes do the same work we do: they try to get the talent early on,\u201d Mormino says. \u201cBut we always leave it up to the creator. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge marketplace out there and the ecosystem has grown, and there are a lot of opportunities \u2013 so long as they ask the right questions and understand what is the advantage of joining an MCN.\u201d The NextUp class isn\u2019t shy of criticising YouTube either. For example, a session on music soundtracks generates a heartfelt group grumble about YouTube\u2019s Content ID system, which music rights holders can use to \u201cclaim\u201d videos using their songs, then either get them taken down or collect their advertising revenues. \u201cNine times out of 10, content creators haven\u2019t done anything wrong \u2026 There\u2019s no penalty for abusing it \u2026 Some people claim just to nick your monetisation,\u201d are among the comments from the group. A fortnight later, YouTube announced plans to change the way Content ID works to ensure creators don\u2019t miss out on revenues if they\u2019re hit with a wrongful claim.     Steven Bridges runs a street-magic channel: \u2018I\u2019d see magicians on TV and that was my goal when I was a kid. When YouTube came along, you didn\u2019t need TV as much, so I dived in ... You learn so much about yourself as a performer, because you have to constantly make new content.\u2019    Online love \u2026 and hate They may be business-savvy but are emerging YouTubers prepared for the slings and arrows of online fame? YouTube\u2019s comments section can be infamously toxic, with vloggers in particular sometimes attracting unpleasant personal abuse. There are no troll-taming lessons in the NextUp camp. Mormino says: \u201cI think when people put themselves out there, they are ready for what is going to come. They\u2019re very aware of what it means to be on social media, and what it means to be on a social platform.\u201d She cites the example of a popular YouTuber in India: \u201cShe always tells me that her community is so strong, whenever people say something that is mildly inappropriate or offensive, the community actually self-corrects that person. YouTube is like real life: you get people who like you and people who like you \u2026 less. Our creators are usually very well aware of that.\u201d     Adriana Braje started her beauty channel in Croatia before moving to the UK: \u201cWhen you look at celebrities and models in magazines, they all look so polished. That\u2019s not really real ... with the YouTube beauty community, people know we are just normal people sitting in our bedrooms.\u201d    When I talk to the British NextUp creators, they broadly stick to this line. \u201cThe people who subscribe to you and then stick with you week after week tend to be really nice and supportive. I don\u2019t think any creators have an inherently negative audience towards them,\u201d says Steven Bridges.   Related: Why are YouTube stars so popular?    \u201cOnce you develop a certain audience and a number of people who like what you do, they\u2019ll start defending you,\u201d agrees Lee. \u201cYou don\u2019t even have to have a huge channel to have people who will defend what you do.\u201d Johnson once attracted an angry mob of Little Mix fans who (mistakenly) thought one of the band was annoyed by her parody of their song Black Magic. \u201cI never reply, I just shrug,\u201d she says. Johnson certainly hasn\u2019t been put off: her latest video spoofs Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade. Lauren Hare, whose vlogs documented her 10-stone weight lossover three years, says she\u2019s only received two hate comments in the past year. \u201cI think it\u2019s because my channel\u2019s got quite a lot of vulnerability about it. The whole weight-loss thing is a touchy subject, and I think people aren\u2019t going to go and say anything negative,\u201d she says.     Lauren Hare documented her weight-loss journey on her loseitlikelauren channel: \u2018I remember the early days when you couldn\u2019t pick your thumbnail images, so you had three random shots of your face that were all equally disturbing!\u2019    \u201cThe only real negativity I get is people not believing that my before and after picture is me. Somebody once said: \u2018Oh, she\u2019s got a round nose in the first photo and a straight nose in the second. It\u2019s not the same person!\u2019. And I was just: \u2018There\u2019s eight years of footage. Go watch it\u2019.\u201d From musician Cameron Sanderson, who was told to \u201cgo die in a hole\u201d by one commenter when he was 12 \u2013 \u201cI just laughed!\u201d \u2013 to Holds (\u201cThe odd bad comment is just some eight year-old boy who fancies you\u201d), these creators certainly try to treat trolls as irritants. \u201cI do receive a lot of hate. I often get \u2018You are officially worse than cancer\u2019,\u201d says impressionist Philip Green. \u201cBut what do you do when they give you hate? Make something beautiful with it, like an opera.\u201d Green did exactly that on his channel. This is not to say YouTubers are immune to online hate. \u201cI ended up in a really bad website where people were commenting on me in a really stupid way,\u201d says Spigariol. \u201cFemales tend to be sexualised a lot on YouTube and you need to be very careful. If you\u2019re talking about feminism and start arguing with them, it\u2019s even worse.\u201d Ley sums it up: \u201cTV shows don\u2019t have a comments section, but on YouTube it\u2019s direct feedback to you. It\u2019s more like standup comedy: you\u2019re putting yourself out there and you\u2019re directly in the firing line. \u201cIt can be a good thing; you get the immediate positive responses. But then you can also get the immediate negative responses. Ten great comments is fine, but the one negative one is the one that may stay with you.\u201d            \u2018You\u2019ve got to dream big\u2019 At the very top end of YouTube fame, the likes of Felix \u201cPewDiePie\u201d Kjellberg \u2013 43.7 million channel subscribers, just under 12bn views and estimated annual earnings of $12m (\u00a38.2m) \u2013 show how lucrative online stardom can be. Further down, British vloggers such as Butler and Zoe \u201cZoella\u201d Sugg are evidence of a path towards book, brands and TV deals. The NextUp UK creators\u2019 ambitions are more grounded on the one hand. Many have set short-term goals such as reaching 100,000 subscribers by the end of 2016, while figuring out what level of income they might need to go full-time. \u201cIf I can find a way where I can make this my only thing \u2013 be 100% dedicated to it as a job \u2013 that would be a dream,\u201d says beauty vlogger Adriana Braje. \u201cBut it\u2019s a step-by-step: one thing at a time.\u201d     Laura Payne started her Laurbubble sketches channel before university: \u201c Slowly TV and more mainstream media are getting on to the vlogging bandwagon. You see Zoella posters in Superdrug now...\u201d    Sanderson adds: \u201cI can see a dream that I\u2019ve been trying to capture for a long time. The possibility, which is magical, of this potentially becoming my job,. He\u2019s already releasing music on iTunes, Spotify and his own Bandcamp store as well as through YouTube. \u201cOne of my first videos where I took this seriously has done the best, so I\u2019m always chasing the 7m views I got with that video,\u201d says Johnson. \u201cBeing able to do that with one video has set my sights: if I can do that again, that would be great.\u201d These creators are also thinking about the mainstream media. \u201cI want to get to 100,000 this year, but I want long-term growth: I want 1m subscribers on YouTube,\u201d says Maggy Woodley, whose Red Ted Art channel focuses on crafting \u2013 an area with few stars on traditional TV in the UK, bar Kirstie Allsopp. \u201cI would quite like to compete with Kirstie to be honest,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI\u2019d like people to think of me first before her when it comes to buying a craft book.\u201d     Maggy Woodley\u2019s Red Ted Art crafting channel started as a blog: \u201cI\u2019m attracting kids to watch my channel. They\u2019d probably like me more if I was 16. They\u2019d think I was cool! They like me but I\u2019m not cool, but I don\u2019t have a problem with it.\u201d    Carly Holds is similarly ambitious. \u201cI want to build my channel and get more and more subscribers. I want to bring out my own cookbook or baking book, and post that I really want to have my own TV cooking show. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge dream, but you\u2019ve got to dream big, haven\u2019t you?\u201d",
