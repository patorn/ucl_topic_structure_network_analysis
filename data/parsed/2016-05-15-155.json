  "body": "Roughly halfway through this free set at London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall, as will.i.am\u2019s 2013 song #thatPower segues into Snap\u2019s 1990 hit The Power, the rapper turned TV star turned tech\u00a0entrepreneur suddenly busts out\u00a0the dance steps from Snap\u2019s video,\u00a0to massive whoops. \u201cI was 13 when that came out,\u201d he says with fervent affection. \u201cThat music taught me to believe.\u201d There follows an impassioned speech on ambition, on how his band, the Black Eyed Peas, began as teenagers and believed they could do anything, despite the inevitable setbacks. It all panned out: starting off as a conscious rap crew, BEP have since sold multiple millions of records \u2013 despite, or perhaps because, of their decision to move into lowest common denominator fusions of hip-hop, Ibizan rave dynamics and big pop hooks. \u201cTonight is about a new dream,\u201d will.i.am concludes. \u201cI wanted to build AI, a crazy thing for a person from the projects.\u201d Hence AneedA Night Out \u2013 a free gig celebrating the launch of will.i.am\u2019s latest wearable tech, the \u201cdial\u201d (he\u2019d prefer you didn\u2019t call it a smartwatch), and its user interface, \u201cAneedA\u201d (at a guess, a cross between \u201cAnita\u201d and \u201cI need a\u2026\u201d).    Tonight\u2019s celebration of will.i.am-ness has a soupcon of Kanye West\u2019s The Life of Pablo fashion show-cum-party    The nation\u2019s capital is no stranger to free shows laid on by tech companies. Every September, Apple\u2019s largesse translates into a whole month of pop freeloading, known as the Apple (formerly iTunes) festival. This i.am+ event feels like a bonsai version, crossed with a film premiere \u2013 a \u201cred\u201d carpet (actually black) is staffed by futuristically dressed ushers. Adverts for the Three network play before the show starts. The last time will.i.am launched a product \u2013 the Puls smartcuff in 2014 \u2013 it didn\u2019t go so well. But AneedA turns out to be one of the better things about the entire night. The disembodied robot wisecracks between songs (\u201cI thought you were going to play It\u2019s My Birthday first,\u201d she intones; later, she chastises will.i.am for not burning enough calories). If any sharp-eared fans were wondering where they had heard her coo before, it becomes apparent near the end. AneedA\u2019s soothing British tones recall Britney Spears\u2019s heavily Auto-Tuned parts on Scream & Shout.\u00a0(Of course, you realise, a digital\u00a0assistant invented by will.i.am had to be an Auto-Tuned female.)         Watch the video for Feelin\u2019 Myself.    Tonight\u2019s 360-degree celebration of will.i.am-ness has a soupcon, too, of Kanye West\u2019s The Life of Pablo fashion show-cum-party. There is DJing, best skirted over, as it degenerates into wedding crowd-pleasing (Oasis, Eurythmics). Will.i.am later rings his mum up via his dial device. Famous friends and colleagues lend their time \u2013 Ricky Wilson reprises his Kaiser Chiefs hit I Predict a Riot, plus breakout crew WSTRN sing their 2015 hit, In2, while Tinie Tempah does his forgettable Girls Like song. We are sitting in the round, and it\u2019s like some fresh circle of hell reserved for Royal Variety light entertainment performances, not tech\u2019s cutting edge. Marking a reunion of sorts, apl.de.ap and Taboo of the Black Eyed Peas appear on stage in the final section for a run-through of some Peas hits \u2013 minus Fergie, whose role in the band seems unclear as they head into recording a new album. Instead, there\u2019s Lydia Lucy, will.i.am\u2019s latest Voice protege, wearing the sort of stupidly high heels that suggest a successful temp work role cannot be far off . She sings the Fergie parts on Where Is the Love? (still moving)\u00a0and\u00a0I Gotta Feeling (less so). The highlight is Taboo\u2019s anecdote about swearing in front of Prince. Prince makes them pray together, only to be told afterwards: \u201cPrince, you are the fucking shit.\u201d Occasionally a spark of wit, or a decent tune, gatecrashes this cybernetic Radio 1 roadshow. Now best understood as a gonzoid TV personality, will.i.am can still flow old school, recalling a time when hip-hop was a flurry of quick-witted syllables internal rhymes. Feelin\u2019 Myself, meanwhile, is a tune where you almost forgive all the inane aural clickbait he has been responsible for since the 00s (My Humps, say). The roll here on Feelin\u2019 Myself is relentless. There is, of course, an underlying message you can get behind \u2013 will.i.am exhorts parents in the audience to get their kids writing code. And one more potentially salient detail about dial that reports have not, thus far, focused on: will.i.am promises free streaming access to the entire music industry, bundled into the cost of his device.",
