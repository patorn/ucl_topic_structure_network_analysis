  "body": "The painting in the Royal Collection now known as The Negro Page (Lost in Showbiz, G2, 29 April) is more interesting historically than is recognised. It is an early example of the horse portraits so popular in Britain \u2013 and also of the renowned Barbary mounts so prized by Europeans in the 17th century. The kingdom of Morocco, then stretching far south, was famed for horsemanship and the horses, together with their handlers, mainly of north-west African origin, were celebrated for what became dressage, as in the Spanish Riding School. Similar figures are shown in Mytens\u2019 picture of Charles I \u201cdeparting for the chase\u201d, also in the Royal Collection and many other contemporary works. The \u201cpage\u201d depicted thus represents a highly skilled groom and not a decorative \u201cblackamoor\u201d. Incidentally, the Moroccan coronation gift to Victoria was a pair of horses, continuing the tradition.Jan MarshLondon \u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email guardian.letters@theguardian.com",
