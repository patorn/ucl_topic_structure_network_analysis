Red smoke and flames filled the sky behind him as he drove away. The wildfire has now burned more than half a million acres, and continues to spread. Most of Fort McMurray was spared destruction, but 2,400 homes fell to the fire, Sabovitch\u2019s included. That a wildfire would roll through this northern, boreal forest-shrouded oil boomtown was not inevitable, but it was not surprising either. \u201cWhen you look at satellite images of Fort McMurray from before and after the fire, you can see that because of the urbanisation that went on there, the city has encroached into the surrounding forestland,\u201d says Heiko Balzter, director of the Centre for Landscape and Climate Research at the University of Leicester.       Where there are forests, there are fires. In 1950, this same part of Canada was engulfed in a wildfire that burned for five months straight, putting nearly 4 million acres of forest up in smoke. \u201cSo this fire is not even huge by historic standards,\u201d says Stephen J Pyne, a fire expert and professor at Arizona State University. \u201cThe reason it\u2019s significant is that, unlike 1950, there\u2019s a relatively modern community right in the middle of it.\u201d There\u2019s no definitive list of the world\u2019s most fire-prone cities, mostly because of the many and often compounding factors that can increase the likelihood of fires. As well as the growing vulnerability caused by climate change and poor urban management, other factors range from the prevalence of dry vegetation and use of flammable building materials to widespread open-flame cooking and, all too frequently, arson. But there is one relatively straightforward indicator of fire risk that can be tracked and mapped. It\u2019s what researchers and foresters call the wildland-urban interface: areas where naturally fire-prone wilderness areas such as forests and shrublands are close to, or even intermingled with, housing developments, neighbourhoods or even \u2013 as in the case of Fort McMurray \u2013 entire cities. The US Forest Service recently released a detailed report and map of the country\u2019s wildland-urban interfaces, made by comparing satellite imagery with housing and population data from the US Census. In total, about one-third of its houses and population are in a wildland-urban interface zone, according to the report\u2019s lead author, Sebastian Martinuzzi from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge number,\u201d he says, attributing much of it to exurban sprawl and the desire to live close to nature in locations such as the fringes of Los Angeles, the \u201cfront range\u201d of Colorado, and exurban parts of Texas and Florida. Not all of these houses and people are at risk of a fire, Martinuzzi says, but many could be given the right conditions.     The devastated neighbourhood of Abasand in Fort McMurray.

Photograph: Reuters    For Fort McMurray, those conditions were created by the recent El Ni\u00f1o weather pattern, which caused much of Alberta to experience a drier-than-normal winter, then an earlier-than-normal fire season amid higher-than-normal temperatures. In Europe, the wildland-urban interface is also widespread, according to a new map created by a team led by Heiko Balzter. He says the abandonment of agricultural areas and the encroachment of shrublands are creating swathes of unmanaged land covered with abundant fuel for fires. Coupled with the growth of densely built suburban and tourist towns \u2013 notably in Lisbon and other parts of Portugal, Provence and southern France, coastal southern Spain and throughout Greece \u2013 the risk of destructive fires in these interface zones is high. \u201cThose areas of the Mediterranean are predicted to receive less rainfall in the future and become hotter,\u201d Balzter says. \u201cSo under climate change, leaving aside the whole issue of wildland-urban interface, this whole area is under higher risk from fire anyway.\u201d Fire has also been identified as one of the key \u201cresilience challenges\u201d in the metropolitan district of Quito, Ecuador, where seismic activity, floods and wildfires occur regularly. In 2012 alone, around 2,600 forest fires were reported there. The interrelatedness of the wildland-urban edge and climate change is well-known in Australia, too, where extreme weather is common and its major cities are often closely surrounded by mostly rural lands. Australia has suffered a number of devastating wildfires that have impacted many developed parts of the country, including the metropolitan areas of Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. The most recent of these major fires were the so-called \u201cBlack Saturday\u201d bushfires of 2009, on the outskirts of Melbourne. Fuelled by a long drought and exceptionally high temperatures, the fires burned more than half a million acres, destroyed more than 2,000 homes, and killed 173 people on a single day. They were the worst bushfires in the country\u2019s history, which is replete with destructive and deadly fires dating back more than 150 years.

The Great Fire of London in 1666 devastated the city north of the Thames, destroying more than 13,000 easily combustible timber-and-pitch homes. The Great Chicago Fire of 1871 destroyed an estimated 70,000 buildings \u2013 more than half of a city where not only the homes but also many of the roads and sidewalks were built of wood. And in the aftermath of the 1906 earthquake, the city of San Francisco burned for four days straight, destroying most of the city\u2019s wooden buildings and killing an estimated 3,000 people. A city built of mostly wooden structures is \u201cbasically a reconstituted forest\u201d, says Pyne, \u201cand so they burn exactly like a forest\u201d \u2013 spreading quickly and easily. These days, of course, less flammable building materials are much more widely used, better fire codes have been developed to guide building practices, and urban planners have established rules for reducing the spread of fire and easing access for robustly-equipped firefighters. As a result, cities across the developed world experience wildfires only very rarely. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking at modern cities of industrial society, it would take something like an earthquake or war to break down the system to the point where you have large urban fires,\u201d says Pyne. Outside these modern, developed cities, however, the risk of large fires rises significantly. \u201cWhat you\u2019re dealing with here is two types of wildfire: there\u2019s the \u2018western\u2019 fire, and there\u2019s the \u2018developing\u2019 fire,\u201d says Greg Bankoff, professor of history at the University of Hull and editor of Flammable Cities: Urban Conflagration and the Making of the Modern World.     Residents try to salvage their belongings after fire raged through a slum in Dhaka earlier this month, destroying around 70 family homes. Photograph: Abir Abdullah/EPA    Fire happens differently in the cities of the developing world, where pressures from urban growth are packing more people into sections of cities that are unable or unprepared to handle them during emergency situations. Informal settlements and shanty towns only increase the risk of fire, due to high population densities, a high prevalence of open flames and improvised stoves, wood- and scrap-based construction materials and a tightly packed urban footprint that allows fire to spread quickly. Bankoff says the statistics on fires in informal settlements aren\u2019t tracked well, but they\u2019re regular and often at a scale that affects thousands of residents. A fire last month in Delhi gutted 400 huts, while more recent fires destroyed the shanties of around 70 families in Dhaka, and more than 60 families in a S\u00e3o Paulo favela. A major township fire in Cape Town last year burned nearly 1,000 shacks and displaced roughly 4,000 people. \u201cI lost my entire savings,\u201d a slum dweller in south Delhi told the Deccan Herald after a fire in 2014 destroyed his home and 4,000 others. \u201cNothing much is left, except some clothes and slippers. All our identity proofs are also gone.\u201d Another fire the summer before burned 400 homes. Death by fire in the slums is a common occurrence. Any city with informal settlements is susceptible to large fires: \u201cCities in India, cities in Africa, you can take your pick really,\u201d Bankoff says. \u201cThey\u2019re all particularly fire prone.\u201d Go beyond the informal settlements, however, and the risk of multi-building fires drops significantly. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like there are two cities within a city,\u201d says Bankoff.     More than 22,000 people were left homeless by this fire which ripped through informal settlements in Manila in January 2004. Photograph: EPA     When people can afford flame-resistant building materials, when codes and plans guide development with fire risk in mind, when resources have been dedicated to respond to fires before they can spread, the large urban fire, spreading and displacing hundreds or even thousands, is rare if not unheard of. \u201cThe solution is really hardening the structures, changing the building patterns, altering the zoning arrangements so that the area\u2019s simply less susceptible to being hit with multiple fires like this,\u201d says Pyne. \u201cBut that\u2019s a hard sell. That\u2019s a political decision that has to be made.\u201d For the informal city to attain the same level of fire safety as the formal city, or for the exurban dwellers of the wildland-urban interface to be as safe as those in the central city, better policies and smarter land management is needed to control what gets built where, how it\u2019s built, and when the line between city and wilderness should be drawn firm. Unless development happens in a way that better recognises and plans around the risk of fire, some cities will continue to burn \u2013 with devastating consequences.
