  "body": "Born in Chicago in 1986, the musician and songwriter Ezra Furman played in the four-piece indie band Ezra Furman and the Harpoons between 2006 and 2011, before releasing his solo debut in 2012 with money raised on Kickstarter. The release of his third solo album, Perpetual Motion People, in 2015 brought him widespread critical acclaim and drew comparisons to the Velvet Underground and Jonathan Richman. Furman\u2019s effervescent, melodic power-pop frequently addresses his depression, Jewishness and gender-fluid identity. He will release a new EP in the summer, will be performing at Glastonbury, and will tour the UK\u00a0in October. 1 | Book The Argonauts by Maggie Nelson     \u2018It doesn\u2019t have to be a political betrayal to be domestic\u2019: on Maggie Nelson\u2019s Argonauts. Photograph: Deirdre O'Callaghan for the Guardian    This is a memoir but also academic queer\u00a0theory: it\u2019s about a woman dating a trans man, and they\u2019re trying to figure out if it\u2019s OK that they want to settle down and have a child \u2013 are they joining \u201cthe other side\u201d? It\u2019s really emotional and personal. I think there\u2019s a large worry\u00a0in\u00a0queer communities about imitating straight people, when queerness has its own identity and maybe can be a radical force that should be dismantling stuff that locks people into structures. But at the same time, everyone wants to be able to live their life, and it doesn\u2019t have to be a political betrayal just to be domestic. And\u00a0there\u2019s something kind of misogynist about the way some of Maggie\u2019s friends disdain motherhood. I may be somehow reacting to this, being off tour for a couple of months, at home with my significant other, tidying up, cooking \u2013 it\u2019s like, \u201cAm I\u00a0still cool right now?\u201d 2 | Band Slang     \u2018Terrifying and insane\u2019: Atlanta\u2019s Slang.    Slang are from Atlanta, Georgia and they opened for us when we played there. They\u2019re a four-piece rock\u2019n\u2019roll outfit, but the singer plays the character of a southern Baptist preacher, and it\u2019s terrifying and insane and he writes amazing songs. When they were playing, Sam, my drummer, leaned over to me and said, \u201cThis might be the best band I have ever seen,\u201d and I was like, \u201cI know.\u201d They have a self-titled album and every song is stunning. Nobody knows about this band and they\u2019re incredible. 3 | Documentary The Dog, directed by Allison Berg and\u00a0Frank Keraudren     \u2018He\u2019s really into his own legend of being a gay outlaw\u2019: The Dog by Allison Berg and Frank Keraudren. Photograph: Drafthouse Films    This is the real-life story of the guy [John Wojtowicz] from the movie Dog Day Afternoon, where Al Pacino robs a bank to pay for his lover\u2019s sex-change operation. The story and the real person are way more over the top than in the movie. It was one of the best documentaries I\u2019ve seen. He\u2019s a really compelling person: he\u2019s out of touch with\u00a0reality and is really into his own legend of robbing a bank and being a gay outlaw. When he got out of prison, his plan was to go to work at the bank he had robbed, as a security guard. He would show up there with a shirt that said, \u201cI robbed this bank\u201d, and sign autographs, and he was like, \u201cI\u2019m the guy! From the movie!\u201d He did not get that job, unsurprisingly. 4 | Podcast Sound Opinions I listen to this a lot. It\u2019s these two celebrated Chicago music critics and writers, Greg Kot and Jim DeRogatis. Part of it is just taking comfort in their Chicago accents. You\u2019d think these two middle-aged nerdy white guys would not be into experimental music and a bunch of hip-hop and soul, but they\u2019re totally adventurous in their listening. Like when Prince died: they don\u2019t just give you the hits, they look at the stuff that people don\u2019t usually talk about. When my debut record came out in 2007, we got our first bad review from one of those guys \u2013 and I like getting a bad review, that\u2019s helpful to me. They kind of make me mad, but I\u2019m still like, yeah, you know what, that could have been better. 5 | Web series Horace and Pete     \u2018Incredible acting and writing\u2019: Steve Buscemi, Louis CK and Edie Falco in Horace and Pete.    I\u2019m a big fan of Louis CK \u2013 I think he\u2019s a master of standup. He told the network, FX, doing his show Louie that he was going to go do something else. So, totally self-financed and without any approval from anyone, he made this 10-episode show, Horace and Pete, and released it on his website. It\u2019s dramatic and there\u2019s honestly not much comedy in it. I\u2019ve seen six or seven episodes and it seems like a tragedy \u2013 horrible things happen. It\u2019s exciting to see someone who\u2019s popular and doing well take a left turn and do something that\u2019s totally not what people\u00a0like them for. It\u2019s like theatre \u2013 there\u2019s some incredible acting and writing. One of the episodes is a 45-minute conversation sitting at a table, and nothing else. It\u2019s compelling\u00a0storytelling. 6 | Blog loveletterstorocknroll.com      This is a pretty new blog. The idea is that it\u2019s all positive reviews \u2013 anyone can write about anything related to rock\u2019n\u2019roll or pop music. I wrote a couple things for it. I really enjoy its approach as an outlet for gushing about music. I love it when people write rapturously about music they love. I like that it\u2019s pure love letters \u2013 most of them are in the form of letters to the actual people who made the music, or to a record store, or to a piece of music equipment. I love obsessive fandom because I\u2019m an obsessive fan who flips out over music.",
