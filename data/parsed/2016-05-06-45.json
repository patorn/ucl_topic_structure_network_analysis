  "body": "An ancient creature with a skull the shape of a vacuum attachment could have been one of the first plant-eating marine reptiles, researchers say. Dug up in Luoping County in the Yunnan province of China, the newly discovered fossils of the sea-dwelling creature Atopodentatus unicus, thought to have lived around 244 million years ago, suggest it had a \u201chammerhead\u201d skull, with two very different sets of teeth that allowed it to feed on underwater plant matter.    Related: It\u2019s all about the genitals: the secrets of fossil insects and amber    The findings overthrow previous conclusions drawn from the first Atopodentatus fossil reported in 2014 that suggested the creature, thought to be between 2.5 and three metres in length, had a drooping snout with a vertical, zipper-like arrangement of teeth. This peculiar feature, the researchers had concluded, was used rather like a flamingo\u2019s beak to rummage around the seabed for invertebrates to eat.

Published in the journal Science Advances by researchers from China, Scotland and the US, the new study was based on two newly unearthed fossil skulls boasting, as the scientists put it, \u201cremarkable jaw apparatus\u201d. The findings suggest that Atopodentatus is the earliest known herbivorous marine reptile.  Reminiscent of the business part of a vacuum cleaner, the \u201chammerhead\u201d skull featured a bank of chisel-shaped teeth along the top and bottom of its wide front edge that were used, the authors say, to scrape plant matter and algae off the rocky sea-bed. The resulting matter, suspended in the water, was then sucked by the creature into its mouth. As the water was then pushed out, the food was retained by a row of needle-shaped teeth acting as a filter. These teeth snaked around the side of the hammerhead and back along the narrow part of each jaw.

Chen, Institute of Vertebrate Palaeontology and Palaeoanthropology    Even in the new interpretation, Atopodentatus unicus is more than living up to its name which, loosely translated, means \u201cbizarre, unique arrangement of teeth\u201d. \u201cIn some ways it is even more bizarre now because instead of feeding on invertebrates it is a herbivore,\u201d said Nick Fraser of National Museums Scotland, who co-authored the research. \u201cThis is the earliest known record of herbivorey in a marine reptile.\u201d   Related: Tully Monster: mystery of the 300 million-year-old fossil finally solved    Around 95% of all marine life is thought to have been wiped out in the end-Permian extinction 252 million years ago. But the form and function of the Atopodentatus skulls, together with other findings from the same deposits, says Fraser, offers new insights into the rate at which life bounced back. \u201cThere is a great diversity of different feeding habits already developed 244 million years ago,\u201d he said. The mystery of Atopodentatus\u2019s head might have been solved, but according to Fraser there are plenty more where that came from. \u201cThere is other weird stuff still coming out these deposits,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is just the beginning of the story.\u201d",
