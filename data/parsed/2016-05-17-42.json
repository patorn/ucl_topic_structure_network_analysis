  "body": "The chairman of Standard Life has said that pay across the UK\u2019s financial services industry is too high, as more than a fifth of the insurer\u2019s shareholders voted against its boardroom pay deals. The Edinburgh-based company, which held its annual meeting in London for the first time, said 22.3% of shareholders voted against the remuneration report for 2015. The protest vote would have been bigger had it not been for Standard Life\u2019s announcement last week that its new chief executive, Keith Skeoch, would reduce his potential \u00a33.5m long-term bonus by \u00a3700,000. The group\u2019s chairman, Sir Gerry Grimstone, said the vote \u201cdoes [send a message]. A number of companies have been sent a message this year.\u201d Meanwhile, nearly 26% of investors opposed the annual remuneration report of office provider Regus on Tuesday, and 17% voted against its forward-looking pay policy. Several major companies have suffered far bigger protest votes over executive pay in recent weeks, including BP, Smith & Nephew, Shire, Weir Group and Anglo American. Grimstone said a number of shareholders had already voted before the announcement on Skeoch\u2019s bonus reduction \u2013 which he insisted was an entirely voluntary decision \u2013 and that some investors subsequently changed their minds and recast their votes. About 90% of Standard Life\u2019s 1.2 million small shareholders \u2013 who account for half of all investors \u2013 backed the remuneration report. Grimstone met 11 major investors in the last 10 days to explain to them why the company had raised Skeoch\u2019s performance-based pay compared to his predecessor David Nish, while paying him a lower basic salary than Nish. He had pointed to competitive pressure and Standard Life\u2019s transition from an insurance company to a global investment company, which proved persuasive with some of them, he said. One private shareholder, Anthony Lee, said at the meeting: \u201cOne would be ungracious not to applaud Keith Skeoch for handing some of his bonus back.\u201d But he added: \u201cThese are still very high rates of bonuses and [they are] given in the annual report with a lack of clarity which sometime you should get a prize for.\u201d Several shareholders raised concerns at the meeting that Nish, who stood down last August, continued to be paid his \u00a3835,000 salary and all other benefits until June. Grimstone said this was a contractual matter. He told journalists that another contentious issue was the \u00a3700,000 share award to executive director Colin Clark, who has been promoted to the board. The chairman told shareholders at the annual meeting: \u201cMy personal view is that pay in financial services is too high \u2026 There is downward pressure on pay and I think that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d Speaking to media later, he called for something akin to \u201cmultilateral nuclear disarmament\u201d \u2013 arguing that Standard Life cannot go it alone in lowering executive pay if it wants to attract the best talent. He added: \u201cThe pay climate is tightening and I think will continue to tighten.\u201d",
