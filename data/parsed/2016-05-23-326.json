No marriage with Muslims.\u201d The post was erected in late March by Buddhist residents of the village in Myanmar\u2019s lush Irrawaddy delta region who signed, or were strong-armed into signing, a document asserting that they wanted to live separately. Since then a couple of other villages across the country have followed suit. Small but viciously insular, these \u201cBuddhist-only\u201d outposts serve as microcosms of the festering religious tensions that threaten Myanmar\u2019s nascent experiment with democracy.

Photograph: Poppy McPherson for the Guardian    After decades of military rule, Myanmar has entered a new era. As state counsellor, Aung San Suu Kyi is in charge, though key institutions remain under the army\u2019s control. Recent weeks, however, have brought a surge in nationalist activity. Scores rallied outside the US embassy in Yangon last month to demand diplomats stop using the word Rohingya to describe millions of Muslims confined to internal displacement camps and villages in western Myanmar. Nationalists insist the group are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh. The few public comments Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy (NLD) has given on the issue have not been encouraging. Aung San Suu Kyi reportedly instructed the new US ambassador not to use the term \u201cRohingya\u201d. The new minister for religion, the former general Thura Aung Ko, recently called Muslims and Hindus \u201cassociate citizens\u201d. The fact that nationalist rhetoric has gone unchallenged \u2013 and has in some cases been echoed \u2013 by the new government has left some wondering what place the country\u2019s minorities have in its future. Thaungtan is a small village of about 700 people, mostly farmers. At the end of a long dirt road flanked by tall grass and banana trees, it is extremely isolated. Recently, residents formed the Patriotic Youth Network, a nationalist group that says it is dedicated to developing the village \u2013 and keeping it out of \u201cforeign hands\u201d. At the local monastery, a young monk with piercing black eyes named Ma Ni Ta sits unsmiling as villagers clamour to explain the new sign. \u201cThe village has talked and seen that the NLD didn\u2019t do anything on the religious matter,\u201d he says. It has fallen to the village to handle the mission to \u201cprotect religion\u201d themselves, he claims.     A young monk, Ma Ni Ta, pictured at the monastery in Thaungtan village, Myanmar. Photograph: Poppy McPherson for the Guardian    In early 2015 a stranger moved to Thaungtan. According to the villagers\u2019 version of events, he initially got along well with his neighbours. He said he was Hindu. Then he started buying land. That\u2019s when they jumped to the conclusion that he must be Muslim. \u201cIt\u2019s like ghosts. We have never seen a ghost but we\u2019re afraid,\u201d says one villager, with a rueful laugh. He was part of a small minority who opposed the sign, he says, asking not to be named for fear of reprisals. Members of the Patriotic Youth Network found that not all of the new arrival\u2019s family had identity cards. \u201cThey might have sneaked in from Bangladesh,\u201d claims Ma Ni Ta. \u201cIf we live together, we might have some problems with donations and religious ceremonies.\u201d Kyaw San Win was the stranger who came under suspicion. A stocky 28-year-old with large, long-lashed eyes, he stands in his cousin\u2019s drinks shop in Yangon, three hours\u2019 drive from Thaungtan. He points at a small Buddha statue on a shelf and explains how his family follow both Buddhist and Hindu traditions. Kyaw San Win says he was living in Yangon when his elderly father decided to retire to the countryside. Kyaw San Win\u2019s cousin suggested his wife\u2019s village: Thaungtan. They bought and renovated an old wooden house. The monks and villagers were immediately unfriendly, he says. After they bought another piece of land, planning to open a teashop, he and his wife got an urgent call from his father. \u201cPlease, my son,\u201d he said. \u201cPlease come back to the village because the villagers and the monks, they don\u2019t really want us to live here.\u201d At the monastery, they were told that residents didn\u2019t want kalar, an offensive term for Muslims, in their village. \u201cI ate pork in front of them,\u201d Kyaw San Win recalls with an exasperated laugh. \u201cThey said I was just pretending so I could do some mission, like jihad.\u201d Later he says members of the Patriotic Youth Network warned him: \u201cSomeone may come and burn your house down.\u201d Then groups of young men took to walking and running around the house at all hours. They revved motorbikes outside. According to Kyaw San Win, the village administrator said he could not guarantee their security. So they left the village, eventually selling the home last month. Around the same time, pictures on Facebook showed members of the Patriotic Youth Network standing beside their new sign. \u201cEvery religion, every person, should be able to live in every part of the country,\u201d says San Htay, Kyaw San Win\u2019s cousin. \u201cEvery person should be under the same law \u2026 The nationalist guys want to rule the village.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re really lucky we are Buddhist,\u201d adds Kyaw San Win. \u201cIf we were Muslim there would be a conflict in that village.\u201d Recently it has seemed to some as though Myanmar could again be teetering on the verge of religious violence. After the disappointment of last November\u2019s election, nationalist groups, who backed the losing military-backed Union and Solidarity party, are again making noises. \u201cNow that the post-election dust has settled, it\u2019s business as usual for religious extremists throughout the country,\u201d says Matthew Smith, executive director of the human rights organisation Fortify Rights. \u201cWithout a stronger counter-movement, this brand of religious discrimination will continue to flourish. Violence is inevitable.\u201d The Patriotic Youth Network in Thaungtan denies links to extremist nationalist organisation Ma Ba Tha, which has waged an anti-Muslim hate campaign in recent years. The firebrand monk Ashin Wirathu has been accused of inciting deadly riots through his Facebook page, where he posts unsubstantiated rumours about Muslims. A spokesperson for the religious affairs ministry says he has not heard about \u201cno-Muslim\u201d villages. \u201cBasically [complaints] should come from the regional level,\u201d he said. He could not be reached to answer further questions. The NLD is in a precarious position. Hatred of the Rohingya penetrates all levels of society. Recently, local magazine the Irrawaddy, which is run by human rights activists, published a cartoon that featured a dark-skinned half-naked man holding a sign that said \u201cboat people\u201d. When students from the Yangon School of Political Science held a small peace march across the city, a few dozen men, women and children carried banners saying: \u201cAccept Diversity. Promote Tolerance.\u201d Police said they planned to charge the activists with unauthorised protest.     Myanmar Taxi driver Nanda Kyaw has scars on his left arm from a beating. Photograph: Aung Naing Soe for the Guardian    Nanda Kyaw, a Muslim taxi driver who was beaten outside Shwedagon Pagoda, from which Islamic vendors were evicted a few weeks earlier, says he is still getting headaches.  \u201cI have to drive every day for my survival,\u201d says the slight 31-year-old. At least once a day, he says, a would-be passenger waves him on when they see his goatee. But the attack in April came as a surprise. A group of young people wound down their windows and shouted racist abuse, he said, they swerved in front of his car and beat him with iron rods. They left him bleeding from his mouth and head. \u201cSome people stopped their cars and watched a little bit. It\u2019s because it was a problem between a Muslim guy and a Buddhist guy; they are afraid.\u201d He declines to have his picture taken, for fear of inflaming tensions. Kyaw San Win feels the same. It\u2019s the reason his family have not pursued charges against the people who hounded them from the village. Besides, he says, they wouldn\u2019t want to move back now. \u201cThe people, they are very narrow-minded, we don\u2019t want to live with them,\u201d his cousin says.
