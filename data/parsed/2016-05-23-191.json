  "body": "The question \u201cIs Jeremy Corbyn art?\u201d hasn\u2019t been asked very often. Most people are still trying to answer the deeper question: \u201cIs Jeremy Corbyn politics?\u201d But for 21-year-old fine art student Lucie Carter, who staged a hoax talk by the Labour leader last week, defending the relationship between the two turned into a full-time occupation. Corbyn didn\u2019t attend Carter\u2019s event, which was held at Lancaster University. But a cardboard box daubed with the words \u201cJeremy Corbyn\u201d did. It\u2019s an approach the artist calls \u201cobject-oriented ontology\u201d. Unfortunately, local Labour MP Cat Smith didn\u2019t see what was so funny about object-oriented ontology. \u201cPeople turned up at the event \u2013 Labour supporters and party members,\u201d Smith complained. \u201cThey paid for parking and childcare, time off work and incurred an expense for an event that wasn\u2019t happening,\u201d she said. The furore spread across the internet. Was it a) art, b) justified, c) necessary to get angry about it even if it wasn\u2019t? We asked the non-cardboard Lucie about all three.

I\u2019ve got a body of developmental work behind it.\u2019 Photograph: Lucie Carter    Hi Lucie. For them what don\u2019t know, what is object-oriented ontology?  It\u2019s this theory to do with the privileging of non-human objects over actual humans. It\u2019s about what happens when you view all objects as equal. When did you first realise you wanted to put Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s name on a box?  It wasn\u2019t a flash decision. I\u2019ve got a body of developmental work behind it. I\u2019ve got this huge installation of boxes with celebrities\u2019 names painted on the side. The box could have been anyone \u2013 it wasn\u2019t really to do with Jeremy Corbyn. But I think if I had put Kim Kardashian\u2019s name on it, some of the realism would have gone out in terms of people attending. What other celebs are on these boxes?  I\u2019ve got one that has got Johnny Depp\u2019s name on the side, but I got my Js mixed up, so it\u2019s an L. It says \u201cLohnny Depp\u201d. Lionel Richie. Beyonc\u00e9. Gordon Ramsay. How do you choose who gets to be on the box?  Completely at random. When did you first realise the Corbyn thing was taking off more than you had intended?  I think it was at the point I received a phone call off Cat Smith, the MP. She wanted me to delete the event from the internet listings, so I did. But you still held the event. What was the reaction? Were people disappointed to learn they weren\u2019t going to get a one-hour lecture on Nye Bevan\u2019s attitudes to international solidarity?  They all turned up knowing that it was the cardboard, not the actual Jeremy Corbyn. When I was there, [there were] in total, probably like five people \u2013 two of whom were viewers, the others came with me. The viewers all thought it was funny. They had a selfie with it. And then \u2026 it was over. What happened next?  I just went to pick it up, then walked back to the studio with it, put it there. Are you going to keep the box permanently? It\u2019s your The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living [AKA Damien Hirst\u2019s formaldehyde shark].  I suppose you could say that. What is it worth now that it has been the centre of an art-world controversy?  I dunno. I really know nothing about the art market. What has the reaction been within the university?  Well, I would just like to point out that a few people have said in passing that I was trying to promote an art event at the last minute, as though I hadn\u2019t done any work and panicked. But that\u2019s not true \u2013 the artwork included the hoax and the reactions to it. It was as much about art\u2019s subjectivity and the stigma against art as a degree. Do you like Jeremy Corbyn?  I don\u2019t really keep up with politics, but he seems like a decent lad, yeah. I like his policies to do with education. And the arts. What sort of art do you think he likes?  Dunno. Soviet realism, and then he probably has a calendar of Monet\u2019s waterlilies?  Sounds about right.",
