  "body": "\u201cEverybody has to eat!\u201d Cinzia, is sitting at her sunny kitchen table, reading glasses on the end of her nose, telling me about her pasta al forno, or baked pasta. It is a dish I have enjoyed many times in her kitchen, the table extended as long as it can go and pushed back so as to leave a Cinzia-sized gap from which she can serve however many of us \u2013 and we are usually many \u2013 a plate of pasta. I have a photograph somewhere, of Cinzia mid-serve, a cord of melted mozzarella stretching from oven dish to plate in everyday symbolism, my son Luca leaping up like a small dog trying to get at it. Back at her table, a generously sized lemon tree almost poking through the kitchen door like a nosy neighbour, Cinzia explains why her pasta al forno is as it is, how over years of cooking for her family and crowds she has settled on the simplest version, just pasta with good tomato sauce, basil, lots of mozzarella and pecorino. It is the most relaxed \u2013 you could say deconstructed \u2013 of the baked pasta family, a big, generous, unfussy dish to feed many. There is no meat, egg, bechamel, chilli or breadcrumbs, even though they are good additions, as they might not agree with everyone \u2013 and everyone has to eat! Her version means that young, old, vegetarian or particular can eat, because everyone likes pasta, tomato sauce and mozzarella, don\u2019t they? I nod, and so does the lemon tree. Cinzia reminds me of my Granny in that she is a great shopper \u2013 sharp and particular; in fact we met at the old Testaccio market, years ago. I remember her, glasses on her nose, examining and sniffing tomatoes (don\u2019t buy a tomato unless it smells like a tomato, she says). We became friends, and I began spending hours sitting in her kitchen. She is a good and careful cook: not precious, just lots of attention for simple tasks, making sure ingredients are at the right ripeness and temperature, careful prep, cooking that seems like coaxing so as to bring out the best in things. The saying \u201cfood is love\u201d is true with Cinzia, and the reason why her food, which seems set out to please rather than impress, tastes so good. Back in my kitchen, her baked pasta has become a firm fixture, especially for almost-summer weekends \u2013 long, slow days when windows are wide and routines go out of them, so something made earlier to bake and eat whenever is welcome. Not only can it be made in advance, once baked, this pasta will sit patiently, which is why it is such a trusted one for a crowd, the baseline to a buffet that might roll on and on. Cinzia\u2019s recipe lends itself to all sorts of variations. You could add meat either as ragu or tiny meatballs, bechamel, fried chunks of aubergine, hard-boiled eggs \u2013 it really is up to you. Treat the recipe below as a basic template, which you can then fancy up. Be particular about ingredients and find a decent quantity of pasta with ridges to collect sauce, and good tomatoes.  Fry the onion slowly with a pinch of salt in good extra-virgin olive oil: you are laying foundations. Then cook the tomatoes until the flavours are concentrated, which will take more or less time depending on the tomatoes. Mozzarella should be firmed up, so at least a couple of days old. Basil, a fragrant and ballsy keynote of summer, is important: you want a bunch with fleshy, floppy leaves that give out an almost violently rich smell as you rip them. If you serve the baked pasta very hot, the melted mozzarella pulls into great long strings. Wait a while and the stretches may not be quite so impressive, but the flavour is better. Italians are often happy to eat this quite cool, and they are generally plate separatists; one thing at a time. I love a great pile of green salad with this, a mix of crisp and bitter leaves, herbs, possibly a flower, dressed with olive oil, salt, and lemon from Cinzia\u2019s nosy tree. The last portion of pasta, eaten a few hours later straight from the dish, is possibly the best. Pasta al forno di Cinzia (Cinzia\u2019s baked pasta) Keeping in mind everyone has to eat, you could make this with gluten-free pasta, and no cheese, just make sure the tomato sauce is superb and there is lots of wine to drink. Serves 4\u20136A small white onion1.2kg ripe tomatoes or 3 x 400 g tins of good quality peeled plum tomatoes5 tbsp extra virgin olive oilSaltA pinch of dried red chilli flakes (optional)500g short pasta: mezze maniche, rigatoni, penne, or macaroni work well500g mozzarella, drained100g parmesan or pecorinoA handful of fresh basilBreadcrumbs (optional) 1 Take an onion and chop it finely. Prepare the tomatoes. If you are using fresh ones, peel them by plunging them into boiling water for a minute, then cold water, at which point the skins should slip away, then chop them roughly. If you are using tinned plum tomatoes, use scissors to snip them up in the tin. 2 Warm the oil in a large, heavy-based pan, add the onion and a pinch of salt and cook gently until soft and translucent. Then add the tomatoes, and chilli, bring to a gentle boil and then reduce to a simmer for 20\u201330 minutes (adding the basil in the last 5 minutes), stirring every now and then, until the sauce is rich and thick. You can leave the sauce as is, pass it through the food mill or blast it cautiously with an immersion bender so it is smooth. Taste and add salt. If the sauce is slightly sharp, redress the balance with a little sugar.

Check the cooking time on the packet, then divide this in half as you want the pasta half-cooked. Set the timer. When it goes off, drain quickly. Mix the pasta with half the tomato sauce, and set the rest aside. Slice the mozzarella and grate the parmesan or pecorino. 4 Oil an ovenproof dish, make a layer of pasta and sauce, then zig-zag over a little more sauce. Make a layer of mozzarella, with a few basil leaves, then sprinkle over some cheese. Repeat the layers until you have finished all the ingredients, but finish with a healthy layer of sauce and parmesan \u2013 with breadcrumbs too if you like. 5 Bake in a preheated oven at 180C/350F/gas mark 4 for 20 minutes, or until the sides bubble, the edges of the pasta are crisp and the top is crusty and golden. Eat hot, or at room temperature.
