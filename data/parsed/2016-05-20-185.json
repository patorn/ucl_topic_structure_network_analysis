  "body": "1: Saint Ludmila Despite the popularity of many of his orchestral pieces, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k\u2019s choral works tend to be overlooked. But the Hall\u00e9\u2019s Dvo\u0159\u00e1k festival ends with a rare outing for this oratorio, which chronicles Christianity\u2019s spread through pagan lands. It will be sung in a new translation by David Pountney; Mark Elder conducts. Bridgewater Hall, Manchester, Sat 2: Il Barbiere Di Siviglia Glyndebourne\u2019s season opens with a revival of one of the most sumptuous of its recent shows, David McVicar\u2019s staging of Wagner\u2019s Die Meistersinger (Sat to 27 Jun), as well as this brand new version of an old favourite.

La Fura dels Baus\u2019s production comes to the Royal Opera from Brussels; Leo Hussain conducts a strong cast, headed by Johan Reuter.

Lyric Hammersmith, W6, Mon, Tue, Thu & Fri, to 28 May 5: English Music Festival The supply of neglected early 20th-century works shows no sign of waning. This year there\u2019s a focus on Butterworth, a century after his death on the Somme. Various venues, Oxfordshire, Thu to 30 May",
