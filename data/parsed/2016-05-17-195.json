  "body": "Helen is playing a game that involves massacring a screen full of animated fish on her mum\u2019s phone. \u201cYes it\u2019s fun!\u201d she says, but there\u2019s an underlying sadness to this \u2013 her mother used to play it with the sound up to soothe the children to sleep at night in a Turkish refugee camp. Now 13, Helen was eight years old when war broke out in Syria. Her parents, Abu Ali and Hala, were frontline revolutionary activists in Aleppo. Her father, a rebel commander, was captured by Isis. His wife confronted the local Isis leader to bargain for his release, but without any luck. The family still doesn\u2019t know if he\u2019s dead or alive, but Hala drinks a cup of coffee for him every morning and talks to pictures of him saved on her mobile phone. Helen, along with her mother, her solemn older brother, Mohammed, and her mischievous younger sisters, Farah and Sara, left Syria to seek refuge in Germany. In 2015, the family applied for refugee status and were granted it. They flew from Turkey to Germany and now live in the sleepy town of Goslar. They are the subject of a documentary, Children on the Frontline: The Escape, which aired on Channel 4 last week. Far away from her homeland, Helen says her life\u2019s mission is to become an architect. \u201cI want to go back to Syria and build everything. Aleppo is broken \u2013 all of Syria is broken,\u201d she says. While they were still at home, fighting against the forces of President Bashar Al-Assad, the family moved between different bombed-out apartment blocks in a once middle-class suburb of Aleppo. It\u2019s the stuff of horror films \u2013 apartments without walls, crumbling staircases that could give way at any second, days without water or electricity. The children were shot at as they played on the balcony and survived night after night of shelling and barrel bombs near their home. For Helen, it\u2019s not just upsetting to see the once-beautiful ancient city reduced to rubble, it\u2019s also a reminder of how many people have died during the five years of fighting. \u201cIt\u2019s now really dangerous,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen pictures and it\u2019s hard to look at them. There are so many people who\u2019ve died. My best friend died \u2013 that\u2019s hard for me. I saw so many people my age dying and you cannot forget their faces. \u201cAleppo was an old city and it\u2019s really beautiful. We have so many beautiful things \u2026\u201d She brightens up. \u201cWhen you go there, there is a restaurant in the citadel, oh my God, you have to go and eat there! And they have really delicious chocolate.    What I learned in Syria is when you want to do something, don\u2019t think about tomorrow, you think about today  Helen     \u201cI would build everything,\u201d she continues. \u201cThe mosque, the church, the buildings \u2026 I\u2019d build it so it was better \u2013 with work. I\u2019ll have to see when the war is finished.\u201d After five years of civil war, Isis violence, al-Nusra bombings, government airstrikes, Russian airstrikes, US airstrikes, French airstrikes, British airstrikes, it\u2019s impossible to tell when peace will be restored and the young Syrian diaspora will be able to return. \u201cWhat I learned in Syria is when you want to do something, don\u2019t think about tomorrow, you think about today,\u201d Helen says. \u201cIn the next second or the next minute you\u2019re going to die. I only think about this moment.\u201d One thing she knew she could do to help other children in the thick of fighting was continue their education, and she single-handedly ran classes for 25 children in Aleppo. With her father\u2019s help, and the reclaimed notebooks and pencils he took from his children\u2019s flattened school, Helen would teach maths to the class when she was just 10 years old. That stopped when Isis militia plundered and burned down the house she was teaching in.

When Bashar is out from Syria, everything will be OK,\u201d she says. \u201cBut we now have so many Bashars \u2013 so many. The guy who used to work with my father in the Free Syria Army who turned him in to Isis, he is the biggest Bashar.\u201d Helen\u2019s father may be absent, but his influence is still powerful. The pride he had in his country has manifested itself in all his children. \u201cHe inspired me to dream to become an architect,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I cannot draw.\u201d All four siblings intend to go back to Syria. Sara wants to look after children, Farah wants to fight with the Free Syrian Army (\u201cShe is a boy,\u201d Helen says), and Mohammed wants to be a psychologist. There will be a great need for psychologists in the new Syria. The mental health toll on Syrians is immense. Dubbed \u201cthe silent crisis\u201d, the International Medical Corps (IMC) found that 54% of displaced people they treated in Syria and surrounding countries suffered from severe emotional disorders, including depression and anxiety. Among children treated by the IMC in Lebanon, Syria and Turkey, 26.6% suffered from epilepsy and the same number had intellectual and developmental disorders.    Related: Syria's peace talks need more women at the table    Hala recalls the impact the war had on her children. \u201cBack when we were on the frontline we didn\u2019t have any electricity and it was all darkness and candlelight. Once we were outside and I saw my son in daylight for the first time he was so traumatised that he had a permanent yellowness on his face,\u201d she says. \u201cWe took the children to the hospital to get them checked out, and they saw bodies with intestines hanging out and limbs blown off. The hospital traumatised them more \u2013 that can destroy a child forever.\u201d There\u2019s a scar the size of a 5p piece on the fourth finger of Helen\u2019s left hand from a botched saline drip, and she has scars from shrapnel on her calf. When she was at a demonstration with her father and brother, someone shot at Mohammed. Thankfully he was standing with his legs apart, so the bullet sailed between his legs, but it burnt the tip of his penis. Helen stifles a laugh as she tells the story. Typical sister.

Helen is planning on coming back to the UK to speak to parliament, and there are plans for the family to work with the UN. \u201cKids will have a big role to play,\u201d says Hala. \u201cThey will rebuild Syria. The children are here to make it not what it was, but better.\u201d Join our community of development professionals and humanitarians. Follow @GuardianGDP on Twitter.
