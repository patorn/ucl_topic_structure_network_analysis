Leicester was transformed into a sea of blue on Tuesday as thousands of fans climbed statues, danced in the street and revelled in the fairytale feat of their underdog heroes. In scenes expected to continue well beyond Saturday, when Leicester City will be formally presented with the Premier League trophy, supporters mobbed the club\u2019s coach as it made its way across the east Midlands city. The Leicester City manager, Claudio Ranieri, was besieged by members of the media and fans when he arrived at the club\u2019s Belvoir Drive training ground, hailing his side\u2019s success as the highlight of his long career. Asked what his first top flight title meant to him, the Italian replied: \u201cIt means the job is good. I\u2019m very happy now. Maybe if I had won this title at the beginning of my career I would have forgot. But now I am an old man, I can celebrate.\u201d     Jamie Vardy with his lookalike, Lee Chapman.

The coach sounded its horn as it was chased by flag-waving fans.

Speaking to the Guardian minutes before he was whisked away, Chapman said he was \u201clost for words\u201d at his team\u2019s season. \u201cI\u2019ve not slept. I went in for work at 6.30am and ran my round so I could be here outside the stadium. I\u2019m still supposed to be at work now,\u201d he said.           \u2018Walt Disney wouldn\u2019t script this\u2019 \u2013 Leicester City champions    Chapman, a lifelong Leicester City fan who, at 29 years old and 5ft 10in, is the same age and height as Vardy, was spotted as a lookalike outside the club\u2019s stadium eight months ago. Since then, he has been recruited for a Channel 4 documentary, appeared on Sky\u2019s Soccer AM and taken thousands of selfies with fans. \u201cI\u2019m not even a confident lad. I\u2019m lost for words at the fact Leicester have won. I\u2019m a Leicester born, Leicester raised, Leicester fan,\u201d he said.     Fans holding scarves line the streets of Leicester. Photograph: Plumb Images/Leicester City FC/Getty    The club shop ran out of replica shirts by lunchtime as hundreds of fans descended on the stadium to carry on the party. Steve Hurst, 43, waved a giant blue flag as supporters posed for pictures with his three-year-old cocker spaniel, Daisy, bedecked in a child\u2019s replica shirt. His 12-year-old son Leicester Hurst \u2013 named after the club \u2013 was not allowed a day off school, but will be with his dad for Saturday\u2019s celebrations. \u201cNot just Nottingham\u2019s on the map \u2013 Leicester\u2019s on the map now,\u201d he said. Walking back from the stadium after renewing their season tickets, Philip Parkinson, 75, and his son Rob, 42, called for streets to be named and statues to be put up in honour of their unlikely heroes. \u201cI\u2019d like to see Ranieri Walk \u2013 but that could wait until we pick up the Champions League,\u201d said Philip, a season ticket holder for more than 20 years. It was not only football fans revelling in the moment. Liz Gray, 58, cycled to the stadium because she felt \u201centhused\u201d by the history making title victory and its effect on the city. \u201cI\u2019m not a football fan at all but this has really inspired me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s great for the city to have something to celebrate. It\u2019s great for people to have common events. I\u2019ve been caught up in it.\u201d The team bus, with Chapman on board, made its way to the upmarket San Carlo restaurant in Leicester city centre, where hundreds of fans gathered as news of their impending arrival spread. Outside the restaurant, nine-year-old Louis Goodge weaved through the crowds for a glimpse of his heroes. His Leicester-born parents, Ellie and Joe Goodge, took Louis and his younger sister Ivy, six, out of school and drove from Hertfordshire so they could be part of the amazing story. \u201cLouis has only just started watching football this season. It\u2019s inspiring, the fact that anyone, not just big teams, can do it,\u201d said Ellie, as her son beamed. \u201cI\u2019ve just seen Kasper Schmeichel,\u201d he said excitedly. At the headquarters of Leicester city council, a team of officials has been secretly planning a party for months, although no details have yet been revealed.

Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Guardian    \u201cIt will be a big, big, big party \u2013 probably even bigger than Jamie Vardy\u2019s party,\u201d said the youthful deputy mayor, Rory Palmer, on Tuesday. \u201cThe city\u2019s never seen anything like this. The spontaneous stuff last night gives us an indication of how big it will be \u2013 possibly the biggest party in Leicester\u2019s history.\u201d Perhaps the only confirmed detail of Saturday\u2019s extravaganza is that the Leicester City superfan Steve Worthy will have the honour of handing the Premier League trophy to his team before their game against Everton at the King Power. Worthy, a part-time happy hardcore DJ and season ticket holder, won a special competition organised by sponsors Barclays. He was watching Monday night\u2019s game between Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur with his 97-year-old grandmother, Gladys Kenny, and their wider family when the former Leicester City player Muzzy Izzet turned up on his doorstep with the Premier League trophy and a camera crew. \u201cThe family and friends were all round. There was a knock at the door. I opened the door and the first thing I saw was the cup \u2013 I didn\u2019t even notice it was Muzzy Izzet holding it as well, one of my all-time idols,\u201d he said. \u201cI got to hold it, beautiful cup that it is. What an amazing moment.\u201d Gladys was the original season ticket holder until she reluctantly gave it up two years ago due to ill health. But she will be at the game on Saturday as Worthy presents the silverware to Leicester\u2019s towering captain, Wes Morgan.  In their more than 130 years, Leicester City had previously never won the top division nor FA Cup; they have lost four FA Cup finals. But the \u00a322m team has outshone rivals with constellations of stars costing 10 times as much. Next season, with Champions League football guaranteed, the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich could be visiting the King Power. It is a proud moment for the east Midlands as a whole, not just for Leicester, Worthy said, as he reeled off the city\u2019s previously best-known talents: \u201cKasabian. And, er, whatshisname \u2013 Engelbert Humperdinck. Showaddywaddy. David Attenborough. But apart from that, nothing else.

It can only mean good things for the future.\u201d",
