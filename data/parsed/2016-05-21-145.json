  "body": "I am a local government manager and proud of it, working for a local unitary authority in the north. Reading some of the red tops, though, I wonder if they are talking about the same sector as me.  It\u2019s just not true that we are lazy and own gold-plated pensions, as the Sun suggests. Reading an Express article last year that regurgitated something from the Taxpayers\u2019 Alliance about the amount spent by councils on biscuits led to accusations from friends that my colleagues and I eat \u00a310m of biscuits each per year. If only.  It is this inaccurate, headline-grabbing drivel that causes people to think we all earn \u00a3200k per year, drive expensive cars, work four hours a week and retire aged 30. In truth, I earn \u00a330k for a 50-hour week, drive a Toyota Aygo and cannot afford a mortgage. I\u2019ll currently retire at 68 with an \u00a318k pension. Bring on the gold.   Related: This government vilifies people who put their lives on the line for their job    I manage a regeneration team at my council and witness people doing their utmost to improve the local area, working long hours for low pay. Yes, there are cuts and inefficiencies and there are certainly ways the sector can improve, but my local authority and the wider sector is resourced by hardworking people with a passion for the locality and a quiet professionalism that will never cease to impress me. The first project I worked on for my current local authority showed me the positive role we play. Running an employability skills project in one of our most deprived areas, we took 12 long-term unemployed people and spent time building a relationship, understanding their lives, their wants and the barriers to them accessing training or employment. We found them courses that plugged any training gaps they had. We wrote CVs with them, went to interviews with them and worked on implementing feedback from unsuccessful interviews. We didn\u2019t change the world, but we improved a few lives: five of them got jobs, three still did the job a year later; all undertook accredited training. And we stayed in touch in case they wanted advice afterwards. Most of them did. Here is another example of the distance between the rhetoric and reality about councils: my town, supposedly suffering a death knell via the ailing steelworks industry, is leading one of the largest housing developments in the north of England, with \u00a31.2bn invested and 6,000 homes built. Thousands of jobs are being created in the offshore wind energy sector in our patch, with the largest enterprise zone in the country.    Related: I'm a bed manager in mental health \u2013 and the scapegoat of the NHS    As soon as the local steelworks redundancies were mooted, the council established a taskforce to coordinate a response and bring key partners together to support those exiting that industry. It secured \u00a312m as grants to local business for retraining and investing in other industries, as well as for one-to-one support for people facing redundancies. So much for the slow-moving bureaucracies of local government. It\u2019s this quiet, dignified dedication that probably allows misinformation about the public sector to go unchallenged \u2013 so consider this a polite rebuttal. I am biased, I admit it: I have experience of being a looked-after child. The state fed me, educated and housed me, as well as being my (corporate) parent on-off for a period. I remain utterly grateful for them being there and despair at what the alternative would mean without such a safety net for the vulnerable. It is that gratitude and belief in the sector that led me to choose the graduate management programme for local government. I\u2019ve worked in the sector for nine years now, across frontline and corporate services and have yet to find a service that was not underpinned by that core value of wanting to improve a person\u2019s life, family or area. Some may mock, but it\u2019s a good thing to go to work for \u2013 and despite the cuts, efficiency drives and press hostility, I\u2019ll still be here, because it\u2019s worthwhile and I love it.
