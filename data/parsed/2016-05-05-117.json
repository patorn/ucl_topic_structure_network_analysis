  "body": "Martha Plimpton is an Emmy-winning actor and pro-choice activist. She currently stars in The Real O\u2019Neals. Her friend Rebecca Carroll is a Guardian US writer, author and critic-at-large for the Los Angeles Times. They emailed about politics, feminism and art Rebecca: You\u2019ve been really outspoken about your pro-choice views in the past, so we should start this conversation with a fresh acknowledgement: Donald Trump is now the Republican candidate, and he\u2019s also arguably a misogynistic freak show of a person who has a ton of supporters. His campaign is broadly about prioritizing money over humans. In the event that he wins, how do we keep humans at the forefront of US? Martha: Oh, lordy. Well, I don\u2019t believe he has a chance in hell of becoming president. I really do not. I just think it\u2019s beyond comprehension. Beyond Bush II. Beyond the beyond. It\u2019s not going to happen, so I won\u2019t even go there. Not because I\u2019m in denial \u2013 I literally think there is no data of any kind to support that kind of doomsday planning as far as Trump is concerned. I\u2019m not being a partisan here. I love a good contest, but there will not be one in this election. We are about to have our first female president, I really don\u2019t care what Tim Robbins says. Rebecca Carroll: In The Real O\u2019Neals you play Eileen, Agnes\u2019 daughter. Eileen is kind of a control freak trying to reassess her life, which involves being far more open-minded than she has been raised to be, especially since her Catholic conservative mother is racist and homophobic.  The first thing I thought after watching the show was: how come Eileen evolved to eventually embrace things that her religion does not (gay people, divorce, black and brown people) and Agnes didn\u2019t? Martha Plimpton: Generational differences are pretty important here. Exposure to new things, especially within your own family, forces a kind of acceptance you never thought you could one day accept. And the more people come out, or demand to be respected and treated as equals, the more likely it is that change is coming to your house.  That\u2019s the case with my character, Eileen. Our show is essentially focused on ideals of forgiveness, empathy, love and acceptance, but it\u2019s a TV show. It\u2019s a heightened reality made to entertain and hopefully move people enough to contribute to the understanding that homosexuality is normal. On some level, we\u2019re hoping that Eileen\u2019s journey will be encouraging for other parents who may be struggling with their views on LGBT issues. We want them to know that it is possible to change, and that it can be a joyful experience too. My own personal thoughts on this might be a little more informed by the darker aspects of human beings. I know how hard forgiveness, or even tiny little forward motion, can be. I also know it takes a long, long time to come, and that the penny doesn\u2019t always drop. Rebecca: On the subject of forgiveness \u2013 for all its difficulty to embrace and offer in a meaningful way, lots of folks are quick to say that forgiveness sets you free. But I actually feel quite free in my anger. I don\u2019t know what or who forgiveness serves. I don\u2019t forgive my fifth-grade teacher for being racist. I don\u2019t forgive the grown man who messed with me when I was six. I forgive immaturity in myself and my friends, and I forgive some mean things we said to each other \u2013 but I feel like people who do awful things don\u2019t get to have my forgiveness. Is that evil?    When you keep women\u2019s health, bodies and sexualities a secret, then it\u2019s much easier to fool people with bogus laws    Martha: \u201cIs that evil?\u201d Haha! No, of course I don\u2019t think you are capable of evil. I relate to this mostly in that I don\u2019t equate forgiveness with the erasure of anger or a sense of injustice. They can and often do exist and thrive in parallel relation to one another. In a weird way, for me, they go hand in hand. But now we\u2019re getting into almost esoteric levels of subjective thinking ... Rebecca: Speaking of esoteric, why do some people still think feminism is akin to witchcraft? I struggle to reconcile how men wouldn\u2019t want women to be able to keep our reproductive organs healthy. The Senate and state plans to defund Planned Parenthood is just unbelievable. Y\u2019all know we don\u2019t just get abortions at Planned Parenthood, right? We get pap smears and breast cancer checks and STD checks that allow us to safely continue the human race. Martha: It\u2019s so weird and I have no idea, though of course there are theories. The ability to \u201ccreate life\u201d, whatever that means, might play a part in this. (As if there\u2019s not a man always definitively involved in that endeavor!) But somehow, women are the ones who get in trouble for it. As far as reproductive health goes, we know that a woman who becomes pregnant is not suddenly, magically possessed by another entity that automatically owns her. No \u2013 she is a self-contained and autonomous human in the process of slowly building another human. When you keep women\u2019s health, their bodies, their sexualities and their biological processes a secret, or try to isolate them from the greater human experience as something \u201cother\u201d and \u201cweird\u201d and \u201cdirty\u201d, then it\u2019s much easier to fool people with bogus laws that pretend to be protecting them but are actually depriving them of their liberty. There are so many gradations to sexism, and so many mitigating and aggravating factors for a sexist person to use as a sort of bread crumb trail back home to Fearville. But we know what happens to bread crumbs in the forest. Birdies come and foil your plans. So, feminists are the birds eating the crumbs in that fairy tale metaphor, I guess. Why some people want to do this, I will never know. What matters more to me is that they are winning. Their reasons are less interesting to me than what we are intending to do about it. Rebecca: For me, the truth is that women are more powerful than men \u2013 and I say this with all due respect to men. I should probably be more egalitarian, but I think women represent the very model of humanity. We are \u2013 and of course I\u2019m generalizing \u2013 emotionally sophisticated, intellectually curious, physically strong AF, and know how to channel our vulnerabilities into revolutionary acts (hi, Lemonade). But how do we better harness this power? Martha: I hear you, but personally, it doesn\u2019t quite sit right with me to associate the ability to be pregnant or \u201ccreate life\u201d with female power. I think that\u2019s the point I\u2019m trying to make. That\u2019s a myth we accept because it reads and is experienced as the only power we do have in the eyes of the patriarchal structure. Not that it gets us maternity leave or childcare, because we are so powerful we don\u2019t need it, I guess? But many, many women cannot conceive or have children, or simply choose not to, and they are just as inherently powerful and physically realized as those who do. Right? So when we buy into that, we\u2019re agreeing on some level that pregnancy, or the ability to be pregnant, is a strata of human value that is separate from the human value of anyone. Maybe I\u2019m an equality purist in this way, but that\u2019s a huge part of the problem in my own view. We are no more, nor less, powerful than the person beside us, regardless of our physical attributes, and that is the foundation of equality and civil rights. Rebecca: My god, when you say we are no more powerful than the person beside us \u2013 I have to disagree. You are far more powerful than the person beside you on the subway going to work at the sandwich shop in Grand Central. I am more powerful than the person beside me on the subway going to work at Forever 21 in Union Square. Right? I mean it would be dense and obtuse to not recognize this. Martha: Yes, in social terms of course you\u2019re right. I meant in terms of the natural rights and value and capabilities of all human beings. This is the basis of civil rights work, legislation and activism. This basic truth, that all human beings are of equal value and carry the same inherent power to move, live, thrive. Yet we largely don\u2019t recognize or accept this, and we subvert this truth constantly and systemically, which is why we need civil and human rights movements and advocacy. Rebecca: That\u2019s fair. One more question. You are a celebrity. It\u2019s weird to ask this because you are my friend, but what do you think is the morally comfortable place for a celebrity to talk about politics?Martha: I don\u2019t know how my moral responsibilities are altered by my job, but I accept that some people think they are. I am a citizen and also a performer by trade, and sometimes that means I have a means of communicating on a bigger scale. But it doesn\u2019t alter my moral responsibilities. Anyway, morality is subjective. I\u2019m more interested in the ethics and responsibilities of being a decent human being.",
