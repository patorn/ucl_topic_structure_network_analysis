  "body": "Rodrigo Duterte will be the next president of the Philippines. Duterte only managed to file his candidacy on the last possible day \u2013 he was supposed to lack the money and political machinery required for a presidential run \u2013 his rise has understandably surprised many. Undoubtedly the first president from the southern conflict-stricken island group of Mindanao \u2013 where a long-running Islamist insurgency rages as well an increasingly violent battle with the communist New People\u2019s Army \u2013 he also believes himself to be \u201cthe first president from the left\u201d. Dubbed \u201cThe Punisher\u201d by Time as far back as 2002 there have been comparisons to Donald Trump and Dirty Harry. But unlike Trump, Duterte now wields considerable national and international clout, and has for some time in his own neighbourhood. Unlike Trump, he is an experienced political figure. We know little of what Duterte policy will look like, on both a domestic and international level. A lack of detail and scrutiny is a reason for worry, and like Trump there are lots of questions and contradictions, but that is as far as comparison should go. Duterte may represent a similar victory for a bigoted, loud-mouthed, populist politician but his circumstances and his impact on the Philippines are particularly striking. Trump is the TV personality while Duterte has a rugged, less polished and more believable man-of-the people persona. So while they both swear a lot and have politically incorrect \u2013 sometimes downright misogynist \u2013 tendencies, the similarities only go so far.   Related: Philippines election: Duterte declares victory and promises change    The 71-year-old has been allowed to run as an anti-establishment figurehead due to a lack of media scrutiny. This is in spite of the fact that he has been mayor of Davao (the largest city in Mindanao) for 22 years and has served as a congressman. Trump is the political outsider and while Duterte cultivates a similar image it simply isn\u2019t true. He is a trained lawyer and he and his family are developing into a powerful political clan. Despite being the fourth fastest-growing economy in the world, the Philippine economy \u2013 like its politics \u2013 is dominated by a few elite families. The striking inequality and widespread poverty is not a new problem. But patience with what Duterte managed to paint as educated liberal American-sycophants in Manila, has run out. And Duterte has been allowed a platform \u2013 providing great copy for global syndication, but often distracting from the issue of how he will \u201ceradicate crime and corruption in six months\u201d. Commentators, interviewers and news anchors in the country seemed reluctant to challenge him. Instead they have focused on his claims that he \u201ccan love four women at the same time\u201d. Protecting access to the foul-mouthed, self-confessed womanising \u201cstrongman\u201d seems to have been their priority. Duterte will speak at length wherever a microphone is near; Trump, meanwhile, is now learning to be much more guarded, even around outlets from the political right, predominantly speaking at his own rallies. The current president, Benigno Aquino, is leaving office after one frustrated term, as one of the few presidents to leave office still popular. It\u2019s surprising then that the electorate has chosen such a drastically different figure. It would be easy to call this the end of democracy, though with voter turnout of more than 80% it is much more complicated. The concern domestically is that a Duterte presidency will carry over the same undertone of threat from the campaign. This was made explicit by a number of his supporters on social media who were quick to attack, especially when his most coveted attribute was ever questioned \u2013 his authenticity. The term \u201cmartial law\u201d was trending across platforms. The mayor who brought rough justice to a chaotic city (and has been accused of having used death squads) made himself the obvious candidate for strong leadership. But memories of Ferdinand Marcos are still fresh; his corruption-riddled reign (1965-86) included a decade of martial law and many are obviously concerned that Duterte will wield a similarly arbitrary iron fist when it comes to the rule of law, breaking it when he chooses. Especially if the former dictator\u2019s son,Ferdinand Marcos, is elected as Duterte\u2019s vice-president. Nobody really believes that Trump would be able to, or even seek to, implement martial law across America. Many of these worries manifest at an international level, given Duterte\u2019s comments on women and rape it is unlikely that Filipino women seeking compensation from Japan for crimes during the second world war will find an ally in the new president. Similarly, following the sentencing of US Marine Scott Pemberton for the murder of Jennifer Laude, which raised the stakes of transgender rights and US-Filipino relations, Duterte has been openly dismissive on both topics. There will be concern in Washington, most pressingly in the development of new and mothballed US military bases required as part of President Obama\u2019s pivot to Asia strategy that until now has relied on and received Filipino support \u2013 arguably at too great a cost. Duterte will be entitled to fight for a better deal for the country in relations with the US but he has openly suggested that a deal with China over the disputed islands in the South China Sea could be more beneficial than being used as \u201cAmericas Pacific buffer\u201d. While their politics may be different, this unpredictable new leader, and the timing of his rise, should worry the world much more than Trump ever could. Comparing Duterte to Trump is tempting as a source of clickbait headlines, but it is inaccurate, and risks becoming another act of cultural colonialism, especially given the history of the United States in the Philippines. Cultural imperialism by the US in the Philippines has often meant local Filipino concerns have been viewed, acted on and disastrously managed through an American lens \u2013 as the new president well knows. Duterte may be plenty dangerous enough without spurious comparisons to a Republican presidential candidate.",
