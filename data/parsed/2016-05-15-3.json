  "body": "The Beatles\u2019 first press officer, Tony Barrow, the man who came up with the phrase \u201cthe Fab Four\u201d, has died at the age of 80. He died on Saturday night at home in Morecambe and is survived by his widow, Corinne, and his two sons.     Tony Barrow worked with The Beatles between 1962 and 1968    Paul McCartney paid tribute to Barrow on Twitter on Sunday:    Tony Barrow was a lovely guy who helped us in the early years of The Beatles. He was super professional but always ready for a laugh. (1/2)\u2014 Paul McCartney (@PaulMcCartney) May 15, 2016      He will be missed but remembered by many of us. (2/2)\u2014 Paul McCartney (@PaulMcCartney) May 15, 2016    Barrow represented the band for six years from 1962 after being recruited by the Beatles\u2019 manager Brian Epstein from Decca records, where he wrote sleeve notes. The job offer resulted after Decca declined to sign the Beatles and Epstein was impressed by press kit he paid Barrow \u00a320 to create, which helped promote the band and helped land their EMI recording contract.  Before taking the job, Barrow met the four Beatles in a West End pub in November 1962. John Lennon pointedly asked him: \u201cIf you\u2019re not queer and you\u2019re not Jewish, why are you coming to work with Brian Epstein?\u201d Epstein\u2019s offer to double his weekly salary to \u00a332 clinched the deal. Part of Barrow\u2019s role was to write sleeve notes for the band\u2019s albums. \u201cJohn must have built himself a set of leather tonsils in a throat of steel to turn out such a violently exciting track!\u201d he enthused on the cover of the Twist and Shout EP in 1963.   Related: Paul McCartney on George Martin: \u2018if anyone was the fifth Beatle it was him\u2019    The EP was the first record singer Tom Robinson bought and wrote in the Guardian in 2007: \u201cTony Barrow\u2019s sleeve notes were worth every penny.\u201d After the first flush of success in 1963, Barrow refused \u2013 at Epstein\u2019s insistence \u2013 to confirm to the press that John Lennon was married and had a child by May of that year. Three years later, while the Beatles were touring the US, he orchestrated Lennon\u2019s apology following his ill-judged comment that the band was \u201cmore popular than Jesus now\u201d. Barrow also represented other Merseyside acts including Cilla Black from 1963 until his retirement in 1980, as well as Gerry and the Pacemakers. He later set up his own PR company, representing acts including Wings and managing Lyn Paul of the New Seekers and Helen Shapiro.",
