You have to do it when you win. You have to do it when you draw. You have to do it if your own supporters have just spent 90 minutes booing you and you\u2019ve lost 5-1. (Because if you don\u2019t, they\u2019ll block the team bus outside the stadium for hours until you come out and apologise). You also have to do it if you\u2019ve just won 5-1 and were booed for 90 minutes by your own fans, like Mats Hummels had been at the Westfalenstadion on Saturday. The want-away Borussia Dortmund captain coolly faced up to an island of irate fists amid the ocean of black and yellow on the S\u00fcdtrib\u00fcne. \u201cI think I\u2019m the only player in league history to get jeered before a move [has been finalised],\u201d he said, \u201cbut it was only 300 of them, a group of fans who didn\u2019t love me before either, certainly not 80,000. Not 8,000 even.\u201d Whistles and an anti-Hummels placard (\u201cThe captain\u2019s the first one to leave the ship \u2013 go now!\u201d) on the Yellow Wall were countered by friendly applause from the main stand.

Or, to be more accurate, there shouldn\u2019t have been any. The DFB (German Football Association) had banned all away supporters from the match after crowd trouble at the first meeting in December; a local court had also banned Eintracht fans from setting foot in the city of Darmstadt. The city\u2019s mayor revoked that blanket ban, however, on Saturday morning. A few hundred away supporters turned up to symbolically occupy rival territory, sing about \u201cDarmstadtschweine\u201d (Darmstadt pigs) and half-heartedly attempt to break through the police cordon to get to the stadium. There were a few minor skirmishes, 530 (mostly temporary) arrests; for reasons that are still not entirely clear Eintracht ultras ripped out a bush while a few Darmstadt ultras trashed an ice cream parlour in their own city.

Photograph: Boris Roessler/EPA    Inside the ground a few Frankfurt fans had managed to buy tickets for the main stand, somewhere in the Nordkurve, too, among the die-hard Lilies supporters. Cue more aggro when the infiltrators blew their cover to celebrate Stefan Aigner\u2019s winner seven minutes before full-time. Riot police officers rushed in to stop fisticuffs as helicopters circled the ground and the stadium announcer castigated Eintracht fans as \u201cviolent thugs\u201d. The worst was over by the time of the strange spectacle Bild called \u201cthe most stupid celebration of the year\u201d*, Niko Kovac\u2019s men applauding in front of a vacant away end when the thrilling relegation six-pointer was over. \u201cIt was not meant as a provocation,\u201d insisted SGE captain, Marco Russ. \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to make a fuss.\u201d The defender Bastian Oczipka explained the players had spotted an Eintracht flag and a few fans in the corner of the stadium; they had headed over \u201cinstinctively\u201d, Kovac maintained. The board member Axel Hellmann apologised for a move he called \u201cnot good\u201d, however, calling it \u201ca tad too provocative in view of the DFB ban. There\u2019s no need for it.\u201d To Darmstadt\u2019s credit they did not regard the away team\u2019s (empty) block party as too big a deal. The keeper Christian Mathenia criticised both sets for fans (\u201cI have zero sympathy for people who go to the ground to have a fight in between families with kids\u201d) for the flare-ups but seemed just as concerned with the home support\u2019s over-confident attitude before the defeat. They had welcomed the Eintracht team with \u201cAbsteiger\u201d (team to get relegated) chants, \u201cbut we can still go down, too,\u201d Mathenia acknowledged.

They had started really well, taking the lead through Mario Vrancic and had a chance potentially to kill off the match when Haris Seferovic tugged Luca Caldirola in the box. To paraphrase Louis van Gaal: That might be allowed, welcome even - but not in this particular context. The SV striker Sandro Wagner stepped up, gave Lukas Hradecky the eyes and saw his tame shot saved. \u201cIf that had been the 2-0 I couldn\u2019t have imagined us coming back,\u201d said the Eintracht chairman, Heribert Bruchhagen. Darmstadt had dominated so much before the break that their subsequent caving-in was hard to explain. \u201dWe were afraid, we only reacted, we let them play their game,\u201d Kovac said about the first half. \u201cIt was nothing, the worst 45 minutes of my time in charge.\u201d Since the Croat took over at the beginning of March the Eagles haven\u2019t exactly scaled new heights of playing fine football but the 44-year-old has at least been able to bring an element of resilience into the team. He tirelessly pushed his men forward from the touchline and made sure to have a ball ready for his side at all times, to stop the ball boys from time-wasting. Armin Veh\u2019s easy-going hands-off regime has given way to a bit of Simeone-esque motivational intensity from the former Bayern Munich midfielder. \u201cFootball is a matter of willpower,\u201d explained Hellmann, \u201cit\u2019s good to have an instigator on the touchline, somebody who knows what\u2019s going on.\u201d Tactically, some semblance of order has returned as well. \u201cWe\u2019re not all over the shop any more,\u201d said Russ. A more concerted effort was enough to trouble the hosts: Makoto Hasebe equalised with a deflected shot shortly after the break to start the fightback.

Staving off relegation will continue to be a struggle without the services of their injured talisman Alexander Meier. He might be back for Saturday\u2019s game at home to Dortmund; he might not be. But the main thing is that Eintracht have found hope. \u201cWe\u2019re alive again,\u201d proclaimed Hradecky. Darmstadt are still two points to the good in comparison with their wealthier neighbours but the last two weeks of the season will now be much more fraught than necessary. They are only two points clear of the relegation play-off spot (before Werder\u2019s Monday night date with VfB Stuttgart), with a pair of very tough opponents (Hertha and Gladbach) to come. \u201cWe\u2019re still ahead of schedule,\u201d Schuster claimed. He and Kovac shared a warm embrace at the final whistle to demonstrate there was no need to persist with the enmity beyond the confines of the pitch and in recognition of the mounting pressure they are both enduring. Thus the most troublesome derby of the season ended on a surprisingly conciliatory note, as the authorities also pleaded for a sense of perspective. \u201cConsidering the amount of people with potential for violence in the city, relatively little happened in our view,\u201d the police director, Bernd Denninger, told Frankfurter Allgemeine. *They obviously hadn\u2019t watched the car-crash Laureus Awards, with Bill Murray as host.",
