In those years she carried this secret with her, hidden from her closest friends and family. Decades later, after marrying and remarrying, returning to school, finding a second calling as a hospice nurse, raising two daughters and becoming a grandmother, the former Playboy playmate watched a clip online of comedian Hannibal Buress excoriating Cosby in a standup routine.  \u201cThis little red locket of anger just exploded in my chest. Suddenly, I was like: who can I tell?\u201d said Valentino, who is now 73 and lives in Pasadena.  Valentino is one of more than 50 women who have come forward in rapid succession over the past few years to accuse the man once elevated to the exalted position of America\u2019s Dad of rape and sexual assault dating as far back as 1965. The allegations followed a sinister pattern: vulnerable young women and a calculated assault, in many cases involving drugs offered as sedatives. \u201cI was already a broken woman,\u201d Valentino said of the year of the alleged assault. Her six-year-old son, Tony, had drowned in a swimming pool in September 1969; she was deeply depressed. \u201cTo be so callous and so remorseless to take advantage of that \u2013 to ruin me again \u2013 it was like one more nail in my coffin,\u201d Valentino said. At just 26, Valentino was a grieving mother on a downward spiral when she said Cosby drugged her, brought her to an apartment in the hills and raped her. Valentino saw Cosby again only once, some months after the alleged incident, outside Cafe Figaro, a popular West Hollywood locale that Cosby partially owned. She was walking into the restaurant with a friend when a passerby shouted: \u201cThere\u2019s Bill Cosby!\u201d      Bill Cosby leaves a hearing on sexual assault charges on Tuesday at Montgomery County courthouse in Pennsylvania Photograph: William Thomas Cain/Getty Images    A black limo stopped in front of the restaurant. Valentino froze. Her heart raced and her mind went blank. Without thinking, Valentino said she pressed her face close enough to see through the tinted window and stuck out her tongue. \u201cIt was so ridiculous it\u2019s almost embarrassing to tell it but it\u2019s the only thing that really illustrates how powerless I felt,\u201d she said. \u201cI was a grieving mother but I was also still a child.\u201d She remembers clearly Cosby\u2019s wife, Camille, next to him on the back seat.  \u201cShe looked so elegant with her black hair all pulled up, sleek on the top of her head,\u201d Valentino recalled. \u201cUgh, it only made me feel worse, like I was some kind of a bum \u2013 a bum that was powerless and unkempt in comparison with this sleek, elegant woman married to a megastar.\u201d But the megastar\u2019s fall would come. On Tuesday, a judge ordered Cosby to stand trial over an accusation that he intoxicated and sexually assaulted Temple University employee Andrea Constand in his Pennsylvania home in January 2004. Constand reported the assault in 2005 and a criminal inquiry was conducted, but the district attorney concluded at the time that the case lacked enough evidence to proceed. Cosby maintains that any sexual contact with his accusers \u2013 including encounters he acknowledges having with Constand \u2013 was consensual.    The legal system is standing behind Andrea Constand and that means it\u2019s standing behind us       \u201cMore than vindication, it\u2019s validation. It\u2019s jubilation,\u201d Valentino said of her reaction. \u201cThe justice system is actually working. The legal system is standing behind her and that means it\u2019s standing behind us.\u201d Although dozens of women have come forward with allegations against Cosby, in many of the cases, including Valentino\u2019s, the criminal and civil statute of limitations has expired. In California, it is 10 years for rape and sexual assault cases. Yet for Valentino, seeing just one case go to trial is a victory. \u201cHe had gotten away with it for so long,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s damaged countless lives \u2026 Now it\u2019s time to pay the piper.\u201d \u2018I was dead inside\u2019 Valentino was raised in Connecticut but moved to California the summer after she graduated high school. She joined a folk group and fell in love with a black man from Cuba. Her family objected to their relationship, but they married anyway. During their ill-fated marriage, they had a son, Tony. Her first husband was an aspiring photographer, and she was his muse. She posed for photographs for him, which he submitted to Playboy.  \u201cI was so naive,\u201d Valentino remembered. \u201cI wasn\u2019t really sure what Playboy meant.\u201d In September 1963, the magazine picked Valentino as Playmate of the Month, when she was just 19.  \u201cAll I remember thinking is that I hope my dad doesn\u2019t find out about this,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course he did and he was livid.\u201d After the spread, Valentino was inducted into the glamorous LA scene. The stunning brunette cavorted with singers, producers and actors. She sat down to record an album and auditioned for acting gigs.  Valentino said her husband was violent. One day, she took her son and left. She returned to Playboy to work as a bunny and helped open the original Playboy Club on the Sunset Strip on New Year\u2019s Eve 1964. Five years later, she was at her then boyfriend\u2019s house when she lost sight of Tony. They found him at the bottom of the swimming pool, his tiny foam surfboard floating above. Valentino became despondent. \u201cI was dead inside \u2013 like someone had taken a dull knife and gutted me,\u201d she recalled.

Photograph: AP    Three months later, Valentino\u2019s friend, Francesca Emerson, a former playmate and one of the first \u201cchocolate bunnies\u201d, suggested she meet Cosby, with the idea that he might be able to get her a role on his show, I Spy. Weeks later, Valentino met Cosby at the Cafe Figaro with her roommate at the time, an aspiring actor named Meg Foster.  She said Cosby knew Valentino was grieving the loss of her son, and paid for the women to spend the day relaxing at a spa. That evening, he sent a limousine to pick them up for dinner.  According to Valentino, he took them to a steakhouse called Sneaky Pete\u2019s. Throughout dinner, Valentino said she felt like a third wheel. She was too disconsolate to feign interest and the wine was making her mood worse. Near the end of dinner, Valentino said Cosby offered her and Foster red pills.  \u201cHe said, \u2018It\u2019ll make you feel better. It\u2019ll make all of us feel better.\u2019 That was my clue that I was being a wet blanket so I took the pill,\u201d she said.  Soon, Valentino said the women could barely keep their heads from falling on to their plates. Their speech was slurred and their movements were lethargic. Cosby led the women out of the restaurant to his car, she said. But instead of driving them home, he took them to an apartment in Hollywood Hills, claiming that he wanted to show off his I Spy memorabilia.    Suddenly he got up with this really pissed off look on his face and walked over to me. His zipper was undone    Once inside, Valentino said she and Foster fell on to a loveseat and passed out. Valentino sat across the room and was focused on keeping herself from throwing up in the presence of one of Hollywood\u2019s biggest talents. She said she saw Cosby walk over to Foster.  \u201cHe was just standing over her like a vulture. I saw the bulge in his pants. I reached out my hands. I couldn\u2019t articulate anything,\u201d she said. \u201cAt first he ignored me. And then suddenly he got up with this really pissed off look on his face and walked over to me. His zipper was undone. He grabbed my head. He orally raped me and the turned me around and vaginally raped me. When he finished, he walked out.\u201d Before he closed the door, Valentino recalled asking Cosby how they could get home.  \u201cHe said, \u2018call a cab,\u2019\u201d she said. She picked up the phone in the room. There was no dial tone \u2013 the phone was a prop. \u2018It\u2019s a life sentence for us\u2019 Valentino never shared the details of that night with anyone. She never hid her disgust for Cosby but no one knew \u2013 or wanted to know \u2013 what happened between them.  \u201cAfter that I became very suicidal,\u201d Valentino said. \u201cI felt like nothing. I was very self-destructive. I was a lost soul.\u201d She left LA for Louisiana. She thinks the move saved her life. In the years that followed, she had two daughters and eventually moved back to the west coast.  Valentino carried her pain, but kept her secrets hidden. The Cosby Show was banned in her house and her daughters never understood why. They admitted to their mom only recently that they watched the show at friends\u2019 houses. The revelation that her children had blithely enjoyed a television show starring the man who had traumatized her life hit unexpectedly hard, Valentino said. More than a dozen women had already come forward when Valentino told her story to the Washington Post in November 2014. She said the experience has been incredibly liberating and has helped her heal. But it has also forced her to confront painful memories. \u201cYou\u2019re damaged for life,\u201d Valentino said. \u201cYou are mistrusting of anyone you meet. You\u2019re always suspicious. You have intimacy issues. You have trust issues. It bleeds into all your relationships and into your children\u2019s lives. Then they have trust issues and they don\u2019t even know why. It\u2019s a life sentence for us.\u201d \u2018Things have come full circle\u2019 Although the trial in Pennsylvania may be the only assault case against Cosby that is prosecuted in court, the women aren\u2019t discouraged. Together they formed a sisterhood, Valentino said. They text and call each other regularly. Together they protested against Cosby\u2019s star on Hollywood Boulevard. They campaign to change rape culture and laws limiting the period of time victims have to report assaults. \u201cThose of us who are outside the statute of limitations have become activists and we are going try to change rape culture in our society and try to somehow make it a better world for our children and grandchildren,\u201d Valentino said. \u201cWe don\u2019t want them to be in the same place we were: afraid to break our silence.\u201d     Those of us who are outside the statute of limitations have become activists    Valentino is part of a campaign that is pushing to eliminate statutes of limitations for rape and sexual assault cases. The California legislature is currently considering a bill that would eliminate its 10-year statute of limitations.  In May, Valentino addressed the West Hollywood city council in support of the California bill. After wrenching testimony, the council voted unanimously to support abolishing the statute of limitations on rape and sexual in California.  As Valentino left the building that day, she said she noticed a female officer with the Los Angeles County sheriff\u2019s department grinning. The officer held out her hand.  Valentino choked up as she recounted the story: \u201cI said, \u2018I really want to give you a hug but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s officially appropriate.\u2019 She just threw her arms around me and we locked our arms around each other in a big hug. In 1969 I would have never ever thought that I could go to the LAPD or the county sheriff\u2019s department. Now here I am, testifying in West Hollywood where I was raped and hugging an LA sheriff, a woman no less.\u201d \u201cThings have come full circle and there is justice in that,\u201d Valentino said. \u201cIt\u2019s an important thing to stay alive for.\u201d",
