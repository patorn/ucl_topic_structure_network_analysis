In an unusually political evening, the tone was set by Wolf Hall director Peter Kosminsky, who received the first award of the night and was given a standing ovation by the audience of TV stars and industry executives when he accused the government of trying to \u201ceviscerate\u201d the BBC and Channel 4.           Mark Rylance: I owe my Oscar and Bafta to the BBC    Rylance later joined in the criticism, saying: \u201cWoe to any government or corporation that tries to get between the British people and their love of a good joke, a true story, a good song, a fact or fiction, good sports commentating, newscasters who can hold themselves together as they tell stories about terrible tragedies in Paris, people who can help you bake cakes. \u201cWe\u2019re a nation of storytellers, were admired around the world for it. Tonight I was struck with the quality of storytelling in the country and I agree with Peter, times are hard.\u201d Winning the prize for his role as Thomas Cromwell in Wolf Hall capped an extraordinary year for Rylance, who also won an Oscar and a Bafta film award for Steven Spielberg\u2019s Bridge of Spies. Kosminsky said: \u201cIn the week in which our secretary of state John Whittingdale described the disappearance of the BBC as a tempting prospect, I\u2019d like to say a few words in defence of that organisation.\u201d It is not thought that Whittingdale attended the ceremony.   Related: Bafta TV awards 2016: full list of winners    Government proposals to appoint a majority of members on a new BBC board threatened its independence, Kosminsky said, and would turn it into a state broadcaster \u201ca bit like ... those bastions of democracy Russia and North Korea\u201d. He said the government wanted to tell the BBC what programmes to make and when to schedule them. \u201cIt\u2019s not their BBC, it\u2019s your BBC. In many ways, the BBC and Channel 4, which they are also attempting to eviscerate, are the envy of the world and we should stand up and fight for it, not let it go by default,\u201d Kosminsky said.  \u201cIf we don\u2019t, blink and it will be gone. No more Wolf Halls, no more groundbreaking Dispatches [on Channel 4], just a broadcasting landscape where the only determinate of whether it gets made is whether it lines the pockets of shareholders. \u201cThis is really scary stuff, folks, and not something I thought I would see in my lifetime in this country. All of this is under threat right now, make no mistake. It\u2019s time to stand up and say no to this dangerous nonsense.\u201d One audience member described the mood in the London\u2019s Royal Festival Hall after Kosminsky\u2019s speech \u2013 the first of the night \u2013 as astonishing. His speech was edited for broadcast when the awards were shown on BBC1 an hour later \u2013 his reference to Russia and North Korea was cut \u2013 but large parts of it remained intact. A BBC spokeswoman said: \u201cAs with any televised award show, we seek to fairly and accurately reflect the passionately held views of recipients and attendees.  \u201cAt the same time, we have a duty to fairly reflect as many awards, nominees and winners as possible. Where we have to edit for length, we ensure that the essence of the speeches which are included, are properly reflected.\u201d Ian Hislop, Strictly Come Dancing judge Craig Revel Horwood and The Missing star James Nesbitt were among the other stars to speak out on behalf of the BBC. Hislop, accepting the comedy and comedy entertainment award for BBC1\u2019s Have I Got News For You, said: \u201cThe BBC have allowed Have I Got News For You to be rude about governments ... and rude about the BBC, which is a privilege you are given with public service broadcasting and not on state television.\u201d   Related: Bafta TV awards 2016: stars arrive on the red carpet \u2013 in pictures    In a reference to Kosminsky\u2019s earlier speech, he said: \u201cI thought I wouldn\u2019t do any political stuff, it\u2019s already been done although probably at home it was cut for you, you may have missed it.\u201d Later, Hislop added: \u201cI have an idea that John Whittingdale\u2019s ideal show would be the prime minister as host [of Have I Got News For You], the defence secretary and the home secretary as the two team captains.  \u201cIt is a ludicrous idea what he [Whittingdale] is proposing. But I think that like most of the really terrible ideas that this government has come up with, in about three weeks they will decide that they didn\u2019t mean it and they will row back.  Revel Horwood spoke out after Strictly Come Dancing, which has been criticised by Whittingdale and may be forced out of its primetime slot, beat ITV\u2019s Britain\u2019s Got Talent to the best entertainment prize. \u201cIf they are in charge of anything entertainment-wise, it would be a complete disaster; we don\u2019t want them in charge of any decisions, creatively,\u201d he said. \u201cThe scheduling is created around our audience. It\u2019s a family entertainment show. You\u2019d never schedule it at 1am would you? That would be ridiculous. I would hate to see it move.\u201d James Nesbitt, one of the awards presenters, told the audience: \u201cI think it\u2019s true that all these films, the writers, directors, cast and crew and, let\u2019s face it, everyone in this hall is able to do what they do as well as they do because of the BBC. Do not strip it away.\u201d The government also came under attack from double Bafta winner Jack Thorne, writer of Channel 4\u2019s Shane Meadows drama This is England \u201990, which won best mini-series, and BBC3\u2019s Don\u2019t Take My Baby, about a disabled couple and their child, which was awarded best single drama. Thorne said cuts to the government\u2019s access to work scheme were \u201cmaking it very difficult for theatre, film and TV companies to employ disabled talent and that\u2019s wrong and that\u2019s got to change\u201d.   Related: Bafta TV awards 2016: the winners \u2013 in pictures    Peter Kay\u2019s comedy Car Share, which premiered on the BBC\u2019s on-demand service iPlayer before being repeated on BBC1, was a double winner. Other BBC winners included Suranne Jones, star of BBC1 drama Doctor Foster, and Poldark, the drama remake starring Aidan Turner, which won the Radio Times audience award voted for by viewers. Channel 4 was a big winner, with its prizes including The Murder Detectives (best factual series), My Son the Jihadi (single documentary), First Dates (reality award) and Channel 4 News, which won for its coverage of the Paris terrorist attacks. Channel 4\u2019s This is England \u201990 was a double winner, with Chanel Cresswell winning the supporting actress category. Michaela Coel, star of the comedy Chewing Gum shown on Channel 4\u2019s E4, used her speech to \u201cpay my respects\u201d to comedian Victoria Wood, who died in April aged 62. US on-demand service Amazon Prime won a Bafta with its first nomination, Jill Solloway\u2019s transgender comedy, Transparent, which won the international award. Its star Jeffrey Tambor said: \u201cThis is the series that answers the question, it\u2019s okay to change, you will still be loved, go for your authentic self, be who you are and to hell with the consequences. Believe, love, be free.\u201d Held on the 90th birthday of Sir David Attenborough, there was no birthday present for the broadcaster because his BBC1 programme The Hunt was beaten by BBC2\u2019s Britain\u2019s Forgotten Slave Owners in the specialist factual category. Elsewhere, Sir Lenny Henry, the actor and comedian turned diversity campaigner, won the Bafta special award and Ray Galton and Alan Simpson, the Hancock\u2019s Half Hour writers and creators of Steptoe and Son, received the Bafta fellowship. Bafta chair Anne Morrison also refered to the uncertainty surrounding the BBC and Channel 4, saying the \u201cbroadcasting ecology we have evolved [in the UK] has served us well. Whatever changes are ahead, we have to find a way of ensuring the range and quality of what we see here tonight is preserved.\u201d After the racial discrimination row that overshadowed this year\u2019s Oscars, she said it was \u201cthe most diverse list of nominations that anyone can remember and that is a cause for celebration as well\u201d. The BBC won a total of 14 awards, half of them for shows on BBC1. Channel 4 won six with another for E4, and two for ITV. Sky and Amazon took home one award each.
