  "body": "Brazil\u2019s image as a socially liberal, multi-ethnic democracy may always have been more myth than reality, but any lingering illusions of this type have been swept away by interim president Michel Temer\u2019s appointment of the country\u2019s first all-male cabinet since the end of dictatorship in1985. After conspiring to suspend Brazil\u2019s first female president, his former running mate Dilma Rousseff, the 75-year-old patrician quickly showed his conservative instincts with a mostly white lineup of ministers that also included a soy baron in charge of agriculture, and a finance minister who immediately declared the need for sweeping cuts. As was evident by the scrum of white men in suits who surrounded the grinning leader during his inauguration speech, Brazil\u2019s old elite are once again at the helm \u2013 and they feel little obligation to represent the 52% of the population who are women or the 53% who are of mixed race. It was a stunning contrast to Rousseff\u2019s departing cabinet and government team, which was far more diverse in gender and race. Temer made no apologies for harking back to traditional values. Just as many impeachment protesters have wrapped themselves in the national colours, he declared the motto of his new government would be \u201corder and progress\u201d \u2013 the Positivist slogan that spans the country\u2019s flag. Progress, however, does not appear to include improvements in the rights of women, who were long treated as second-class citizens in this macho culture.    Diversity diminishes in Brazil\u2019s cabinet   A recent cover story, Veja magazine \u2013 the mouthpiece of the conservative right \u2013 paid tribute to such ideals, describing Temer\u2019s wife, Marcela \u2013 a beauty pageant contestant who is 43 his junior \u2013 as \u201cBela, recatada e do lar\u201d (Beautiful, demure and homely). In the interview inside, the first lady \u2013 who has her husband\u2019s name tattooed on the back of her neck \u2013 said she felt lucky that he still found time to take her out for dinner every couple of weeks. Rousseff \u2013 a former Marxist guerrilla who was once arrested with a gun in her handbag and withstood torture during the military dictatorship, yet went on to lead Latin America\u2019s most powerful country \u2013 was the antithesis of the right\u2019s vision of femininity.  In her parting address, Rousseff said she was the victim of treachery and misogyny. During the rowdy lower house impeachment vote, many conservative congressmen and their wives and girlfriends posed with patronising placards reading \u201cTchau querida\u201d (Bye bye darling).  Ultra-conservative lawmaker Jair Bolsonaro went a step further by dedicating his vote to the dictatorship-era torturer-in-chief Carlos Alberto Brilhante Ustra, who he described sadistically as \u201cthe dread of Dilma\u201d. Despite condemnation from the left for this comment, Bolsonaro has not been punished. Among the right, he has surged in popularity, adding more than half a million Facebook \u201clikes\u201d in the two weeks that followed.    Related: With Rousseff on the ropes, Brazil's far right sees an opening    Rousseff was stripped of her powers on Thursday after losing a preliminary impeachment vote in the Senate. This followed a similar crushing defeat in the congress in April. She now faces trial by the senate on charges of doctoring government accounts to give an unrealistically healthy impression ahead of the 2014 election. She now has only a slim chance of avoiding permanent removal from office. The final senate vote \u2013 which requires a two-thirds majority \u2013 could come by September. Many of her accusers, however, are under investigation for far more serious crimes. Temer faces an impeachment challenge and has been barred from standing for office for eight years due to election violations. He has also been named in two plea bargains in the ongoing Lava Jato investigation into the kickback and bribery scandal at the state-run oil firm, Petrobras. Half a dozen other members of his proposed cabinet, including new planning secretary Romero Juc\u00e1, also face charges by Lava Jato prosecutors.

We must form a government that will save the nation,\u201d he said. As he spoke there were minor scuffles outside the building, where several dozen anti-Temer protesters staged a lie-in. They were ejected by security guards with beatings and pepper spray. Many doubt an all-male, predominantly white government can unite one of the world\u2019s most ethnically diverse nations, particularly given its primary focus will be to cut government spending so attract foreign investment.    Dilma wasn\u2019t perfect, but at least she gave us a voice  Edinaldo Ar\u00e1gun     Ana Claudia Farranha, the only black female professor in her department at the University of Brasilia, said Temer\u2019s cabinet showed how far removed he was from the population, which will be a course of weakness.  \u201cThis feels like we are taking a step backwards,\u201d she said. \u201cThey say they want to build a \u2018bridge to the future\u2019, but it\u2019s not a coalition with society. It\u2019s a hegemonic faction inside a political bloc. This arrangement gives his government a lot of fragility.\u201d It has certainly resulted in a great deal of mockery. Beyond the conservative right, the other Brazil \u2013 which aims to be more inclusive and egalitarian \u2013 has responded with indignation and bitter humour.  Among the many scathing online memes and comments was one by \u200e@andretrig who noted in Portuguese: \u201cOrder and Progress without women or blacks as the first step. The Temer government begins with a lot of testosterone and little pigment.\u201d Indigenous groups, who have suffered under every government for more than 500 years, say the difference is one of degree.  \u201cDilma wasn\u2019t perfect, but at least she gave us a voice,\u201d said Edinaldo Ar\u00e1gun, a chief of the Tabajara people from Paraiba state, who joined the farewell rally for Rousseff. \u201cThe new government will be much worse. They are criminals and thieves who will take our land, as people have been doing for hundreds of years.\u201d",
