That time he dissed ADELE, for freak\u2019s sake?  His latest spotlight-grabbing setpiece was to stage a catwalk show in communist-ruled Cuba less than a year into the warming of diplomatic relations with the west. Lagerfeld told Reuters the show was a homage to the \u201ccultural richness and opening up of Cuba\u201d. But the staging of an elite fashion event in a country with an average annual salary of \u00a33,000 was always likely to court controversy. Chanel goods are not available to buy in Cuba.

A motorcade of the jellybean-coloured vintage cars, as iconic of the city as the mojito cocktail, carried 600 guests to the broad promenade of the tree-lined Paseo del Prado, flanked by sun-faded pastel mansions. Chanel muses Vanessa Paradis and Gisele Bundchen arrived, as a live band played Cuban music.      Chanel muse Vanessa Paradis arrives. Photograph: STRINGER/Reuters    The commandeering of this historic Havana street as a stage set for brand-building by a luxury goods giant \u2013 showcasing clothes that will not be available to buy in Cuba \u2013 raised a few eyebrows, as did the fact that after the high-toned diplomacy of the Obama visit in March, the US was represented at this show by the rather less statesmanlike figure of Vin Diesel, in town to shoot Fast And Furious 8. However, Tony Castro, the former president\u2019s grandson and himself an aspiring model, attended the event and called it \u201can honour for all Cubans for this big event to take place here\u201d.

Photograph: Xinhua/REX/Shutterstock    The mischievousness of Lagerfeld\u2019s world view made, as ever, for gorgeous fashion theatre. Bundchen wore a beret, a hat that is both as profoundly French as a string of onions and as totemic of Cuba\u2019s revolutionary past as Che himself. Guayaberas \u2013 the classic short-sleeved Cuban shirts with vertical pin-tucks \u2013 were the basis for black organza cocktail blouses, and lightly pleated Chanel jackets. There were two-tone co-respondent shoes, Panama hats and Cadillac-printed T-shirts.  But perhaps the best image of the night came, inevitably, from the mind of Lagerfeld, who told a WWD reporter that he had, as a young man in Paris, been an accomplished cha-cha and tango dancer. \u201cI won contests,\u201d he claimed. With Karl Lagerfeld, anything seems possible.",
