  "body": "Oscar Scheller is armed with heart-throb looks and sugary hooks. If it wasn\u2019t for Oscar Pistorius and the Academy Awards rendering his name ungoogleable, not to mention the difficulty of staying afloat as an independent act in 2016, the London crooner\u2019s career would seem preordained. His debut album belligerently establishes this art school boho\u2019s fey Britpop status: he pummels his songs with dandyish imagery, an adversity to laddishness (\u201cTell me who I should support / Red team, green team?\u201d) and a tendency for lovestruck melodrama (\u201cThen I see your face and I want to die\u201d). Its songs are bereft of Britpop\u2019s social commentary, and instead its story lies within its DIY creation \u2013 a bedroom pop star occupying his days with GarageBand rather than narcotics. Cut and Paste\u2019s melodies are glorious \u2013 single Daffodil Days is surging and swoonsome \u2013 but with lyrics so surface, you sometimes wish he\u2019d get out a bit more.",
