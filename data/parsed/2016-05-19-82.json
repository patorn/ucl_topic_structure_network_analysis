  "body": "Ireland\u2019s finest singer-songwriter and interpreter of other people\u2019s songs returns with his first album in three years. Christy Moore\u2019s new set is as varied as his celebrated live performances: unexpected songs are reworked with his intimate, soulful vocals. He starts with a series of easygoing pieces by Irish writers, including the upbeat The Tuam Beat, but the mood changes with the thoughtful, partly self-composed title track, which blends nostalgia and history. Then comes the politics. A powerful treatment of Wallflower, Peter Gabriel\u2019s 80s lament for political prisoners, is followed by Mick Blake\u2019s Oblivious, an angry analysis of Ireland, a hundred years on from the Easter Rising. The backing includes fiddle, harmonica and mandolin, and for the final track, Christy recites a poem by Dave Lordan against a wash of sound. He celebrates 50 years as a full-time singer this summer, and he\u2019s still taking chances.          Watch Christy Moore sing Oblivious",
