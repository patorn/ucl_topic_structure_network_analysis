She is desperate to raise awareness about what\u2019s at stake for what could be dubbed \u201cGeneration E\u201d \u2013 those suddenly confronted with the possibility of living their adult lives outside a union that most take for granted. \u201cI don\u2019t want the prejudices of the older generation to decide this for our generation,\u201d she says. \u201cOur grandparents should not decide our future for us.\u201d She has good reason to worry. At last year\u2019s general election, only 43% of those aged 18-24 voted, compared with 78% of over-65s. Up to 4 million in the same age group are still not on the electoral register. Longland, like many young people, is in favour of staying in the EU, but fears too many of her contemporaries will not bother to register in time for referendum day on 23 June. Their future in Europe would then be determined by Eurosceptic older voters, who are much more likely to turn out on the day. Last night in the university campus pub, the Mooch Bar, she and the rest of the Nottingham Students for Europe organised a Eurovision Song Contest party: sign a registration form, available in the bar, and you could win a \u00a325 travel voucher if you picked the winning country out of a hat. \u201cThis is really important,\u201d said Longland. \u201cWe can enjoy the right to travel easily in Europe and to study in Europe. We are the easyJet generation. We take it for granted. It would be a huge shame if we turned our back on all that.\u201d Up and down the country, groups of young people are stirring into action. But can those who are engaged and motivated connect with enough of their contemporaries to turn apathy into interest? And with so little time to spare? The charity Bite the Ballot, which persuaded hundreds of thousands to register before the last general election, is to set up \u201cdemocracy cafes\u201d in Starbucks branches, laying on experts to explain how to register and vote, and what the referendum is all about (Bite the Ballot does not take sides but merely encourages participation). On 31 May it will organise a flashmob in Albert Square, Manchester, with thousands of young people forming a giant X. Then, on 4 June, it plans a \u201cthunderclap\u201d on social media to tell young people that they have just three days left to register and influence their futures. Harriet Kingaby, 32, and Bethan Harris, 30, who both have jobs in communications and strategy, are now lending much of their time to a new campaign called We Are Europe, working out of cafes in Bristol. Again, their objective is to get young people to register, and then to inspire them to go out to vote. Harris says she and a small group of friends got involved because they felt their generation had been \u201clocked out\u201d of decision making and let down by the system for too long, and had to use this chance to strike back. \u201cAs a generation of millennials, we want to create a better world, but we have felt excluded from decision making,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all protested about Iraq and we were not listened to. There is no one representing our generation in parliament on the issues that matter to us. In the civil service, there is no ministry for young people. We feel locked out. It is becoming intensely frustrating. \u201cWe have endured a recession and endless austerity, which has impacted on us as a generation, and we are the people most affected by current policies. We are all young professionals. The reason we have got so fired up by this referendum is not that we are Europhiles or that we love the EU \u2013 although we do think it has been hugely beneficial for us. But it is a sense that this [Brexit] would be another massive step backwards, and our generation can\u2019t take any more of that. We are the difference between an in and an out vote.\u201d There are now more than 50 campaigns on university campuses pushing students to register and then to vote, and a clear majority are pro-EU. Tanya Williams of Bite the Ballot has worked on previous registration campaigns and is now doing so in Brent, north London. Outside the universities, she says, it is an uphill struggle and, at first, the feedback is often not good. \u201cIt is very hard. People will at first say no, and that they are not bothered, and it makes no difference, but you have to battle through. Then, some time later, you sometimes find the same people have got involved after all. It really can make a difference.\u201d We Are Europe believes that Leave campaigners are deliberating staying away from students because they know that most young people want to stay in, and if they highlighted the need to register they would be shooting themselves in the foot. They cite comments last week from Arron Banks, the Ukip donor and founder of Leave.EU, who declared: \u201cIf turnout is low, we win. If it\u2019s high, we lose. Our strategy is to bore the electorate into submission, and it\u2019s working.\u201d Students for Europe, meanwhile, will launch a poster and social media campaign on Monday asking: \u201cWhere are you on 23 June? Home? Uni? Glasto? Register to Vote Now.\u201d The Electoral Commission is sending out a giant mailshot this weekend to 28 million households, explaining how to register and vote. Back in Nottingham, Longland is telling students that the referendum vote is not like a general election, where the first-past-the-post system often makes people think their vote makes no difference. This time it will. \u201cWe have just got to up our game and show that in this referendum we really can make the difference \u2013 because we really can.\u201d     Don\u2019t know: Feron Grant. Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer    NOT REGISTERED, UNDECIDED Feron Grant, 32 Painter and decorator, LondonI\u2019m not registered. I had meant to, I just didn\u2019t get round to doing it. To be honest, I don\u2019t know how I\u2019d vote. The EU is a bit tricky. Where I work, in the building trade, you\u2019ve got a lot of EU people. I would say [immigration from the EU] probably makes it a little harder, workwise. I\u2019ve got friends from the EU working with me every day but when they come, they\u2019ll work for anything so it makes it harder for a proper professional like me. I\u2019ve got my NVQ and stuff but it\u2019s a challenge for you to get work because they\u2019ll take [work] for anything. So we could say \u201cleave\u201d and that would stop people from coming here, but then you might also stop big business deals \u2013 there might be rich people that are coming to build big buildings and give other people work. A lot of the big businesses say that there will be difficulties if we leave. I do talk about it with friends all the time, but we always come round to the same spot. I don\u2019t know.     Remain: Hannah Capstick. Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer    REGISTERED, SUPPORTS REMAIN Hannah Capstick, 22Studying for a graduate diploma in law, LeedsAmong my friendship group, people didn\u2019t vote in the local elections. It wasn\u2019t just because they hadn\u2019t got registered in time; it was because they\u2019re just not engaged and not interested. It\u2019s really frustrating because generally I would think that young people would want to stay in, but they\u2019re not going to vote - and the all the old isolationist people are going to be voting. I think [young people\u2019s apathy] is linked to representation and the idea that the people representing us are very disconnected. It\u2019s to do with the attitudes of politicians and how they behave. How can you respect a politician like Boris Johnson who has two letters prepared, depending on the way things go. How can you feel inspired by him being one of the leaders of the Leave campaign? I don\u2019t think either campaign has been especially powerful or impressive. It hasn\u2019t swayed me either way. I knew how I was going to vote before, and it hasn\u2019t really affected me.     Don\u2019t know: Biuram Billan. Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer    REGISTERED BUT NOT SURE WHETHER HE\u2019LL VOTE Biuram Billan, 21  Economics student, LondonThey\u2019re saying we\u2019re going to lose backing from other countries [if we leave the EU]. Then we\u2019re buggered. I don\u2019t want us to turn into North Korea. But I also don\u2019t want our country to have to bail other countries out. Why have we got to bail out Greece? To be honest, if I was to vote, I would probably listen to my mum. If I hadn\u2019t got so much studying going on and had a lot of free time, I would look at what\u2019s going on. I\u2019d Google it, but only for, like, five minutes, and then I\u2019d decide. But I\u2019m not doing much about it because I\u2019m concentrating on other stuff. No one knows what will happen if we leave and what will happen if we don\u2019t. It\u2019s all guesses. It\u2019s such a small issue in my head, to be honest, that I haven\u2019t thought about it much. I missed [the last] vote for the mayor as well. I\u2019ve got exams, and I was at uni studying. It\u2019s not a high priority for me to go all the way back to Essex [where I am registered] and vote.     Remain: Martine Valle. Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer    NOT YET REGISTERED, SUPPORTS REMAIN Martine Valle, 25  Student midwife, Castleford, West YorksI\u2019m not registered to vote but I want to vote to stay. I just think that we get a lot of benefits from being in the European Union, like the free movement of people. I think that the rightwing media and the conservative government are scapegoating people all the time to influence how we feel about the EU. They talk about these massive influxes of people who don\u2019t bring anything to the economy, when in fact it\u2019s been proven that they do. Why not stay? And what would we do if we left \u2013 we\u2019re just some little island in the middle of the sea. Young people I know aren\u2019t talking lots about it - this is the first discussion I\u2019ve had about the EU. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s an issue that people are engaging with. There are other things going on: Syria, the austerity measures here\u2026 I don\u2019t think it\u2019s on the agenda for most people. I don\u2019t think there will be a very good turnout among young people \u2013 which is quite sad.     Leave: Darren Grimes.    REGISTERED, SUPPORTS LEAVE Darren Grimes, 22Brighton University student, fashion and business studies, who has set up BeLeave, a group representing young people in the campaign for a leave vote in the EU referendumI don\u2019t think politicians have done enough to reach out to young people. I think that\u2019s wrong and that young people deserve the chance to make an informed and rational choice in the debate. I set up BeLeave to put forward an optimistic case for those young people who do believe we\u2019re better off and have a brighter future outside of the EU. As the debate progresses, and young people start to see Boris Johnson telling them: look, this is going to be your last chance, and it might be your only chance, and this is a referendum that will impact upon your life more than any other generation \u2026 Once they start to get this message, and start to think: maybe I should give this a bit more attention \u2026 that might boost turnout. But there is a fear that young people are slightly forgotten about in this debate so far, and maybe won\u2019t turn out in high numbers.     \u2018Remain\u2019: Eugene Shaw. Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer    REGISTERED, SUPPORTS REMAIN Eugene Shaw, 24  Mechanical engineering student, KentYeah, of course I\u2019m going to vote and I am registered. I want us to stay, because there are a lot of advantages [to being in the EU]. I wasn\u2019t a fan of the EU until I read the news and realised that the pros outweigh the cons. Normally you plan a holiday during summer and visit European countries, but after Brexit you would have to get a visa. It\u2019s a hassle and nobody wants that hassle. I\u2019m thinking one day of moving out of London to somewhere in Europe where life would be cheaper. I\u2019m a mechanical engineering student in my second year and most of the engineering companies are in Germany, France and Spain. VW, for example, is a German company and that\u2019s where we aspire to work. So if we leave it\u2019s going to affect [employment opportunities] as well. There are not many good mechanical engineering companies in the UK. I\u2019m a football fan and a supporter of Manchester United. I realised that some of the football players and teams might leave [if Britain left the EU]. That alone puts me off. I love the diversity of football in the UK, and we don\u2019t have that many good English players, to be honest.     Leave: Ziyad Korman. Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer    REGISTERED, SUPPORTS LEAVE Ziyad Korman, 29Warehouse worker, London  I\u2019m going to vote out. It\u2019s not fair on the citizens here - we\u2019re hardly getting any jobs. I\u2019m not really interested in this kind of thing. There are one or two television shows [on the referendum debate] that I have watched but I\u2019m not really bothered. With my background, we\u2019re not really interested in this kind of stuff. But everyone that I know, they want to vote out - there are hardly any houses, and rents have gone up in London as the population has grown.",
