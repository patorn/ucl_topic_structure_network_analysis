At the very least, the club are likely to be charged with failing to control their players after several confrontations marred their 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge on Monday night which handed the league title to Leicester.   Related: Tottenham\u2019s Danny Rose apologises for setting bad example in Chelsea draw    The ill feeling spilled over into the tunnel at the end as Spurs and Chelsea players got involved in a rolling maul which led to the home manager Guus Hiddink being sent flying and his counterpart Mauricio Pochettino attemping to prise the multiple brawlers apart. The referee Mark Clattenburg had struggled to control order in a bad-tempered game in which there were continual flashpoints, most notably just before half-time when Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 appeared to rake his finger nails across Diego Costa\u2019s eyes and \u00c9rik Lamela trod on Cesc F\u00e0bregas\u2019s fingers towards the end. Those booked for Spurs were Kyle Walker, Jan Vertonghen, Danny Rose, Eric Dier, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9, Lamela, Christian Eriksen, Ryan Mason and Harry Kane. Spurs will receive an automatic fine for having six players or more yellow-carded. Three Chelsea players made it into the referee\u2019s notebook: Branislav Ivanovic, Mikel John Obi and Willian. The stakes had been raised by Eden Hazard before the game when he said that Chelsea would go all out to stop their London rivals winning the Premier league.       \u201cWe don\u2019t want \u2013 the fans, the club, the players \u2013 Tottenham to win the Premier League, but in football you never know. We hope for Leicester because they deserve to be champions this season, but we will see,\u201d he said. Hazard predictably came on at half-time to score the equalisier in the 88th minute. Pochettino, who was sent off 13 times as a centre-back with Espanyol, refused to criticise his players, saying: \u201cIt was a derby, we were fighting to win the title and Chelsea were fighting to try and win. We were all involved. When you play for the title and play a big team like Chelsea, they want to win. It was normal emotion, fighting on the pitch is not a good example, for both teams.\u201d \u201cOf course it was a very emotional and hectic game,\u201d said Hiddink. \u201cAt the end highly emotional, there was a bit of verbal animosity and I tried to come in between and protect a bit and go into the locker room. We shuffled a bit on the benches. \u201cI took F\u00e0bregas, I tried to get him down [the tunnel], because there were some words in Spanish and I understand Spanish. Threatening a bit. There became more people involved and we shuffled around.\u201d Kane later wrote on Twitter: \u201cI\u2019m so proud of this team and club. We put it all on the line but unfortunately it just wasn\u2019t enough. We learn and come back stronger!           \u2018Walt Disney wouldn\u2019t script this\u2019 \u2013 Leicester City champions    \u201cCongratulations to Leicester on what they achieved. Finally thanks to all the fans! Let\u2019s finish the season strong now!\u201d       Pochettino said: \u201cI want to congratulate Leicester Football Club, Claudio Ranieri, all the players.\u201d The Leicester manager called Hiddink to thank Chelsea for their role in handing his team the title. Hiddink said: \u201cHe called and thanked us for what we did, especially the second half, and I congratulated him for being champions. His voice was trembling a bit.\u201d",
