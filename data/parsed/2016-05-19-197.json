  "body": "By coincidence I was listening to the Tory MP Steve Baker, complaining on Radio 4\u2019s Today about Downing Street\u2019s orchestrated abuse of the Brexit camp, while throwing out piles of old newspapers, multitasking as many people do in a tidying moment.  \u201cQueensberry rules please,\u201d he said. I\u2019m sure Baker, MP for High Wycombe since 2010, is as sincere as a fairly inexperienced politician can be, though it was a bit off-message on a day when David Cameron\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech package was supposed  to be a forward-looking exercise in binding up Tory Euro-wounds.  But one-sided abuse only? A campaign of abuse in which shaggy big beasts like Michael Heseltine and John Major  are sent on radio or TV to disparage the Brexiters by the youngsters at No 10? I don\u2019t think so, Steve. I think you\u2019ll find they were invited on by the wicked media, bent on generating lively headlines. I believe Brexit\u2019s box office champion, Boris Johnson, is quite media savvy too.   Related: In Starbucks and on Tinder, campaigners seek out the young vote    And the media\u2019s own proactive role, always more self-effacing (\u201cwe just report the news\u201d) than it should be? What I couldn\u2019t help noticing going through old copies of the Daily Mail was how much it bangs on about Cameron\u2019s \u201cProject Fear\u201d strategy for the 23 June vote, almost as much as independence campaigners did in Scotland\u2019s 2014 referendum. That\u2019s a bit rich, I thought, not for the first time. After all, the Mail\u2019s brilliant strategy for a hugely successful paper is rooted in its own version of Project Fear, especially aimed at its loyal female readers. It\u2019s spine-chilling stuff and often very readable. But first readers have to wade their way past front pages Project Fear-ish enough to give them strokes. Here\u2019s a recent sample: Greed of Loan Shark Banks; Bomb Plotter\u2019s Tour of Britain; Thousands of Heart Victims Killed by Poor Care; Hospitals Braced for Five Days of A&E Chaos and EU Vote: Now PM Warns of War and Genocide (he didn\u2019t). You get the picture: it\u2019s Project Fear on a daily basis. The only upbeat exception I could find was: Birthday Smile That Says She\u2019s Loving Every Minute, but that\u2019s excusable on the Queen\u2019s 90th, though almost certainly untrue as well as sentimental. The poor woman would probably have preferred a little zzz. So Baker, by trade an RAF aerospace engineer turned Lehman Brothers IT man (the 2008 crash drove him into politics), has little to complain about while he has Fleet Street\u2019s dogs of war on his side.  Cameron makes a reasonable point about the EU helping keep Europe\u2019s fragile peace and the Mail \u2013 not Cameron \u2013 turns it into a \u201cwar and genocide\u201d warning. You don\u2019t believe me? Read the speech here. Boris plays the Hitler card and the Mail reports that Tories backed him (they were actually divided). It was a generosity not shown when Ken Livingstone crassly played the same card a few days earlier. And so on. Of the four papers I buy at home the Guardian, Times and FT all make a decent stab at reporting both sides. I assume their readers would insist. So the pro-EU FT recently carried a 300-word explanation of why a Treasury official had been wrong-footed on a Brexit detail. It was so obscure that I failed to understand it after three attempts. But I was glad it was there, against the paper\u2019s editorial line.  Needless to say, the Mail, an excellent paper in so many ways, rarely does balance, which it mistakenly sees as weakness. But nor do the wider Brexit crew, who have said some pretty lurid things, not least about the prospects for uncontrolled immigration into Britain if we don\u2019t leave the EU. The Mail gives the impression that 75 million Turks will be heading straight for Penge. For the sake of fairness (see above) I\u2019m not going to assert that one side has been consistently worse than the other side. Campaigners in both camps have made foolish, inflammatory or unprovable claims, floated statistics they might not want examined in daylight. The Treasury\u2019s official analysis is not beyond criticism and has been criticised extensively. But even Christopher Booker, founder editor of Private Eye and pro-Brexit Sunday Telegraph columnist, calls the Brexit camp\u2019s \u201c\u00a3350m a week\u201d payments (allegedly) made to Brussels a childish untruth. Boris keeps repeating the bogus slogan all the same.     Baker\u2019s Radio 4 complaints make him sound quite innocent in a wholesome way. All of which helps explain why he\u2019s a free market romantic who thinks Britain will be better off if we reject Europe in favour of the open sea. None of us really know what will happen after 23 June\u2019s verdict (do register, kids, I\u2019ll be dead by the time you regret it). The best we can do is assess the balance of risk. As in Scotland in 2014 (correctly as it turned out, even with oil edging back to $50 a barrel), the balance of expert assessment is in favour of staying in. That\u2019s scientists and house builders, farmers and big pharma, universities as well as those fat cat corporations that upset Baker. It\u2019s not mere self-interest; it\u2019s underpinned by factual analysis. Such a conclusion isn\u2019t brave or romantic, but, as in Scotland, it is real. That may be why the latest Ipsos Mori poll, grudgingly reported in the London Evening Standard, shows voters sceptical of both camps, but edging towards remain by 55% to 37%. Healthy scepticism, quite different from mere cynicism, is as much in order about fallible polls as it is about fallible politicians. So don\u2019t believe Ipsos Mori either. This one won\u2019t be over until the fat lady sings (and the Mail promptly tells its readers that she\u2019s overweight).",
