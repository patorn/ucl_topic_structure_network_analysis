  "body": "\u2022 A feature about the BBC children\u2019s channel CBeebies said that it did not make its own programmes, but commissioned and \u201cpre-bought\u201d shows from independent production companies. In fact CBeebies makes about half of its shows in-house (The clean, green and slightly bonkers world of CBeebies, 5 May, page 29). \u2022 An editorial about Syria said that after\u00a0five years of civil war the city of Aleppo had an \u201cestimated 300,000 remaining inhabitants\u201d. The figure of 300,000 is an estimate of the number of people living in the rebel-held eastern part of Aleppo. A further 1.3 million people are estimated to be living in western Aleppo (The agonies of Aleppo and the talks that shrink from the facts, 6 May, page 34). \u2022 Biometric passports have been issued in the UK since March 2006, not the spring of 2007 as we said in article about travellers being turned away from flights to the US because their passport did not contain an electronic chip. They were introduced gradually throughout 2006 (Chip passports needed for US, tourists told, 6 May, page 1).",
