  "body": "Amid the much-mythologised graffiti that appeared around Sorbonne University during the French civil unrest in May 1968, one line still stands out as intriguing and ambiguous: \u201cThe future will only contain what we put into it now.\u201d What appears at first utopian has more than a hint of the ominous. While augmented reality creates a city individualised for every occupant, and developments in modular architecture and nanotechnology might result in rooms that change form and function at a whim, the problem lies in the unforeseen. The smart city will also be the surveillance city. For the moment, we remain largely wedded to superficial visual futures. The likelihood is that the prevailing chrome and chlorophyll vision of architects and urbanists will become as much an enticing, but outdated, fashion as the Raygun Gothic of The Jetsons or the cyberpunk of Blade Runner. Rather than a sudden leap into dazzling space age-style cityscapes, innovations will unfold in real-time \u2013 and so too will catastrophes. The very enormity of what cities face seems beyond the realms of believability, and encourages postponement and denial.  \u201cSurvivability\u201d should be added to urban buzzwords like connectivity and sustainability. Three quarters of all major metropolises lie on the coastline. In China alone, 20 million people per year move to cities, with the flood-prone Pearl River Delta now the world\u2019s largest urbanised area, according to the World Bank.     Blade Runner\u2019s futuristic city scene. Photograph: Allstar/Cinetext/Warner Bros    A recent report by Christian Aid places more than a billion people in coastal cities vulnerable to severe flooding and extreme weather due to climate change by 2070, with Kolkata, Mumbai and Dhaka topping the list. Many more people face the knock-on effects of severe flooding such as fresh water shortages, refugee crises and political instability.     Cities would be designed to allow for a co-existence between water and civic activities  Seth McDowell     The question remains whether large-scale adaptation will be possible in the face of short electoral cycles, the abiding influence of commercial interests, and a sense of inertia beneficial to the status quo. Since Kenz\u014d Tange\u2019s Tokyo Bay Plan (1960), one tendency has been towards proposing intriguing but as yet ephemeral \u201cfloating\u201d cities. For real cities facing sea-level rise, Seth McDowell from Mcdowellespinosa architects identifies three strategies: \u201cDefence, retreat and adaptation.\u201d \u201cCities and populations with generous resources and engineering capacity will likely simply take the defence strategy and build mega engineering structures to keep the water away \u2013 similar to the Delta Works in the Netherlands. For those with less cultural and economic investments in the water\u2019s edge, we will likely see retreat as a strategy. However, I see retreat as both a horizontal and vertical operation. So, retreating does not just mean packing up and moving inland, but could also mean elevating above the water.\u201d Venice is the commonly quoted model for this process, but a more recent example (though considerably less aesthetically appealing) is the platform oil city of Neft Da\u015fhlari in Azerbaijan. \u201cWater becomes a new datum \u2013 not so much a habitable space, but rather a fluctuating ground,\u201d McDowell explains. \u201cCities would be designed or reconfigured to accept rising water levels and adapt \u2026 to allow for a co-existence between water and civic activities. You can see this strategy in projects like De Urbanisten\u2019s Water Square Benthemplein in Rotterdam, where a public square doubles as a water storage basin.\u201d     Terreform One\u2019s Ecotarium project in the North Pole is based on the premise of massive human migration to the north to escape severe flooding and increased temperatures. Photograph: Mitchell Joachim/Terreform One    Architecture group Terreform One adopts a similarly counter-intuitive but practical approach in its Governors Hook project, where \u201cinstead of keeping the water out, the design allows the water in\u201d. The relationship between the urban and rural must be reconsidered, co-founder Mitchell Joachim suggests, to prevent cities adopting a siege mentality and fighting a losing battle with the elements. \u201cWe need to find these much larger soft buffer zones that are accepting of these two worlds of nature and city. Before Hurricane Sandy, we were using these ghost fleets, old military vessels as artificial reefs that would be embedded into the edges of our city and allow sediment and life-forms to build up on top of them over time and create these middle zones between land and sea.\u201d The devastation wrought by Hurricane Sandy made these plans seem particularly pertinent, if not prophetic. Dealing with waste The population explosion and advances of the industrial age have produced unprecedented levels of waste into landfill, the sea and the sky. Countering measures, such as developing nanotechnology that would see buildings alleviate pollution at a molecular level, are still in their infancy. In the meantime, waste is as much a testament to civilisation as our urban skylines. Mcdowellespinosa proposes a shift in thinking: \u201cWaste is just a material state,\u201d McDowell says. \u201cSince it tends to be unwanted, it is cheap.    We need to find these much larger soft buffer zones that are accepting of these two worlds of nature and city  Mitchell Joachim     \u201cThe main issue to overcome in viewing waste as raw material is the energy required to transform the material from a state of refuse to a state of sophistication. There is also the perceptual challenge \u2013 how can waste be transformed to acceptable visual and performance standards? We\u2019ve explored this idea in projects such as City of Blubber, which imagines converting Hong Kong\u2019s food waste into a productive bioplastic material.\u201d What we might see as absurd is already happening through necessity in settings like Manshiyat Naser in Egypt, where a \u201cGarbage City\u201d functions on the refuse of Cairo. Mitchell Joachim agrees that our current approach is a problem. \u201cThere is no such thing as waste. Waste is supposed to go away but there is no \u2018away\u2019. We look at fully \u2018upcyclable\u2019 cities where projects, products, concepts that we make are always intended to be cycled upwards again and again.\u201d     The City of Blubber imagines converting Hong Kong\u2019s food waste into a productive bioplastic material. Photograph: Mcdowellespinosa    This is reflected in Terreform One\u2019s Rapid Re(f)use project \u2013 a \u201cfuture city [that] makes no distinction between waste and supply\u201d.  Engaged in projects from the shifting pods of Peristaltic City to the transformed-Arctic Ecotarium of Future North, Joachim suggests a radical change in our economic and political systems to match our technological ingenuity. \u201cThey say we\u2019re in the age of the Anthropocene but really it\u2019s more accurate to say we\u2019re in the Capitalocene. Everyone has to grow and show proof of growth. And we know that is impossible. Nothing grows to infinity. There will always be stresses whether on the market or the environment that will cause it to feedback.  \u201cAt Terreform One, we\u2019re anticipating, not an endless growth system, but a state where waste doesn\u2019t exist \u2013 a steady state or closed, stable economy that cycles back and recognises the limits of the earth\u2019s metabolism and what we can take out. This would be done with footprint calculations and life-cycle analyses on anything we produce.\u201d Rather than view the city architecturally, Joachim encourages us to see it also as a series of interconnected metabolic systems, akin to a biological organism. \u201cIn a culture of biology, you just don\u2019t design something for a single purpose. A cherry tree is servicing thousands of other forms of life. It produces thousands of cherries that get absorbed into the soil and feed all different types of flora and fauna. It\u2019s connected into a web of life.\u201d Terreform One\u2019s ideas and designs might seem wildly visionary on first glance but looking closer, they go beyond speculative concepts into proposing functioning models. \u201cWhat we do is create very detailed fictive scenarios that don\u2019t promise the future will end up this way, but rather we think about what the inherent issues are and bring these to the foreground and talk in a logical way how cities might respond.\u201d     The Rapid Re(f)use project supposes an extended New York reconstituted from its own landfill material. Photograph: Mitchell Joachim, Terreform ONE    The obstacle in adapting cities is the same obstacle in tackling fossil fuel emissions; what Joachim identifies as \u201cpredatory drag\u201d. \u201cIf you\u2019re an oil company, you\u2019re going to say \u2018Yes, solar panels are great, we\u2019ll invest in that. We think in 2050, we\u2019ll all be using solar panels.\u2019 Until then, every single day they are in business, there are such enormous profits for them that the point is to delay.\u201d Given how embedded these interests are in political circles, change from within needs an unlikely synthesis of the community-orientated philosophy of Jane Jacobs and the force, connections and leverage of Robert Moses. It will likely take a disastrous jolt (\u201can environmental Pearl Harbour\u201d) to alter the calculus of negligence economics, provide a rousing symbol and focus the issue, by which stage it might be too late.    Rather than devising more complex technologies in an escalating battle against nature, we adapt and invite the water in  Ostap Rudakevych     One day, cities may be forced to follow their inhabitants in becoming mobile. Ron Herron\u2019s Walking City for Archigram  may still suggest the outer reaches of science fiction, but the idea of moving a city has already happened: the Swedish town of Kiruna was relocated two miles away. And with developments in the assembling of buildings through drones, nanotechnology-enhanced materials and industrial 3D printing, dissembling and deploying them elsewhere could be much easier than at present. Changing cities Perhaps the likeliest outcome is that cities will simply continue as they are, or be deserted. The costs of change may result in inundated areas simply being abandoned (in the model of Detroit or New Orleans) while more privileged areas will be protected. Sacrifice zones and ruins may form in coastal cities as the authorities and the rich move up or out.     Aqualta by Clouds Architecture Office illustrates New York adapting to rising waters. Photograph: Clouds AO    Containing a critique of the present, as every prophesy does, Clouds Architecture Office\u2019s Aqualta envisages a partially submerged metropolis where life nevertheless carries on. \u201cThe city would in effect lift its skirt allowing water to flow beneath its feet,\u201d explains partner Ostap Rudakevych. \u201cThinking through the ramifications \u2013 flooded subway tunnels, submerged roads and sidewalks, street level retail underwater \u2013 allows for new conditions to emerge, such as transport by boat or dirigible, suspended walkways, oyster beds, and a generally slower and quieter lifestyle. Perhaps fossil fuels would be gone by then, yielding a quieter city without the sounds of engines or motors. \u201cRather than devising ever more complex technologies in an escalating battle against nature, we adapt and invite the water in.\u201d   Related: Story of cities #48: Cybercity, Mauritius \u2013 a vision of Africa's 'smart' future?    Beyond the initial surprise, there are sound ideas and a scathing perceptiveness underlying the project: \u201cAqualta was guided by the observation that people are resistant to change, especially if it means sacrificing comfort or convenience. Needed lifestyle adjustments have been gradual or non-existent. Aqualta was intended as a kind of slow-burn wake-up call, a seductive portrayal of where we\u2019re headed, like it or not.\u201d To go beyond the superficial aspects of future cities requires seeing past the architectural shell and the marketing to the systems, relationships and people within \u2013 the citizens rather than the citadels. \u201cA city is more than a place in space,\u201d Patrick Geddes pointed out, \u201cit is a drama in time.\u201d Change will be continuous, because \u201cdesigning a city is like painting a watercolour in a stream\u201d, says Joachim. In order to be preserved, the city must become adaptable. So too must its designers and its inhabitants \u2013 but they must do so together. We are endlessly, fancifully predicting the future partly in order to distract ourselves from the fact that we\u2019re already creating it, for good and ill.
