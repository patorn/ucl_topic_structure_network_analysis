My eldest brother told me to do that. I never did. And that\u2019s what I regret.\u201d One of Britain\u2019s best-known explorers, Joe recently spent five weeks filming in remote parts of Burma (now Myanmar) following the footsteps of his late father, who served there during the second world war. He\u2019d suggested the film a while ago, but nobody wanted it. \u201cThen the BBC said they loved it. I think they changed their minds about what documentaries should be \u2013 not just travel, but a personal quest, with a family, and \u2018trying to understand your father\u2019. And that awful American phrase, \u2018getting some kind of closure\u2019 \u2013 which is the biggest load of bollocks I\u2019ve ever heard.\u201d Despite his bluff talk, Joe\u2019s journey threw up powerful questions that he continues to wrestle with, as do many people. Such as: why don\u2019t fathers and sons talk to each other more? And: which of us, really, has the slightest idea what our parents have lived through \u2013 and why don\u2019t we try to find out before it\u2019s too late? Joe was born in Malaya, the fifth child of Lieutenant-Colonel Ian Simpson (Da) and his wife Geraldine (Ma). Joe knew that his father was in the Gurkhas, but that was about it until 1978, when Joe was 18 and the Imperial War Museum asked veterans to provide materials for its collection. \u201cIt turned out that he was a Chindit \u2013 forerunners of the SAS. He had landed at night behind Japanese lines in the Burmese jungle and fought the Japanese. I was fascinated.\u201d There were 1,350 men in his father\u2019s regiment, the Prince of Wales 4th Gurkha Rifles. After four months in the jungle, only 25 men and eight officers emerged capable of fighting. \u201cI heard that his commanding officer was killed in an attack \u2013 mortally wounded and then decapitated. I remember, as an 18-year-old, being pretty alarmed by that.\u201d Ian didn\u2019t share much more but it turned out that he had kept a diary, written in secret, against army regulations. \u201cI remember thinking, there\u2019s a map, and diary \u2013 you could follow in his footsteps \u2026\u201d The situation in Burma in the late 1970s made any such trip impossible, but that has changed. Late last year, Joe went there with the jungle explorer Ed Stafford. They took with them Ian\u2019s diary and map. \u201cI was probably walking the same tracks Da had walked down.\u201d     Ian Simpson in uniform, 1944. Photograph: Courtesy Joe Simpson    Being there significantly changed Joe\u2019s understanding of what his father\u2019s force went through. \u201cI always thought the scary thing would be worrying about being found and fighting your way out. But they depended on supply drops, sometimes having to eat roots. And the heat was unbelievable. No matter how much we drank at the end of the day, our piss was still brown. Sorry to be crude, but that\u2019s an indicator of dehydration \u2013 as a climber, I know how significant that is. And there was serious disease. If you were wounded, or if you got sick, and they couldn\u2019t cut an airstrip in the jungle, which they often couldn\u2019t, you would die.\u201d On many occasions, soldiers were left behind with a pistol and some rations. \u201cThere were many occasions where their own medics shot them because they couldn\u2019t be moved and they didn\u2019t want to leave them to the Japanese. And Da did this.\u201d It\u2019s striking that Joe is so gripped by soldiers being left for dead because perhaps the most famous thing about Joe Simpson is that he was once left for dead himself. In 1985, he was caught in a storm, high on a mountain in the Andes. He broke his right leg, and his friend and climbing partner, Simon, lowered him and had to cut the rope he was hanging from. Joe fell into a crevasse. Simon gave up hope of finding him. For three and a half days Joe crawled back to camp, close to death. The story of that disastrous expedition was later told in his book, Touching the Void, subsequently turned into a film. \u201cIt was only when I got back to England that the psychological trauma hit me. One night, I must\u2019ve been screaming because I woke up and found my father with me. He touched me on the shoulder and said, \u2018It\u2019s all right, I\u2019ve seen this.\u2019 He was very understanding. He\u2019d obviously seen it in the past. He understood what was going on. It was perhaps what we call post-traumatic stress. He said, don\u2019t worry about it. And that was it. But I felt embarrassed. I made damned sure it would never happen in front of my father again.\u201d Looking back, Joe says this attitude seems a bit ridiculous, but that was how he felt. \u201cI was brought up in a particular way \u2013 boys don\u2019t cry.\u201d He is most impressed by the evidence that his father could empathise. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t something I\u2019d seen before,\u201d he says. \u201cI never saw it again, either.\u201d Sometimes Joe feels jealous of the relationship his friends have with their fathers. \u201cThere\u2019s a sort of friendship and communication that just didn\u2019t exist with us.\u201d     Ian Simpson, front left, with the Prince of Wales 4th Gurkha Rifles in Burma. Photograph: Courtesy Joe Simpson    Ian\u2019s own father was a soldier before him \u2013 a working-class boy who joined up underage, in the first world war, lived in India, then joined the Somali Camel Corps in the second world war. Joe\u2019s mother, Geraldine, the daughter of a doctor, came from Ireland. When Joe was a child, the family rarely settled for more than a couple of years \u2013 moving between Malaya, Gibraltar, Northern Ireland and Germany. At eight years old, like his brothers and sisters before him, Joe was sent to boarding school in England. \u201cIt pretty well bankrupted our parents, but it was to give us a continuity of education. My mum agreed to us going but I remember her telling me it tore her heart out. And I don\u2019t think you should be separated from your family at that age. Back then, you went away and didn\u2019t see your parents for a long time. Just letters every now and then. After my mother died, we found all these letters from all of us. She kept them all, for some peculiar reason. There were letters from me, aged eight or nine. I read them and burst into tears. What was very apparent was that this was an appallingly homesick, lonely child. But Da was sent to boarding school from India, when he was seven. So I never thought I could complain.\u201d On balance, he believes that the separation he experienced can also be helpful. \u201cIt makes you more independent, which has advantages. But in relationships it means you are less open because you are used to being rejected.\u201d     Joe and Ian, their last photograph together. Photograph: Courtesy Joe Simpson    Ian Simpson died in 2010. \u201cI felt more alone in the world,\u201d Joe says. \u201cI had all that time when he was ill, towards the end, when I could have sat down with his diary and said, \u2018explain this, what happened here, what happened there?\u2019 I can\u2019t believe I didn\u2019t.\u201d To be fair, the reticence went both ways. Today, Joe has written eight books. Before Ian died, he gave him one of those books for Christmas and a bottle of whisky. \u201cI went into the kitchen and was talking to my sister, Sarah. I popped my head round the door and he was reading it. So I went back and said to Sarah, \u2018Da is reading my book!\u2019 She said, \u2018Oh, he\u2019s read them all, he thinks they\u2019re great.\u2019 He never said a word! If you had a son who had written a book, you would probably say you were proud of him. If he\u2019d written an award-winning book that beat Stephen Hawking into second place and was made into a film, you\u2019d think he might have mentioned it. But no.    I wish we\u2019d been closer. I wish we could have talked. I wish I had shared things I did in my life with him  Joe Simpson     \u201cHe didn\u2019t give much away. It sounds like I\u2019m criticising him, but that\u2019s how he was. A good soldier. A good man. A good father. We\u2019re just one of those bloody families who don\u2019t talk.\u201d Joe married two years ago. He and Corrinne live in Sheffield and have a place in Ireland too. He has no wish to be a father. \u201cNever had children, never wanted them. Can\u2019t stand the buggers,\u201d he jokes. As a young man, he though about a military career in order to get a bursary into university. His father called him a blithering idiot. \u201cHe said, \u2018I haven\u2019t brought you up to be an independent individual only for the army to tell you what to do.\u2019 I don\u2019t think he would have chosen to be a soldier. He was training to be a dentist when the war broke out. He stayed on only because when they got demobbed there were a lot of soldiers looking for jobs and he didn\u2019t have any particular qualifications, so the army became his career. He gave us every opportunity. Ma and Da couldn\u2019t afford a house because they were paying school fees. Everything I achieved in my life was down to them.\u201d In Burma, when Joe arrived at Rangoon after weeks in the jungle, he found the Prince of Wales 4th Gurkha Rifles at the cemetery. \u201cThe names of the men were in my father\u2019s diary. Now it hit home. My father probably helped to bury these men. He probably watched them die. It felt as if something that had only been a story was suddenly true, suddenly real. And I really did appreciate Da. I was always immensely proud of him. I just found it difficult to tell him \u2013 and I never did. \u201cI wish we\u2019d been closer. I wish we could have talked. I wish I had shared things I did in my life with him. I wish I could show him the photographs, and tell him where we\u2019d got lost \u2013 and he would call me a blithering idiot. But it\u2019s not going to happen. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve said goodbye and what I really wanted to do was say hello.\u201d \u2022 Burma\u2019s Secret Jungle War with Joe Simpson is on BBC2 on 8 May, 9pm",
