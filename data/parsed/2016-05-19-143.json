  "body": "The summer before my dad died, we moved house. Up until that point, we had lived with my grandmother; now finally our family had our own space to spread out. As the temperature rose, we were gripped by a giddiness that found expression in acts of spontaneity. One night, I watched my parents dance round a bonfire, the glowing embers rising up to my bedroom window like prescient ghosts. Money was tight, so there was no television set. But we owned a turntable on which my dad\u2019s records spun constantly. It played Jimi Hendrix, Johnny Cash and Joan Baez, but mostly, it played Bob Dylan. Tracks from The Basement Tapes and Desire became the anthems of our new life. My brother and I, aged eight and 10, climbed trees, built dens and learned the words of Clothes Line Saga: \u201cHave you heard the news?\u201d he said with a grin. \u201cThe vice-president\u2019s gone mad.\u201d\u201cWhere? \u201cDowntown.\u201d \u201cWhen?\u201d \u201cLast night.\u201d\u201cHmmm, say, that\u2019s too bad!\u201d We would chant, over and over, consumed by our own\u00a0hilarity. It was January and the earth was hard when my dad suffered the aneurysm and collapsed in the back garden, close to the spot where the bonfire had blazed. The paramedics put him on a stretcher and took him to hospital, but with lethargy born of knowing they\u2019d arrived too late. He was 36 going on 37 then, the same age as Dylan. Afterwards, our laughter subsided, but we kept on playing the records. With no grave to visit, listening to Dylan became our sole ritual of remembrance \u2013 his sandpaper rasp, a kind of keening. The two men became so intertwined in my head, I struggled to tell them apart. My dad was the tousled-haired figure on the cover of Blonde on Blonde. A few bars of the harmonica was all it took to summon up his ghost.   Related: A moment that changed me \u2013 listening to David Bowie\u2019s Hunky Dory | Peter Ormerod    Dylan was my dad\u2019s gift to me. I kept on listening to Mr Tambourine Man, Don\u2019t Think Twice and A Simple Twist of Fate, and my love of language grew. What child wouldn\u2019t be spellbound by songs full of vagabonds, pirates and seasick sailors? But it was the strangeness of concepts I was too young to grasp that thrilled me most. What made a mouth \u201cmercury\u201d or eyes \u201cwarehouse\u201d? How did it feel to have \u201cno direction home?\u201d Farewell, Angelina became my party-piece: The machine guns are roaring.The puppets heave rocks.The fiends nail timebombsTo the hands of the clocks. I would sing this at church cheese and wines, to the disapproval of the assembled audience. Or perhaps not. A lot of allowances were made. I grew up, as children are wont to do. I didn\u2019t think about my dad or Dylan as much. I remained a fan of the music, but I wasn\u2019t obsessed. I couldn\u2019t have told you which tracks were on which album and which album was recorded in which year. Cataloguing my relationship with him would have diminished it and, anyway, I wasn\u2019t that interested. Then, one day in early 1995, my brother phoned to say he had bought us both tickets to see him play at Brixton Academy. Work had been manic. London felt like a long way to go. But finally seeing Dylan step out on to the stage brought a sudden rush of euphoria. After an untypically upbeat set, which included Positively 4th Street and Love Minus Zero, No Limit, and two encores, he returned to perform I Shall Be Released with Elvis Costello. Standing amid the sweat and the smoke and the broken beer bottles, it didn\u2019t feel like a gig: it felt like an act of\u00a0faith.

Watching him age has been a weird experience \u2013 a privilege, but also a reminder of what should have been. Together, we have fretted about his spindly legs, his arthritic-looking fingers and his broken voice as if we might be responsible for drawing up his future care plans. When he failed to come north on his last visit to the UK, it felt like a betrayal. My brother is not around so much these days. He lives hundreds of miles away and spends a lot of time in the Far East, but he was up for a visit recently. We passed a convivial evening laughing and drinking, while his son and daughter, aged nine and 11, performed for us. My nephew looks much like him as a child, except that he has red hair and is as yet untouched by loss. His party-piece was Subterranean Homesick Blues. He sang it word-perfect and without hesitation. And so it goes on: Dylan\u2019s music as an heirloom, passed down the generations. The great behatted one turns 75 next week. Imagine that. Despite all the hard living, he\u2019s about to notch up three-quarters of a century. Doesn\u2019t seems fair, somehow. It\u2019s also 50 years since the release of Blonde on Blonde. An abundance of artists, including Emmylou Harris, will celebrate both events at Dylan Fest in Nashville. Other tributes will be held in cities across the US and the UK. At home, I expect I\u2019ll raise a glass and play a few tracks. Enough to remember, but not enough to make me maudlin. It will be a low-key affair, quite unbefitting to his status, but there will no shortage of gratitude, nonetheless.",
