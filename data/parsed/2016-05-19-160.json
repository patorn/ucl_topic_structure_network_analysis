  "body": "Everything about Day of the Dead suggests that it long ago ceased being a fundraising exercise for the Aids charity Red Hot and turned into a painstaking labour of love. You can tell by its packaging, which is beautiful, and by the sleevenotes that gushingly attest to how obsessed its curators \u2013 the National\u2019s Aaron and Bryce Dessner \u2013 are with the album\u2019s subject: Grateful Dead. In among the stuff about the how the spirit of Jerry Garcia lives on and the impossibility of doing the band\u2019s legacy justice, there\u2019s a conversation with Dead guitarist Bob Weir: when he mentions that he likes the National, the Desser twins are left incredulous at receiving a compliment from their idol. But most of all, you can tell by the sheer size of the thing: Day of the Dead goes on and on, as was the wont of the band that inspired it. The original idea was apparently to cover 10 of the Dead\u2019s songs. In its finished form, the compilation is five CDs, 59 tracks and five and a half hours long.   Related: Grateful Dead: final concerts unite fans and band as legends fade away    Its cast list is a veritable lexicon of hip American alt-rock artists, from Anohni to the War on Drugs via Bonny \u201cPrince\u201d Billy, Bill Callahan, Fucked Up and Phosphorescent. Their ranks are bolstered by a sprinkling of contributions from the worlds of country music, retro soul, and the artier end of electronica, including that of Tim Hecker, the one artist who appears to have shown up with mischievous intent. \u201cIdeologically opposed\u201d to Grateful Dead, his contribution is a burst of chaotic abstraction inspired by Grayfolded, John Oswald\u2019s \u201cplunderphonics\u201d layering of multiple live versions of Dark Star, which Hecker clearly views as gleeful desecration rather than homage.             Ironically, Hecker\u2019s Transitive Axis for John Oswald is one of the few moments of out-and-out hallucinogenic weirdness on Day of the Dead. Far fewer of the album\u2019s 327 minutes are given over to extemporisation or frazzled psychedelia than you might expect, given Grateful Dead\u2019s monumental reputation both as the house band at Ken Kesey\u2019s Acid Tests and as rock\u2019s premier improvisers. Indeed, it\u2019s tempting to think their reputation might have cowed the participants. It seems revealing that when Grizzly Bear\u2019s Daniel Rossen and the National take on an extended version of Terrapin Station, it\u2019s as a tightly structured prog rock \u201csuite\u201d replete with orchestra and choir: it\u2019s simultaneously hugely impressive in its own right and entirely at odds with Grateful Dead\u2019s spontaneous approach to their material.  It sometimes seems a shame that more of the contributors didn\u2019t feel impelled to let their freak flag fly a bit, not least because when they do, the results are really impressive. Stephen Malkmus and the Jicks\u2019s solo-heavy China Cat Sunflower/I Know You Rider crackles with nervy energy. The version of Playing in the Band by TV on the Radio\u2019s Tunde Adebimpe and Sonic Youth\u2019s Lee Ranaldo unspools gloriously. And of the two game runs at Dark Star, Cass McCombs\u2019s is the pick: at turns elegant and exploratory, it sounds uncannily like Dark Star might have done were it the work of late 60s Pink Floyd.

It\u2019s not just the sheer profusion of fantastic songs here \u2013 Box of Rain, Easy Wind, Wharf Rat, Goin\u2019 Down the Road Feelin\u2019 Bad \u2013 but how malleable Grateful Dead\u2019s oeuvre proves. For every cover that seems to lose something in translation \u2013 the War on Drugs\u2019 Touch of Grey smooths away the curious ricketiness that made the original seem appealingly like an 80s AOR anthem that had been constructed in a shed from spare parts; Sam Amidion\u2019s version of the traditional And We Bid You Goodnight is beautiful but misses the quavering eeriness that drew the Dead\u2019s interpretation close to the kind of music dug up by Harry Smith\u2019s Anthology of American Folk Music \u2013 there is an abundance of tracks that work when recast as everything from tough psych-soul (Charles Bradley\u2019s Cumberland Blues) and expansive prog-punk (Fucked Up\u2019s Cream Puff War) to the curious combination of banjo picking and tabla drums found on Bela Fleck\u2019s Help Is on the Way.             Furthermore, the album highlights how strangely haunted, otherworldly and idiosyncratic the band\u2019s songs were, no matter how grounded in rootsy Americana they seemed to be. Shivering with feedback and echo, Perfume Genius and Sharon Van Etten\u2019s heartbreaking version of the country ballad To Lay Me Down homes in on the darkness at its centre: a song about sex that might as well be about death. At face value, Sugaree, as performed by Phosphorescent and Jenny Lewis, is an amiable bit of chugging blues boogie, but there\u2019s a strange melancholy tug in the way the chords change that fits with the lyrical intimations of fear and loss.  It seems telling that there\u2019s only one British contributor: Mumford & Sons, whose frontman\u2019s singing voice appears to have emigrated from Wimbledon to Waxahachie in order to fit in. In the UK, Grateful Dead have always been a cult concern. In the US, they\u2019re an imperishable part of the cultural landscape. \u201cTheir music is in our bones \u2026 it\u2019s in the ether,\u201d as the sleevenotes put it \u2013 which, with the best will in the world, it patently isn\u2019t in Britain.  For a lot of British listeners, drawn in less by the album\u2019s subject than its cast list, the important question might not be how faithful it is to the band\u2019s ethos but whether it works as an album if you don\u2019t have the same deep knowledge of and love for Grateful Dead as its curators. Happily, the answer is yes. Despite its length and the number of contributors, it is richly enjoyable and remarkably coherent \u2013 the latter perhaps due in part to the National\u2019s role as a kind of house band for the project. Indeed, the album even might be more suited to neophytes than Deadheads \u2013 a route into a complex, multifaceted and, to the outsider, faintly forbidding world of music; a long trip, not quite as strange as some might have hoped, but one worth taking.",
