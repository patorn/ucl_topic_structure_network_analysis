Department for Education figures show 18% of lessons were taught by teachers without a relevant post-A-level qualification for English baccalaureate subjects in 2014. Things are unlikely to have improved since. The support provided to these non-expert teachers varies widely, according to interviews given to Education Guardian. How many parents know this is going on? \u201cIn some places parents will be very aware,\u201d says Malcolm Trobe, of the Association of School and College Leaders. It\u2019s never an ideal situation for headteachers but there may not be a choice. \u201cSchools will endeavour to have a subject specialist. But if you can\u2019t recruit, particularly in a core subject, you\u2019re going to have to ask someone to teach outside of their discipline.\u201d  Former drama teacher, London Taught music to year 7 students I laughed at them when they asked me. I\u00a0said: you\u2019ve got to be crazy, I can\u2019t even play an instrument. I have absolutely no musical capacity. They said they\u2019d give me lesson plans, but that didn\u2019t help, because [in lessons] I was setting students off in groups to play instruments and I couldn\u2019t help them in any way. It soon became clear to the kids that I didn\u2019t know what the hell I was doing. I\u00a0was angry for them.   Related: Teacher recruitment \u2018a mess\u2019 as every school slugs it out for itself    When students give performances at the end [of a lesson] you\u2019re meant to give feedback. They\u2019d perform \u2013 and I\u2019m comparing it to the last concert I went to. I\u2019m expecting Pavarotti and they\u2019re beating tambourines. What kind of feedback can I give? \u201cYes it sounds lovely\u201d? My main approach was to get the classroom set up in a way that I could work on discipline and control. I\u2019d make sure that I had the desks in groupings that would work best, because there were quite a few discipline problems, of\u00a0course. There were grade 8 pianists in the class, so if there was a demonstration to do I\u2019d perhaps ask one of them. Though they soon got pissed off \u2013 they didn\u2019t want to be seen as teacher\u2019s pet. For some students, if you have a whole year of that subject with someone who doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing that could ruin the subject for life. That was one of the reasons I left the teaching profession. Richard White, biology specialist, West Midlands  Teaches sciences and has taught key stage 3 geography and drama I spend about 90% of my time outside my specialism. I studied the other sciences at A-level so it wasn\u2019t too bad when I started. The first six months of physics was a struggle because I was teaching myself a week before, and reading through the bits I didn\u2019t understand. The flipside is that it has helped me to understand where the kids fall down and where they get confused. Drama was more unnerving. I never did drama at school myself. I\u2019d never even been in a school play. But there are loads of good schemes of work online and I did actually enjoy it. It has also benefited my teaching [in science]; I do a lot of role play in lessons now. It\u2019s also nice to see the students in a different setting \u2013 you get kids who hate science but are amazing at drama and vice versa. It gives them a confidence boost and it boosted my faith in them, to see what they can do.

Photograph: Vic Goddard    Music teacher, London Teaching French to year 7 students I really enjoy it, partly because I see the students more often than I would as a music teacher. It\u2019s been a lot more work, though, because of the planning, but my head of department has been phenomenal in supporting me. Because\u00a0I\u2019m not a French specialist, you want to go into class knowing every eventuality \u2013 what possible questions could they ask? I wasn\u2019t too worried because it was only year 7 and I have an A-level in French. I\u2019m probably not teaching at the same level as a French specialist \u2013 they can go off script \u2013 but I am an experienced teacher so I don\u2019t have any classroom management problems. And there are maybe things that I can bring to the lesson that others haven\u2019t, not because I\u2019m a non-specialist but because it\u2019s me, I\u2019m a good teacher. Art and design teacher, Nottinghamshire  Also teaches textiles and food technology, including GCSE classes The first thing that went through my head was dread and panic. I thought, OK, I can do this, but how am I going to find time? I worried most about the technical stuff, especially in electronics and workshop-based subjects because there are health and safety issues there. We do things like soldering circuit boards together, using vacuum forming machines, bandsaws, pillar drills \u2013 there\u2019s all this technical equipment. The specialist teacher would show me first and then I would show the students. The amount of time I had practising varied: sometimes it was an hour, sometimes at lunchtime or after school. Lots of times I felt a bit out of my depth, though there\u2019s always a technician as back up. The workload is massive, it\u2019s huge. With food tech, the only experience I have is the part-time jobs I\u2019ve had at university. Aside from a\u00a0health and safety course, I haven\u2019t had any support for GCSE \u2013 I was just given a textbook.

I\u00a0have a young child, so I can\u2019t take huge portfolios home to mark. We\u2019re here from 8am to 5pm so I\u2019ll do marking at school but then when I\u2019m at home, after I\u2019ve taken my daughter to bed I\u2019ll open my laptop and do a couple of hours of\u00a0planning. Science teacher, London  Has taught maths My subject knowledge for maths is really good \u2013 I\u2019ve done maths to A-level. But it was knowing how to teach it, how to help people who are struggling, that I found hard; that\u2019s something I\u2019d had no training in. Because I\u2019m a science teacher I\u2019m used to there being some physical, practical thing in most of my lessons, and I didn\u2019t have the expertise to deliver maths in that way. So when a child struggled, I was a bit like: well I\u00a0know how to do it, and I\u2019ve shown you how to do it and I really don\u2019t know other ways of doing it. I couldn\u2019t go to the department meetings [which clashed], so I didn\u2019t get to find out what was going on. There were pages in books\u00a0about multiplication and division, then [the other maths teachers] said \u2013 oh no that was for calculator practice. I didn\u2019t know. Kristy Turner, chemistry specialist, Manchester Has previously taught science, maths, geography and French  State school teachers I know are teaching 23 lessons out of 25 possible periods a week \u2013 so they have two lessons in which to do all their marking, all their planning. Nobody would doubt it would have to spill over into your free time. The time they\u2019ve actually got to develop subject knowledge is limited to ending up a page ahead of everybody in the textbook. I\u2019d still got my A-level notes from school, that helped me more than anything else really. At the time I felt fine but looking back I do feel I did some of those children a disservice because I know I\u2019m a much better chemistry teacher than I am of anything else. The\u00a0hardest thing was not knowing the subject well enough to differentiate to the level the pupils need. Sam Hesling, PE specialist, Hertfordshire Teaches history to year 8 students In the back of my mind I did wonder: how happy would students and parents be if they had a PE teacher teaching their son or daughter history? My main concern was that I only had a GCSE in history to my name and that was over 10 years ago. But I was given a lot of support: a huge bank of shared resources from previous years, an email group between history teachers, extra textbooks were ordered so that I could take one home to plan, assessment guidance and effective marking shortcuts were handed out termly. My head of department has been very supportive, always checking how things are going and on hand to either cover or step in if behaviour was an issue. I do think there is an element of expertise needed to sufficiently teach GCSE, but at key stage 3 a good teacher should be able to teach and plan lessons outside of their area.",
