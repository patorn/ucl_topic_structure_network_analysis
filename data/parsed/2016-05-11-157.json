  "body": "If there is one thing we know about words you shouldn\u2019t say, it\u2019s that those words end up becoming very alluring. The Sellout is a fast-paced, verbose book, but one particular word crops up again and again. Paul Beatty\u2019s version is the slave master spelling of nigger, not the 90s hip-hop \u201cnigga\u201d. Although the \u201cer\u201d is a\u00a0harsh and oppressive end to a harsh and oppressive word, his repetitive use comes off with a friendly familiarity. It\u2019s far from menacing or mocking. You\u00a0might even close the book feeling desensitised to one of the most contentious words in the English language. Maybe that\u2019s the point of this whirlwind of a satire. Everything about The Sellout\u2019s plot is contradictory. The devices are real enough to be believable, yet surreal enough to raise your eyebrows. Our protagonist is never fully\u00a0named, but we are told that his surname is Me. This is convenient, because the novel is written entirely in\u00a0the first person. Me is a black man who owns a farm in a poor black urban\u00a0neighbourhood. Farmland in the middle of a poor city is an odd setting, but it\u2019s real enough: you\u2019ll find Richland Farms in the heart of rap-famous Compton, Los Angeles. Me surfs for fun, and smokes weed in the supreme court, where he ends up facing retribution for breaking some of the country\u2019s most hallowed laws about race. The plot is set in motion when Dickens, the city Me lives in, is surreptitiously wiped off the map, triggering an identity crisis in its residents. It just sort of disappears, and nobody is told why. Dickens\u2019s slow merge with its surrounding cities hits local celebrity Hominy Jenkins particularly hard. A\u00a0lovable, downtrodden Uncle Tom character, Hominy yearns for his halcyon days as the black butt of a thousand racist jokes in the 1950s kids\u2019 TV show The Little Rascals. With Dickens gone, Hominy is nobody. Rascals fans can no longer seek him out for autographs. Devastated, he swears that he will be Me\u2019s slave until Dickens is back on the map. Me thinks that the way to reinstate Dickens is to segregate the city\u2019s schools. So, a slave-owning black man working hard to bring back racial segregation. Eyebrows raised yet? If Dickens, subsumed into its wider surroundings, represents blackness, then our protagonists\u2019 unrelenting quest to re-establish its existence is about setting some clear boundaries. Following the recent public outing of Rachel Dolezal as a white American woman masquerading as black, there are understandable anxieties about blackness and authenticity. Thanks to artists such as Beyonc\u00e9 and Kendrick Lamar, the African American experience has gone viral. With this level of global success, it\u2019s no wonder everyone wants a slice. Of course, the downside of this widely celebrated pop culture moment is feeling the exclusivity of blackness slipping away. \u201cThe black experience used to come with lots of bullshit,\u201d our protagonist muses, \u201cbut at least there was some fucking privacy.\u201d Beatty (pictured) throws in dozens of jokes: every stereotype, rivalry and anxiety about race in the US is laid bare. No one is above criticism. The comforting social blanket of whiteness is satirised mercilessly. Black intellectuals on the left and right are exposed as fakes grasping for social power. But there is a problem when in-jokes become jokes for everyone, which left me not knowing what to make of the book. Twenty years ago, Chris Rock\u2019s \u201cblack people versus niggers\u201d standup comedy routine was aimed squarely at the respectable black middle classes. Yet you couldn\u2019t help but think that there were some racist people watching, too, chuckling along at what they felt were the failures of black people as a whole. With Beatty\u2019s satire punching not just up, but all over the place, I\u2019m not sure who the book is for. Perhaps I am too jaded, or too used to conversations about race, but I didn\u2019t laugh out loud while reading The Sellout, as so many reviewers claim to have done. It did, however, tease out a\u00a0fair few wry smiles. In his quest to reinstate his city, the protagonist joins a dating service for cities looking for their perfect partner, and settles on twinning Dickens with the lost city of White Male Privilege, \u201ca controversial municipality whose very existence is often denied by many (mostly privileged white males)\u201d. If The Sellout does anything, it successfully points not only to the problem, but all the complexities and nuances of the problem, proving that it\u2019s not as simple as (I hate myself for this) black and white. This book doesn\u2019t shy away from anything. \u2022 To order The Sellout for \u00a310.39 (RRP \u00a312.99) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.
