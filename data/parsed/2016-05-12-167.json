  "body": "George Clooney has said that Donald Trump will not win the US presidential election as the American public will not be ruled by fear. \u201cThere\u2019s not going to be a President Donald Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cFear is not going to drive our country. We\u2019re not afraid of Muslims or immigrants or women. We\u2019re not going to be afraid of anything.\u201d   Related: Money Monster review - George Clooney goes Leslie Nielsen in popcorn hostage thriller    Clooney was speaking at the Cannes film festival press conference for Money Monster, a thriller directed by Jodie Foster that also features Julia Roberts and Skins star Jack O\u2019Connell. The film tells the story of a blowhard financial pundit Lee Gates (Clooney), who, along with his director (Roberts) is held hostage live on air by a man (O\u2019Connell) who risked his life savings on one of Gates\u2019s tips. Clooney also used the press conference to attack cable news networks for allowing their output to slide further into infotainment, a move that he says helped Trump become a viable candidate for the presidency.            \u201cThere\u2019s a great disaster in the way we inform ourselves now,\u201d Clooney said. \u201cTrump is actually a result in many ways of many of the news programmes that didn\u2019t follow up and ask tough questions. Their ratings go up because they can just show an empty podium [and a caption] saying \u2018Donald Trump is about to speak\u2019.\u201d Clooney, asked about his own film about TV news, Good Night, and Good Luck (which told the story of Edward R Murrow\u2019s analytical takedown of McCarthyism), said that the problem in the television industry was that broadcasters had lost sight of the idea that news was never designed to be immensely profitable, but that it was designed to inform.   Related: George Clooney interview: \u2018Donald Trump is a xenophobic fascist\u2019    \u201cMoney Monster talks about the evolution of what has become the cross between news and entertainment. It\u2019s become a big problem,\u201d said Clooney. \u201cNews stopped being a loss leader \u2013 you were never going to make money on news, you were actually going to just inform people. There was other programming that would make money.\u201d Foster was last at the festival five years ago with The Beaver, a romantic drama starring Mel Gibson as a man who has a breakdown, but learns to express his feelings with the help of a beaver hand puppet. She first came to Cannes at the age of 12 to promote Martin Scorsese\u2019s Taxi Driver, which would go on to win the Palme d\u2019Or. She likened directing to good parenting, saying it was her job to give her stars both structure and the freedom to experiment.

They don\u2019t know what the next step is.\u201d \u201cI think men are often confused by women who don\u2019t follow traditional rules in conflict. But guess what: all they need to do is have more experiences with them.\u201d     Julia Roberts and George Clooney at the Money Monster press conference. Photograph: Ian Gavan/Getty Images    Foster also said she didn\u2019t believe that the spate of recent studies showing women make up a significantly smaller proportion of off- and on-screen talent was because of a conscious effort by men to keep women out. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big plot of men putting women down in the film business,\u201d she said. \u201cThe film industry is pretty progressive. They\u2019re just stuck with the same traditional models and they\u2019re trying to figure out how to get around that. But [men in the industry] haven\u2019t had enough experiences with women to do that.\u201d Roberts, making her first visit to Cannes, was asked if she too would like to direct one day. She said lacked the \u201cintelligence and patience\u201d for the job. In a response to a question about the heightened security at the festival in response to an increased likelihood of a terrorist attack, she said she felt \u201cabsolutely safe\u201d. Finally, a journalist from Iran asked Jodie Foster if she had cast Roberts and Clooney for a specific quality they bring to their roles. \u201cWhen I look at Mr Clooney, for example, I see a future president of the United States,\u201d said the journalist. \u201cThat means a lot from a guy from Iran,\u201d joked Clooney.",
