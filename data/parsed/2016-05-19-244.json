  "body": "\u201cWhen we started the process, everyone thought \u2018resilience\u2019 was just about climate adaptation and fighting flooding,\u201d says Jonas Kroustrup, chief resilience officer (CRO) for Vejle, a city of just over 100,000 people in southern Denmark. \u201cBut when we started to unfold the topic and ask people what it meant to them, it came to the point where social resilience became the main heart of the strategy.\u201d Earlier this year, Vejle launched Europe\u2019s first urban resilience strategy, which will see more than 100 city-wide initiatives \u2013 from cycle highways to flood-adapted neighbourhoods \u2013 rolled out over the next four years, in order to develop the city\u2019s adaptability to future challenges. Resilient Vejle is one of 11 strategies announced so far as part of the Rockefeller Foundation\u2019s global initiative 100 Resilient Cities (100RC), with Rotterdam the latest to be launched today. Cities as far afield and as varied as Rio de Janeiro, Byblos, San Francisco and New York have produced detailed strategies; each offers a bespoke blueprint for how the city will better prepare for, and bounce back from, all manner of pressures and shocks \u2013 not just climate change and natural disasters, but rampant urbanisation, economic downturns, social unrest, changing technologies and more.  Vejle fits the profile of a resilient city rather well. Located at the mouth of a fjord and the meeting point of two rivers, the city \u2013 whose name means \u201cford\u201d \u2013 has always had a close relationship with water, beginning life as a fishing village before growing into an important port city for Denmark\u2019s industrial trade.    Co-creation requires an openness to recognise that we don\u2019t have all the answers and solutions  Ulla Varneskov     But today, the water that brought Vejle such prosperity is its biggest threat: sea-levels are expected to rise by 25cm in the fjord by 2050, and it is at serious risk of flooding due to its low-level topography. During the industrial revolution, Vejle was known as \u201cthe Manchester of Denmark\u201d for its thriving manufacturing industry, but in recent years, the city has suffered as a result of the financial crisis, and new technology creating a turbulent job market. Furthermore, Kroustrup explains, an ageing population and limited higher education options make it difficult for the city to retain young minds.  Vejle\u2019s response to this challenge is fascinating in the context of the refugee crisis \u2013 a politically sensitive issue in Denmark as elsewhere in Europe. According to Kroustrup, the city is looking at immigration from a new perspective as a \u201cstep-up for the city to become a globalised society\u201d, having been voted the best municipality for refugee integration in Denmark in 2012.

Underlying all aspects of its resilience strategy is the mantra of \u201cco-creation\u201d, a bottom-up meets top-down approach that calls for collaboration between citizens and the municipality. \u201cCo-creation requires an openness to recognise that we don\u2019t have all the answers and solutions,\u201d says Ulla Varneskov, coordinator for integration and social resilience in Vejle. \u201cCollaboration is a prerequisite for a better future for all \u2026 that requires a pinch of risk-taking to put one\u2019s own resources and provisions into play.\u201d To make sure drawing up the strategy was not simply a \u201cdesktop process\u201d, an architecture school from the neighbouring city of Aarhus ran workshops where residents were invited to shape and build 3D models of Vejle, adding in their priorities and concerns for the city. Open meetings were held and existing citizen networks engaged to ensure a collaborative relationship between citizens, the municipality and other stakeholders (which will continue to come into play as Vejle rolls out the resilient actions). \u201cBy involving broad input from the beginning, on the one hand we reduced the obvious pitfalls [of miscommunication],\u201d Varneskov says. \u201cBut on the other, this required an almost inhuman overview of a very complicated process to ensure that all voices are heard in a way that ensured a coherent strategy.\u201d Vejle has identified three neighbourhoods that will be used as \u201claboratories\u201d for experimenting with different resilience projects, from physical infrastructure, to community cohesion initiatives. A waterfront neighbourhood will become a test-bed for storm management and flood adaptation, of which a large portion will be integrated into everyday public spaces to enhance liveability \u2013 a technique already underway in cities including Copenhagen \u2013 while another area with a large amount of social housing will become a laboratory for bottom-up community initiatives. Looking further into the future, an 80-hectare brownfield site on the outskirts of Vejle will be developed into a new residential area by 2050, by integrating and scaling up successful solutions from elsewhere in the city. Vejle may be tiny in comparison to a city such as New York, but its pledge to build urban resilience hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed across the Atlantic. According to Daniel Zarrilli, Kroustrup\u2019s counterpart CRO: \u201cVejle may be a smaller city than New York, but it\u2019s demonstrating creativity in tackling it biggest challenges. By studying practices from around the globe, we can be sure that even our own OneNYC strategy continues to evolve as we prepare our growing city to be even more equitable, more sustainable and more resilient.\u201d     New York\u2019s resilience strategy includes how to repair the extensive damage from Hurricane Sandy.

The city\u2019s $19.5bn (\u00a313.5bn) climate resilience strategy outlines more than 250 actions from elevating electrical infrastructure, to constructing flood walls and repairing the damage caused by Hurricane Sandy in 2012.    Vejle has taken a critical step by making resilience central to their city\u2019s overall strategy  Daniel Zarrilli     The city of New Orleans is also looking at how to bounce back from the impact of storm-related damage in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Its strategy \u2013 which recently received a best practice award by the American Planning Association \u2013 adopts a technical approach to resilience, with actions including an urban water plan, redesigning the transport system and leveraging critical resources for coastal projects. Kroustrup and others involved in Vejle\u2019s resilience efforts recently returned from an ideas sharing event with other CROs in New York and New Orleans \u2013 the first two cities to deliver their strategies last year. \u201cAll cities have something to learn from each other,\u201d he agrees. \u201cResilience isn\u2019t a state you\u2019re in, it\u2019s something you do and it\u2019s reflected in the way you\u2019re organised.\u201d The visit to the US was a chance for cities in the 100RC network to exchange ideas around building resilience. A similar visit took place to Rotterdam earlier this year \u2013 flood-adapted solutions from this sea-level city have inspired actions of other members of the network, and collaborative relationships are being formed.   Related: Expect the unexpected: how to measure and improve a city's resilience    But as each new strategy is made public, it also becomes clear that each city\u2019s approach must be unique to its circumstances. In contrast, perhaps, to the traditions of the Danish welfare society \u201cwhere the citizen is a consumer of services\u201d, Vejle hopes to learn from its citizens by supporting existing initiatives and enabling people to take ownership of services to create self-sustaining communities. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to see social resilience,\u201d Kroustrup says. \u201cIt\u2019s embedded in culture, communities and relationships. Our challenge is to inscribe this into infrastructure to make this city more liveable.\u201d But as is the case with all of the plans drawn up under the 100RC guidelines, they must be backed up with effective implementation. \u201cVejle has taken a critical step by making resilience central to their city\u2019s overall strategy,\u201d says NYC\u2019s Zarrilli. \u201cNow the hard work begins of partnering to deliver on their ambitious vision.\u201d Guardian Cities is a member of the Habitat III Journalism Project; read more about the project here.
