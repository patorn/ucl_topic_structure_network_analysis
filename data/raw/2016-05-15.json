      "body": "<p>Rickie Fowler\u2019s surge towards the 2015 Players Championship title offered a scintillating storyline which will prove a regular source of reference. That this year\u2019s version was dull in comparison owed everything to the skill and mental fortitude of one man.</p> <p>Jason Day\u2019s triumph, his third of 2016, was never in doubt on this Florida afternoon. Maybe it was sealed from the moment the Australian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/12/jason-day-sawgrass-players-championship-lowry-rose-spieth-willett\" title=\"\">signed for an opening round of 63</a>. He joins his compatriots Steve Elkington, Greg Norman and Adam Scott in claiming the PGA Tour\u2019s marquee competition. For Day, who won by four shots, the plaudits keep on rolling in.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/15/russell-knox-made-light-nine-shots-17th-hole-players-championship-sawgrass\">Russell Knox makes light of his nine shots on the 17th at Players Championship</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cJason\u2019s run is Tiger-esque,\u201d said Scott. \u201cI try to imagine how good Tiger felt just playing, five years into his pro career having won 50 events. Imagine how you\u2019d feel confidence-wise. Jason must be kind of feeling something like that at the moment and that\u2019s an incredibly nice way to walk out on the golf course.</p> <p>\u201cYou can see it with Jason. I played with him one day this week in practice, you can see there\u2019s that calmness inside him, calm confidence, the way he\u2019s walking around. He\u2019s got that kind of unbeatable look about him.\u201d</p> <p>Yes, the Sunday atmosphere at Sawgrass was noticeably tame but that is to the credit of Day. He did not want to be embroiled in any kind of battle and duly was not.</p> <p>Day\u2019s grip on his world No1 ranking is now vice-like. That scenario appeared inconceivable even towards the end of last season when Jordan Spieth was laughing in the face of convention. Spieth, Rory McIlroy and the rest are now in frantic pursuit of Day, who has a remarkable record of seven wins from 17 starts since late July. Three of those successes \u2013 the US PGA Championship, WGC Match Play and now the Players \u2013 have arrived in illustrious events.</p> <p>Day began Sunday with a four-shot lead. That halved, but very briefly, as the 28-year-old reached the turn in 38. He required a 12ft putt for bogey after regressing into the realms of a 12-handicapper when chipping around the green at the 9th. Day gathered his thoughts before making birdie at the 10th and collected further shots at the 12th and 16th to shoot 71 and win at 15 under.</p> <p>Kevin Chappell closed with a 69 for solo second, earning him spots in both the US Open and Open Championship. Justin Thomas, Matt Kuchar, Colt Knost and Ken Duke \u2013 the world No495 \u2013 shared third. Without being overly disrespectful, the calibre of player closest to Day during round four made matters even easier for him.</p> <p>McIlroy\u2019s Sunday hope was always a vain one. The four-times major champion played the front nine in 34 but stumbled on the turn for home, ending with a 70 for a seven-under-par aggregate and share of 12th. McIlroy was mid-air by the time Day collected the trophy; his charity foundation hosts the Irish Open at the K Club this week.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s good stuff in there and there\u2019s too many wasted shots,\u201d said McIlroy, offering what has been a recurring sentiment. \u201cSo that\u2019s what I need to try and cut out going forward.</p> <p>\u201c I feel like I\u2019m playing good enough golf with the way I\u2019m hitting the shots to win tournaments and I haven\u2019t won a tournament this year. The last golf tournament I won was in Dubai in November, so it feels like a long time ago now.</p> <p>\u201cI need to stay patient because if I keep pushing and keep looking for the win, that\u2019s when these sloppy mistakes start to creep in. I just need to go out there and play my game and trust that I\u2019m playing well enough for the chips to fall my way sooner rather than later.\u201d</p> <p>Fowler, despite missing the cut, was on hand to congratulate Day behind the 18th green. This is not yet Day\u2019s era but unquestionably it is his time.</p>",

The figures do not include inner-London homes.</p> <p>The website said strong demand from investors keen to buy before the introduction of the surcharge on second homes had caused a \u201cproperty drought\u201d at the lower end of the market, putting upwards pressure on prices for those homes that were being made available.</p> <p>However, Rightmove\u2019s director, Miles Shipside, said: \u201cIt remains to be seen if these prices can be achieved and there may be some over pricing in the market. It is also a reflection of better quality property coming to market in this sector which is now targeting owner-occupiers rather than landlords.\u201d</p> <p>In Llandudno, north Wales, prices were down by 7.5% year-on-year and in Darlington, north-east England, they dropped by 3%.<br /></p> <p>Across all property types, Rightmove said average asking prices had increased by 0.4% over the month to an average of \u00a3308,151. Prices were down on the previous month in London, the north-west and the north-east, but in all other regions sellers appeared more confident than in April.</p> <p>The stamp duty increase came into effect on 1 April after being unveiled in November\u2019s autumn statement. Second homes now attract a three percentage point surcharge, adding \u00a36,000 to the upfront cost of a \u00a3200,000 property.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/apr/21/rush-to-beat-stamp-duty-changes-causes-surge-in-housing-market-activity\">Figures from HM Revenue and Customs showed a spike in purchases before the change</a>, with 161,990 sales of \u00a340,000 or more registered during March. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/11/average-london-home-doubles-price-house-property\">Average price of London home almost doubles to \u00a3600,625 since 2009</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There are signs that landlords are still willing to buy, but are focusing their attention on the cheaper end of the market. Paul Milson at estate agents Leaders in Epsom, Surrey, said: \u201cDespite the increase in stamp duty, investors are still keen to purchase one-bedroom flats because they make good long-term investments due to their higher yields, potential for capital gains and consistently high demand from tenants. </p> <p>\u201cHowever, supply of two-bedroom flats is currently good across the board and prices for these appear to have peaked.\u201d</p> <p>Research by estate agents Countrywide showed the average price paid by investors fell by 8.3% in April, from \u00a3194,000 to \u00a3178,000. Stamp duty on the cheaper property would now be \u00a36,400 - \u00a3800 lower than on March\u2019s average price. </p> <p>Countrywide said investors in London paid an average of \u00a3365,000 in April v \u00a3436,000 in March, attracting a stamp duty bill of \u00a319,200 rather than \u00a324,880. </p> <p>Johnny Morris, its research director, said: \u201cRather than being dissuaded by the new 3% charge it seems that landlords are already adjusting their behaviour. In response to the extra purchasing costs many are choosing to buy cheaper homes that offer a higher yield and of course a lower stamp duty bill.\u201d</p> <p>He said there were early signs that first-time buyer numbers were increasing, but added: \u201cIt\u2019s too early to tell whether this is simply the after effects of the stamp duty rush or the start of a longer term trend.\u201d </p>",

      "body": "<p>The Church of England has said it fears a looming global economic slowdown with governments relatively powerless to shore up growth, as it revealed a decision to offload a portion of its substantial stock market holdings.</p> <p>The church commissioners, who manage the C of E\u2019s \u00a37bn investment fund, said they enjoyed market-beating returns of 8.2% last year but warned they would struggle to keep up that pace in future. Over the past 30 years the fund\u2019s average annual return has been 9.7%. </p> <p>The first church estates commissioner, Sir Andreas Whittam Smith, said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/24/why-is-global-economy-suffering-turbulence\">jittery global markets</a> had prompted a decision in March to sell about \u00a3250m of the church\u2019s global share portfolio. That amounts to about 6% of its \u00a34bn equities holdings.</p> <p>Writing in the church commissioners\u2019 annual report, Whittam Smith highlighted the past 30 years\u2019 performance but added: \u201cUnfortunately, it may be harder in the future to achieve such a satisfactory performance. My message to the wider church is: don\u2019t count on it.</p> <p>\u201cThe nervousness of investors is explained by the feeling that governments have lost the power to reverse any slowdown in economic activity. In earlier times they would reduce interest rates, but now that rates hover around zero, that remedy is unavailable. And it\u2019s hard to believe that negative interest rates can provide the necessary boost, or that governments would let the supply of money expand.</p> <p>\u201cIn other words, the risk is that economic activity slows down across the world and remains stuck at a low level,\u201d concluded Whittam Smith, the founding editor of the Independent newspaper.<br /></p> <p>The annual report noted that last year\u2019s returns on the investment fund, which helps pay for the church\u2019s work by topping up donations from churchgoers, meant it had outperformed the London stock market, which \u201ceked out a 1% rise in 2015\u201d.</p> <p>The C of E also has many non-stock market holdings, including land, forests and property. During turmoil on global markets the commissioners had increased their investment in areas \u201cthat are not subject to every twist and turn in stock market prices\u201d, Whittam Smith said. \u201cThis is why we increased our commitments with private equity managers during the year.\u201d</p> <p>The commissioners\u2019 private equity managers returned 20.2% during 2015 and the value of the church\u2019s \u00a32bn property portfolio was up by more than 14%. The commissioners continued to invest in forestry with two new holdings in Australia, bringing the total to nearly 120,000 acres, they said. The timberland and forestry portfolio delivered a return of 13% last year.</p> <p>The C of E has come under pressure in the past to offload particular investments to reflect its values, notably a commitment to tackling climate change. Last year, the church commissioners adopted a new climate change policy and took the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/apr/30/church-of-england-ends-investments-in-heavily-polluting-fossil-fuels\">decision to divest from tar sands oil and thermal coal</a> \u2013 the first time they had ever imposed investment restrictions on environmental grounds.</p>",

This would assert the supremacy of the UK courts as David Cameron seeks to unite the Conservative party despite its divisions on Europe.<br /></li> <li>Prison reform, setting out a legal framework for stronger governors and a degree of autonomy over budgets, plus powers for \u201creform prisons\u201d to take over nearby failing jails on the same model as school academy chains.</li> <li><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/02/driverless-cars-future-motorised-middle-ages\">Driverless cars</a>, including allowing them to be insured under ordinary policies as part of a transport bill that will also include sections on space travel and drones.</li> <li>Changes to the powers of the House of Lords, as recommended by the Strathclyde review, to stop peers being able to block statutory instruments, although Baroness D\u2019Souza, the Lords\u2019 Speaker, has already warned against the likely consequences.</li> </ul> <p>The programme is likely to be a packed one, as Cameron seeks to prove that the government is still active, despite the EU referendum and a divided Conservative party with a small majority.</p> <p>However, the <a href=\"http://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/\">Institute for Government</a> (IfG) thinktank warned on Monday that the government is already under intense pressure to deliver existing commitments, such as the seven-day NHS and balancing the books, with only a tiny majority to help it pass laws in the Commons.</p> <p>Over the past year, the government has backed down on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/09/nicky-morgan-chaotic-mess-academies-u-turn\">academies</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/25/george-osborne-u-turn-scrap-tax-credit-cuts-autumn-statement\">tax credits</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/04/david-cameron-concessions-syrian-child-refugees\">taking in child refugees</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/09/cameron-defeated-in-commons-over-plans-to-relax-sunday-trading-laws\">Sunday trading</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/19/government-scraps-proposed-changes-trade-union-funding\">trade union reforms</a> and aspects of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/05/pay-to-stay-tory-climbdown\">housing bill</a>.</p> <p>In a new report, the institute suggested the government needs to tread carefully to avoid more U-turns, pointing out Cameron has suffered three defeats in the Commons and more than 50 in the Lords over the past 12 months.</p> <p>Daniel Thornton, a director of the IfG, said: \u201cTo be effective, the government must recognise the enormous challenges it now faces. It is making big spending cuts and attempting far-reaching public service reforms, and the strain is showing. </p> <p>\u201cAs a result of divisions over Europe, its small majority has become no majority at all. It must consult and build alliances before rushing ahead with more ambitious reforms in the Queen\u2019s Speech.\u201d</p> <p>The warning was echoed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/andrewlansley\">Andrew Lansley</a>, the Conservative peer and former leader of the Commons, who said it had been disappointing to see bills being \u201csavaged\u201d in the House of Lords because there was not enough detail in them.</p> <p>He told the BBC\u2019s World at One: \u201cWhat you really want is some of these big issues to be set out in draft bills and be thoroughly worked out.\u201d</p> <p>Lansley said there has \u201cbeen a lot of shifting about\u201d but he said the academies plan was an exception because the government published proposals and refined them before trying to get them passed in legislation. </p> <p>He warned that there could be \u201cvery large uncertainty\u201d about implementing new laws if the UK votes to leave the EU.</p> <p>\u201cIf there were to be a Brexit vote \u2026 in the latter part of this parliament we would be completely absorbed with managing the consequences of that, which would be monstrous to think about,\u201d Lansley said. </p> <p>\u201cIt would really get in the way of almost anything else in parliament for a substantial period of time.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Workers are being warned to expect meagre wage rises until at least 2020, as weak productivity and new costs such as the national living wage curb employers\u2019 readiness to raise salaries.</p> <p>Even though employment is expected to rise, pay growth is forecast to be just 1.7% over the next year, as an ample supply of labour helps employers hold back on wage rises in a \u201cjobs-rich, pay-poor\u201d economy, said the Chartered Institute for Personnel and Development (CIPD).</p> <p>The gloomy outlook for workers comes as business group the CBI has warned that the economy is losing steam, cutting its growth forecasts for this year and next, and retail industry figures have revealed continuing trouble on the high street.</p> <p>Numbers of shoppers visiting retail centres fell in April, in the latest evidence that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/10/uk-retailers-suffer-sharp-drop-sales-experience-economy\">cautious consumers are cutting back</a> or going online to hunt for better deals. Consumers have been the main drivers of the UK\u2019s economic recovery but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/29/uk-consumer-confidence-barometer-eu-referendum-gfk\">recent business surveys suggest confidence is flagging</a>, affected by a range of factors from economic uncertainty ahead of the EU referendum to a darker global outlook.</p> <p>Weak pay growth has also added to pressures on households and the CIPD, the trade group for the HR industry, warned that the pattern of low rises in pay is set to continue. It is calling for more practical government measures to help employers raise productivity, a measure of output per hour worked.</p> <p>\u201cFor now, there\u2019s no sign of the economy running out of jobs, or out of people to fill those jobs,\u201d said Mark Beatson, CIPD chief economist.</p> <p>\u201cHowever, the UK is now in its eighth year of productivity go-slow which continues to limit the scope for employers to pay more, and recruitment and retention problems have so far proved manageable without across-the-board pay rises.\u201d</p> <p>The group <a href=\"http://www.cipd.co.uk/research/labour-market-outlook.aspx\">surveyed more than 1,000 employers</a> and found the expected average pay rise over the next year, at 1.7%, was higher than the 1.2% in its previous survey three months ago. But it noted that was a relatively weak pace of growth and predicted various factors meant workers were unlikely to see much of a boost to the real, or post-inflation, value of their pay \u201cuntil at least the end of this decade\u201d.</p> <p>Pay growth was running at around 3%-5% in the year before the financial crisis took hold in 2008. It then petered out and workers saw their wages fall in real terms for several years. Real pay growth returned last year but some experts say it will never return to pre-crisis levels as immigration and increasing automation have sapped workers\u2019 bargaining power.</p> <p>Low inflation, expanding labour supply and a lack of productivity growth were working in combination to reduce the economic pressure for employers to pay their staff more, the CIPD said. At the same time, government-imposed increases in labour costs such as the apprenticeship levy, pension auto-enrolment and the new national living wage would reduce the scope for employers to raise pay.</p> <p>\u201cThe national living wage and roll-out of pension auto-enrolment were introduced to improve the living standards of low-paid employees, but this can only happen without significant job losses if the productivity of low-paid employees also increases,\u201d said Beatson.</p> <p>\u201cSimply making low-paid labour more expensive is not the answer and the government should not be surprised if some employers choose easier options, such as reducing hours, chipping away at other benefits or making a less generous pay award the next time pay is reviewed.\u201d</p> <p>The data on falling shopper numbers in April noted fragile consumer confidence but also longer-standing pressures on the bricks and mortar retail industry, which has suffered <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/bhs-heading-for-administration-as-rescue-deal-fails\">the high profile collapse of BHS</a> in recent weeks. </p> <p>Footfall fell 2.4% compared with a year ago when measured across high street stores, retail parks and shopping centres, according to research company Springboard and lobby group, the <a href=\"http://www.brc.org.uk/brc_home.asp\">British Retail Consortium</a> (BRC). That was only slightly shallower than the 2.7% drop in footfall in March.</p> <p>The biggest decline was seen at high street stores where footfall fell 4.7%. Shopping centre footfall was down 0.7% although at retail parks it rose 1.1%.</p> <p>\u201cThe rise in unemployment and economic uncertainty in this pre EU referendum period has undoubtedly adversely impacted consumer activity. We know that cuts in retail spending are the first line of defence against threats to household budgets when consumer confidence is knocked,\u201d said Diane Wehrle, Springboard\u2019s marketing and insights director.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2016-05-15T13:31:14/embed.html\" data-alt=\"CBI sees growth slowing\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2016-05-15T13:31:14/embed.html\">CBI sees growth slowing</a> </figure>  <p>The CBI also cited pre-referendum uncertainty as it cut its forecasts for UK economic growth to 2% this year and next, compared with 2.3% growth in 2015. In February, the CBI had pencilled in growth of 2.3% for 2016 and 2.1% for 2017. Much of the 2016 downgrade was blamed on a softer than expected start to the year. </p> <p>\u201cA dark cloud of uncertainty is looming over global growth, particularly around weakening emerging markets and the outcome of the EU referendum, which is chilling some firms\u2019 plans to invest,\u201d said CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn.</p> <p>\u201cAt present, the economic signals are mixed \u2013 we are in an unusually uncertain period.\u201d</p> <p>The CBI has come under criticism from campaigners for Britain to leave the EU, who have dismissed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/21/brexit-could-cost-100bn-and-nearly-1m-jobs-cbi-warns\">the business group\u2019s analysis of Brexit costs</a> as \u201cscare stories\u201d.</p>",

The club is facing a bill running into millions of pounds after calling off the match because a private security firm, staging a mock terror exercise at the stadium last Wednesday, hid the bomb then apparently forgot all about it.</p> <p>The revelation will come as an intense embarrassment after United ordered a full evacuation of the stadium and called in bomb-disposal experts when a member of staff found the device, taped to a gas pipe in one of the toilets, with a mobile phone attached and protruding wires and buttons.</p> <p>Greater Manchester Police described it as \u201cincredibly lifelike\u201d as they prepared to make a controlled explosion and sniffer dogs were brought in to check there were no more devices around the stadium.</p> <p>Yet the reasons became apparent seven hours after the drama began when the police revealed that further inquiries had shown it was a \u201ctraining device which had accidentally been left by a private company following a training exercise involving explosive search dogs\u201d.</p> <p>The Guardian is aware of one supporter who travelled from India for what was supposed to be his first match at Old Trafford. United\u2019s home games regularly attract fans from all over Europe and around 3,000 Bournemouth supporters had made a 500-mile trip for what was meant to be their first-ever league fixture at Old Trafford.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/old_trafford-zip/giv-12515UTFRkfvKmjPu/\" data-alt=\"Old Trafford\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/old_trafford-zip/giv-12515UTFRkfvKmjPu/\">Old Trafford</a> </figure>  <p>Ed Woodward, United\u2019s executive vice-chairman, has ordered the review into the precise chain of events that led to the first-ever cancellation of a match in English football because of a bomb scare and the priority will be to ascertain how the terror exercise did not end with the fake explosives being taken away.</p> <p>United\u2019s security chiefs will also face questions about the hoax bomb being unnoticed from Wednesday to Sunday and why it took so long for the truth to emerge once the alarm was raised.</p> <p>\u201cWe will investigate the incident to inform future actions and decisions,\u201d Woodward said. \u201cThe club takes security very seriously and staff are regularly trained with the police and emergency services to identify and deal with these incidents.\u201d</p> <p>The incident sparked an \u201cOperation Code Red\u201d evacuation as part of the increased security measures that have been in place since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/paris-attacks\" title=\"\">the Paris terrorist attacks</a> last November, when one of the bombers tried to get into France\u2019s game against Germany. Ander Herrera, the United midfielder, talked later about the \u201cnerves and tension\u201d as the two sets of players were kept in the dressing rooms and the club\u2019s former captain, Gary Neville, was among those expressing his horror about the possibility that an English football ground might have come under attack.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/15/premier-league-fans-verdict-2015-16-arsenal-manchester-united\">Premier League 2015-16 fans\u2019 verdicts part one: Arsenal to Manchester United</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was a galling day for United for many reasons. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/15/swansea-city-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Manchester City\u2019s 1-1 draw against Swansea City</a> ended any chance of Van Gaal\u2019s team qualifying for the Champions League and there is the added possibility that Bournemouth will seek compensation for their travel costs.</p> <p>Of greater concern to Van Gaal is that his team must now play a midweek fixture when they are preparing to meet Crystal Palace at Wembley on Saturday.</p> <p>The manager will inevitably be tempted to rest players with the final in mind but that is still far from ideal when United need a draw to climb above Southampton into fifth place and guarantee direct entry to the Europa League group stages.</p> <p>Blackpool\u2019s game against Huddersfield was declared a 0-0 draw after a pitch invasion caused its abandonment on the final day of the 2014-15 season but in United\u2019s case the game has to be replayed because of the implications on the rest of the league, not least because every place in the top division is worth an extra \u00a31.2m in prize money.</p> <p>The same applies to Bournemouth, who are currently 16th but could climb above Palace and West Brom with a win .</p> <p>Bournemouth\u2019s fans could be heard chanting \u201cyou don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing\u201d because of the lack of information inside the stadium and, though United have been praised for the manner in which the evacuation took place, there was more embarrassment for the club that it was left to their opponents to announce, via Twitter, that the match had been called off. With various news outlets reporting the same, journalists asking the question of United were told \u201cwe don\u2019t know\u201d.</p> <p>Assistant Chief Constable John O\u2019Hare said: \u201cI am grateful to the Manchester United and Bournemouth supporters for their support and assistance. While this item did not turn out to be a viable explosive, on appearance this device was as real as could be and the decision to evacuate the stadium was the right thing to do, until we could be sure that people were not at risk.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>At the Nebraska Republican convention on Saturday, a resolution condemning \u201cdegrading remarks toward women, minorities and other people by Republican elected office holders or party officials, including candidates for president of the United States\u201d was quashed. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/06/fremont-nebraska-walmart-senator-ben-sasse-letter-reaction\">In Nebraska's key Walmart parking lot, voters dissatisfied with election choice</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The resolution, which fell in the name of party unity, had been intended as an implicit rebuke to Donald Trump, the party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee. The Republicans were meeting to design their state party platform ahead of the national convention in July, at which delegates will create the campaign platform with Trump.</p> <p>However, state school board member Pat McPherson, who has a history of controversy surrounding racial remarks and has faced <a href=\"http://www.wowt.com/news/headlines/213786.html\">allegations of inappropriate behavior</a> towards a woman, made the motion to put the resolution aside.</p> <p>Last year it was reported that repeated references to Barack Obama as \u201ca half-breed\u201d <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.omaha.com/news/nebraska/ricketts-condemns-articles-description-of-obama-as-half-breed-ed/article_bfe73023-0695-5bbc-8cd3-cc30fc2aaf01.html\">had appeared on McPherson\u2019s blog</a>. The Republican activist insisted that an anonymous contributor wrote the posts in question. He declined to identify that person.</p> <p>A majority of the state school board <a href=\"http://www.omaha.com/news/education/board-of-ed-member-pat-mcpherson-makes-it-clear-he/article_d3b07d92-ae27-11e4-acac-4f741b4ece2d.html\">called for McPherson to resign</a>, as did Republican Nebraska governor Pete Ricketts and both its Republican senators, Ben Sasse and Deb Fischer.</p> <p>It was not McPherson\u2019s first brush with scandal. In 2003, he was <a href=\"http://www.enterprisepub.com/news/red-robin-ruffled-feathers-deemed-a-political-ploy/article_efa4b2e6-55f2-52dd-9ab9-6e21ac0c9b69.html\">forced to step down</a> as a county election commissioner after being charged with third-degree sexual assault and disturbing the peace, over an incident at a Red Robin restaurant.</p> <p>McPherson was acquitted of the charges, which involved allegations that he groped a 17-year-old waitress. Another man, then vice-president of Omaha city council Chuck Sigerson, was charged with one count of disturbing the peace. That charge was dismissed.</p> <p>On Saturday, the Nebraska GOP passed overwhelmingly a resolution condemning any third-party bid in opposition to both Trump and Hillary Clinton. </p> <p>This was seen as a rebuke to Sasse, the state\u2019s junior senator, a vocal opponent of Trump who has pledged <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/06/fremont-nebraska-walmart-senator-ben-sasse-letter-reaction\">never to support the presumptive nominee</a>. </p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/10/nebraska-west-virginia-primaries-donald-trump\">the Nebraska primary this week</a>, held after Ted Cruz and John Kasich ended their campaigns, Trump <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/10/nebraska-west-virginia-primaries-donald-trump\">received 61.4% of the vote</a>.</p>",

      "body": "<p>One of Italy\u2019s most popular politicians, the comedian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/beppe-grillo\">Beppe Grillo</a>, took a swipe at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/sadiq-khan\">Sadiq Khan</a>, saying London\u2019s first Muslim mayor would \u201cblow himself up in front of Westminster\u201d.</p> <p>Racist and misogynist humour is not uncommon within extreme parties in Italian politics, but the remark by the head of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/five-star-movement\">Five Star Movement</a> (M5S), an anti-establishment party founded by Grillo in 2009, came as his own party\u2019s candidate, Virginia Raggi, is the leading contender to become the next mayor of Rome.</p> <p>Grillo was performing at a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/143184772739324\">show on Saturday night</a> in Padua when he went out of his way to praise the rise of the \u201cBangladeshi\u201d Khan \u2013 the Labour mayor\u2019s family were originally from Pakistan \u2013 and said it proved one must never stop dreaming. Then he added the sarcastic jibe: \u201cNow I want to see when he blows himself up in front of Westminster.\u201d</p> <p>The remark showed that Grillo has been unwilling to temper his off-colour jokes, even as he has sought to portray the MS5 as a serious alternative to Italy\u2019s traditional parties, especially the centre-left Democratic party (PD) led by the prime minister, Matteo Renzi.</p> <p>The joke was seized on by Grillo\u2019s political opponents, who said the remark was an attempt to distract the public from internal problems within the M5S, including a scandal involving the mayor of Parma, Federico Pizzarotti, a member of Grillo\u2019s party who is under investigation for abuse of office.</p> <p>Another M5S mayor, Filippo Nogarin of Livorno, also recently revealed he was under investigation for fraud. Both politicians denied any wrongdoing, but the news has nevertheless been an embarrassing setback for a party that prides itself on being anti-corruption.<br /></p> <p>Stefano Esposito, a PD senator, demanded to know what Raggi thought of the joke. On Twitter he wrote: \u201cWhat does Raggi think of the racist insult that her boss directed at the mayor of London? Pretends nothing is going on?\u201d</p> <p>If she were to be elected mayor of Rome, Raggi would be the first female mayor of the Eternal City and the most high-profile M5S candidate to hold office in Italy. Her election would be seen as a test of whether a party that emerged from Grillo\u2019s sardonic stand-up act in the 1980s and 1990s can move beyond Grillo the protest politician and actually govern.<br /></p> <p> The comment was denounced by the PD\u2019s candidate for mayor of Rome, Roberto Giachetti, who quoted the remark on Twitter and said: \u201cIt didn\u2019t make me laugh.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/bobogiac/status/731804818013102080\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"it\" dir=\"ltr\">Beppe Grillo: &quot;Voglio vedere quando il sindaco musulmano di Londra si far\u00e0 saltare in aria a Westminister&quot;.

The question is, who is going to bring an earthquake to Washington DC?\u201d</p> <p>Trump, Priebus added, \u201crepresents something much different from the analysis of traditional candidates. Donald Trump is going to have to answer the question, but we\u2019re in a year where nothing applies. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s down to the bigger question: Who is going to blow up the system? That\u2019s what this election is coming down to.\u201d </p> <p>Former House speaker Newt Gingrich, now a potential Trump running mate, also told Fox that whatever its reservations, the party should withhold judgment in part because the candidate\u2019s appeal exists outside traditional political constraints. </p> <p>\u201cDonald Trump makes no claims for his life before he ran for office,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cHe\u2019s been a very successful businessman, he\u2019s learned a great deal, and he would do more to change Washington than any other candidate. </p> <p>\u201cNow he defeated 16 other people for candidacy and won more votes than any other Republican candidate in history because voters decided he will change Washington.\u201d</p> <p>Trump\u2019s top adviser, Paul Manafort, did, however, seek to diffuse the latest Trump controversy: <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/donald-trump-alter-ego-barron/2016/05/12/02ac99ec-16fe-11e6-aa55-670cabef46e0_story.html\">the allegation that he posed as his own publicist</a>, \u201cJohn Miller\u201d, in a 1990 interview.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s down to the bigger question: Who is going to blow up the system? That\u2019s what this election is coming down to</p> <footer> <cite>Reince Priebus</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Trump has admitted under oath that he used the pseudonyms \u201cJohn Baron\u201d and \u201cJohn Miller\u201d at that time. The voice on the John Miller recording, released by the the Washington Post, does sound very much like Trump. </p> <p> \u201cI couldn\u2019t tell who it is,\u201d Manafort told CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cDonald Trump says it\u2019s not him; I believe it\u2019s not him.\u201d</p> <p>The allegation that Trump posed as his own publicist to promote himself has crystallised the apparent problem for the Republican party: whenever its leaders seek to contain one media drama over the presumptive nominee, another emerges. </p> <p>Echoing the Republican leadership, Manafort said simply that the issue of whether Miller was or was not Trump was \u201ctotally irrelevant\u201d.</p> <p>Manafort also said Trump had not refused to release his tax returns \u2013 most presidential nominees do so \u2013 although the candidate told ABC earlier this week that the returns were \u201cnone of your business\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cHe has said he will release his tax returns. He never has changed his position,\u201d Manafort said, blaming the delay on an IRS audit, though the IRS has said repeatedly there is no legal barrier for the release of returns during an audit. </p> <p>\u201cAs I understand it, the audit is going back for the last eight years,\u201d Manafort said. \u201cAnything going on beyond eight years is not going to be of interest to anyone beyond the media. This is an issue that the media is interested in; it\u2019s not an issue that middle America is interested in.\u201d</p> <p>Hillary Clinton, Trump\u2019s likely opponent in November, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/12/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-tax-return\">has released tax returns dating to 1977</a>.</p> <p>The decision by mainstream Republicans to tolerate Trump\u2019s excesses is a pragmatic one. Last week, after a closed-door meeting, House speaker Paul Ryan said he and Trump \u201cwere planting the seeds to get ourselves unified\u201d. Asked on Sunday how the meeting had gone, Manafort said the most senior elected Republican had not asked Trump to change. </p> <p>\u201cAnd there\u2019s no reason for him to change [after] beating 16 qualified candidates,\u201d he said.</p> <p>However, there are still murmurs of an effort to mount a third-party challenge. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/inside-the-gop-effort-to-draft-an-independent-candidate-to-derail-trump/2016/05/14/1b04682e-1877-11e6-924d-838753295f9a_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_thirdparty-1248pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory\">According to the Washington Post</a>, the plotters include 2012 candidate Mitt Romney and the conservative commentator William Kristol. Their efforts have been rebuffed, though, as party moderates conclude that going up against Trump would be certain to fail. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/14/donald-trump-republican-party-support\">How Donald Trump convinced the Republican party to revolve around him</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThis is a suicide mission,\u201d Priebus told CBS\u2019s Face the Nation. \u201cWhat people should do is take the Paul Ryan approach, which is to work with Donald Trump and find out whether or not there\u2019s common ground \u2026 as opposed to blowing everything up.\u201d</p> <p>That approach also comes with dangers: Clinton has the highest negative ratings of any presidential candidate in history <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/08/clinton-trump-election-electoral-map-red-blue-states\">except one: Donald Trump</a>. Get too close to Trump, or at least appear to tacitly endorse him, and those negatives could begin to rub off on candidates in tight congressional races. </p> <p>Republicans are betting that in crucial swing states, the polls will tighten, and even female voters currently seen as implacably opposed to Trump could yet come round. </p> <p>\u201cThis is one of these conventional wisdom facts that are not correct,\u201d Manafort told CNN, although he did concede that Trump struggled with women. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s an issue. It\u2019ll be dealt with,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re coming to a healing process. This is way early and still already we\u2019re seeing convergence on the party of the electorate on Donald Trump.\u201d</p>",

When the domestic highlight of women\u2019s football ventured to Old Trafford in 1989, the crowd failed to reach four figures. Only three years ago, when Arsenal defeated Bristol Academy, 4,988 turned up.</p> <p>The landscape has altered to a remarkable degree. Fara Williams, the gifted Arsenal and England midfielder, spoke beforehand of how she would play Wembley \u2013 the street game \u2013 when growing up but dreaming of playing at the ground itself seemed too far-fetched.</p> <p>Yet the most important thing, as Emma Hayes, the Chelsea manager, was at pains to point out in defeat, is that Arsenal are no longer in a position to dominate as before.</p> <p>Long gone are the days when Arsenal, claiming their 14th FA Cup here, were scoring four and five on a yearly basis in finals lacking an edge. Instead they were the outsiders against last year\u2019s league and Cup winners, leaving a sense that this was the sweetest win of all for the country\u2019s most decorated club.</p> <p>\u201cThe past is the past but now we must look to the future because the future is different,\u201d the Arsenal manager, Pedro Mart\u00ednez Losa, said. \u201cFootball is evolving and we have to evolve back. It\u2019s going to be more competitive in future so we can\u2019t say we will win every league and cup. But the good thing in future is that it will be more competitive.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/may/14/arsenal-v-chelsea-womens-fa-cup-final-live\">Arsenal 1-0  Chelsea: Women's FA Cup final - as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It might sound strange for a team who have won nine of the past 13 Cup finals but this is a period of reconstruction for Arsenal. They sit third in the Super League after an indifferent start to the campaign and getting in front of Chelsea and Manchester City will be onerous. The top two qualify for the Champions League.</p> <p>\u201cIn the club we have a clear idea,\u201d Losa said. \u201cWe know how more difficult it is to win now but this is a transition moment. We need to build a project and develop step by step. Obviously winning is helping for the mentality of the players. We must use experience like today to create our philosophy and develop our Arsenal way to play.\u201d</p> <p>Amid the Wembley glow it would be negligent to ignore that strides need to be made in other departments to continue the game\u2019s furtherance, of course. Losa referred more than once to how Arsenal were able to execute their game plan on a good pitch \u2013 a nod, perhaps, to the sub-standard surfaces they can occasionally come across. \u201cIt helped us combine better in the middle and get in behind them,\u201d he added. Certainly his wide players enjoyed an extra yard of space.</p> <p>The pace of Carter and Asisat Oshoala, complemented by the central figurehead of 37-year-old Kelly Smith as part of a three-pronged attack, ensured Arsenal had all the best chances and Chelsea\u2019s defence struggled in the first half, with their experienced centre-half Niamh Fahey not fit enough to be more than a substitute.</p> <p>Hayes said she would \u201cshut the world down\u201d, such was the pain of relinquishing the trophy, but admitted Arsenal were deserved winners.</p> <p>\u201cThere are an awful lot of teams that would have loved to be in our position to compete for it,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s an achievement in itself. The fact we\u2019re not victorious is disappointing but we are aware we are competing for the Continental Cup, working towards progress in the Champions League and looking to retain our league title.\u201d</p> <p>And above all they are ensuring that the sport\u2019s upward trajectory continues. \u201cI\u2019m no longer speaking to just one journalist after a game,\u201d Hayes said. \u201cWomen\u2019s football today isn\u2019t what it was 10 years ago.\u201d</p>",

Only in Gilmore on the south coast was Turnbull ahead.</p> <p>In Lindsay, 36% thought Shorten was better for the west compared with 32% for Turnbull but Labor trailed Liberals 54%-46% in the two-party preferred. In MacArthur it was 44% for Shorten being better for the west and 29% for Turnbull while in Reid, Shorten led Turnbull as better for the west by 41% to 37%. In Banks 39% thought Shorten was better for the western suburbs while 34% chose Turnbull.</p> <p>In Banks the two-party preferred was a dead heat 50%-50% while in Reid it was 51% for the Liberals and 49% for Labor.</p> <p>But the polling also shows Labor picking up only one or two of the key marginal seats.</p> <p><strong>Peta Credlin, </strong>in her role of most-useful-person-for-the-Labor-party for the campaign so far, used her Sunday Telegraph column to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/15/peta-credlin-suggests-government-lawyers-said-boat-turnbacks-were-illegal\">suggest government lawyers advised boat turnbacks were illegal</a> \u2013 a policy introduced when she was Abbott\u2019s chief of staff.</p> <p>While <strong>Scott Morrison</strong> says he will not commentate on commentators who are commentating, Abbott has no such problem and has <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2016/riveting-viewing-tony-abbott-praises-peta-credlins-political-commentary-20160515-govqzt.html\">praised Credlin\u2019s stint on Sky News</a>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I think she\u2019s been riveting viewing.

The Liberal party is running a gay candidate, Jonathan Pavetto \u2013 Katter once infamously said there were no gay people in north Queensland \u2013 and it will be interesting to see how much of the vote he scores, though he is based in Brisbane which will be to his detriment.</p> <h2><strong>And another thing(s)</strong></h2> <p>The weekend was rich in hot takes on the campaign, the parties and the leaders.</p> <p>After Credlin called Turnbull \u201cMr Harbourside Mansion\u201d, <strong>Laurie Oakes</strong> <a href=\"http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/national/federal-election/laurie-oakes-mining-a-rich-seam-of-envy/news-story/fd385fb5fff9f45ac5f0b9b888960ab7\">wrote in the Herald-Sun that his wealth was becoming an issue</a> in the campaign and has long been a concern for senior Liberals:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><strong>Nick Minchin</strong>, rightwing powerbroker and government Senate leader in the Howard years, also had concerns about how punters would react to tough economic decisions made by someone so clearly rolling in dough.</p> <p>According to <strong>Paddy Manning</strong>\u2019s Turnbull biography, Born To Rule, \u201cMinchin once said that Malcolm Turnbull could never be prime minister while he lived in \u2018that house\u2019.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p><strong>Annabel Crabb</strong> and <strong>David Marr </strong>both have books coming out on Turnbull and Shorten respectively and they were extracted in the Good Weekend.</p> <p>Marr noted <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/good-weekend/the-man-in-the-machine-20160512-gotfb2.html\">the changes in Shorten once he became leader</a> \u2013 and not always for the better.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>There was no huge enthusiasm for him in the party. He was not seen as a miracle worker. But he was bricked in to the job. Yet his response to victory was drab. He barely celebrated. He seemed to shrink. Something had happened.</p> </blockquote> <p>The books are both updates to Quarterly Essays.</p> <p>Crabb has spent time <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/good-weekend/malcolm-in-the-middle-20160512-gotfkf.html#ixzz48kvhMtfZ\">considering what Turnbull has learned </a> in the seven years since he last became leader. </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Where once the air was thick with tales of Turnbull rages, or the acidly fluent character assessments for which he has been famous his whole life, the early part of his prime ministership has been reasonably calm on that front. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you get what you want,\u201d observed one cabinet colleague succinctly.</p> </blockquote> <p>We have been inundated with podcasts this campaign but the best one in my humble and unbiased opinion is Australian Politics Live with <strong>Lenore Taylor </strong>and <strong>Katharine Murphy</strong>.

It is astonishing to think he cost only a six-figure fee when plucked from Le Havre in 2014.</p> <p><strong>Owen Gibson</strong> Take your pick from any of those who worked miracles at the King Power but Kant\u00e9 was the choice of those very players for good reason. Won more tackles and made more interceptions than any other player in the Premier League. </p> <p><strong>Barry Glendenning</strong> Kant\u00e9 has been a revelation for Leicester. \u201cNo matter who we\u2019re playing, we play three in midfield \u2013 Drinkwater in the middle and Kant\u00e9 either side,\u201d explained the club\u2019s chief scout, Steve Walsh, in a fairly unbeatable description that tells us all we need to know.</p> <p><strong>Andy Hunter</strong> Mahrez. 17 goals, 11 assists, glorious footwork and vision illuminated Leicester en route to the title but the Algerian\u2019s character, which helped eke out several slender but crucial victories, completed the package.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/16/premier-league-2015-16-review-player-of-the-season\">Premier League 2015-16 review: player of the season | Scott Murray</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>David Hytner</strong> Vardy. When I read last December that they were thinking about making a Hollywood movie out of his life-story, I thought it might be a bit much. Now, it seems like the most obvious thing in the world.</p> <p><strong>Jamie Jackson</strong> Wes Morgan. A supposed career journeyman who led Leicester with a coolness and assurance that will come to be viewed as one of the great feats of captaincy.</p> <p><strong>Stuart James</strong> I\u2019m giving it to Vardy for his all round contribution \u2013 24 goals, six assists, and breaking Ruud van Nistelrooy\u2019s record.</p> <p><strong>Amy Lawrence</strong> Mahrez. Of all the outstanding candidates from Leicester, he was the one who could make the crowd gasp with pure, creative technique.</p> <p><strong>Scott Murray</strong> Virgil van Dijk. At some point, the penny will drop and a club other than Southampton will have a quick gander around the Scottish league.</p> <p><strong>Sachin Nakrani</strong> Mahrez. His high point was the elastic-legged nutmeg on Stoke\u2019s Philipp Wollscheid which, four months on, continues to feel like a trick of the mind.</p> <p><strong>Barney Ronay</strong> Vardy. The romantic choice but also an entirely sensible one. Both a nerveless goalscorer and the hare that made an entire team run behind him.</p> <p><strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong> It feels harsh in the extreme to overlook Vardy\u2019s goals and assists but I\u2019m going to, simply because few things in life are better than watching an impish winger like Mahrez torment full-backs. </p> <p><strong>Daniel Taylor</strong> Mahrez, with an honourable mention for Wes Morgan, who has come a long way since being part of the Nottingham Forest defence that sieved five to Yeovil Town in the League One play-offs.</p> <p><strong>Louise Taylor</strong> Mahrez. Although hats off to Claudio Ranieri and Leicester City for creating the right framework for him to strut his wonderful stuff. It would be very interesting to see how Mahrez might fare in a Tony Pulis or Alan Pardew team \u2013 what price he would have disappeared without trace or received the Hatem Ben Arfa treatment? </p> <p><strong>Paul Wilson</strong> I voted for Vardy as footballer of the year. If you cannot get recognition for climbing out of non-league football to win the title, break Van Nistelrooy\u2019s Premier League scoring record and banging in the probable goal of the season against Liverpool what is the point of having an award? </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4ad5121917b8a7bd1e0c6f15b6eec391073a4e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4ad5121917b8a7bd1e0c6f15b6eec391073a4e7/0_232_4648_2789/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leicester's Riyad Mahrez\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Riyad Mahrez of Leicester City: \u2018Few things in life are better than watching an impish winger like Mahrez torment full-backs.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Regan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/16/premier-league-2015-16-review-manager-of-the-season\">Best manager </a><br /></h2> <p><strong>Paul Doyle</strong> Claudio Ranieri.

Amid a fine season for club and country, the fearless 20-year-old played at times as though he was still in the schoolyard. </p> <p><strong>Barry Glendenning</strong> Vardy\u2019s outrageous 25-yard volley against Liverpool in February was perhaps the most sublime Roy of the Rovers moment in a Roy of the Rovers season for the Leicester City striker.</p> <p><strong>Andy Hunter</strong> Vardy v Liverpool. I\u2019m always partial to a \u201cpick that out\u201d screamer but there was a little more to Vardy\u2019s 30-yard shot over Simon Mignolet than the stunning execution. Mahrez\u2019s ball and the significance of the goal \u2013 setting Leicester on their way to a win that kept them three points clear at the top ahead of the trip to Manchester City \u2013 added to the moment.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/16/premier-league-2015-16-review-goal-of-the-season\">Premier League 2015-16 review: goal of the season | Gregg Bakowski</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>David Hytner</strong> Cuco Martina v Arsenal, a first-time, outside-of-the-boot curler 19 minutes into his full league debut for Southampton. Even Martina looked stunned.</p> <p><strong>Jamie Jackson</strong> Eden Hazard\u2019s title decider against Spurs. The reigning double footballer of the year has hardly been a goal machine but his third of the season was hailed around the world.</p> <p><strong>Stuart James</strong> Vardy\u2019s brilliant dipping 30-yard lob, on the run, against Liverpool in February. You know that something special has happened when people are on their feet in the press box.</p> <p><strong>Amy Lawrence</strong> A top five in no particular order you say? That\u2019s just about managable: Vardy\u2019s screeching first time volley Liverpool; Dimitri Payet\u2019s up-and-down free kick against Crystal Palace; Martina\u2019s absurd curler against Arsenal; Alli\u2019s delicate footwork on the turn against Palace; and Hazard\u2019s title swinger against Tottenham.</p> <p><strong>Scott Murray</strong> \u201cTo be honest I was looking all game, because he was quite far off his line.\u201d Vardy on the questionable positioning of Mignolet, and why he bought a ticket to the raffle from 35 yards.</p> <p><strong>Sachin Nakrani</strong> Martina for Southampton against Arsenal. I heard this goal before I saw it, listening to Southampton\u2019s home game against Arsenal on the radio. The commentator went bananas and my initial thought was \u201cthere\u2019s no way the goal is that good\u201d \u2013 it was.</p> <p><strong>Barney Ronay</strong> Vardy spanks it past Mignolet on the run. Planned and executed brilliantly.</p> <p><strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong> In terms of its significance, it has to be Mahrez bamboozling the Manchester City defence with a drop of the shoulder, a swerve of the hips and a dazzling stepover before putting Leicester 2-0 up at the Etihad. </p> <p><strong>Daniel Taylor</strong> Matt Ritchie for Bournemouth against Sunderland. It\u2019s the angle behind the man that shows it best \u2013 the chest control, the spinning volley and then the power of the shot, off the outside of his boot, as it arcs into the top corner.</p> <p><strong>Louise Taylor</strong> Vurnon Anita for Newcastle United against Manchester City. The midfielder, operating out of position at right-back, had not scored for more than two years when he met Moussa Sissoko\u2019s clever pass, dodged Aleksandar Kolarov, cut inside and shot unerringly beyond Hart. </p> <p><strong>Paul Wilson</strong> Vardy against Liverpool. There were other candidates, but Vardy\u2019s devastating strike from such a long way out summed up the audacity of Leicester\u2019s title challenge.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/feb/04/leicesters-claudio-ranieri-likens-jamie-vardy-goal-to-van-basten-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4gdpz\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2450868\"            data-video-name=\"Leicester's Claudio Ranieri likens Jamie Vardy goal to Van Basten \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"SNTV\"            data-video-poster=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2016/2/4/1454604405223/KP_1711309_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56b38081e4b05b93c48cd1ff\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2016/2/4/1454604405223/KP_1711309_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/02/04/160204leicester_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/02/04/160204leicester.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11207786&amp;format=video/webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/02/04/160204leicester_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/02/04/160204leicester_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/feb/04/leicesters-claudio-ranieri-likens-jamie-vardy-goal-to-van-basten-video\">Leicester\u2019s Claudio Ranieri likens Jamie Vardy goal to Van Basten</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/16/premier-league-2015-16-review-match-of-the-season\">Best match</a></h2> <p><strong>Paul Doyle</strong> Leicester 3-2 Aston Villa.

A display that included Mahrez bamboozling three defenders plus Hart to score the second just after the break.

With 20 minutes to go a message flashed up from Leicester\u2019s official twitter account that read: \u201cSo if you\u2019re just joining us... #lcfc are leading 3-0 and Robert Huth is on a hat-trick.\u201d What a wonderfully bonkers game. </p> <p><strong>Amy Lawrence</strong> Tottenham 2-2 Chelsea. A sensational game with a load of drama and a meaningful outcome. It might not have been to the purist\u2019s tastes with the odes to Chopper Harris and all that but witnessing such souped up commitment was special.</p> <p><strong>Scott Murray</strong> Chelsea 2-2 Tottenham Hotspur. An old-school donnybrook that emptied the benches and spilled down the tunnel. Marvellous entertainment. It even adhered to the old music-hall joke: in the middle of it all, a football match broke out. </p> <p><strong>Sachin Nakrani</strong> Leicester 2-1 Chelsea. A night when English football\u2019s tectonic plates shifted. Leicester returned to top spot with a display over the champions that was so dominant that the thought of them winning the title no longer felt outlandish. </p> <p><strong>Barney Ronay</strong> Right now the last one I went to, the wild, loopy farewell to Upton Park. Comebacks, goals, terrible defending, violence, sentimental music, angry people talking about buses. What more could anyone want?</p> <p><strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong> The final game at Upton Park.

Possibly Newcastle 2-2 Chelsea \u2013 back in the day when there was still hope for both Steve McClaren and Mourinho.

It took him 22 minutes of his debut, against Liverpool, to get that job out of the way.</p> <p><strong>Sachin Nakrani</strong> Kant\u00e9has established himself as one of the most dynamic and consistently excellent midfielders in the country.</p> <p><strong>Barney Ronay</strong> Kant\u00e9, a midfielder who appears to \u201ccover every blade of grass\u201d but in fact only covers the ones he really needs to, albeit with real drive and craft. Jan Kirchhoff, Wahbi Khazri and Lamine Kon\u00e9 wasn\u2019t a bad January treble.</p> <p><strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong> Kant\u00e9\u2019s midfield dynamism, diligence and quality has ensured that Leicester did not suffer from losing Esteban Cambiasso, their best player last season.</p> <p><strong>Daniel Taylor</strong> Kant\u00e9. Steve Walsh, Leicester\u2019s head of recruitment, put it nicely when he described their midfield as: \u201cDrinkwater in the middle and Kant\u00e9 either side.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Louise Taylor</strong> Kirchhoff. To Sunderland from Bayern Munich reserves for \u00a3750,000 in January. An apparently failed centre half, the German was immediately converted to an anchoring midfielder and has helped transform Wearside fortunes. Talk about value for money.</p> <p><strong>Paul Wilson</strong> Kant\u00e9 is the obvious answer here, but let\u2019s give the Leicester theme a rest and go for Alderweireld. Most of the big clubs were in the market for defenders, Tottenham signed one of the best for a very reasonable \u00a311.4m. The Belgian has barely put a foot wrong all season.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"063176b71949e29c97076e05020645940f8816e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/063176b71949e29c97076e05020645940f8816e3/0_94_3827_2296/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tottenham\u2019s Toby Alderweireld\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tottenham\u2019s Toby Alderweireld \u2018has barely put a foot wrong all season\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tom Jenkins for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/16/premier-league-2015-16-review-flop-of-the-season\">Worst flop </a></h2> <p><strong>Paul Doyle</strong> Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. Hopefully, as lobbyists tried to land him the Manchester Untied job at last, Mourinho has spent recent months exploring the one conspiracy theory that he has not yet publicly examined: he was the architect of his own spectacular downfall.</p> <p><strong>Dominic Fifield</strong> Florian Thauvin\u2019s three Premier League starts after a \u00a312m move from Marseille probably drew the line under Newcastle\u2019s dalliance with the French market, particularly as he ended the season back at Stade V\u00e9lodrome on loan.</p> <p><strong>Owen Gibson</strong> Chelsea\u2019s title defence. So many things went wrong that it\u2019s hard to know here to start but the destabilising Eva Carneiro farce is as good a place as any.

From comfortable title winners in May to a disorganised, uncommitted and weak team with 12 defeats to its name by Christmas.

Plagued all year by injury, as he was in recent seasons at Bayern Munich: what were Manchester United doing buying him?</p> <p><strong>Stuart James</strong> Aston Villa could make a legitimate case to \u201cown\u201d this category. As for some individual contenders, Depay, Christian Benteke, Pedro, Thauvin and Raheem Sterling must be in the mix, and what on earth happened to that bloke called Eder at Swansea?</p> <p><strong>Amy Lawrence</strong> Mourinho. The unseemly episode surrounding Carneiro on the opening day of the season set a dreadful tone. It is hard to think of a title defence as pitiful as Chelsea\u2019s this season and that came straight from the manager.</p> <p><strong>Scott Murray</strong> Benteke scored a spectacular bicycle kick at Old Trafford, tucked away the most nerveless penalty of the season at Crystal Palace, and was one of only three players to score a winner against Leicester. But if relationships don\u2019t click, they don\u2019t click. Mind you, if he comes off the bench to decide the Europa League final, there\u2019s a summer-window dilemma and a half for J\u00fcrgen Klopp.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/12/jose-mourinho-management-june-manchester-united\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho: \u2018I\u2019ll be back in management by 30 June\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Sachin Nakrani</strong> Chelsea.

Did Mourinho really once say that Hazard might have overtaken Cristiano Ronaldo as the most phenomenal player on the planet bar Lionel Messi? </p> <p><strong>Louise Taylor</strong> If we are talking managers - Mourinho.

It\u2019s not incorrect, just jarring.</p> <p><strong>Jamie Jackson</strong> The view that Leicester City cannot win the Champions League. Really? If a misfiring Manchester City can be a goal away from the final, why the heck not?</p> <p><strong>Stuart James</strong> When Bafetimbi Gomis scored at Manchester City, ending a three-and-a-half-month goal drought, and decided not to do his \u201cpanther\u201d celebration. You try explaining that kind of behaviour to his biggest fan (aged four). Just messing with kids\u2019 minds, leaving parents to pick up the pieces. What you did after scoring at Upton Park last Saturday, Gomis, was too little too late.</p> <p><strong>Amy Lawrence</strong> The growing sense of entitlement that grips certain clubs and certain fanbases.</p> <p><strong>Scott Murray</strong> No matches over the Easter holidays. International friendlies simply don\u2019t cut it on English football\u2019s traditional title-defining weekend, no matter how many two-goal leads the world champions let slip.</p> <p><strong>Sachin Nakrani</strong> The ubiquity of betting adverts. The gambling industry has wrapped itself around football in this country, and that is seen most starkly with the number of ads for bookies. Most of them are terrible and it will be a great day when I am able to turn on my TV and not be confronted by Ray Winstone\u2019s massive head.</p> <p><strong>Barney Ronay</strong> Teams chasing the title should play as much as possible on the same day. I know. TV. But it doesn\u2019t work well as a spectacle or as good sporting practice.</p> <p><strong>Jacob Steinberg</strong> I only went to Villa Park once this season, to see Tim Sherwood\u2019s Aston Villa lose 1-0 to Stoke City, and there was an intolerable apathy and sadness about the place. Villa are in danger of being run into the ground by Randy Lerner and their stay in the Championship could be a long one.</p> <p><strong>Daniel Taylor</strong> Managers who try to deceive everyone in press conferences by pretending their team has played well, usually after non-heroic defeats, and the number of famous Leicester fans who have suddenly turned up (who, funnily enough, I never remember seeing in four years of covering the club on a daily basis).</p> <p><strong>Louise Taylor</strong> That Newcastle United did not replace Steve McClaren with Rafa Ben\u00edtez a little sooner. </p> <p><strong>Paul Wilson</strong> Monday night football. If it has to happen, and I suppose television is paying enough money to do pretty much as it chooses, could not the games be selected a little more randomly? I don\u2019t think it was fair that Tottenham had to play on three consecutive Mondays at the end of the season.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e67ff3183b1ff91375fff43beec963eff0beb3fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e67ff3183b1ff91375fff43beec963eff0beb3fb/0_396_4415_2649/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ray Winstone\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It will be a great day when I am able to turn on my TV and not be confronted by Ray Winstone\u2019s massive head.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony O'Brien/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Change for next season</h2> <p><strong>Paul Doyle</strong> Transparent and accurate time-keeping. Clocks should be seen to be stopped for goal celebrations, substitutions, natters before set-pieces, rolling around and whenever the ball goes out of play. Everyone should know exactly long is left. </p> <p><strong>Dominic Fifield</strong> How about having 25-man match-day squads, with a guarantee that at least five (a number plucked from the ether) have been nurtured through the club\u2019s academy or youth system? That might encourage a few more youngsters on the benches with a chance of game-time in the top flight.</p> <p><strong>Owen Gibson</strong> Almost certainly a folorn hope, especially with the advent of Friday night Premier League football, but it would be nice if the new \u00a330 price cap on away tickets was accompanied by at least a modicum of respect for the most loyal fans in the game when it comes to fixtures shunted around the calendar for television at short notice. </p> <p><strong>Barry Glendenning</strong> A bit of consideration for travelling fans from TV schedulers cherry-picking their Saturday lunchtime matches is probably too much to hope for.</p> <p><strong>Andy Hunter</strong> Transfer deadline day being the day before the Premier League season starts.</p> <p><strong>David Hytner</strong> It\u2019s an old chestnut but the clubs have to do more to lower the price of tickets. With the new TV deal incoming, they can afford it. It\u2019s so wrong that many parents cannot afford to take their kids.</p> <p><strong>Jamie Jackson</strong> Referees to give post-game interviews.</p> <p><strong>Stuart James</strong> Cancel the introduction of Friday night Premier League football \u2013 a rubbish idea (you only need to look at the Aston Villa-Manchester United game last August to know that).</p> <p><strong>Amy Lawrence</strong> It would be great for the train companies to put on more services, especially late ones, to cover fans getting home from night games. </p> <p><strong>Scott Murray</strong> The removal of all electronic scoreboards, big screens and animated hoardings. No shirt sponsorship. Plastic flags, clappers and mobile phones to be replaced by rattles, flat caps and untipped cigarettes. Match of the Day to be transmitted in black and white.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/copa90/2015/oct/09/safe-standing-bundesliga-fans-premier-league\">Safe standing is popular in Germany and should be welcomed by British leagues</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Sachin Nakrani</strong> An end to ridiculous kick-off times.

Since then, all of his films have featured male leads. Binoche turned down a role in Spielberg\u2019s Jurassic Park that went to Laura Dern. </p> <p>\u201cSaying no to certain films is as important as saying yes, because it really defines you,\u201d Binoche said, recalling a similar discussion with Scorsese. </p> <p>\u201cHe has a very feminine side of himself,\u201d Binoche said of Scorsese, another director with whom she has yet to work. \u201cBut for me, he doesn\u2019t explore it [in his work].\u201d</p> <p>Binoche said she had had better luck with the French director Olivier Assayas. She said that once she phoned Assayas, to urge him to make more films centered on women, citing his love for Ingrid Bergman as an impetus. </p> <p>Following the conversation, he decided to make <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/14/clouds-of-sils-maria-review-juliette-binoche-kristen-stewart\">Clouds of Sils Maria</a>, in which Binoche took <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/17/clouds-of-sils-maria-review-juliette-binoche\">one of three central female roles</a>. The film played in the 2014 competition at Cannes and won Kristen Stewart a Cesar, making her the first American to be so honored.</p> <p>Binoche was speaking at the Majestic Hotel off the Croisette, on behalf of We Do It Together, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/25/female-dominate-hollywood-production-company-launches-we-do-it-together\">newly launched</a> not-for-profit production company which aims to improve opportunities for women in Hollywood. She is on the advisory board, along with Jessica Chastain, Queen Latifah, Freida Pinto and Catherine Hardwicke.</p> <p>The company used Cannes as a launchpad, announcing as its first feature Together Now, an omnibus of short films directed by women of different nationalities. Robin Wright, Katia Lund and Patricia Riggen are among the seven directors. Binoche is slated to star in one segment.</p> <p>Binoche said she had been compelled to back such an organization for quite some time. </p> <p>\u201cI felt the need to do something like this since very early on as an actress,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you read scripts, you ask how you serve the story. Very early on, you see how you can be used. </p> <p>\u201cWhat I\u2019ve been seeing is that I\u2019ve been refusing roles, instinctively, out of the need to talk about the feminine. The feminine has to have its place. It needs space, and we don\u2019t have the space, so we have to take it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb41f73594e70a6feab6c4d9e21f48ceb0c9f78b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb41f73594e70a6feab6c4d9e21f48ceb0c9f78b/0_101_2986_1792/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Juliette Binoche, The English Patient\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Juliette Binoche won an Oscar for her role in The English Patient.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/17/clouds-of-sils-maria-review-juliette-binoche\">Clouds of Sils Maria review \u2013 career-best magic from Juliette Binoche</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to a <a href=\"http://annenberg.usc.edu/news/research/want-work-hollywood-only-straight-white-men-need-apply\">recent study</a> by the University of Southern California\u2019s Annenberg School of Journalism, in the most popular films of 2007 to 2014, women had less than a third of speaking parts. A report from the <a href=\"http://womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu/files/2014_Celluloid_Ceiling_Report.pdf\">Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film at San Diego State University</a>, meanwhile, found that women directed just 7% of Hollywood\u2019s top 250 films in 2014. </p> <p>Since winning her Oscar for The English Patient in 1997, Binoche has largely stayed away from Hollywood, acting mostly in European productions. Slack Bay, a Gallic farce, is playing in competition at Cannes.<br /></p> <p>Asked why she had chosen such a path, Binoche said: \u201cI was drawn to films that were very different, from different countries. I never chose to live in Hollywood because I didn\u2019t conform to a mold. </p> <p>\u201cAmerican agents would sell me films to bolster my career, but I didn\u2019t feel a connection. Staying in Europe was a way of resisting.</p> <p>\u201cI knew I had to step away from the system. Being independent is the most important thing. I think as a free spirit, you have to be smart enough to be able to go in and then get out. Don\u2019t belong to a system that rules your spirit.\u201d</p>",

The party also failed to take target seats such as Norwich South and Bristol West, and lost control of its only council, in Brighton. </p> <p>The party did not make much headway in the May elections this year, apart from gaining MSPs in Scotland and coming third in the London mayoral elections, and also faces a challenge in how to compete with a more leftwing Labour party under Jeremy Corbyn.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/apr/06/greens-take-on-party-politics-five-year-olds-squabbling-in-a-playground-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4t646\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2484546\"            data-video-name=\"Greens\u2019 take on party politics: five-year-olds squabbling in a playground \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"The Green party\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57051c0ee4b0401b41c4efe9\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/04/06/160406GreenParty_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/04/06/160406GreenParty_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/04/06/160406GreenParty_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/04/06/160406GreenParty.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/04/06/160406GreenParty_small.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/apr/06/greens-take-on-party-politics-five-year-olds-squabbling-in-a-playground-video\">Greens\u2019 take on party politics: five-year-olds squabbling in a playground</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Caroline Lucas, the MP for Brighton Pavilion since 2010, remains the party\u2019s only representative in the House of Commons. But Bennett stressed that the 123 of the party\u2019s candidates saved their deposits nationwide, a sharp improvement on its historical performance.</p> <p>She said the party\u2019s strong showing in areas such as Sheffield, Manchester and Liverpool, outside traditional strongholds such as Bristol and Brighton, shows that it has now become a political force across Britain. \u201cWe\u2019ve very much grown up, and developed, and become a truly national party. We are now spread right across the country.\u201d</p> <p>Bennett was a little-known figure on the nationwide political stage when she appeared in the TV debates, and she believes her presence, along with Plaid Cymru\u2019s Leanne Wood and the SNP\u2019s Nicola Sturgeon, helped to change the nature of the debate.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the things I\u2019m proudest of is being able, in those national debates, to look David Cameron in the eye and challenge him about his position on Syrian refugees,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She added: \u201cIt really is telling that I was the only one to talk about climate change in those two debates. It\u2019s a real indictment of the other parties when you think about how pressing these issues are.\u201d Her message was that \u201cenvironmental problems are inextricably linked to the structure of the economy and society.\u201d</p> <p>She said grassroots activists and members have helped support her, offering their spare bedrooms and their time and enthusiasm as she has travelled around the country. \u201cI have a fraction of the resources of other party leaders,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes I have just handed my phone to someone and said, \u2018media manage me for the day\u2019.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/14/green-party-loud-proud-backing-britain-europe-brexit-lucas\">Green party 'loud and proud' about backing Britain in Europe</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bennett has sometimes struggled to compete with the public profile of Lucas \u2013 herself a former Green leader \u2013 who is likely to be a strong contender to succeed her. The Scottish Green leader, Patrick Harvie, is also regarded as a powerful campaigner.</p> <p>Bennett said she hoped another contribution of the debates last year was to make young people realise that women, from different walks of life, can succeed in politics. \u201cYoung women, seeing us all in the debates, thought, \u2018that could be me\u2019,\u201d she said.

      "body": "<p>Oh no! It\u2019s all over! It\u2019s time for Indian Summers to be a bedtime story. Were we ever really here at all \u2013 or were they just pulling our legs? It took the Britishers a very long time to understand anything about what was going on in India, but at least they seem to have got it in the end. They\u2019re not bloody welcome any more. If only they\u2019d got the message ages ago. </p> <p>Alice left with a frozen expression in white gloves, saving Aafrin\u2019s life but signing her own death warrant. But what\u2019s this remarkable coincidence? The town where she is overnighting is under siege \u2013 and it\u2019s Ralphie and Aafrin to the rescue! </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"63aa948543b64cd3f8b7abdce885dec303708c24\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63aa948543b64cd3f8b7abdce885dec303708c24/103_0_2658_1595/1000.jpg\" alt=\"It\u2019s Ralphie and Aafrin to the rescue!\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">It\u2019s Ralphie and Aafrin to the rescue!</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Alblas/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> It was only ever a mob that was going to be able to finish off Mr Charlie, but it was good to see Alice play her part in his downfall. I do hope she and Aafrin will be able to save up lots of money for Percy\u2019s therapy. I did feel sorry for that poor boy having to return to the Adultery Cave of Doom. That\u2019s right, Alice, say in a loud voice in front of your child: \u201cI did it. I killed him.\u201d I know Mr Charlie was dysfunctional and psychopathic and arguably deserved to die, but none of this can really be a happy ending, can it? When you\u2019ve just seen your father slaughtered in front of your eyes? Never mind, though \u2013 here\u2019s a nice wedding feast we can gatecrash! I hope they\u2019ve got some hot food left!</p> <p>There was a lot we had to overlook here in favour of the feelgood factor. Had Sooni\u2019s parents finally made peace with the fact that she is not going to be married off to Eyebrow Man? Oh no. They\u2019re still in with the Eyebrows. \u201cYou sister is a Muslim now.\u201d Oh dear. And now she\u2019s called Leila! \u201cI don\u2019t think I know any such a person. Do you, Daddy?\u201d Fantastic scene. Well done, everyone, especially the little sister: \u201cI didn\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, on the other side of town... it\u2019s wonderful Mr Khan! I would do anything he asked. Just call me Leila. I know we\u2019ve run out of time but I\u2019m intrigued as to what Mr Khan\u2019s family\u2019s reaction would have been to Sooni marrying their son. Surely they would have been just as annoyed? </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80b60149d7487e51154c3c17fd9012b6dce94df2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80b60149d7487e51154c3c17fd9012b6dce94df2/0_26_2832_1699/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Wasn\u2019t the auction all a bit sudden and odd?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Wasn\u2019t the auction all a bit sudden and odd?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Alblas/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> As for the auction: wasn\u2019t this all a bit sudden and odd? Did I miss an episode? I know Ralphie hasn\u2019t become the Viceroy and that he can\u2019t afford to pay the house back ... but ... is he sacked? Ah, here it comes. The resignation letter. \u201cYou\u2019d be setting me free.\u201d But how come he is still going to be living in the house while Cynthia is leaving the house? Really, I give up.</p> <p>As usual there was a lot of great acting in this episode and some truly moving moments, not least Aafrin\u2019s father: \u201cI can\u2019t give her up.\u201d But also as usual it was all over the place and nothing was really advanced or sewn up. I imagine when it was filmed it was supposed to be a temporary conclusion setting the scene for series three in which ... what? Ralphie makes his amazing comeback? Aafrin decides to join Team Mahatma? The ghost of Mr Charlie firebombs the entire subcontinent? We\u2019ll never know.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3523a1a477be8ba4dec91f8a3d2d15b402c735ce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3523a1a477be8ba4dec91f8a3d2d15b402c735ce/89_0_2658_1595/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Aafrin\u2019s father has a wobble over the wedding of Sooni, sorry, Leila.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aafrin\u2019s father has a wobble over the wedding of Sooni, sorry, Leila.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Alblas/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> I\u2019ll miss the sumptuous beauty of the cinematography, some fine performances and Cynthia\u2019s dove-concealing turban. But I\u2019ll never forgive them for wasting Art Malik and Rachel Griffiths, and for not really making that much sense ever. Farewell, members of Club Simla. We raise a glass to you (before smashing it defiantly on the patio).</p> <h2>Political shenanigans</h2> <p>Moving forward hand-in-hand towards the ultimate goal of self-government! Huzzah! \u201cI have heard your speech. Since it is always the same.\u201d There was at least a moment of decent exposition here from the new British man. So they\u2019re still failing to grasp the basic problem that India is on the brink of civil war and all the Brits can really do is be \u2013 as Aafrin put it \u2013 policemen. It would have been fascinating to see how all this would have played out over the further three series that were planned. Presumably Ralphie would have swapped sides at some point and taken up the revolutionary cause. But this episode illustrated one of Indian Summers\u2019 perennial problems: it was a show about politics that really failed to make us understand or care that much about politics.<br /></p> <h2>Evil Britisher of the week</h2> <p>Mr Ian made a brief play for King Evil with his moment of madness in Ralphie\u2019s bedroom. Had he overdosed on vitamin C? I\u2019ve never seen him so frisky. I was even more shocked to see him overlook the cutlery pilfering. </p> <p>This is small fry next to Mr Charlie\u2019s catalogue of horror, though. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just pop along?\u201d...\u201cNow do you see? Do you see?\u201d Poor Aafrin. I don\u2019t know where Mr Charlie gets the strength. And then in his vest in the back of the car ... oh evil Mr Charlie. What will do you now that you\u2019ve got what you wanted? Make a Hindu chauffeur insult a cow by driving round it? That is going to be a mistake, my friend ... <br />Series verdict: Mr Charlie remains Head of Evil \u2013 and just as Tom Hiddleston is surely a shoo-in for the next 007, surely Blake Ritson has given the best ever audition for the all-time Bond villain? I look forward to seeing more of him. This has been a virtuoso role.</p> <h2>The Julie Walters Fan Club</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3d20fc81aeddaf72fb7b4807605c4b40b2a2149\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3d20fc81aeddaf72fb7b4807605c4b40b2a2149/177_0_2658_1595/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bye bye, Cynthia, you were class in a show stuffed with class.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bye bye, Cynthia, you were class in a show stuffed with class.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Alblas/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn it goes!

I was surprised she went so quietly, to be honest. \u201cI came to an arrangement ... We swapped the deeds around.\u201d Of course. She said nothing because she knew she could get what she wanted. It\u2019s a shame we haven\u2019t had a proper resolution here over the relationship between Ralphie and Cynthia, but that\u2019s what happens when your series doesn\u2019t get recommissioned. I still maintain that she would somehow have turned out to be his mother, no matter what has gone before. (I know, I know, he\u2019s just her proxy son and it\u2019s all about a sort of weird revenge on her syphilitic husband, Ralphie\u2019s father). But now that can never be. Bye bye, Cynthia, you were class in a series full of class.<br /></p>",

      "body": "<p><em>Spoiler alert: this recap assumes you\u2019ve seen the final episode of Undercover. Don\u2019t read on if you haven\u2019t.</em></p> <p>\u201cPolice please \u2013 there\u2019s going to be a murder.\u201d My god it was gripping in that clearing. When Nick dials 999, when the mystery Scotsman emerges eerily from behind a tree, spied by the reporter Brady, when Maya and the kids bundle into the car to rush to their dad\u2019s rescue. When the Scotsman turns his gun on Dan and fires, Nick sprints towards his chest-wounded son, and Maya screams in raw despair. I may even have gasped. </p> <p>You may equally have scoffed \u2013 at the lovely family racing to save the dad they\u2019ve just discovered is a dissembling undercover cop. But I found the climax in the forest a fine few minutes of television. It was the aftermath, and indeed the bulk of what came before, that was not such good television.</p> <p>As I see it, Undercover\u2019s great potential \u2013 brilliant cast, huge angry knotty issues \u2013 has been fatally undermined by implausibilities. I know we always have to suspend a bit of disbelief, but it\u2019s hardly ideal to leave your audience hollering at copious plotholes every couple of scenes, is it?</p> <p>There\u2019s still so much that fails to add up. Why did it take Maya so long to investigate Michael Antwi\u2019s death? Why is she still driving when she has epilepsy? And can it really all come down to the elected mayor of Baton Rouge? Did the minister of justice and the mystery Scotsman enlist Antwi to assassinate the mayor? Why have they expended so much energy and evilness to cover this up for so long \u2013 to stop a riot? Nick\u2019s work seems unlikely \u201cto make the world a safer place\u201d. Surely he\u2019s just there to save face for them. The triumvirate of evil\u2019s reasoning was: \u201cwe\u2019ve been making sure police officers are not put on trial. We live in a tolerant society and none of us want to disturb that.\u201d It seems so weak. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae0ef7425f1f38bae21d06a5a007a00709b28c3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae0ef7425f1f38bae21d06a5a007a00709b28c3f/0_205_4288_2572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Maya overturns the US constitution, with a little help from Rudy!\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maya overturns the US constitution, with a little help from Rudy.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sally Mais/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Though the bid for justice didn\u2019t work out so well in London, yet, Maya actually <em>did</em> overturn the US constitution. Her argument before the Supreme Court to prove that the death penalty was cruel and unconstitutional swerved from slavery to superheroes to linguistics to racism, and finally to pain (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/13/pfizer-blocks-drugs-lethal-injections\">very topical</a>). But she can\u2019t offer any hard evidence. Rudy Jones can, though. It\u2019s a miracle! What a recovery from the man who came out of a lethal-injection-induced coma to give a lengthy, rousing and history-defining speech. The excellent Dennis Haysbert gave it his best go, but why did no one veto this secondary strand in the States? Police brutality in Britain would have been quite enough for one script. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e04d1856299cdf7db5d4a8a513c048724c83b7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e04d1856299cdf7db5d4a8a513c048724c83b7a/0_281_4288_2572/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Will the minister of justice finally be held to account?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Will the minister of justice finally be held to account?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sally Mais/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But forget all that: Nick\u2019s finally written a book! \u201cThis is my story\u201d \u2013 hardly going to go down in history as a classic opening line. But perhaps, as he says in his scrawled autobiography, life is such a random \u201cragbag of incoherent happenings\u201d (oh the irony) that it\u2019s natural a drama would leave us with the real villain on the loose \u2013 \u201cmy freedom is unrestricted\u201d \u2013 and Nick still loved by his family. At least Brady will break the story of the two-decade cover-up and hold the minister and the mystery Scotsman to account \u2013 and Maya, Clem, Ella and Dan will get to learn Nick\u2019s true identity, his real name at last. My money\u2019s on Barry. </p> <h2>\u2018Go big\u2019 speech of the week</h2> <p>True to form, it goes to Maya, after she realised that Michael Antwi murdered the man who landed Rudy Jones on death row, and that the mystery Scotsman has got off scot free for shooting her son: \u201cI\u2019m going to go bigger.\u201d The words we\u2019ve all been dreading. See you back here for the second series, folks. </p> <h2>Notes and observations</h2> <p>\u2022 It is kind of shocking, at a push, that Antwi murdered the mayor elect of Baton Rouge \u2013 though we have no idea why, and no idea of the larger transatlantic link, so it still feels too tangential for the denouement. But no matter how much it might shatter Maya\u2019s belief in Antwi and her 20-year cause, it surely wouldn\u2019t stop her seeking justice for all black men killed in police custody, trying to make the house fall down \u201clike it should\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 Why did Nick break his own wrist? I know he needed to record the MOJ\u2019s admission for Maya, but wouldn\u2019t the Scotsman ask why the hell he turned up to their meeting with a cartoonish bump on his arm, rather than hotfoot it to A&amp;E? And couldn\u2019t he just use his phone, or put a recording device in his pocket, or his crotch, like a normal person? </p> <p>\u2022 I\u2019ve found Adrian Lester\u2019s performance fairly wooden and underwhelming throughout Undercover, but I did think he gave a powerhouse in the scene where he appealed to the Scotsman for the truth: \u201cI gave you Abi \u2013 I gave up one of our own for you. You\u2019ve made me part of a conspiracy to murder. I gave you Michael\u2019s mum, man, probably the best human being I have ever met. How much more of me do you want without telling me what this is all for?\u201d What a shame the fine performance was sandwiched with the unnecessary wrist-breaking incident. </p> <p>\u2022 I loved the moment when the Scotsman threatened the minister: \u201cYou do what I say or I will cut your small and average penis off, chop it up and send slices of spotted dick to all the women in your life.\u201d What a, err, ballsy takedown. </p> <p>\u2022 Dan\u2019s list of questions to ask Lola the undercover bint was an exceptional dating crib sheet: \u201cHow old are you? Where do you live? Are you happy?\u201d Thank god Nick caught her snooping and realised her game. I still can\u2019t believe he got shot. </p> <p>\u2022 Did the minister really compare Maya to a sonderkommando? <br /></p> <p>\u2022 I know the final seconds were all a big, saddening set-up for series two but let\u2019s look on the bright side: at least it didn\u2019t all come down to Big Ray. </p>",

      "body": "<p>Maro Itoje\u2019s reaction to a season which has seen him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/19/england-win-six-nations-grand-slam-france-match-report\">win the grand slam with England</a> and the Champions Cup with Saracens, when he was named man of the match in the final against Racing 92 before being also named the European player of the year, was typical of someone reared in a club which is more about ergo than ego.</p> <p>When asked whether he was satisfied with his progress in a season which started with disappointment <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/10/england-rugby-world-cup-squad-cut-stuart-lancaster\">at being left out of England\u2019s World Cup squad</a>, he replied: \u201cNot really. I feel I am nowhere near where I think I can be. There is a lot to come: I am still young [21]. There is still one hell of a lot I have to work on. I need that mindset and mentality if I am to improve and my plan is to become better at everything. No aspect of my game is perfect.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/14/saracens-racing-92-european-rugby-champions-cup-final-match-report\">Owen Farrell kicks Saracens to European glory after Racing 92 lose Carter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Itoje\u2019s recognition is remarkable in one sense because he is not a flamboyant player who catches the eye by making big hits or scattering defenders on leg-pumping runs. He stands out for his ubiquity and an ability to be in the right place at the right time, winning turnovers, stealing lineouts and forcing mistakes.</p> <p>All can be summed up in one play in the final. Racing had little time when in possession, offering scant attacking threat with Dan Carter muted by a calf injury that forced him off the field shortly after the interval. There was one moment in the second half when they threatened as Mike Phillips bustled out of a tackle and headed into Saracens territory. Suddenly, for once, Racing had men over and Sarries were scrambling.</p> <p>The threat was snuffed out by Itoje who, after Phillips was eventually brought to ground, planted himself immovably over the ball and won a penalty. His reading of the game is so acute that it compensates for his relative lack of experience. Racing had some seasoned forwards, not least the No8 Chris Masoe who had dominated the tackle area in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/24/leicester-racing-92-european-rugby-champions-cup-match-report\">the semi-final against Leicester</a>, but none had Itoje\u2019s impact.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a tough old match,\u201d said Itoje. \u201cThe plan was to put Racing under pressure, force them to do things that they did not want to and get them to make mistakes. They are a fantastic side and it was far from easy. We had Sunday to celebrate the victory, but our season is not over. We have at least one more big game to go [against Leicester in Saturday\u2019s Premiership semi-final] and we want to finish the season in the right way.</p> <p>\u201cWe enjoyed the victory over Racing because the club has been working for this for seven years and it was a big relief to win the tournament. I am someone who believes in living in the moment; enjoy the here and now because you have no idea what is going to happen tomorrow. I take things as they come; once they are finished, you move on. We are very fortunate at Saracens in that they treat us unbelievably well. All they ask in return is that we work incredibly hard and that consistently comes across on the pitch; the care and love we have for each other.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/09/maro-itoje-saracens-racing-92-european-rugby-champions-cup-final\">Maro Itoje: \u2018Disappointments sharpen the desire \u2013 Saracens want to go all the way this year\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Itoje became the fourth English player in as many years to be named European player of the year, but there was a difference: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/05/nick-abendanon-european-player-of-the-year-2015-clermont-auvergne\">Nick Abendanon</a>, Steffon Armitage and Jonny Wilkinson were all playing for French clubs when they won the award. Saracens became the first Premiership side to win the European Cup since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/may/21/rugbyunion.heinekencup2006071\">Wasps in 2007</a> and it was not that many years ago, when Leinster were dominant and Toulon were spending, that some predicted a long English drought.</p> <p>\u201cThere is more to come from Saracens,\u201d said Itoje. \u201cWe have a relatively young squad and players picked by the coaches step up to the occasion. We are not a side that ever goes through the motions. We have feedback from the coaches after every match and we want to keep pushing forward. What is non-negotiable for us is doing well in every competition we play in, which is why it will be back to work at the start of the week to prepare for Leicester.\u201d</p> <p>Mark McCall, Saracens\u2019 director of rugby, spoke after the match about how the victory over Racing was the culmination of seven years of planning, the time when Brendan Venter joined the club to head the management team. A team then consistent only in its inconsistency has become one of the most feared and hardest to beat in Europe and this season has only lost one match outside the international window.</p> <p>\u201cMark is a very important figure in the club,\u201d said Itoje. \u201cHe sets the agenda and the tone. He works as hard as anybody I know \u2013 he does the prep and gives us confidence. Our success has a lot to do with him. I know there are things I need to work on with him and the coaches. If I do that, I will continue to push boundaries. As a rugby player my aim is to try and achieve pretty big things and win major tournaments. We know we can\u2019t win the double if we don\u2019t beat Leicester so we\u2019ll put all our concentration into that game this week and go from there.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>It has been a while since English rugby felt such a warm inner glow. For the past nine years their top players have watched their French and Irish rivals raid the European dessert trolley on an annual basis, picking off the sweetest treats and declining to share them around. Now, after a lengthy interlude, there is a richly satisfying Champions Cup to accompany the Six Nations grand slam <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/19/england-win-six-nations-grand-slam-france-match-report\" title=\"\">secured by Eddie Jones\u2019s squad</a> back in March.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/may/14/owen-farrell-dan-carter-saracens-racing-92-european-rugby-champions-cup\">Grandest day for Owen Farrell but no grand adieu for Dan Carter | Eddie Butler</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Small wonder Saracens looked so thrilled as they belted out their own-brand victory song, having finally become the first English side <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/may/21/rugbyunion.heinekencup200607\" title=\"\">since Wasps in 2007</a> to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/14/saracens-european-kings-racing-92-premiership\" title=\"\">crowned champions of Europe</a> \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/14/saracens-racing-92-european-rugby-champions-cup-final-match-report\" title=\"\">with a 21-9 win over Racing 92</a>. None of the previous winners has done so with a 100% record over nine games since the existing pool format was introduced in 1997-98, making it even more special. If the finale was not the most exhilarating spectacle in the history of sport it meant everything to all involved with Sarries.</p> <p>There could be further joy this month should the club retain their domestic title to round off a season of unrelenting success for their leading lights. The telescopic-limbed Maro Itoje has been on the losing side only once all season and he and George Kruis have no peers among northern-hemisphere second-row pairs. Then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/may/14/owen-farrell-dan-carter-saracens-racing-92-european-rugby-champions-cup\" title=\"\">there is Owen Farrell</a>, who did not so much edge his duel with a patently unfit Dan Carter as eclipse the hobbling All Black legend. If Farrell\u2019s seven unerring penalty goals and all-round contribution do not ensure he has the England No10 jersey against the Wallabies next month it will be a major surprise.</p> <p>Farrell certainly has the backing of his Saracens director of rugby, Mark McCall, who rightly pointed out his fly-half and scrum-half, Richard Wigglesworth, had been in a different tactical league to their opponents once it emerged Carter could barely run and Racing\u2019s other key general Maxime Machenaud departed with concussion. \u201cThey understood where the space was and how to build pressure on the opposition \u2026 it was a masterclass from both half-backs,\u201d McCall said. \u201cSometimes Owen is an easy target when it doesn\u2019t go quite right and he probably doesn\u2019t get the credit he deserves. He was masterful out there.\u201d</p> <p>The undemonstrative McCall has not always received the recognition he deserves either but this was as clinical a demonstration of how to win a big game as anything <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/02/clermont-auvergne-toulon-european-champions-cup-final-match-report\" title=\"\">Toulon produced in the last three seasons</a>. At barely any stage were Racing allowed out of first gear and the defence, work rate, intensity and commitment of Brad Barritt\u2019s side never flagged. There might be more attractive sides around but few with more relentlessly effective methods.</p> <p>Regardless of what television-watching neutrals made of the entertainment value in slippery conditions, it also rewarded Saracens\u2019 ability to absorb tough lessons en route from European makeweights to steely champions. Not much is left to chance under McCall but even he could not be entirely sure how his team would respond, having fallen short <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/may/24/toulon-saracens-heineken-cup-final-match-report\" title=\"\">against Toulon in Cardiff in 2014</a>. \u201cIt feels brilliant because I think it was a test of whether we had grown from two years ago,\u201d McCall said. \u201cWe felt then that we weren\u2019t good enough and they kept us at arm\u2019s length. It felt the opposite this time \u2013 we kept them at arm\u2019s length and they are a big team. I thought we were tactically brilliant. Today was the day to deliver or not deliver and, when it came to it, we delivered.\u201d</p> <p>The next question is whether Saracens can collect this year\u2019s Premiership title as well, ensuring the first league and European double by an English side since Wasps in 2004. \u201cThat maybe could be part of the conversation but you have got to get to the final first,\u201d said McCall, mindful that his players will be playing their 32nd game of a uniquely demanding season this Saturday when Leicester visit Allianz Park. \u201cWe\u2019ve dug in the whole season and I\u2019d hate to think we\u2019d just give up on it now. Knowing the players the way I know the players, they will enjoy this \u2013 and they deserve to \u2013 but when Tuesday comes they will be ready to go back to work.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe there will come a day when the freakishly consistent Itoje, Farrell, Kruis and Alex Goode finally run out of juice but there is little sign of it at the moment, give or take the nasty forehead gash sustained by Billy Vunipola. Racing freely conceded they were beaten by a superior team, the decision to risk Carter\u2019s suspect calf backfiring badly, and McCall is confident there is more to come from Saracens: \u201cI think they\u2019re going to get better not worse. I\u2019m not going to say we\u2019re going to win everything but I do think this team will improve.\u201d</p> <p>The club\u2019s other ongoing ambition will be to entice more fans to come and watch them. For all their famous team bonding, impressive role models and meticulous preparation they are still struggling to convince the wider population of north London there is compelling sporting life beyond Arsenal and Tottenham. Their chairman, Nigel Wray, concedes it is a long-standing cultural issue but remains hopeful consistent success will gradually break down such historic barriers.</p> <p>In the shape of Itoje, Kruis, Farrell, Billy and Mako Vunipola, Will Fraser and Jamie George, Sarries really should have a core of impressive young Englishmen capable of charming the next generation. As the players, their children, coaches and support staff clung to each other following the final whistle, it reflected the ethos of a club for whom family values matter hugely. There may have been more flamboyant European champions but few whose search for the holy grail has been such a genuinely collective pursuit.</p> <p><strong>Saracens</strong> Goode; Ashton, Taylor (Bosch, 77), Barritt (capt), Wyles; Farrell (Hodgson, 80), Wigglesworth (Spencer, 80); M Vunipola (Barrington, 77), Brits (George, 52), Du Plessis (Figallo, 77), Itoje (Hamilton, 80), Kruis, Rhodes (Wray, 68), Fraser, Vunipola.</p> <p><strong>Pens</strong> Farrell 7. <strong>Racing 92</strong> Dulin; Rokocoko, Goosen, Dumoulin (Chavancy, 57), Imhoff; Carter (Tales, 42), Machenaud (Phillips, 22); Ben Arous (Vartanov, 76), Szarzewski (Lacombe, 66), Tameifuna (Ducalcon, 68), Charteris, Van der Merwe (Carizza, 66), Lauret, Le Roux (Claasen, 77), Masoe.</p> <p><strong>Pens</strong> Goosen 3.</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> N Owens (Wal). <strong>Att</strong> 58,017.</p>",

I asked to have a little break where we would give a little time, maybe five more minutes, to people to arrange the court. The chair umpire knew that the forecast was good. There was not going to be any rain. I didn\u2019t see any reason why we couldn\u2019t stop.</p> <p>\u201cWe played on a very, very heavy court because it was raining for an hour and it was very muddy behind the baseline. In three games I literally could have twisted my ankle two or three times.</p> <p>\u201cI asked him: \u2018Is it necessary that somebody gets injured?\u2019 [before] he realises what\u2019s going on? It\u2019s his decision whether or not the court is playable but to me it\u2019s ridiculous that [in] casual shoes he comes out and just slides on the line and says, \u2018OK, the court is good.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cWe can laugh about it now but it\u2019s not just a matter of whether or not you\u2019re going to play better, win or lose. It\u2019s a matter of keeping yourself healthy.</p> <p>\u201cConditions like we had today \u2026 the risk for an injury is much higher than it [should] be. Behind the baseline especially, where we move the most, was heavy, muddy, very, very wet.\u201d</p> <p>Djokovic also exploded earlier in the second set. \u201cThese kind of matches are important for both players,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is a lot at stake. When you play a rival, and of course you want to win, sometimes you get too emotional.</p> <p>\u201cI threw a racket, it bounced over the fence and I got a warning instantly. So the chair umpire was on fire today. He really wanted to show his authority to me. So congratulations to him.\u201d</p> <p>Murray, naturally, was not so wound up about all of this but he largely agreed with Djokovic. \u201cI didn\u2019t find it so much of a problem behind the baseline,\u201d Murray said. \u201cIt was the lines that were the issue. They were extremely wet and you could see sometimes when the ball hits the line it just takes off. And it pretty much rained for a large portion of the match.</p> <p>\u201cIt is a difficult one because, if something was to happen to one of the players in that situation, either of us would be absolutely gutted and unhappy. If it was like at the beginning of the clay season maybe it would have been a bit different. But, with the French [Open] starting in one week, if you get a problem it can really hamper your preparations and your chances of winning there \u2013 so I can understand that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"90484c47100719ced67f9b3f942fe9c49ce7c91d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90484c47100719ced67f9b3f942fe9c49ce7c91d/0_138_3496_2098/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andy Murray celebrates victory over Novak Djokovic in Rome.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andy Murray celebrates victory over Novak Djokovic in Rome.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pacific Press v/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>However, this was Murray\u2019s day to celebrate one of his finest wins, the first by a British men\u2019s player here since 1931, when George Patrick Hughes prevailed over the French legend, Henri Cochet, in a quick and decorous best-of-five final, a 6-4, 6-3, 6-2 victory that presaged one of those extraordinary British droughts, the sporting counterpoint to our weather.

The film, a Sundance favorite, provides an in-depth look at the ways gun control advocates have tried to counteract the power of the National Rifle Association. </p> <p>Soechtig talked to the Guardian about how she approached the polarizing issue of guns in America \u2013 and what change she would like to see.

Stars join march for 'gun sense'</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>How did you decide to do a film tackling the issue of guns in America?</strong></p> <p>In 2014, Katie was like, \u201cI want to talk to you about this idea that I had.\u201d The Isla Vista Shooting happened on May 22. She called me and said, \u201cI\u2019ve been covering this issue for 30 years and the situation seems to be getting worse. Could we give this the same exploration of Fed Up and really unpack this issue in this holistic and comprehensive way?\u201d</p> <p>My first impression was, really, don\u2019t we know everything about this issue? When I started digging in, there was so much that I didn\u2019t know.</p> <p><strong>What surprised you?</strong></p> <p>Anything that\u2019s in the film is something that surprised me. The first thing I learned that \u2013 you\u2019ve got to be kidding me \u2013 is that 40% of guns in this country are bought without a background check. That just astounded me. That the ATF doesn\u2019t have computerized records. That the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was banned from researching this as a public health issue.</p> <p><strong>As well as interviewing the families of mass shooting victims, you went to Chicago to interview families there. What did you learn about the way that race plays into the gun debate?</strong></p> <p>In Chicago, we featured the Bosleys, and I chose them because I feel they were a great juxtaposition to the Bardens [whose son Daniel was killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School]. These are both families that have three children, that lost one, and the response from the community was so different for the Bardens than it was for the Bosleys. I think race was a huge component to that. I think the idea that black lives don\u2019t matter has a lot of merit to it. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"375405a3bf8a6a260a29ea49b12360bcde72dfea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/375405a3bf8a6a260a29ea49b12360bcde72dfea/0_300_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stephanie Soechtig and Katie Couric.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephanie Soechtig and Katie Couric.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Sayles/Invision/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Chicago has a mass shooting every other week. The grief counsellors don\u2019t come out. There\u2019s no CNN breaking news alert. I\u2019d like to think it\u2019s more nuanced than race, but at the same time, it\u2019s the only difference I can see. Unless it\u2019s the idea that it\u2019s gangs, that these lives are less valuable because they\u2019re in gangs, which we show in the film is often not the case.</p> <p><strong>Were there moments when you felt shocked or outraged? </strong></p> <p>More than the outrage of the stranglehold that the National Rifle Association has over our legislative process \u2013 that was, of course, infuriating and outrageous \u2013 what really shocked me more was seeing that the NRA only really represents 5% of gun owners, to see that they\u2019re not really speaking for gun owners.</p> <p>It had sort of became really confusing for me, for a while: why are they so powerful when the majority of their members don\u2019t agree with the position they take? Their connection with the gun industry \u2013 that this is more about promoting gun sales than protecting your second amendment rights \u2013 was a real \u201caha\u201d moment for me, because I felt that gun owners are being duped, that they\u2019ve been sold a bill of goods by the NRA, as well. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/01/obama-smart-guns-police-law-enforcement\">Smart guns: how Obama hopes to create a market for personalized weapons</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The NRA has ginned up an idea that this is a huge debate, when 90% of the country agrees on background checks.

Ninety per cent of the country doesn\u2019t like kittens.<br /></p> <p><strong>What makes you think that gun owners are being duped?</strong><br /></p> <p>The NRA toes this line that the government is trying to take your guns away. Seventy per cent of NRA members want background checks but the NRA opposes them at every turn. Background checks means they\u2019ll sell fewer guns. The members have been duped. The NRA doesn\u2019t care about your second amendment rights.</p> <p><strong>Then why don\u2019t we see more NRA members protesting what the NRA is doing?</strong></p> <p>I don\u2019t think that they\u2019ve known about it before this film came out. </p> <p>At one screening, an NRA member told me, \u201cI am embarrassed and outraged that I am an NRA member and this is happening.\u201d She found it duplicitous, the way they are opposing the most commonsense measures.

How could it be possible most NRA members don\u2019t realize what the NRA is doing? </strong><br /></p> <p>I think a lot of gun owners join the NRA because they get deals, they get discounts. If you sign up for the NRA and see their newsletters, they\u2019re always: \u201cThey\u2019re coming to get your guns.\u201d They don\u2019t advertise: \u201cOh, we were able to strip the CDC of researching gun violence as a public health debate,\u201d or, \u201cWe made it so you can bring your guns into bars.\u201d<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"52919adbceda9d708a40fc4896f152a8ec4347c9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/52919adbceda9d708a40fc4896f152a8ec4347c9/0_239_4637_2783/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chicago police officer investigate a crime scene of a gunshot victim.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chicago police officer investigate a crime scene of a gunshot victim.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Young / Reuters/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>You should ask an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/23/national-rifle-association-gun-lobby-wayne-lapierre\">NRA member</a> why they don\u2019t know.

We got a blanket \u201cno\u201d. Could we have Wayne LaPierre? No. Can we have Chris Cox? No. Can we have any board member? No. We said to them, what if we did a live interview, unedited?

Did you try to hear from researchers or experts who aren\u2019t gun control advocates, who are more on the gun rights side?</strong></p> <p>We spoke to Richard Feldman, who is a former lobbyist for the NRA.</p> <p>We spoke to John Lott; he will be featured in a digital companion that we have. We did a great piece on him. He\u2019s the originator of the idea that more guns equal less crime. His research has been criticized and largely discredited, and when we went to include it in the film, it felt like unnecessary real estate to put in the film, because we know his research has been debunked many times. We kept going back to the idea that we wanted to reserve the real estate in the film for the responsible gun owners.</p> <p><strong>In the film, you focus on poll results suggesting that the majority of NRA members say they support universal background checks on gun sales. But, in the film, when you talked to a focus group of gun owners, people willing to go on camera, most of them opposed universal background checks. Did you explore that contrast?</strong><br /></p> <p>To me, the Virginia Citizens Defense League represents that very small fringe of gun owners that don\u2019t support really any gun safety measures. What\u2019s interesting: when you speak to them, they agree that people should be trained, they agree that people should put safety locks on their firearms. They don\u2019t think it should be legally required.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47572f9cf62dd3a8960042e0fd70e4ef44fe93e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47572f9cf62dd3a8960042e0fd70e4ef44fe93e5/0_122_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Parents and their daughters, nine- and five-years-old, look over a pistol at the National Rifle Association of America\u2019s 2008 meeting.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Parents and their daughters, nine and five years old, look over a pistol at the National Rifle Association of America\u2019s 2008 meeting.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Olson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When you saw NRA members outside the convention, you saw that four out of five of them said, \u201cOf course we should have background checks.\u201d We have to show that where the stranglehold comes from is this small but noisy fringe who are single-issue voters, who call their elected officials.</p> <p><strong>What impact would you like to see from this film?</strong><br /></p> <p>The best case scenario would be to inspire people to make gun sense their voting priority.

The NRA is such a great example in showing that a small group of people can really make a difference. We heard from so many people who say: \u201cWe don\u2019t get as many calls from gun safety advocates as gun advocates.\u201d</p> <p>I hope that within the NRA, people say, \u201cYou do not represent me, and I will not be a member,\u201d that they will rescind their membership until the NRA represents their views. I hope there is an uprising within the NRA to hold leadership accountable.</p> <p><strong>During the process of making the film, were there any points when you were convinced that the gun rights advocates were right? </strong></p> <p>I worked at Fox and on the O\u2019Reilly Factor for a long time. I could see at times where people were coming from. I could see why Victoria Montgomery wants to carry a gun to protect her baby. I don\u2019t agree with it, but I respect her point of view.</p> <p><strong>Do you think <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/14/inside-the-nra-the-officials-keeping-gun-control-laws-off-the-us-agenda\">Wayne LaPierre</a> truly believes the government wants to confiscate guns?</strong></p> <p>They can\u2019t. It would be physically impossible. There are 300m guns in this country and the second amendment protects people\u2019s right to own guns. This is not a contentious issue. In the two years I spent making this film, I did not meet one person who thought we should ban guns.</p> <p><strong>But do you think LaPierre actually believes this could happen? </strong></p> <p>No, I think he knows that it can\u2019t happen. I think he knows what he\u2019s doing. This is a man who makes a million dollars a year. His bottom line would be threatened if he gave up the idea.</p> <p><strong>Having spent so much time with gun control advocates, do you think there is anything that the gun control movement gets wrong, or that they could do better?</strong></p> <p>I think the assault weapon ban of 1994 was really poorly written and poorly executed.</p> <p>The gun safety advocates \u2013 there are some that would benefit from having more conversations with gun owners. I think the good ones really try, and really embrace gun owners. When I was in Chicago, a man came up to thank me for the film and was talking to me about how crazy this open-carry woman was. I told him, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s productive for you to write her off as crazy. You\u2019ll never further the conversation if you do that. </p>",

The base was built on an island surrounded by a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larsen_Ice_Shelf\">thick shelf of ice</a> called Larsen A. Ten soldiers manning the base noticed strange pools of melted water appearing on the ice surface, followed by gurgling noises as water drained through cracks in the ice, whilst far below came deep rumbling sounds. Shortly after, a monstrous collapse shook the base as the whole of Larsen A suffered a colossal implosion and shattered into a melange of icebergs. That was followed by the collapse of more ice shelves along the Peninsula.</p> <p>Because ice shelves float on the sea their melting didn\u2019t add to rising sea levels. The ice shelves did, however, act as a brake on glaciers, and when they vanished the glaciers were free to slide into the sea and melt, incrementally adding to the threat of rising sea levels. </p> <p>Rising global temperatures remain a concern \u2013 just last year, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/31/potential-record-high-temperature-in-antarctica-alarms-scientists\">Antarctic Peninsula set a new record temperature of 17C</a> for Antarctica and prolonged warming and subsequent ice shelf collapses have wide ranging global implications.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/may/13/west-antartica-ice-sheet-collapse-coastline-world\">West Antarctica ice sheet collapse: 'it will change the coastline of the world' | Hamish Pritchard</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A far greater worry is the giant <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov/jpl/news/antarctic-ice-sheet-20140512/#.VzXPmHrNxU0\">West Antarctic ice sheet</a>.

They resemble an eel and have a permanently open mouth with a great number of teeth. They also have some nasty parasitic habits.</p> <p>Perhaps the most extraordinary thing about them is that they have been around since well before the dinosaurs, and with 360-million-year-old fossils looking remarkably like modern lampreys, they are said to be the oldest vertebrates.</p> <p>Having thrived all that time they have suffered greatly in the UK from pollution and human interference with the flow of rivers, which has prevented them reaching their spawning grounds.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/04/older-than-the-dinosaurs-lamprey-fish-return-to-uk-rivers-after-200-years\">Older than the dinosaurs: Lamprey fish return to UK rivers after 200 years</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, the cleaning up of the rivers and provision of passes to allow them to get round weirs and other obstructions has allowed them to recolonize rivers that had not seen a lamprey for many years, including the Great Ouse, Trent, Derwent and Wear.</p> <p>Like salmon they stop eating when they leave the sea and travel to the upper reaches of the river where they <a href=\"http://www.arkive.org/river-lamprey/lampetra-fluviatilis/video-07.html\">lay eggs in troughs in gravel</a>. Until the end of June this normally secretive creature, sometimes more than a metre long, can be seen swimming up river, looking more like a snake than a fish.</p> <p>In the excitement of breeding in shallow water, it is oblivious to danger as it lays up to 170,000 eggs. Fishermen have been known to trip over both them and the troughs they excavate to lay their eggs. Perhaps the lamprey is careless because it already knows its fate \u2013 it dies soon after breeding.</p> <p>There are three species: <a href=\"http://www.snh.org.uk/publications/on-line/NaturallyScottish/riverrunners/lampreys.asp\">brook, river and sea lampreys</a>. The first is small and never leaves fresh water, while the river and sea lampreys develop into much nastier beasts that suck the life out of fish.</p> <p>All start life looking rather like a flat tadpole. They drift downstream until finding a suitable muddy area to burrow into.

The men in these ads tend to fall into three categories; the bellowing yahoo, the dithering dolt and the smug, sockable sales type. In a footy season like this however, their protean premiership markets give pause for thought. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/13/dangerfield-and-cats-top-of-afl-ladder-after-downing-crows-in-grudge-match\">Dangerfield and Cats top of AFL ladder after downing Crows in grudge match</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They are barely recognisable from week to week, let alone from when they were first framed last October. Eight weeks into one of the most entertaining and open footy seasons in years, a clear favourite has yet to reveal itself. There is no Leicester City in this competition, but there are any number of flag chances, including a franchise club, a team of flat track bullies from across the Nullarbor and a couple of old staples.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been either overrated or underrated,\u201d Geelong coach Chris Scott said last year. \u201cI don\u2019t think too many pundits get us exactly right.\u201d Running with that, the Cats were the bookies\u2019 seventh or eighth fancies in October but quickly shortened on the back of an unusually cosy draw and the acquisition of a handy player from across the state line. </p> <p>Three things missing since 2011 \u2013 decent ruck stocks, leg speed and someone to take the pressure off Joel Selwood around the contest \u2013 have catapulted them into contention. Patrick Dangerfield (you may have seen him interviewed recently) is not short on confidence, nor talent. On the eve of his debut game, he was sitting on a throne on The Footy Show. </p> <p>Granted, Geelong\u2019s forwards are still prone to the yips. And they\u2019ve lost five of their past six finals. But with Dangerfield strutting about, a list that bats deep and the luxury of being able to rest their senior citizens, the Cats are in this up to their ears.</p> <p>North Melbourne has hovered reliably but reluctantly on the second rung down for several years now but are currently undefeated and season 2016 surely represents their best shot at a flag since the Carey/Pagan years. They have a dominant ruckman, the tallest of timber up front and a gameplan that stands up in September. They are 8-0, their best start to a season since 1978. \u201cWe\u2019re in a opinion-based game,\u201d their coach likes to say. Yet prevailing opinion, surprisingly, remains lukewarm on the Roos.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/14/kangaroos-mason-wood-hospitalised-after-knocking-himself-out-in-brave-mark\">Kangaroos' Mason Wood hospitalised after knocking himself out in brave mark</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Are the Swans the safe bet? They certainly looked so until late on Saturday night, when a couple of decidedly un-Sydney-like lapses and unlucky bounces handed Richmond a typically absurd after-the-siren win. Lance Franklin has shown he can still buckle his swash, booting five goals, including one from outside 60. Despite figuring in 12 of the last 13 finals series, the Swans continue to fly under the radar.<br />What about their not-so-noisy neighbours? Greater Western Sydney dismembered Gold Coast on Saturday, unearthing yet another frighteningly good first gamer in the process. They\u2019re the only team to have worked Geelong out and over. The Victorian-centric commentariat continues to bewail the concessions, the academies, the fact that they get 8,000 people to their games. But they are tough, ever-evolving and eminently watchable. They also have a stack of high draft picks who can\u2019t break into their side. </p> <p>In 1992, when the despised West Coast became the first non-Victorian team to win a VFL/AFL premiership, ground announcer Mike Williamson urged the locals to make some noise and show some respect as the victors completed their lap of honour. Should we brace ourselves again? Should we start learning the words to their theme song? Or will the winter grind prove their undoing? They were, after all, 6-2 this time last year and fell in a heap.</p> <p>Speaking of West Coast, at what point do we take them seriously? When it comes to beating up second stringers on their home turf, the Eagles are peerless. But AFL premierships are won in Melbourne. And every time they land at Tullamarine Airport, the Eagles shrivel up.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/15/carlton-leave-it-late-to-stun-port-adelaide-in-afl\">Tom Liberatore equals AFL tackles record as Bulldogs see off Demons</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Is there a bolter? Is it the Western Bulldogs, whose coach was player-coach of a C-grade amateur team a decade ago, and whose captain\u2019s ACL injury has been the asterisk on an otherwise rollicking season? Or is it Adelaide, who have been involved in two of the most high-standard and entertaining games this year \u2013 a win against Sydney and a loss to Hawthorn? But were their cards marked on Friday night, with their 25-point losing margin flattered by some tardy Geelong kicking and interesting umpiring?</p> <p>And what of the reigning, reigning premiers, those Dark Lords of the competition? The ones with the crook percentage and the monotone club legend on the Lite n\u2019 Easy ads? Such are the vagaries of the draw, the Hawks still have to play North Melbourne, Melbourne and Sydney twice. This time last year, they\u2019d won four games. By the time we\u2019d woken up, Darryl Braithwaite was blaring in their change-rooms and people were commissioning statues of their coach. It couldn\u2019t happen again, could it? The hell it couldn\u2019t.</p>",

They were covering my hair.\u201d</p> <p>Concord police Capt Chris Blakely said the problem was first reported Friday when an amateur beekeeper went to check on his backyard hives and bees attacked him. \u201cIt\u2019s OK to drive through the area with your windows up,\u201d Blakely had told <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Angry-bees-force-cops-to-bar-walkers-from-Concord-7469233.php\">SFGate </a>on Saturday. \u201cBut we are telling people on foot to stay out of the area. The bees are swarming all around.\u201d</p> <p>Beekeepers said they could use pheromones to calm the bees and try to lure them back to their cluster at night, when they are naturally less aggressive and usually retreat to a colony.</p> <p>The swarm may have invaded a more peaceful hive, bred with its queen and then killed her, Lott said.</p> <p><em>The Associated Press contributed reporting</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>It was shortly before midday when Monty Panesar, to generous welcoming applause, began the latest stage of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/jun/13/monty-panesar-england-forgotten-spinner\">his journey back to the top of his sport</a>. Wise counselling, therapy and friends have helped him begin to overcome the demons that had taken over his life, and now here he was, back at the County Ground with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/04/monty-panesar-included-in-northamptonshire-squad\">Northamptonshire, just as it was when he started out</a>, preparing to bowl his first over in a first-class match this summer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/15/surrey-middlesex-county-championship-division-one-match-report\">Surrey\u2019s Tom Curran helps rein in Middlesex to gain the initiative</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/dec/02/monty-panesar-england-cricket-speak-openly-mental-illness\">The county have treated him sensibly,</a> with sensitivity and a certain amount of courage on their part, not rushing him. Panesar looks a little more ample now and is still not back to absolute full fitness following a shoulder operation. His rehabilitation has involved playing some minor counties cricket for Bedfordshire and he was not expecting a game now. However, he was delighted to be back again, even though he said it felt strange: there were some nerves.</p> <p>The pitch offered him nothing. In fact it gave nothing to any of the Northampton bowlers who under the circumstances did well to stick to their task as Joe Denly notched up his 18th first-class hundred and Kent reached 300 for seven. Panesar felt his way into the task with six overs from the Wantage Road end, ball after ball sent down at that default pace that is a little quicker than most spin bowlers: it has always been a strength that he can deliver a heavily spun ball at good pace without losing accuracy.</p> <p>Until two overs at the end of the day, during which he collected a second wicket thanks to a catch by Adam Rossington to round off a brilliant day behind the stumps for the young keeper, the rest of his bowling was from the Pavilion end. A return of two for 94 from 31 overs was a good day\u2019s work. His first wicket was a good one, for Sam Northeast is a dangerous young player and had powered his way to 49. But now he drove low and hard back to the bowler, Panesar taking the catch with a calm simplicity that belied his ham-fisted reputation. Panesar was mobbed by his team-mates, sharing his genuine, obvious but by no means ostentatious delight.</p> <p>Northamptonshire\u2019s persistence kept them in the game at a time when Kent might have had ambitions of batting themselves out of sight. Denly played particularly well though for his eventual unbeaten 126 from 258 balls.</p>",

Ridden by Ryan Moore for Aidan O\u2019Brien, the colt powered five and a half lengths clear of a dozen rivals and is now 6-1 from 20s for the Epsom race.</p> <p>The Gurkha\u2019s performance came just six weeks after his racecourse debut, when he was third in a Leopardstown maiden. In between, he had hacked up in another maiden at Navan.</p> <p>Being a son of Galileo, The Gurkha is surely worth a try at the Derby distance of a mile and a half and he did not appear to be stopping at the end of Deauville\u2019s mile on Sunday but O\u2019Brien was keeping his options open. \u201cHe has three options now: the St James\u2019s Palace, the French Derby and the Epsom Derby,\u201d the trainer said.</p> <p>But O\u2019Brien has struggled to come up with a convincing Derby candidate <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/12/midterm-fifth-frankie-dettori-dante-stakes-wings-of-desire\" title=\"\">in the recent trials</a> and it would be quite surprising if he skipped Epsom with such a talented and progressive animal. O\u2019Brien\u2019s US Army Ranger remains the 9-2 favourite for the Classic on 4\u00a0June, with John Gosden\u2019s recent Dante winner, Wings Of Desire, on 5-1.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/09/aidan-obrien-defends-derby-hope-us-army-ranger\">Aidan O\u2019Brien defends his chief Coolmore Derby hope US Army Ranger</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A tilt at the Derby is also being mulled by connections of Ulysses, a general 16-1 shot after breaking his duck at the third attempt when landing a Newbury maiden by eight lengths on Friday under Moore. Another son of Galileo, he is out of Light Shift, an Oaks winner, making him a strong Epsom contender on breeding.</p> <p>\u201cHe won very nicely and has taken the race very well,\u201d said Alan Cooper, racing manager for the Niarchos family, owners of Ulysses. \u201cAs for plans, we will regroup with Sir Michael [Stoute], Ryan and the racing team and see what Sir Michael thinks we should do next. He\u2019s in the Derby, but he\u2019s just won his maiden. We are going to give his programme good thought and when we know, all will become clear.\u201d</p> <p>But there will be no Epsom for Foundation, a good third in last week\u2019s Dante, when he may not have had the clearest of runs. Harry Herbert, chairman of his owning syndicate, said the colt would go to the French Derby on 5\u00a0June.</p> <p>\u201cWilliam [Buick] wasn\u2019t able to extricate himself when he needed to, but he ran very well and was only beaten a length and three-quarters by the winner,\u201d Herbert said. \u201cWilliam felt we should stick to a mile and a quarter for the time being and the French Derby looks a very good target for him.</p> <p>\u201cIt will be very exciting for everyone involved to have a runner in the French Derby. I don\u2019t think Highclere have ever had a runner in the race before.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Four years ago Tom Daley stood on the 10m board here with the country waiting expectantly. Much has changed for the 21-year-old since then and, after claiming an emphatic European gold to blow his rivals out of the water, there was a moment to reflect.</p> <p>\u201cI will never, ever experience more pressure than standing on the end of the board, looking down at the Olympic rings for my final dive with 18,000 people in the audience in London and millions of people watching at home,\u201d said Daley of his experience in 2012, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/11/tom-daley-olympic-diving-bronze\" title=\"\">when he won bronze</a>. \u201cThere will never be a more pressurised moment in my life than that moment and I managed to handle it. I feel now, as a diver, I am so much better.\u201d</p> <p>How he proved it. Daley, below, dove to a comfortable victory and claimed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/11/tom-daley-grace-reid-mixed-gold-synchro-european-championship\" title=\"\">his second gold at these championships</a> in the 10m platform, doing so in some style with a score of 570.50 \u2013 not far short of a personal best \u2013 and beating the Russian Victor Minibaev, his nearest competitor, by 45.90 points.</p> <p>To put the performance in context, it would have been enough to take gold at London 2012 and there was also an encouraging display by Britain\u2019s 18-year-old Matthew Lee, who finished the competition in fifth. Daley\u2019s victory marked a satisfying denouement to Britain\u2019s diving efforts at these championships, with the team having excelled beyond expectations and topping the medal table three months before the Rio Olympics.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very happy with how it went, it was close to my personal best,\u201d said Daley. \u201cThe thing is, there is so much more in the tank, everything could have sharpened up a little. In training I can get all my dives in 10s, one day I will get them all together.</p> <p>\u201cIn theory I\u2019m at peak age. I feel like I\u2019m diving the best I\u2019ve ever dived, consistently, and it\u2019s really exciting moving forward to the Olympic Games because it\u2019s one of those events where anything can happen, it\u2019s outdoors and there are so many factors. I feel like I\u2019m in the best place I possibly can be.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m more advanced with my experience, my power, my ability, just my mental stability and how I want to fight for every single thing in a competition. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/may/23/dream-best-dive-tom-daley\" title=\"\">I\u2019m in a different place than I was four years ago</a>. Going into Rio it\u2019s nice to think there will never be a situation as pressurised as that, there will be pressure don\u2019t get me wrong, but I don\u2019t have the home crowd there expecting me to win a medal.\u201d</p> <p>On Britain\u2019s overall improvement, he added: \u201cIt\u2019s the most medals we\u2019ve ever won at a European Championships, the most before was two. We\u2019re doing the best we\u2019ve ever done. There are so many different reasons, the UK Sport lottery funding we\u2019ve been getting since 2012 has increased our facilities, new pools across the country. The way that our performance director, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/dec/29/british-diving-appoint-new-coach\" title=\"\">Alexei [Evangulov], has performance-managed British Diving</a>, he was over in 2008 and if you look at the difference in British diving since then it\u2019s miraculous really.\u201d</p> <p>Five of Daley\u2019s six dives in the competition scored between 96.20 and 99 points, saving his best for last with an almost flawless back three-and-a-half somersaults. It was certainly a message to his Chinese rivals, who will provide a sterner test at the Games this summer, and Daley\u2019s former coach Andy Banks \u2013 who is still part of the GB setup \u2013 said: \u201cIt was fantastic, 570 is a very, very good score. A performance like that I think will get on the podium in Rio. It\u2019s a question of where, because those Chinese are so good. It\u2019s probably the best championships we\u2019ve ever had, we\u2019ve never had so many medals before. Confidence has got to be strong going into the Games.\u201d</p> <p>Britain finished the day with a final medal in the women\u2019s 3m synchronised event, Alicia Blagg and Rebecca Gallantree taking silver with a score of 319.32 from five dives, the country\u2019s 11th medal in total at the championships before the swimming begins on Monday.</p>",

Russell Knox should be a part of golf\u2019s wider consciousness on account of his success at<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/08/russell-knox-wins-wgc-hsbc-champions-shanghai-golf\" title=\"\"> last year\u2019s WGC event in Shanghai</a>. An appearance at a Thursday evening dinner at Sawgrass, as hosted by Darren Clarke, endorsed the Scot\u2019s status as part of the Hazeltine Ryder Cup equation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/08/russell-knox-wins-wgc-hsbc-champions-shanghai-golf\">Russell Knox pulls off Shanghai surprise with fairytale WGC-HSBC Champions win</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Knox\u2019s historic family connection to Jacksonville, which is now his home, means that the Players Championship has featured in his thoughts since he harboured dreams of playing professional golf. When developing as a junior at Nairn Dunbar and subsequently Inverness golf clubs in the Scottish Highlands, the Stadium Course at Sawgrass was as much as an inspiration to Knox as major championships.</p> <p>It seems fitting then that this venue played host to the scene which won the understated Knox so many new fans. The true character of sportsmen is frequently displayed in adversity or trauma. Knox suffered the latter in the dying embers of his third round at the Players but reacted in a manner which was class personified. The public duly embraced him.</p> <p>The taking of nine shots anywhere would be painful enough for a professional golfer. To do it, as Knox did, at such an iconic hole as the par-three 17th here offered a fresh level of attention. Add in the proximity of friends and family, plus the fact that at eight under par Knox was a serious part of this tournament narrative, and he would be forgiven for wanting to follow his three balls into a lake which provides a home for alligators.</p> <p>Instead, when pitching his seventh shot on to the green, Knox punched the air and laughed. A scene which could have precipitated gasps and unrelenting sympathy from galleries instantly became cause to afford lavish praise upon the 30-year-old. When holing out for nine, Knox again celebrated.</p> <p>By Sunday morning, the United States broadcast media were replaying the incident time and again; not as a dig at Knox but in celebration of his attitude. The reaction to his own reaction has proved quite something.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people were rooting for me here,\u201d Knox said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what to say. I mean, that was an epic fail. Until you\u2019re in that position, you don\u2019t understand what it feels like. I thought I hit a good first shot. I thought I\u2019d stuffed it. And then after that, it just goes so quickly.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s hard to describe how you feel. Your whole body is like ... I don\u2019t even know, where your blood is just pumping through your brain. I had never shanked a pitching wedge off a tee before, so that was a first.</p> <p>\u201cThe first one, I must have just hit it a groove high because I hit it pretty decent. It wasn\u2019t a total chunk. I was very shocked when it went in the water because I never once thought it was going to go in, and then obviously the second one; epic fail. After that, it\u2019s just difficult. You\u2019re so nervous. I mean, you\u2019ve got thousands of people laughing at you. It\u2019s a very uncomfortable feeling.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s such an easy shot when you have no nerves or adrenaline. A pro would never miss that. We should know what we\u2019re doing. But it\u2019s a different story once you\u2019ve hit two in a row in the water. The green felt like it was the size of a quarter.</p> <p>\u201cI had no idea what I was going to make. I ended up made an awesome putt for that nine. After I was walking through the tunnel to the next tee, I was like: \u2018Whoa, that was to avoid a 10.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>There was no lingering damage. Knox returned the 17th tee on Sunday when five under par for his round. Green safely found, his arms were aloft again. One of the most endearing, if curious, tales of this golfing year was complete.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-16T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>There is a moment early in Mike Tyson\u2019s autobiography, Undisputed Truth, when it becomes clear that the baddest man on the planet does not much care for fighting any more. That epiphany visits all boxers eventually. But for Tyson the moment arrives not at the strung-out denouement of his career, as he sags on his stool following defeat against the Irish journeyman Kevin McBride, but at its thrillingly turbulent epicentre.</p> <p>Seven months after Tyson knocked out Trevor Berbick in two rounds to become, aged 20, the youngest heavyweight world champion in history he faced a reunification bout against Tony Tucker. \u201cThis was going to be the biggest fight of my career, the fight to unify all three titles,\u201d he writes. \u201cI pulled [close friend] Steve Lott aside one day in the gym. \u2018I\u2019m going to retire,\u2019 I said.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/may/14/tyson-fury-boxing-demons-absurd-world-champion\">Tyson Fury\u2019s demons keep prodding him into the theatre of the absurd | Kevin Mitchell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is a recurring theme, even after Tyson became undisputed champion.</p> <p>\u201cFrank Bruno should have kicked my ass,\u201d Tyson remembers. \u201cI just didn\u2019t care any more. I was tired of fighting. I wasn\u2019t in training. I was just sleeping with women.\u201d Before the myth of his invincibility was crumpled by Buster Douglas in Tokyo Tyson even had to be dragged on to the plane. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to fight,\u201d he admits. \u201cAll I was interested in then was partying.\u201d It was only after his final contest against McBride, in 2005, that Tyson admitted that in effect he had lived a lie for 25 years. He had not enjoyed fighting since 1990.</p> <p>Increasingly \u2013 and sadly \u2013 it seems that Tyson and Britain\u2019s current WBA and WBO title holder, Tyson Fury, share more than a name and world championship belts. It is nearly seven months since Fury <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/28/tyson-fury-shocks-wladimir-klitschko-world-heavyweight-title-champion\" title=\"\">outpointed Wladimir Klitschko</a> to become the lineal heavyweight champion. Yet just like Tyson before facing Tucker, he appears fickle and restless \u2013 only it is tumbling out in a much more public way.</p> <p>Recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/28/tyson-fury-wladimir-klitschko-retire-rematch\" title=\"\">Fury has talked of retiring</a> \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s going to be my last fight win, lose or draw. Shit or bust. I\u2019m so sick of it. I\u2019ve got no motivation to carry it on\u201d \u2013 or moving to America. He has revelled in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/27/tyson-fury-wrecking-ball-self-destruction-wladimir-klitschko\" title=\"\">his baroque rolls of fat</a> two months before his rematch with Klitschko. And last Friday he returned to the pulpit, attacking what he suggested was a godless society ravaged by paedophiles, bisexuals, transexuals and a lack of morals.</p> <p>This time, though, the rant had a further worrying element: paranoia. It is not uncommon for fighters to believe that someone is out to screw them after they win a world title. Usually their fire is concentrated on promoters or the size of their purses. Fury, though, is garbling on about Zionist conspiracies.</p> <p>Some believe Fury is merely toying with the media. To them his recent behaviour is just more pantomime shock-jockery guaranteed to put the Fairtrade pants of any liberal in a twist. But, to these eyes, like Tyson before him, it looks more as if he is grasping for a way out.</p> <p>For, as Tyson discovered, becoming world champion is no cure-all for long-standing problems outside the ring. \u201cI was always mad at the world,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI always felt empty. Being champ of the world just accelerated and intensified those feelings \u2013 I didn\u2019t care what anybody thought about me.\u201d</p> <p>Arguably some of the most notorious moments in Tyson\u2019s late career, including biting Evander Holyfield\u2019s ear and Lennox Lewis\u2019s leg and attempting to break Frans Botha\u2019s arm, were not just about trying to maintain his reputation as his powers waned but also about trying to self\u2011destruct his way out of the sport. His autobiography is crass and self\u2011pitying yet always compelling; the only thing he appears to hate more than the business of boxing is himself. Only towards the end is there some uneasy semblance of peace.</p> <p>Fury is not straightforward, either. His supporters offer a continual reminder that, despite a tough upbringing, his only problem with the law has been a solitary parking ticket. His promoter, Mick Hennessy, calls him \u201cgenuine and honest\u201d and speaks warmly of his charity work. Fury, he insists, should be judged by his actions, not his oratory.</p> <p>Incidentally, I remember speaking to Fury in 2012 after he had posted on Twitter: \u201cdont like gays shoul all b shot dead.\u201d After claiming that his friends had posted it Fury appeared to make a sincere apology. \u201cIt\u2019s the 21st century so who cares who is gay and who ain\u2019t?\u201d he insisted. \u201cPeople who know me will tell you I\u2019ve had many a good night out with a few gay people I know. Whatever they are it\u2019s none of my business and it\u2019s got nothing to do with boxing.\u201d</p> <p>Fury also wished the Puerto Rican boxer Orlando Cruz, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/oct/04/orlando-cruz-boxer-announce-gay\" title=\"\">who had recently came out as gay</a>, well and told me: \u201cGive him my number and we\u2019ll go for a beer.\u201d</p> <p>At that point it was easier to believe that Fury might be wild and unpredictable but his head and heart were fundamentally in the right place.</p> <p>He said something else, too. \u201cRight now it seems to be there\u2019s a story about me every day but I want to make headlines for the right reasons.\u201d Despite reaching the peak of his profession that wish appears more elusive than ever.</p>",

The result, coupled with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/15/arsenal-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report\">Arsenal\u2019s 4-0 win against Aston Villa</a>, meant Spurs once again failed to finish the season ahead of their north London rivals, dropping to third in the final Premier League table.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/15/newcastle-united-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report\">Georginio Wijnaldum leads Newcastle in astonishing rout of Tottenham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cFirst of all I would like to apologise to our fans,\u201d said the Argentinian whose side have fallen apart since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/02/leicester-city-win-the-premier-league-title-after-fairytale-season\">losing out on the title to Leicester</a>. \u201cOur team was terrible for them; to our families, too. I feel ashamed. This wasn\u2019t the team that played all season. It\u2019s my worst day in management, not just in England but Spain, too.</p> <p>\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a tactical problem, it wasn\u2019t about physical conditioning \u2013 we need to improve our mentality. Today we could see from the beginning that we weren\u2019t ready to compete and we don\u2019t have enough quality to only play with the ball. We need to run, we need to give 100% and be aggressive.\u201d</p> <p>Finishing beneath Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s side only exacerbated the pain. \u201cWe wanted to finish second. I feel very bad about being third and not finishing above Arsenal; we showed we don\u2019t care about our position in the table,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cThis upset and disappointed me. If we want to fight for big things in the future we need to avoid performances like today. We have to fight. I was very disappointed, very upset.\u201d</p> <p>It was a surreal atmosphere at St James\u2019 Park with the home team already relegated but the fans <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/15/newcastle-united-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report\">singing Rafa Ben\u00edtez\u2019s name for 90 minutes</a> in the hope of persuading him to stay. Newcastle, who had Aleksandar Mitrovic sent off for a shocking tackle on Kyle Walker, were watched from the directors\u2019 box by Mike Ashley, who will hold talks with Ben\u00edtez this week.</p> <p>The Spaniard is likely to find it very hard to walk away now. \u201cIt was amazing, I was flattered before, but now \u2026\u201d he said after being serenaded for the entire match. \u201cIt was emotional. I was hoping to talk before, but now I\u2019m even more open to talking. We still have to sit down but it\u2019s not easy to leave a club like this.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/15/arsenal-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report\">Arsenal finish second as Olivier Giroud hat-trick sees off Aston Villa</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Even so there was a distinct sense of what might have been. \u201cWe knew if we played without fear we could be like this,\u201d said Steve McClaren\u2019s successor who, if only he had only arrived before March, would surely have saved Newcastle from relegation.</p> <p>Instead the fact they ended the season on a six-game unbeaten run was no consolation. Indeed the only hope of a bright future on Tyneside seems to rest with the Spaniard saying \u201cyes\u201d to Ashley.</p> <p>This being Newcastle much can still go wrong but when someone shouted \u201csee you back here next season Rafa,\u201d Ben\u00edtez did offer a thumbs up signal in return.</p>",

He had hoped to stake his claim to replace the injured Danny Welbeck in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/15/arsenal-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report\">Arsenal\u2019s final fixture against Aston Villa</a>, only to be ruled out of that match with a tight hamstring which, while not serious, will sideline him for seven to 10 days.</p> <p>Given Hodgson intends to announce a squad potentially of up to 28 players at Wembley, picked with his team\u2019s first two pre-tournament friendlies in mind \u2013 they play Turkey at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday and Australia at the Stadium of Light on 27 May \u2013 Walcott\u2019s latest setback feels untimely.</p> <p>England will be without players from Manchester United and Liverpool this week given their remaining commitments in the Premier League, Europa League and FA Cup, meaning some of those named on Monday will ultimately find themselves only on standby for the finals in France. Hodgson has already put back his selection, initially scheduled to be announced last Thursday, by four days and will reduce the number to the requisite 23 by Uefa\u2019s deadline at the end of the month.</p> <p>While Walcott\u2019s absence was a blow for the player, Hodgson will have taken heart from witnessing Wilshere play 68 minutes for Arsenal in their 4-0 success, even if the midfielder is still ring-rusty having only returned to first-team contention towards the end of last month.</p> <p>The 24-year-old, operating on the right of an attacking trio behind Olivier Giroud, missed a good chance from Alexis S\u00e1nchez\u2019s centre in the first half but will have benefited from the period spent out on the pitch, albeit against the division\u2019s whipping boys. \u201cJack is fit,\u201d said the Arsenal manager, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. \u201cBut Theo has a little hamstring problem. He is sharp but not available. If he is selected on Monday, he will be available for the Euros.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/15/tottenham-hotspur-mauricio-pochettino-newcastle-united\">Mauricio Pochettino apologises to Tottenham fans for Newcastle shambles</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There was another <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/15/newcastle-united-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report\">encouraging display from Andros Townsend at Newcastle</a>, with the former Tottenham Hotspur winger having played himself into contention for the squad given recent impressive form. Kyle Walker hobbled out of that game having been hurt in a challenge from Aleksandar Mitrovic, but his availability for the national side is not in doubt. Danny Drinkwater, too, impressed with a fine equaliser for the champions, Leicester, at Chelsea.</p> <p>Hodgson will also have been encouraged to learn Jordan Henderson, who damaged knee ligaments against Borussia Dortmund in early April, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/15/west-bromwich-albion-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">played 26 minutes for Liverpool at West Bromwich Albion</a>. \u201cI don\u2019t want to force the situation and say: \u2018Come on Hendo, try,\u2019 because it\u2019s his knee,\u201d said the Liverpool manager, J\u00fcrgen Klopp. \u201cBut he didn\u2019t feel anything in the last few sessions so we wanted to try to give him 20 minutes or so.

Race stewards later dismissed the crash as a racing incident yet Lauda, Mercedes\u2019 non-executive chairman, was in no doubt about who was the guilty party.</p> <p>\u201cIt is stupid, we could\u2019ve won this race,\u201d Lauda said. \u201cLewis is too aggressive. I need to talk to them and hear their explanation and then we will see what happens.\u201d</p> <p>However, after speaking to both drivers Toto Wolff, the team\u2019s head of motorsport, said he would be taking no action. The double retirement was \u201clesson enough\u201d, he said. \u201cBy continuing with the approach of letting them race it was clear that eventually this could happen. And we will continue to let them race.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/15/lewis-hamilton-nico-rosberg-crash-out-f1-spanish-gp\">Mercedes inquest after Hamilton and Rosberg crash out of F1 Spanish Grand Prix</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cToday was just a couple of unfortunate coincidences that ended up in us losing as a team. It\u2019s painful for them to see that we have lost what could\u2019ve been a great result,\u201d Wolff added.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I said to the two of them is that fundamentally they are sitting in the cars. They are responsible for bringing those cars home and they failed to bring those cars home today. And I don\u2019t want to go any further.\u201d</p> <p>Remarkably it was the first crash between the only two drivers competing for the world championship since the Belgian Grand Prix two years ago. But Wolff said: \u201cWe have moved on from Spa in 2014 and it was a completely different situation in the team back then.\u201d</p> <p>Unsurprisingly, the drivers had differing views. Hamilton said: \u201cFirstly, I have already apologised to the team. That\u2019s the most gutting thing when I stopped. Thinking about all these guys. To not deliver for those guys.</p> <p>\u201c I saw a gap and I went for it and that\u2019s what racing drivers do. I went for it. I got there and had part of my wing and wheel alongside. The gap diminished pretty quickly.</p> <p>\u201cI did what I could to avoid an incident by going on the grass. It all went pretty quickly.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cYou make a calculation in a split-second decision. You never go to the outside, it\u2019s not where you want to overtake. The gap is one car width. The inside is two car widths. So I went for that one.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/15/max-verstappen-youngest-winner-f1-history-spanish-gran-prix\">Max Verstappen becomes youngest F1 winner in history at Spanish Grand Prix</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rosberg said he had been surprised at Hamilton\u2019s attempt to pass him. \u201cI saw Lewis closing in and I moved to the inside, closing the door to make sure Lewis knew there wasn\u2019t going to be any space there,\u201d he said. \u201cBut he went for it anyway, so I was really surprised. In hindsight, I was surprised he went for that inside gap. In the end we have to go with what the experts think and they think it was a racing incident.\u201d</p> <p>Allan McNish, the BBC Radio 5 analyst, got it right when he described the incident as \u201ca little bit of a misunderstanding\u201d. He said: \u201cIt was very robust from both drivers.\u201d \u201cRosberg was moving over to defend the corner - it was two guys going for the same piece of tarmac, but the big loser out of this is Lewis Hamilton.\u201d</p> <p>The stewards also came to a reasonable view. In their verdict they concluded: \u201cHaving heard extensively from both drivers and from the team, the stewards determined that Car 6 [Rosberg] had the right to make the manoeuvre that he did and that Car 44\u2019s [Hamilton] attempt to overtake was reasonable, and that the convergence of events led neither driver to be wholly or predominantly at fault.\u201d</p> <p>Having been involved in his fair share of collisions during his career that saw him win four drivers\u2019 championships, the wise Alain Prost just gave a Gallic shrug and said: \u201cRacing incident.\u201d</p>",

The finest such innings came from Nick Gubbins who, yet to make a Championship century, fell in the 90s for the third time. This, an innings of elegance, joy and, at times, cheek, reaffirmed the sense that it is a matter of when, not if, Gubbins reaches that hundred.</p> <p>In a morning session that saw he and Sam Robson glide to 126 without loss, Gubbins looked a player of rare class. Twice Curran was driven straight down the ground and, as the field spread, James Burke \u2013 who improved as the day wore on \u2013 was welcomed to the attack with consecutive late cuts, the second of which whistled past a man specifically placed to prevent the stroke. Gubbins stands tall and still, drives with class and has an impressive pull shot.</p> <p>Robson, dropped cutting on nine by Kumar Sangakkara at first slip, was less fluent but settled, before Gareth Batty drifted one past his outside edge in the first over after lunch, and Ben Foakes stumped him.</p> <p>The wicket saw Surrey\u2019s bowling improve markedly; Curran found Gubbins\u2019 leading edge and a fine catch was taken at mid-off, before Dawid Malan \u2013 who drove as elegantly as ever \u2013 played away from his body to Burke when no stroke was required and was caught at the wicket.</p> <p>That was the first of five wickets to fall in the final session as Surrey battled back. Burke pinned Adam Voges leg before, then John Simpson \u2013 sweeping \u2013 and Paul Stirling, playing away from his body, gave their wickets away. When Curran trapped Ollie Rayner in front, the day had improbably swung his team\u2019s way.</p>",

      "body": "<p>By accident of geopolitics or diplomatic design, Ukraine has been largely absent from international headlines recently. The violence in the east has subsided; the government in Kiev has been in disarray, and Russia has been distracted by Syria. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/12/ukraine-crisis-reports-emerge-of-agreement-in-minsk-talks\">Minsk-2 agreement</a> limps along.</p> <p>But as Saturday night passed into Sunday morning, Ukraine <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/14/ukraine-wins-eurovision-jamala-1944\">bounced back into the spotlight</a>. This was when Jamala, the country\u2019s entrant in this year\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/gallery/2016/may/14/eurovision-song-contest-2016-in-pictures\">Eurovision song contest</a>, was declared the winner; her song, 1944, was an elegy for her Tatar grandmother, who was deported from Crimea by Stalin. Russia, the bookies\u2019 favourite to win with Sergey Lazarev\u2019s performance of You Are the Only One, came third behind Australia.</p> <p>Jamala had hardly begun her victory performance when Russia\u2019s Twitterati started to call foul. Ukraine\u2019s song, they objected, was blatantly political, by which they meant \u201canti-Russian\u201d, and as such should have been excluded.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/13/eurovision-2016-ukraine-singer-urges-vote-for-crimean-ballad\">Ukraine's Eurovision singer urges voters to show Crimea solidarity</a> </p> </aside>  <p>They weren\u2019t completely wrong. Stalin\u2019s deportation of the Tatars was one of the more heinous Soviet-era atrocities, and it resonates anew following Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014. Eurovision wisely bans political lyrics, and has managed, amazingly, to pretty much hold the line.</p> <p>But questions had been asked at an early stage, and Ukraine\u2019s song was permitted. As a result this year\u2019s Eurovision laid bare the extent and depth of Europe\u2019s continuing divisions over Russia and Ukraine in a visceral, dramatic way, in part because of the new system devised for presenting the scores.</p> <p>Politicised voting, of course, is hardly new. With polling always organised on a national basis, Eurovision has never been able to stop people voting for friends, allies and fellow believers. The predictability with which, say, Greece and Cyprus vote for each other and against Turkey, and with which the Scandinavians cluster together, has become a standing joke.</p> <p>Those same tendencies were all on display this year. But the separation of the national juries\u2019 votes from the popular vote \u2013 disaggregated on the <a href=\"http://www.eurovision.tv/page/results\">website</a> for all to see \u2013 permits some further-reaching and discomfiting conclusions.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/video/2016/may/15/eurovision-winner-jamala-song-touches-people-ukraine-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4j88p\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2505814\"            data-video-name=\"Eurovision winner Jamala says her song touches people \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"SVT/EBU\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57383d60e4b0f7baa6962941\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/15/160515EurovisionUkraine_KP-27940122_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/15/160515EurovisionUkraine_KP-27940122.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/15/160515EurovisionUkraine_KP-27940122_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/15/160515EurovisionUkraine_KP-27940122_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11508197&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/video/2016/may/15/eurovision-winner-jamala-song-touches-people-ukraine-video\">Eurovision winner Jamala: \u2018If you sing about truth it can really touch people\u2019</a> </figcaption> </figure>   <p>First is the clear evidence of how sharply Ukraine and Russia have divided the rest of Europe, and the difficulty many voters feel in deciding between their merits. The two countries remained in contention for the top slot until the very end.</p> <p>Second was the striking disparity between the votes of the national juries (the professionals, you could say), and those of \u201cthe people\u201d. The juries betrayed the same political instincts as in the past; there was a marked preference for Ukraine over Russia, while some seemed to opt for Australia as an ingenious third way. The \u201cpeople\u201d were braver. Rather than treating Russia and Ukraine as either-or, they often plumped for both, putting them close together, at or near the top. It could be a matter of musical taste, but across the board Russia received far more votes from the \u201cpeople\u201d than from the national juries.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/09/ukraine-needs-russia-nicolai-petro\">Why Ukraine needs Russia more than ever</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nor is the glaring gap that the Eurovision voting exposed, between elite and popular opinion about Russia, unique to the song contest. It is replicated in views about Russia itself, especially as expressed in \u201cold\u201d Europe. When western condemnation of Russia over Ukraine was at its height, many people used social media to insist that the arguments were more finely balanced. When official contacts were severed, they said dialogue should remain open. These were not so-called Kremlin trolls, but non-specialists with a different view.</p> <p>Even in the unlikely event that Minsk-2 is implemented by this time next year, it is hard to envisage Jamala and Lazarev, say, sharing the Eurovision platform in Kiev. Just maybe, though, the professionals need to take their cue from the people and accept that it might be time for the diplomatic stand-off over Ukraine to be wound down.</p> <p><em>Mary Dejevsky is a writer and broadcaster</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>There was a moment midway through the second half of this pulsating Super League game when, with the leaders Warrington trailing Wakefield by eight points and pressing hard to complete a remarkable comeback from 30-6 down, you felt that most sides would have buckled.</p> <p>The Wakefield of 2015 \u2013 who won only three of their 23 regular season games \u2013 would have. Even their side who started this season in similarly uninspiring form would have folded. But not this Wakefield <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/16/chris-chester-head-coach-wakefield-hull-kr\" title=\"\">since Chris Chester took charge</a>.</p> <p>Some felt that the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/10/wakefield-wigan-super-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Wildcats\u2019 62-0 win against Wigan</a> last month was more down to the many pre-match problems experienced by their opponents. But this result shows Wakefield are not only a fine side to watch with ball in hand, but one who can beat anyone in the competition.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/14/benjamin-jullien-finds-feet-surprise-package-warrington\">Benjamin Jullien finds his feet as surprise package for Warrington</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Eight wins in nine games since Chester formally took over have lodged them firmly in the top eight \u2013 an unthinkable prospect a few months ago \u2013 and put them within four points of the top four. On this form Super League\u2019s lowest salary-cap spenders will go into Magic Weekend confident of taking another major scalp when they play Catalans. \u201cThis is a great journey we\u2019re on, but we just want to consolidate a place in the top eight,\u201d Chester said. \u201cResults have gone for us this weekend, we\u2019re up to sixth and we just have to try and continue this momentum. None of us are getting excited just yet.\u201d</p> <p>Wakefield can thank a stunning first- half display for their win. Their 24-6 lead at the interval proved too large a gap for Warrington to overturn. \u201cThat first half killed us,\u201d the Warrington coach, Tony Smith, said. \u201cThey started enthusiastically, we didn\u2019t come out of the blocks as well as they did and there were a couple of errors from blokes you\u2019d normally count on.\u201d</p> <p>Smith did not divulge the identity of the players responsible but, with two of Wakefield\u2019s first-half tries coming via interceptions, it was not hard to identify them. With the home side leading 12-6 thanks to tries from Craig Hall and Matty Ashurst, they were gifted two more within the space of 13 minutes resulting from loose passes by the experienced Warrington duo of Ben Westwood and Kurt Gidley.</p> <p>From the first Hall outpaced Kevin Penny to dive in at the corner. Hall was again in the right place to scoop up a lazy pass from Gidley, eventually putting Tom Johnstone away for another superb Wakefield try.</p> <p>There was no respite for Warrington at the start of the second half when Ashurst went over for a second try, after a fine pass from the in-form half-back Jacob Miller to make it 30-6.</p> <p>But now Warrington began to rally. Two tries in three minutes from Daryl Clark and Gidley made it 30-18 and when Matty Russell crossed, two tackles after Ben Jones-Bishop had been sent to the sin-bin \u2013 the first of four cards shown by the referee, Chris Campbell, in the second half \u2013 the comeback was on. A penalty goal from the metronomical right boot of Liam Finn nudged Wakefield\u2019s lead back out into double figures, but when Joe Westerman charged over to make it 32-28 it became a matter of whether they could hold out. But despite their captain, Danny Kirmond, being shown a yellow card for a trip with five minutes left, it was the Wildcats who scored the game\u2019s final try, when Jones-Bishop atoned for his earlier indiscipline to touch down.</p> <p>Some of the play from both sides had an interested spectator, the former England footballer, Stuart Pearce, on his feet during the second half. Pearce, a well-known rugby league fan, has plenty of knowledge about sporting success stories \u2013 but surely not even he could have predicted the incredible job Chester is undertaking at his hometown club.</p> <p><strong>Wakefield</strong> Jowitt; Jones-Bishop, Hall, Arundel, Johnstone; Miller, Finn; Scruton, Sio, Simon, Kirmond, Ashurst, Arona. <strong>Interchange</strong> Anderson, Annakin, England, Tupou.</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Hall 2, Ashurst 2, Johnstone, Jones-Bishop. <strong>Goals</strong> Finn 6.</p> <p><strong>Sin bin</strong> Jones-Bishop (53), England (68), Kirmond (75).</p> <p><strong>Warrington</strong> Russell; Penny, Evans, Atkins, Lineham; Gidley, Currie; Hill, Clark, Sims, Jullien, Westwood, Westerman. <strong>Interchange</strong> Cox, Philbin, King, Smith.</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Westerman 2, Clark, Gidley, Russell. <strong>Goals</strong> Gidley 3, Smith.</p> <p><strong>Sin bin</strong> Gidley (68).</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> C Campbell (RFL). <strong>Att</strong> 5,180.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The day I found out my therapist killed himself I\u2019d taken a cab to the appointment, feeling myself in a hurry. Dr H had a way of holding it against you when you were late. A block from his office, we hit traffic and I ran the rest of the way, sweating under my heavy coat (it was January). But the young doorman stopped me in the lobby. He gestured toward a stiff leather armchair and had me sit while he stayed standing.</p> <p>\u201cSo listen, uh, I\u2019m sorry no one told you,\u201d he started. \u201cBut, uh.\u201d Dr H was dead. He\u2019d, uh, taken his life. Even as he faltered, it was clear that the doorman had been doing this all week. He had little deli napkins at the ready when I found myself suddenly, surprisingly tearful.</p> <p>\u201cThe doctor \u2013 he hanged himself.\u201d</p> <p>I felt a second shock then, a stinging feeling of having been told too much. But then, Dr H had had no partner in his practice, no secretary, and so it was unlikely anyone had coached the young doorman on what not to tell people. </p> <p>He had me add my information to list of other patients. It was just a sheet of printer paper tucked into a logbook; that it would end up anywhere useful seemed unlikely. The doctor\u2019s daughters, he said, would be in touch with a referral.</p> <p>I was 25 and had been going to Dr H, off and on, for more than a year. He was the kind that could prescribe things. It was almost all he did. He prescribed antidepressants, naturally; and antipsychotics to help with the antidepressants; and later, a course of amphetamines to help me concentrate \u2013 then sleeping pills for when it was time to come off of those. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I woke up in the mornings I did not always know where I was</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For the most part, it worked: I no longer cried when asked to talk about my feelings, and I no longer spent whole days turning over in bed, promising myself that tomorrow I\u2019d do better. I was up, I was efficient, but my efficiency veered toward the robotic. At times, my heart beat too strongly, and my breathing felt too shallow, and waiting for things made me anxious and irritated. When I woke up in the mornings, I did not always know where I was.</p> <p>I would never have advised a friend to follow such a path, but when you\u2019re depressed, you cease to be your own friend. And isn\u2019t that a central obstacle to beginning therapy? By the time things are dire enough to acknowledge a need for outside help, one is rarely in the position to weed out the right kind of help from the wrong. You are always, always at risk of putting yourself in the wrong hands.</p> <p>Dr H himself was short and broad of jaw and looked to be about 50. It\u2019s likely he dyed his hair. His office was on the ground floor of a residential building, and I assume he lived there as well, in one of the cordoned-off rooms. </p> <p>The waiting area was equipped with the requisite three-month-old issues of People, but instead of piped-in muzak or news radio there was Bruce Springsteen, blaring from behind his closed door. Skulls and facsimiles of skulls lined the windowsills of his office.</p> <p>Our monthly sessions were short. He kept his prescription pad in hand. On one alarming occasion, he ventured to ask about my recent car accident. So authoritative is the position of therapist that I had to rack my brain a moment before I could confidently say \u201cno\u201d. It turned out he had been thinking of another patient. Another time, he asked if I recognized the woman in the large black-and-white photograph just over my head. It was a young Mariel Hemingway, at Studio 54. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised,\u201d he said, \u201cwho gets that.\u201d That detail bewilders me still.</p> <p>I\u2019d first found Dr H on the internet and made the appointment online, essential because it was usually between the hours of midnight and 4 am that I was most willing to confront my situation. I was in graduate school, working on the manuscript I didn\u2019t yet know would become my first novel, feeling simultaneously guilty for caring so deeply about something so self-serving as my own success and afraid I wouldn\u2019t be able to hack it. I\u2019d begun avoiding people, avoiding travelling too far from my bed lest I needed suddenly to be safely back in it, sleeping so much as to only get more tired.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Dr H\u2019s suicide felt like comeuppance \u2013 the logical, if shocking, end to our clandestine arrangement</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is true that, on Dr H\u2019s meds, I became a functioning person again, but it was just barely worth the shame I felt over how I was functioning. I knew that his methods were irresponsible \u2013 lazy at best, hazardous at worst \u2013 and so I kept the nature of his treatment mostly to myself. When I went to fill my many prescriptions, I felt the eyes of the pharmacists on me, appraising me. For this reason, Dr H\u2019s suicide felt like a comeuppance \u2013 the logical, if shocking, end to our clandestine arrangement. </p> <p>When Dr H died, I went to see another doctor I\u2019d found online, who asked me to describe my dreams. When I told him I couldn\u2019t remember any, he suggested I make one up. I didn\u2019t go back, and weaned myself off the pills with my own nonprofessional methods, a strategy I recommend to precisely no one. A few years later, I had another bout with depression, and found my first good therapist, who suggested I may have a mood disorder called dysphoria, which I like to think of as Eeyore syndrome. It is, as I understand it, the precise opposite of rose-colored glasses, making a person more susceptible to depression in light of a triggering event. Knowing that hasn\u2019t made everything perfect, but it has made most things better.</p> <p>There was one session with Dr H, midway through our time together, that stands apart from the others. I was having problems with a man I was seeing and my anxiety over it compelled me to break from our usual script. \u201cThere\u2019s this guy,\u201d I began haltingly, expecting that he\u2019d stop me. I watched his eyes for signs of surprise and found none (though what could be less surprising than a 25-year-old wanting to talk about her love life?). The problem, I explained, was that I felt myself more invested in the relationship than my partner was.</p> <p>Dr H paused. He tapped his fingers against his other fingers. \u201cIt\u2019s rare,\u201d he said, \u201cto find any relationship where it\u2019s really 50-50. If it\u2019s 60-40, you can deal with it. Worse than that \u2013 70-30 \u2013 it\u2019s not working.\u201d</p> <p>It was our longest session. It lasted maybe 20 minutes. But I think about that scrap of math quite a bit now. Words have a way of gaining wisdom when their speaker ceases to exist, and in the case of suicide, they grow heavy. The truth is, I thought Dr H was an asshole. And he was kind of an asshole, to me. But he was also a person, whose demons were far worse than my own, and I think about him a lot more now than I would if he were still with us, medicating the entirety of the Upper East Side. I wonder what kind of pills he was on, if he was on all the kinds. I wonder about his daughters, the ones who never were in touch, and if he was the 70 to someone else\u2019s 30, if that was what left him so ill-equipped to help anyone, let alone himself.</p> <ul> <li><em>In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255.

      "body": "<p>The high court\u2019s judgment in relation to fines for parents who take children on holiday during term-time (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/13/high-court-father-fine-term-time-holiday-jon-platt\" title=\"\">Report</a>, Editorial, 14 May) illustrates the dangers of ministers seeking to change the law without proper parliamentary scrutiny. Fixed penalties for absences from school were introduced by the Labour government in 2003. At the time parliament was told that fines were solely designed to deal with persistent and problematic truancy, and that they would not be used to prevent parents from taking their children out of school to go on holiday or take part in other supervised activities. The Conservative education secretary Michael Gove changed this policy in 2013 using a statutory instrument, an alteration to legislation that is not subject to parliamentary debate on the basis that it does not change the aims of the original law, something which in this case it clearly did.</p> <p>Mr Platt is to be commended for seeking to hold the government to account. New legislation to allow for the reintroduction of fines for holidays may well be forthcoming, but it will at least be subject to proper parliamentary scrutiny before making its way onto the statute books. <br /><strong>Dr Andrew Defty</strong><br /><em>University of Lincoln</em></p> <p>\u2022 Jon Platt argued that his daughter\u2019s attendance of \u201cover 90%\u201d was good, and the high court agreed with him. When a primary school is inspected by Ofsted, an overall school attendance figure of 94% or under is regarded as low and can trigger a safeguarding issue and even be included as part of an inadequate rating. The national average for attendance is 96%. Will the Department for Education now set a minimum floor standard for attendance and will children below it be forced to enter an academy?<br /><strong>Toby Wood</strong><br /><em>Peterborough, Cambridgeshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Children\u2019s school attendance and their achievement are correlated; ergo, every effort should be made to ensure unbroken attendance at school. Children\u2019s shoe size correlates strongly with reading age; ergo, every effort should be made to ensure children wear larger shoes. Relationships in matters social and educational hardly ever point to simple cause-effect, and are usually misleading.</p> <p>Children from caring backgrounds who have missed a lot of schooling because of illness seem by and large not to suffer achievement-wise. Why? Because the factors most strongly influencing their achievement are overwhelmingly to do with their home backgrounds, not their time spent in school.</p> <p>Surely, hearing new voices, seeing different cultures, exploring new places, talking and playing with parents, even if it\u2019s all at Disney World, are likely to be among the most educational experiences a child could have.<br /><strong>Professor Gary Thomas</strong><br /><em>School of Education, University of Birmingham</em></p> <p>\u2022 It is sad that some young people are being brought up in a world where getting one\u2019s own way is paramount and in which there is talk about rights without responsibility. Less than 100% attendance may be \u201cgood enough\u201d, but when a parent chooses a school, he or she should be entering into a contract of shared responsibility, support and value for both education and those offering it. A school is a place in which a young person can learn to demonstrate independence, loyalty, trust, strength of character and, above all, a role within and commitment to a community beyond the home. Commitment isn\u2019t only when it suits you.<br /><strong>Terry Williams</strong><br /><em>St Albans, Hertfordshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 Article 26 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights provides that elementary education should be compulsory; but also that parents should have a prior right to choose the type of education that shall be given to their children. In their arrogance, civil servants and teachers have lost sight of this fundamental principle. The courts are right to bring them back into line.<br /><strong>Frederic Stansfield</strong><br /><em>Ramsgate, Kent</em></p> <p>\u2022 As a headteacher, when parents came to ask if they could take their children on holiday in term-time, I\u2019d explain the law, but was usually keen to let them go, as long as attendance otherwise was good.</p> <p>I used to give them a couple of sheets of activities and ideas for their children to do while on holiday: collect leaflets, coins, receipts, learn a few words of the language of the country you are in, start a scrapbook, keep a diary etc. All parents came back to say how helpful it was and the children had something to share with their friends on return.\u00a0<br /><strong>Chris Holmes\u00a0</strong><br /><em>Colchester, Essex</em></p> <p>\u2022 Let\u2019s see what parents think when they have to take time off their own work to care for their children while\u00a0parents who are also teachers exercise their parental rights to a cheap holiday.<br /><strong>Anni Swinburn</strong><br /><em>Sheffield</em></p> <p>\u2022 If term-time holidays are now to be dependent on a good attendance record, is there not a danger that some pupils will be sent to school when sick (as already happens now when parents are on zero hours contracts) rather than jeopardise the family holiday?<br /><strong>Susan Mann</strong><br /><em>Faversham, Kent</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

      "body": "<p>Many of the men who are appearing to ignore the perceived risks of consuming alcoholic beverages above the government\u2019s new guidelines of 14 units per week are doing so not out of wilful disregard for their own health, but because they do not believe these new guidelines (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/13/warnings-alcohol-middle-age-men-refuse-believe-risks\" title=\"\">Report, 13 May</a>). It would be helpful if the UK\u2019s chief medical officers could explain what evidence they have that is not available to their equivalents in other EU countries. For example, the equivalent figure in Spain, not a country traditionally noted for a culture of problem drinking or alcohol-related health issues, is 34 units.</p> <p>The new UK guidelines seem to ignore previous well-regarded studies which showed the beneficial health effects of moderate consumption of alcoholic drinks compared with total abstinence. These studies also showed that the level of risk did not exceed that from total abstinence until a level somewhat higher than 14 units per week was reached (the so-called \u201chockey-stick\u201d curve). It is very easy to detect the joyless hand of the anti-alcohol lobby behind these guidelines. Indeed, one could surmise that they will only be content when every brewer, cider-maker, wine-maker, distiller and publican has been driven out of business, and a significant plank of our culture has been destroyed.</p> <p>The irony of all this is not lost on those of us who have campaigned and lobbied our government to adopt policies to support and protect the great British community pub, recognising the value of these wonderful institutions in providing an environment for moderate consumption of alcoholic drinks, whilst interacting with friends, neighbours and peers. The recent <a href=\"http://www.camra.org.uk/documents/10180/36197/Friends+on+Tap/2c68585b-e47d-42ca-bda6-5d6b3e4c0110\" title=\"\">report from the Campaign for Real Ale, carried out by Professor Robin Dunbar of Oxford University</a>, demonstrated this clearly.</p> <p>While we would all recognise the effects on both individuals and society from excessive alcohol consumption, the government\u2019s approach to tackling harmful drinking is wrong. It does little or nothing to get to grips with the small proportion of adult who consume excessive and harmful amounts of alcoholic drinks, while stigmatising the millions of men and women who enjoy a few pints of beer, glasses of wine, a single malt or a gin &amp; tonic in their local two or three times a week, or the occasional glass of wine with dinner.</p> <p>I refer back to the comparison with Spain; perhaps by treating their citizens like grownups, there is a large degree of self-regulation, manifesting itself in a lower incidence of alcohol-related problems for individuals and society. We need to be wary of those who seem hell-bent on pushing this country towards prohibition, destroying centuries of our culture in the process, whilst carefully ignoring any evidence or studies which do not fit with their view of the world.<br /><strong>Nick Boley</strong><br /><em>National director, </em><a href=\"http://www.camra.org.uk\" title=\"\"><em>Campaign for Real Ale</em></a><em> (Camra)</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>Felicity Lawrence has done her usual incisive and powerful piece on the growth of modern slavery in the UK (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/11/gangsters-on-our-doorstep\" title=\"\">The gangmasters on our doorstep</a>, 11 May). It raises three questions about which many of us working in the area are concerned. One is, that at a time when the remit of the Gangmasters Licensing Authority is to be extended, its resources are completely inadequate to deal effectively with the number of likely cases which may be identified. Second, and related, for the first year, data from the National Crime Agency shows that cases of trafficking for labour exploitation exceed those of trafficking for sexual exploitation, the form of modern slavery most people assume to be more significant. This means that a much wider range of organisations will need to develop the skills to identify and respond to it. And third, it is clear that much of the judiciary have yet properly to understand the appalling nature of forced labour and apply appropriate sentences. Legally, judges can apply up to life sentences, but many convictions are still met with derisory fines or periods of imprisonment. This makes many agencies, police included, reluctant to waste time and resources on achieving what might be marginal gains.<br /><strong>Professor Gary Craig</strong><br /><em>Wilberforce Institute, University of Hull</em></p> <p>\u2022 In March 2015, the Modern Slavery Act became law in the UK. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/dec/14/modern-slavery-act-explained-business-responsibility-supply-chain\" title=\"\">This requires</a> any business with a global turnover of \u00a336m operating in any part of the UK to publish a slavery and human trafficking statement for each financial year from 31 March 2016. This statement must disclose the steps the business has taken during the financial year to ensure that slavery and human trafficking is not taking place in its own operations or in its supply chain. Given Felicity Lawrence\u2019s excellent article, it will be interesting to learn what each of the supermarkets are doing either to avoid sourcing suspect produce from East Anglia or, preferably, how they are using their collective influence to change the business practices there.</p> <p>Inevitably, some will raise the objection that people demand cheap food and who are they to deny them? But when these businesses are reporting pre-tax profits that run into the hundreds of millions of pounds, there is clearly scope for decent wages\u00a0and conditions to exist throughout the supply chains\u00a0and for healthy profits to be made by those exercising responsible business practices. It is also incumbent on all of us who were affected by the article to make the supermarkets aware that this is what we expect of them and what will influence our spending.<br /><strong>Dave Hunter</strong><br /><em>Bristol</em></p> <p>\u2022 Toby Wood (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/11/in-east-anglia-will-continue-regardless-of-eu-result\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 12 May) is over-optimistic that the authorities who deal with illegal activity in the Fens will be adequately resourced.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-16T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Political campaigns are not often won by the side that concedes how many valid points the opposition has made. Brash simplification is unavoidable. It would be naive to expect the battle over Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union to be distinguished by nuance. But the descent beyond hyperbole into hysteria has been unusually steep over the past week. The remain campaign sounds an apocalyptic alarm about the threat to the UK economy and national security from Brexit. The leave side probes atavistic fear of subjugation by foreigners, either in the form of Brussels-based bureaucrats or Dover-bound migrants. Each side accuses the other of peddling bogus statistics and ramping up baseless fear.</p> <p>There is ample blame to share, but it would be too glib to say the two campaigns are as bad as each other. While the remain side can fairly be accused of overstating its case, the leave side is guilty of a graver offence: wilfully misrepresenting its agenda.</p> <p>Those who defend Britain\u2019s EU membership come from across the political spectrum but they share a belief that, in the broadest terms, our national interest is best preserved working within the existing framework for continental alliance. The principal assertions of their campaign \u2013 that Brexit entails massive risk and needless surrender of influence \u2013 is beyond rational dispute, or it should be.</p> <p>The pro-Brexit side might fairly argue that it is a risk worth taking for some longer-term gain; that influence might be rebuilt outside the EU. But they know that this is an uphill struggle in campaigning terms, especially when there is no agreed strategy, timetable or model for rebuilding Britain\u2019s trade and diplomatic relationships outside a club whose other members would be affronted by the act of departure.</p> <p>So, instead of explaining how Brexit works in practice, the leave side tilts towards xenophobia and outright falsehood. An egregious example is the claim, routinely made by Vote Leave, that EU membership costs the UK <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/21/vote-leave-claim-350m-a-week-gain-potentially-misleading\" title=\"\">\u00a3350m per week</a> \u2013 a figure that ignores the budget rebate, European subsidies and development funds spent in poorer British regions. Most absurdly, it presumes no economic benefit at all from membership of the single market. It is also a ludicrous fiction to imagine that, on voting to leave the EU, this same sum becomes instantly available to be lavished on hospitals and schools. Many of the Conservatives now making this case have hitherto shown no appetite for increases in public spending. Likewise, the spectacle of well-heeled Eurosceptics from the Tory right suddenly discovering opposition to \u201cthe Establishment\u201d would be comical if the dishonesty did not contribute to a dangerous pollution of the political debate. In the absence of a coherent account of Britain\u2019s role outside the EU, the leave campaign is in danger of becoming a ragtag caravan of disjointed grievances. It seems likely, over the coming weeks, to mine ever deeper into social and economic illiberalism, aspiring to stir up revolt, not against the banal reality of EU membership but against politics more generally, for which \u201cBrussels\u201d is cast as the sinister, conspiratorial epicentre.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/15/boris-johnson-likens-eu-to-nazi-superstate\">Iain Duncan Smith backs Boris Johnson over EU-Hitler link</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Boris Johnson\u2019s ugly and provocative allusion to the Third Reich as a metaphor for European integration clearly signals the rhetorical trajectory. It is at best a move from the Donald Trump playbook \u2013 maximising controversy in order to dominate the conversation and drown out reasonable debate. It might mark something even worse than that. To the extent\u2013 the very limited extent \u2013 that Mr Johnson is capable of sincerity, he might mean what he says. His view of the world might be formed by the prep school certainties of comics about the second world war, as much of his party\u2019s still appears to be.</p> <p>Any Trumpification of British politics is to be fiercely resisted. Mr Johnson is not famed for consistency or integrity, but there are other senior Conservatives, cabinet ministers past and present \u2013 the likes of Michael Gove and Michael Howard \u2013 who, unlike the former mayor of London, combine sincere Euroscepticism with a conscientious view of public life as entailing responsibilities. They should be alarmed by the direction the campaign they endorse is taking. A question they, and other moderate Eurosceptics, should face, is how much poison they are prepared to see tipped into the well of reasonable public debate in pursuit of a goal \u2013 Britain outside the EU \u2013 whose precise terms none of them can even describe.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The democracy that the Americans established in the Philippines after ousting the Spanish and crushing the local rebels was from the beginning a nursery for oligarchs. Without quite intending to do so, the United States fostered the emergence of great land-owning and commercial families, often of part Chinese origin but Americanised in culture, whose relationship with ordinary Filipinos was always uneasy.</p> <p>The institutions of local and national government that Washington introduced were soon in their hands, and politics under the Americans, and after independence, was usually about power passing from one wealthy clan to another. Every now and again a leader would promise to reform the system, but it survived, even after upheavals as great as that represented by the overthrow of Ferdinand Marcos in 1986.</p> <p>The oligarchical system has produced both good leaders and bad leaders, and the president who will step down next month, Benigno Aquino, of the fourth generation of that family to achieve political prominence, has been a good one. Under his rule, there has been rapid economic growth and solid investment in infrastructure, health, and education. It might have been expected that a candidate from the same elite, and connected to the same family, would succeed him. There were such candidates, but they failed to unite around a single champion when Rodrigo Duterte, a city boss from the southern island of Mindanao, running a vociferously populist campaign, began to sweep ahead in the polls.</p> <p>The upshot is that Mr Duterte will be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/10/rodrigo-duterte-declares-victory-in-philippines-election-vows-to-rewrite-constitution\" title=\"\">the next president of the Philippines</a>. For all that the elite system had become tired and distant from the common people and needed shaking up, this is a leap into the unknown for the country. He has said very little that is precise about his policies, but what he has said is not reassuring. His tough law and order line brought in the votes. But although he says he is against extrajudicial killing of criminals, <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2009/07/30/philippine-death-squads\" title=\"\">the record in his city of Davao </a>suggests such killings have been commonplace there. He wants to make the Philippines into a more federal country. The idea is attractive to those in the provinces who resent Manila\u2019s dominance and lion\u2019s share of everything, but\u00a0decentralisation might bring more problems than it solves. He rages against the everyday corruption Filipinos have to endure, but offers nothing specific to counter it. He has threatened the Chinese over the South China sea and also suggested he could do deals with them.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/may/10/who-is-punisher-rodrigo-duterte-philippines-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4j37h\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2502134\"            data-video-name=\"Who is 'Punisher' Rodrigo Duterte? \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5731d27de4b0dca26156f77c\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/10/160510Duterte_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/10/160510Duterte_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/10/160510Duterte.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/10/160510Duterte_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11493778&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption>Video: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/may/10/who-is-punisher-rodrigo-duterte-philippines-video\">Who is \u2018Punisher\u2019 Rodrigo Duterte?</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Mr Duterte\u2019s appeal has been his insistence that he can fix everything and does not care what corners he has to cut in order to do so. It is a story many politicians in many countries have told before, and it dooes not usually end well. The gross misogyny he displayed when he joked about the rape and murder of an Australian missionary must add to concern about his ascent to the presidency.</p> <p>His supporters suggest his bark is worse than his bite, and that he has, for instance, <a href=\"http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections/2016/132854-tough-persona-duterte-davao-feminist\" title=\"\">helped women\u2019s programmes in Davao</a>, as well as pioneering such commendable objectives as reducing smoking. \u201cI\u2019ll behave if I become president,\u201d he said a few days ago, adding, in one of his better jokes, that he would not make state visits to countries with cold weather. There is a cheeky chappy side to Mr Duterte that can be engaging. But there can be no denying that, in office, he could prove to be a very loose cannon indeed.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Campaign groups branded the anti-corruption summit in London a missed opportunity (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/11/david-cameron-corporate-money-laundering-offence-anti-corruption-summit\" title=\"\">Report, 13 May</a>). David Cameron failed to force any concessions from the British Virgin Islands, while John Kerry said transparency in US states such as Delaware was \u201ca matter for Congress\u201d. Surely this shouldn\u2019t surprise us? Tax havens are at the heart of a corrupt financial trade now worth at least $1trn worldwide and every country is involved.</p> <p>So how can this problem be solved? Gordon Brown is right to put emphasis on the EU as the only body that could apply real pressure on the US to increase transparency (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/11/gordon-brown-enters-eu-debate-appeal-to-labour-voters\" title=\"\">Report, 12 May</a>). But even an alliance between the US and Europe might simply push secret banking to other offshore territories in east Asia. The answer must be to campaign in the short term for greater EU-US cooperation, but at the same time work to construct a global economic community, capable of regulating all financial transactions.</p> <p>The extent of secret networks revealed by the Panama Papers should make it obvious that, as in so many areas today, only a global solution can solve this problem. Yet with great irony, the UK continues to focus on 20th-century arguments about whether we should remain part of the EU, while the debate that really matters is how we can achieve global cooperation in the 21st century.<br /><strong>Robert Bruce</strong><br /><em>Author, The Global Race</em>, Blackwood, Monmouthshire</p> <p>\u2022 It\u2019s wonderful to read that top-end London estate agents (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/12/super-rich-may-sell-london-homes-under-anti-corruption-rules\" title=\"\">Report, 13 May</a>) are so concerned to protect the privacy of US media moguls owning property in London. Given that any US media moguls likely to own property in London will have made a lot of money out of exposing the private lives of others, while arguing that it is in the public interest for us to know what sexual, financial or familial peculiarities football-players, actors and politicians may have, it seems to me quite clearly in the public interest for the privacy of media moguls to be similarly constrained.<br /><strong>William Wallace</strong><br /><em>House of Lords</em></p> <p>\u2022 If David Cameron wants to root out the cancer of corruption over property ownership in Britain, why is he intent on privatising the Land Registry, making it prohibitively expensive for individuals or journalists to discover who owns land or property?<br /><strong>Fr Julian Dunn</strong><br /><em>Great Haseley, Oxfordshire</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

      "body": "<p>As a part-time resident of a small coastal town in East Yorkshire, I was delighted when our newly refurbished Meridian Centre was equipped with a decent-sized cinema and began showing a regular programme of films. These tend to be screened on Monday afternoons and sometimes on Saturday evenings. The Monday sessions are followed by a splendid afternoon tea \u2013 dainty sandwichs, cakes, as much tea and coffee as you can imbibe, all for the sum, film included, of \u00a34. However, audiences are not always large and there are times when the money taken does not even cover the cost of a screening licence, which can be up to \u00a3125 for a one-off event. Those running this worthwhile venture tell me that the cinema might have to close because of high licensing fees. Nor is Withernsea a place where most people can afford to pay, or would pay, \u00a310 a ticket. In Cannes film festival week, we should remember there are many such small cinemas in operation now. Is it really necessary for the distributors to charge so much for what is essentially the loan of a DVD? Surely some discretion could be used in the case of small cinema venues which do provide a valuable service to a community?<br /><strong>Susan Harr</strong><br /><em>Withernsea, East Yorkshire</em></p>",

Crimea was annexed by Russia two years ago, but while many in the peninsula celebrated the event, the Crimean Tatar minority have largely been strongly opposed to Russian rule.<br /></p> <p>Maria Zakharova, Russia\u2019s foreign ministry spokeswoman, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/maria.zakharova.167/posts/10209814234902253?pnref=story.unseen-section\">wrote</a> on her Facebook page that next year the Russian entry should be about Syrian president <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/bashar-al-assad\">Bashar al-Assad</a>, and even offered a bizarre English-language chorus for the potential song: \u201cAssad bloody, Assad worst. Give me prize, that we can host.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Dmitry Rogozin, the deputy prime minister, suggested sending Sergei Shnurov, a rock singer known for his foul-mouthed lyrics, to next year\u2019s Eurovision: \u201cDon\u2019t know if he\u2019d win, but he\u2019d have some choice words for everyone,\u201d the politician wrote.</p> <p>Jamala, whose real name is Susana Jamaladynova, pleaded for \u201cpeace and love\u201d as she collected her award on Saturday night. She admitted her song was highly politically charged in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/13/eurovision-2016-ukraine-singer-urges-vote-for-crimean-ballad\">an interview with the Guardian the day before the contest</a>. She has not been home to Crimea in nearly two years, saying she fears arrest, but most of her family still live there, and she said that although her song was inspired by the events of 1944, it was also about more recent tragedies. </p> <p>\u201cOf course it\u2019s about 2014 as well,\u201d she said. \u201cThese two years have added so much sadness to my life. Imagine, you\u2019re a creative person, a singer, but you can\u2019t go home for two years. You see your grandfather on Skype who is 90 years old and ill, but you can\u2019t visit him.

(Most <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5T7Xlyaieo\">recently</a>, Sarandon, a registered Democrat and avid Bernie Sanders supporter, courted controversy for saying she might abstain from voting for Clinton, should the former secretary of state win the nomination to contest the presidency with Trump.)</p> <p>A reporter asked the actor what she made of Allen\u2019s comment at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/12/woody-allen-ronan-farrow-cannes-cafe-society-film\">a press conference</a> for his Cannes opener, Caf\u00e9 Society, that he didn\u2019t have \u201canything to really draw on\u201d to one day make a film about a younger man and an older woman (his narratives often center on an older man and a much younger woman). </p> <p>Sarandon at first appeared to shut it down: \u201cI have nothing good to say about Woody Allen, so I don\u2019t think we should go there.\u201d</p> <p>Pressed to elaborate, Sarandon said: \u201cI think he sexually assaulted a child and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right \u2026 It\u2019s gotten very quiet in here, but that\u2019s true.\u201d</p> <p>Sarandon was referring to allegations made by Allen\u2019s daughter and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/11/ronan-farrow-condemns-media-woody-allen-allegations\">brought back into the public</a> eye this week by his son, Ronan Farrow. The allegations, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/12/woody-allen-ronan-farrow-cannes-cafe-society-film\">which Allen denies</a>, were investigated in 1993 but no charges were brought. </p> <p>Later, Sarandon was asked what a Trump presidency would look like. Sarandon said she did not imagine the billionaire businessman and Republic candidate winning, because \u201che\u2019s alienated so many minorities and women\u201d. </p> <p>But should he beat Clinton, Sarandon said Trump would not be able to enact many of his grand policies. </p> <p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what [Trump] thinks because nothing will be able to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cThe thing interesting about Trump is the things he\u2019s talking about are impossible. They\u2019re not what\u2019s threatening. He\u2019s obviously not going to build a wall; he\u2019s not going to be able to export all the Muslims in the United States. All of those things are impossible to do.</p> <p>\u201cWhat he did that was terrible is that he legitimatized racism and homophobia in order get that very discontented base that wants something authentic. What he did in the process was say, \u2018It\u2019s OK to be violent.\u2019 That\u2019s why he has the KKK as one of his representatives. That\u2019s been really terrible, besides the fact that America looks ridiculous.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, earlier this year, Trump <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/28/donald-trump-former-kkk-leader-david-duke\">hesitated to disavow</a> an endorsement from a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. This week, it was revealed that the Trump campaign\u2019s California delegates to the national convention <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/10/donald-trump-white-nationalist-delegate-database-error\">included an avowed white nationalist</a>.</p> <p>Sarandon praised Sanders for \u201cactivating minorities \u2026 people who have not been engaged in the political process before, especially millions of millennials\u201d. She said she believed Sanders supporters would not let Trump go through with his agenda, and would fuel a widespread backlash, should he be elected president. </p> <p>Lastly, Sarandon targeted the American mainstream media for being \u201cirresponsible\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/31/susan-sarandon-debra-messing-trump-clinton-sanders\">Debra Messing and Susan Sarandon end Twitter fight over Hillary Clinton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe election has exposed how lame the media is,\u201d she said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t even covering Bernie Sanders until he won Iowa. That\u2019s why the millennials knew so much, because they were online. The mainstream media never paid attention to him.\u201d</p> <p>When Variety\u2019s Ramin Setoodeh, who was moderating the event, pointed out that the media\u2019s current narrative said Clinton would beat Sanders to win the Democratic nomination, Sarandon scoffed: \u201cIt\u2019s been the narrative all along. I don\u2019t agree with that narrative.\u201d</p> <p>Referring to the continuing investigation into Clinton\u2019s use of a personal email server while secretary of state, she said: \u201cI think a lot can happen besides the fact that [Clinton] can be indicted at any moment. She stands a very good chance.\u201d</p>",

      "headline": "BHA asked Matthew Lohn to quote for major contract before Jim Best hearing",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-16T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>The crisis over disciplinary procedures at the British Horseracing Authority deepened on Sunday as it emerged that one of its officials had dangled the possibility of a substantial contract in front of Matthew Lohn, a solicitor who has been serving as chairman of BHA disciplinary panels. Lohn declined the opportunity.</p> <p>The BHA was forced to admit on Friday its finding of guilt against the trainer Jim Best would have to be quashed because Lohn, who chaired the panel in that case, had also been paid for other work by the BHA in recent years, giving rise to a possible perception of bias.</p> <p>The BHA has so far refused to say when that work was done or how much work was involved. The Guardian can reveal that Lohn was first approached about non-disciplinary work for the BHA in October 2013 and that he offered occasional service to the regulator over the next two years, giving advice on matters unrelated to disciplinary issues.</p> <p>It is understood Lohn regards the quantity of work done for the BHA over that time to be at the trivial end of the spectrum and that he did not submit a bill for same until specifically asked to do so. He was first approached about this seam of work by Adam Brickell, the BHA\u2019s director of integrity, and subsequently advised Ben Gunn, who was an independent regulatory director at the BHA at the time.</p> <p>There is therefore no question of the BHA\u2019s senior integrity figures being unaware of the additional work Lohn was doing, which has now caused the regulator such embarrassment.</p> <p>Early this year, around the time Lohn was chosen by the BHA to chair the panel hearing the Jim Best case, Lohn was told a complete redraft of the rules of racing was in prospect and was invited to quote for the work of advising on that project. Lohn declined to do so, recognising the obvious conflict with his work on disciplinary panels. However, it reflects very poorly on the BHA that the possibility of such a valuable contract was ever raised with someone in Lohn\u2019s position, who is required to be independent of the BHA in order to carry out his disciplinary function effectively.</p> <p>Lohn has previously indicated through the BHA that he would not offer public comment on these matters and he did so again on Sunday in response to an email from the Guardian.</p> <p>The BHA has also opted for silence in response to a deluge of criticism this weekend, a spokesman insisting it would not be appropriate to comment further in advance of the Best appeal hearing on 24 May \u201cto avoid prejudicing the interests of all of the parties concerned or influencing the appeal board in any way\u201d. The authority promises to be \u201cfully open and transparent about the wider matters that have arisen during this case\u201d after its conclusion.</p> <p>So far officials have not said what will happen to the case of Paul Gilligan, an Irish trainer who was also recently banned for six months, by a panel chaired by Lohn. Like Best he maintains his innocence of charges against him and appealed on several grounds, one of which was the involvement of Lohn. If the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/11/jim-best-guilty-ordering-jockey-stop-two-horses\" title=\"\">finding and four-year ban against Best</a> must be quashed, it appears inevitable the finding against Gilligan must also fall.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/02/british-horseracing-authority-paul-gilligan-ban-disciplinary-panel-independent-status\">BHA defends ban on Paul Gilligan despite clear appeal risk </a> </p> </aside>  <p>Other cases may also be in jeopardy. Among those heard by Lohn since October 2013 are those that ended with bans for the owner Anthony Knott, alleged to have passed inside information, and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/dec/04/gerard-butler-drugs-case-racing\" title=\"\">trainer Gerard Butler,</a> alleged to have doped his horses with steroids. While some of those cases, including Butler\u2019s, involved admissions of guilt, it is possible that those who were disciplined may now wish to challenge the extent of the punishments they received.</p> <p>The BHA has been subjected to especially strong criticism by one of the solicitors who regularly represents defendants before its disciplinary panels. \u201cThis is a completely self-inflicted wound on itself,\u201d said Rory Mac Neice in comments reported by the Racing Post. \u201cThe BHA is an utter shambles. I\u2019m afraid to say there is a real strand of arrogance running through the BHA, where they will not listen to reasonable and sensible concerns raised by participants.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Police chiefs are struggling to recruit enough officers willing to carry a gun to tackle a Paris-style terror attack, because they fear they will be treated as criminal suspects if they use their weapon in the line of duty, the country\u2019s top firearms officer has warned.</p> <p>Deputy chief constable Simon Chesterman said potential recruits were being deterred because of fears they could spend years under investigation after a decision to fire on a suspect.</p> <p>After November\u2019s terrorist gun and bomb attacks on Paris, senior security officials believe Britain needs an extra 1,500 armed officers. But because half won\u2019t make it through rigorous training and selection, police chiefs need 3,000 volunteers to come forward.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/people/simon-chesterman--2\">Chesterman, the national lead for firearms</a>, said: \u201cWe might have a challenge attracting the right number of volunteers and retaining the people we have got.\u201d He added: \u201cIt is not a crisis but it might become one.\u201d</p> <p>A representative of firearms officers in England and Wales has warned that in the event of a determined terrorist gun attack targeting civilians such as that carried out in the French capital six months ago, significant parts of Britain would be left vulnerable.</p> <p>Che Donald of the Police Federation, who represents the current 5,647 firearms officers, said while major cities such as London had sufficient cover, other large towns and cities did not. \u201cCurrently there are not enough firearms officers who could deal with an incident in quite a lot of areas of Britain.\u201d</p> <p>Britain\u2019s police are largely unarmed and officers need to volunteer to carry a gun.</p> <p>British police chiefs devised new strategies after the November attacks in Paris, which they viewed as a \u201cgame changer\u201d because the terrorists used new tactics and displayed greater capability to kill on western territory than previously thought.</p> <p>Key among the new plans was the need to deploy armed police officers, faster and in greater numbers than before in the event of an attack. The theory is that it would take a minimum of three armed officers to confront and neutralise one armed terrorist.</p> <p>Assessments after Paris suggest the loss of life was limited to 130 people because the French police, who are routinely armed, could get officers carrying guns onto the streets far faster than the British state can.</p> <p>This need to boost numbers coincided with increased disaffection among firearms officers, caused by several factors.</p> <p>Chesterman and Donald say firearms officers were rocked by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/11/imitation-uzi-was-in-car-in-which-man-was-shot-dead-by-police-jury-told\">arrest in December 2015 of a police officer on suspicion of murder</a>.</p> <p>The officer known as W80 was arrested by the Independent Police Complaints Commission after a suspect, Jermaine Baker, was shot dead in December in Wood Green, north London. Baker was thought by police to be part of a plot to spring a prisoner from custody. He was shot while sat in the front passenger seat of a car. An imitation firearm was found in the back of the car, on the floor.</p> <p>Donald said the arrest caused anger. \u201cIt had a huge effect. It sent shockwaves through the entire armed policing community.\u201d</p> <p>Chesterman added: \u201cMorale among firearms officers is poor. They are more than prepared to put themselves in harm\u2019s way to protect the public. What they are worried about, in the event they have to use lethal force, is that they make a split-second decision and are pulled apart for up to 10 years.\u201d</p> <p>He said the anger among firearms officers, at a time when they were needed more than ever to face down a potential terrorist attack, had led the prime minister to order a review of the laws covering armed officers.</p> <p>David Cameron\u2019s review was \u201creassuring\u201d and \u201cvery welcome\u201d and stopped the disaffection among armed officers worsening, said Chesterman.</p> <p>He said: \u201cNo one is looking for immunity, but they want to be treated as professional witnesses and not as suspects, unless there is evidence.\u201d</p> <p>Officers are also angered by IPCC plans to toughen up measures after any shooting. The plans being considered by the home secretary would mean that officers are separated after a shooting, stopped from conferring while making statements, and required to give detailed accounts straight after an incident.</p> <p>Chesterman \u201cThere are things in the background that, if we don\u2019t get them right, will put people off.\u201d</p> <p>Deborah Coles of Inquest, which has supported families whose loved ones have died after police shootings, said officers should face tougher rules. Recent killings include the innocent Jean Charles de Menezes, mistaken for a terrorist in 2005, and Mark Duggan, who was shot in 2011 after an officer thought he was holding a gun, which an inquest jury concluded he had tossed away earlier. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>In both cases police use of deadly force was found to be lawful. Under the laws on self-defence, officers need to show they have an \u201chonest belief\u201d that a suspect poses a lethal threat.</p> <p>Coles said: \u201cThe lack of immediate separation and conferring by police following shootings and other deaths involving use of force has undermined family, community and public confidence with concerns about risks of collusion or contamination of evidence.</p> <p>\u201cThe police hold a monopoly on the use of force on behalf of the state and this comes with a requirement to justify the fatal use of force in a transparent manner. The rule of law must apply equally to police officers. Police resistance to the new proposals will further erode public confidence.\u201d</p> <p>Some in policing believe the law should be changed to further protect armed officers, but Chesterman\u2019s view is that it does not need to, although the procedures could be improved: \u201cThere should be a rebuttable presumption they have done nothing wrong, unless the evidence shows otherwise.\u201d</p> <p>London is seen as the most likely target for a terrorist attack, and the Metropolitan police are on course to recruit 300 of the 600 extra armed officers they want.</p> <p>UK military special forces units such as the Special Air Service and Special Boat Service are on standby and response times have been cut to less than an hour, but armed police officers are expected to be the first to confront any attackers.</p> <p>After the Paris attacks, a special squad of counter-terrorism specialist firearms officers has been increased in number and is now organised in four hubs around Britain, as well as a squad covering London.</p> <p>Donald said: \u201cThe challenge is is going to be quick mobilisation and getting resources to where they are needed in sufficient numbers.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Hooray for multiculturalism, global amity and all that. The United States, long known for its intense skepticism toward foreign things such as socialism, portion control, clove cigarettes and soccer, has finally taken a major step toward joining the rest of the world with the first American television broadcast of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/14/ukraine-wins-eurovision-jamala-1944\">the Eurovision song contest</a>, on the extended basic cable channel called Logo.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/14/ukraine-wins-eurovision-jamala-1944\">Eurovision 2016: Ukraine's Jamala wins with politically charged 1944</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Americans have always been hesitant about cultural imports, especially those with the deep undercurrent of camp that pervades much of European society. But miraculously, we\u2019ve recently found ourselves seduced by all manner of Old World pleasures. </p> <p>Instead of being relegated to bootleg satellite feeds or dodgy pay-per-view, the English Premier League has a home on NBC. Bernie Sanders can advocate for the superiority of government intervention without being pushed into the ocean by some John Wayne types with a vendetta against commies. I can comfortably admit my love of McVities chocolate digestives and Nathan Barley without shame. </p> <p>The rise of reactionary Donald Trump could be seen as a response to America\u2019s methodical, deliberate assimilation into the mess that is planet Earth and the mythical idea of Europe that EU advocates are always blabbering on about. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"704ecb06d24ee3b873c1cdea58238dbd8fc90e61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/704ecb06d24ee3b873c1cdea58238dbd8fc90e61/0_23_4635_2782/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mans Zelmerlow hosts the Eurovision final.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mans Zelmerlow hosts the Eurovision final.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vyacheslav Prokofyev/TASS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the time I\u2019m writing this, #Eurovision is the top trending topic on Twitter in the US, with more than 5m tweets. In a world where sectarian and cultural divides seem more and more acute, Americans are increasingly prone to the fleeting comforts of the cross-demographic spectacle. We crave a communal experience to distract from the grisly horrors of Trumpism, Isis and xenophobia. Eurovision promises a utopian idealism rivaled only by the Olympic Games and the odd rerun of Star Trek: The Next Generation. </p> <p>I can\u2019t think of a better time for America to embrace such an unrepentantly corny event. There\u2019s even been speculation that we\u2019ll stick our cocky noses into the fray and compete, sending our most glamorous pop stars to the show to act as ringers, like the basketball Dream Team that swept through the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, for no other reason than to assert our unquestioned cultural hegemony. </p> <p>In a moment when the UK is considering severing its ties with the continent and throwing the entire European project into disarray, the idea that the US would swoop in to claim the show as its own must be chilling.</p> <p>The only hitch in that apocalyptic narrative is that we Americans are not only not wanted in Eurovision, but we would eviscerate all that is unique about the contest with our magic brand of glossy cynicism. As I tuned in to watch the inaugural stateside broadcast, I expected a full HD presentation, flashing adverts, Ryan Seacrest vomiting nonsense into a microphone, and special US-only graphics packages flying in at random intervals to alert the viewer to a special episode of The Big Bang Theory where Sheldon open-mouth kisses a Klingon. </p> <p>After all, Eurovision is one of the biggest TV properties in the world and draws a massive audience in every country that shows it. More importantly, American production values almost always trounce those of other nations. I say almost, because once I found Logo on my cable guide \u2013 somewhere between Lifetime Movie Network, the 24-Hour Corn Shucking Channel and Videodrome \u2013 I realized that there would be no bells, only a couple of whistles, and a fair amount of grainy video footage of a singing competition that might as well have been held in the Capital from the Hunger Games. </p> <p>Logo didn\u2019t send a crew out to cover the show properly. Instead, it plugged into the internet livestream and hired two American hosts \u2013 former Queer Eye for the Straight Guy presenter Carson Kressley and comedian Michelle Collins, a performer who I find to be pretty excellent, all things considered \u2013 to chat over the existing broadcast like the two old men from The Muppet Show. Collins and Kressley did a fine job translating proceedings for a bewildered audience, but they couldn\u2019t compete with the intrinsically European spectacle.</p> <p>The home nation, Sweden, provided the presenters: Petra Mede and reigning Eurovision champion Mans Zelmerlow. I must admit they charmed me, especially Petra, who refused to be filmed not smiling \u2013 an admirable if physically complicated task to pull off. At times, she reminded me of a dinner party host who\u2019d had one too many glasses of merlot and was desperate to keep it together until her guests could squeeze into their Ubers and piss off back home. During the judge\u2019s voting period, she\u2019d robotically ask each nation\u2019s representative: \u201cWill you please tell us who you give 12 points?\u201d over and over again, a bit like a malfunctioning Swedish version of Siri. </p> <p>Mans is clearly a huge star in Sweden despite being overly polished and generic, which, based on my experiences at Ikea, might be a virtue in his home nation. He reminds me of the English pop star Robbie Williams, if Robbie took up pilates, went on a three-month juice cleanse and was subjected to the rigorous mind-control program from A Clockwork Orange to purge any thoughts of dissent. </p> <p>The presenters\u2019 very European-ness was their charm \u2013 there\u2019s something unavoidably dorky about the way Europe sees its pop culture icons. I can\u2019t quite explain it other than to compare it to a very expensive pantomime. Whereas American singing competitions are hopelessly slick delivery systems for cellphone and soda pop adverts, Eurovision, with its opening and closing idents featuring majestic, Champions League-style horns and a lack of commercials, exudes an image of a sacred public service. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9f29b1487ffb2e0d589f9fc031b23743ffc63e1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9f29b1487ffb2e0d589f9fc031b23743ffc63e1b/21_213_4571_2742/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donny Montell of Lithuania performs his song I\u2019ve Been Waiting for This Night.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donny Montell of Lithuania performs his song I\u2019ve Been Waiting for This Night.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rolf Klatt/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s nothing like it in the States. The Oscars have a tendency to veer into self-indulgent propaganda for the film industry. The American Idol finale, the closest analog to Eurovision, was a showcase for the creaky brand of American Idol and nothing more \u2013 a yearly Horatio Alger story manufactured to seem genuine. Eurovision is earnestly trying to save the planet through song, which is admirable in a blinkered kind of way. It\u2019s as though every country in Europe is trying to outdo We Are the World each year, and mostly coming up short.</p> <p>The show itself was not without its share of eccentric characters. The Polish contestant, Michal Szpak, performed a spirited ballad called Color of Your Life while dressed as Gary Oldman from Bram Stoker\u2019s Dracula at a Ted Nugent costume contest. In the judges\u2019 round, he scored a measly seven points, which proves yet again that Europeans are hopelessly prejudiced against vampires of any kind. </p> <p>The band from Georgia performed a terrible track that made me think it was a Kasabian song that fell out of a wormhole from 2006, performed by a troupe of NME writers. It was no surprise the UK awarded them 12 points. They might as well have been from Kettering or Corby.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/14/eurovision-song-contest-america\">If America did Eurovision | Jeb Lund</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The contingent from Cyprus, a rock band called Minus One, performed with their drummer in a cage, as though he could leap out and attack the helpless audience at any moment because of his thirst for human flesh. The rest of the night\u2019s entertainment was slightly more engaging than a cutscene from the video game Final Fantasy VII. Elaborate costumes, light shows, and holograms distracted from the fact that most of the songs sounded like rejected tunes from a 2009 iPod commercial. I only perked up for the Belgian entrant, Laura Tesoro, who I legitimately thought was 12, and Dami Im of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/11/graham-norton-is-right-australias-participation-in-eurovision-is-stupid\">Australia</a>, whose song was actually good.</p> <p>This year\u2019s winner, 1944 by Jamala, doesn\u2019t quite try to save the world in the classic Eurovision style as much as it reminds us that the world as it is is quite dreadful. You wouldn\u2019t have known it from the American broadcast, but 1944 was a highly controversial song because its subject was the deportation of Crimean Tatars from Russia at the hands of the despotic Joseph Stalin. The Russians balked at any intimation of agenda in the song, especially because it made the Russians look like bloodthirsty bullies. Eurovision prides itself on being apolitical and focused on peace and harmony, but the victory of 1944 is sure to remind viewers that nationalism and politics are inescapable because they\u2019re the very reason we bother with silliness like international singing competitions.</p> <p>The explosion of Eurovision into America isn\u2019t going to convince the half of the country that reaches for a shotgun when someone speaks French at a Burger King, but it certainly can make the years of turmoil and strife go by a little easier than if we had to live without it. At the very least, it\u2019s an annual reality check that there is a world of cultures other than our own, and some of them are quite adept at writing pop songs.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-16T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>It takes me back to the 1990s as reliably as the first notes of Wonderwall. In the Sunday Telegraph Boris Johnson compared the European Union to Hitler\u2019s campaign to dominate the continent, and I was transported to the days when Tory Eurosceptics fighting the Maastricht treaty routinely compared \u201cBrussels diktats\u201d to the pan-European ambitions of the F\u00fchrer.</p> <p>Their hero was Nicholas Ridley, who had resigned in 1990 after telling Dominic Lawson, then editor of the Spectator: \u201cI\u2019m not against giving up sovereignty in principle, but not to this lot. You might as well give it to Adolf Hitler, frankly.\u201d</p> <p>In his book The Tainted Source (1997), the scholar John Laughland argued that far from being the institutional consequence of the Third Reich\u2019s defeat, the EU was another means of pursuing many of its objectives. Goebbels, for instance, had hoped to end customs barriers, create a single market and fix exchange rates, while Hitler aspired to sweep aside the \u201cclutter of small\u00a0nations\u201d.</p> <p>Two decades on, Johnson has broken the glass and pressed the big red button marked \u201cHitler comparison \u2013 only to be used in an emergency\u201d. In his interview, he declared that Hitler, among others, had aspired to entrench European unity, \u201cand it ends tragically \u2026 The EU is an attempt to do this by different methods.\u201d I don\u2019t recall Hitler being so keen on national opt-outs, derogations, or measures that excused particular nations from, say, \u201cever-closer union\u201d. Nor can I imagine Hitler\u2019s Europe accepting refugees from war-torn Syria. His methods for dealing with the displaced were chillingly different.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/15/boris-johnson-eu-hitler-bad-taste-bad-judgment\">Boris, the EU and Hitler: bad taste, bad judgment | Michael White</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Johnson would doubtless plead that his point was strictly limited to a narrow continuity: the campaign to unify Europe under a single authority and the repeated frustration of that objective. All the same, a politician of his talent and experience knows that invoking Hitler is the H-bomb of his profession. Indeed, his predecessor as London mayor, Ken Livingstone, has just supplied an object lesson in why it is almost never wise to do so.</p> <p>In January Johnson wrote of his admiration for Field Marshal Lord Bramall, a veteran of the Normandy landings and Borneo, a former chief of the defence staff and a recipient of the Order of the Garter. So it must have stung to learn that Bramall had declared Johnson\u2019s comparison between Hitler\u2019s objectives and those of the EU <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/15/boris-johnson-likens-eu-to-nazi-superstate\" title=\"\">\u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201csimply laughable\u201d</a>.</p> <p>The EU referendum campaign was never going to be bonhomous in its final weeks. Nonetheless, the bitterness creeping into the debate is sometimes startling. David Cameron has declined all invitations to oppose his fellow Conservatives in the forthcoming television debates. Naturally, the leavers insist he is afraid of seasoned orators such as Johnson and Michael Gove, both former presidents of the Oxford Union.</p> <p>The prime minister\u2019s allies maintain with equal vigour that he is avoiding such confrontations for \u201cTory unity reasons\u201d. This has done nothing to dampen the fury of Vote Leave, designated by the Electoral Commission in April as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/13/vote-leave-official-brexit-campaign-eu-referendum-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">official lead campaign on the leave side</a>, over Cameron\u2019s decision to appear on an ITV referendum special with Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader and public face of Grassroots Out. Extraordinarily, Vote Leave warned ITV that there would be \u201cconsequences for its future\u201d on the grounds that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/12/vote-leave-lambasts-itv-over-eu-debate-between-cameron-and-farage\" title=\"\">\u201cthe people in No 10 won\u2019t be there for very long\u201d</a>.</p> <p>It is not every day that a campaign with six members of the political cabinet in its senior ranks threatens a national broadcaster and predicts imminent regime change at No 10. I\u2019m all for feisty politics, but not the sort usually associated with CIA black ops in South America during the cold war. Deep breaths, everybody.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/12/robert-peston-vote-leave-mad-slur-eu-referendum-debate\">David Cameron to avoid facing Johnson or Gove in Brexit debates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Friday I chaired a pre-referendum debate between two senior Tories at Magdalen College, Oxford, that was the model of civilised political discourse. Dominic Grieve, chair of the intelligence and security committee and former attorney general, made a characteristically lucid case for Britain to vote remain on 23 June. In response John Redwood, a former Tory leadership contender and cabinet minister, made perhaps the most compelling pro-Brexit speech I have yet heard. The two politicians were courteous to a fault. Yet Redwood\u2019s remark that the national argument resembled \u201cthe English civil war without muskets\u201d was more than a quip. It was a prophecy.</p> <p>Thirty-seven days hence, Cameron may achieve his patriotic objective, securing the public\u2019s approval for Britain\u2019s continued membership of the EU, persuading us to resist the urge \u2013 as he put it in his Bloomberg speech in 2013 \u2013 \u201cto pull up the drawbridge and retreat from the world\u201d. Posterity may be kind to him in that respect. But even if he wins, the Tory beast has been awoken and will not be tranquillised by a single defeat. On Friday Redwood said he would vote only for a pro-Brexit candidate in the next leadership contest. He also confirmed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/09/eu-vote-tory-battle-europe-23-june\" title=\"\">what I wrote last week</a>: that, should they lose, the Brexiteers will shift their attention to future referendums on EU treaties, as mandated by the European Union Act 2011.</p> <p>For Johnson, meanwhile, the game is on. Cameron, it is true, regards him as the contender most likely to win a leadership contest held in the near future. But that depends upon the nation voting for Brexit and the prime minister deciding \u2013 in defiance of his allies\u2019 strong advice and (it must be said) his present intentions \u2013 to step down more or less immediately. If Cameron wins, the former mayor will be exposed as never before. Having kept the prime minister guessing about his intentions until the very day that he announced he would campaign to leave, he will face a difficult conversation with \u201cDave\u201d. Will the prime minister propose a \u201creconciliation reshuffle\u201d, to heal the party after its bout of self-laceration? Or will Johnson retreat to the backbenches, an unrepentant, still-popular maverick?</p> <p>Never forget that one of his mentors is Michael Heseltine, his predecessor in Henley (the seat Johnson represented first time round). Thirty years ago, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/30/cabinet-papers-national-archives-thatcher-heseltine-westland\" title=\"\">Heseltine stormed out of cabinet over the Westland affair</a> \u2013 an important but obscure issue that had no public traction. One of the next items on the cabinet agenda that day was the question of local government finance and what became the wildly unpopular community charge \u2013 or poll tax. Had Heseltine resigned over that issue, he might well have achieved his ambition to replace Margaret Thatcher. But he did not.</p> <p>Has Johnson chosen his cause wisely? We will know soon enough.</p>",

She was offered that we would be able to get a towel for her if she was cold.\u201d</p> <p>He alleged that Hodgson then quoted the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/dec/09/wi-branch-apologises-to-mum-who-was-told-not-to-breastfeed-her-baby\">Breastfeeding Act </a>and told staff how much compensation she could apply for.</p> <p>Christian confirmed the pool had spent \u00a3700 on an external health and safety report assessing Hodgson\u2019s claim. The report, shared with the Guardian, said that while a woman had a right by law to breastfeed in the pool, an infant may regurgitate the milk and be sick in the pool, presenting an \u201cunacceptable level of risk\u201d by harming other \u201cbathers\u2019 psychological wellbeing\u201d.</p> <p>The report also said: \u201cIt is foreseeable that the attention of a pool lifeguard could be diverted from a bather experiencing difficulty in the water due to being temporarily distracted by having to deal with other bathers\u2019 concerns at the given point in time. This raises the possibility of the swimming pool management being held vicariously liable with regards to an employer being held responsible for unsafe acts and omissions committed by an employee in the workplace.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/nov/21/lactivism-mp-modern-tribes-breastfeeding-catherine-bennett\">Modern tribes: the lactivist MP</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Hodgson could not be reached for an interview on Sunday. But she told the Mail on Sunday: \u201cWhen it first happened, I was tearful and embarrassed. I felt sick with nerves. But the pool board have acted terribly, at every stage.</p> <p> \u201cI felt bullied and ridiculed all the way through when, ultimately, I\u2019m just a breastfeeding mother standing up for a right given to me by statute.\u201d</p> <p> The swimming pool\u2019s new breastfeeding policy makes clear that women are welcome to breastfeed in the cafe, changing village and spectators\u2019 area. If staff see women feeding in the water, they are instructed to \u201cexplain politely that following a risk assessment in the pool and within the pool surround this is not permitted but that alternative areas are available\u201d.</p> <p>Earlier this month, it was reported that another mother was suing a leisure centre in Lancashire for \u00a320,000 after being asked not to breastfeed her baby in a swimming pool while the wave machine was on.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/7120372/Breastfeeding-ban-mum-sues-pool-for-20k.html\">The Sun</a> reported that lifeguards saw Abbie Stocker feeding eight-month-old Eric in the water at Pendle Wavelengths in Nelson, Lancashire.</p>",

      "headline": "The BBC boss in charge of Bake Off: \u2018Distinctiveness v popularity is absurd\u2019",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-16T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>As the man who oversees the most popular show on television, The Great British Bake Off, BBC head of documentaries Patrick Holland can breathe a sigh of relief that the white paper did not allow the government to meddle with scheduling. But the corporation now has to focus on the ubiquitous watchword \u201cdistinctive\u201d when it chooses what shows to make, and that brings its own challenges as Holland says.</p> <p>\u201cThe debate that goes on about distinctiveness versus popularity is a completely false dichotomy; it\u2019s absurd. A documentary like Behind Closed Doors offered unprecedented access to domestic violence victims yet was watched by over three million people, The Real Marigold Hotel was watched by close to five million. These programmes were, in very different ways, distinctive and engaged very large audiences.\u201d</p> <p>He adds: \u201cCompetition is essential to the quality of programming for the audience. The BBC and Channel 4 are at the heart of that competitive ecology; look at the Baftas. I think all but four of the programme gongs went to those two organisations [Bake Off took home one]. The private sector needs the public broadcasters to drive quality.\u201d</p> <p>However there has been speculation that Bake Off could end up on one of the BBC\u2019s rivals <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/27/bbc-great-british-bake-off-as-rivals-circle\" title=\"\">after reports </a>that talks to renew the show\u2019s contract after the next series had stalled over money. Holland is optimistic about it remaining on the BBC, saying \u201cthere\u2019s no stalling \u2026 negotiations are ongoing, we\u2019re still in really active talks. From our point of view it\u2019s very much this is always the case \u2013 we start negotiating contracts for the next series when we\u2019re filming the one before.\u201d</p> <p>When asked if the programme had become too expensive for his division and could move into entertainment to get a higher tariff, Holland says \u201cBake Off can easily remain within factual. We\u2019ll do the deal based on what\u2019s appropriate for the programme.\u201d The good news is there are no major changes to the forthcoming seventh series, which is already in production.</p> <p>Like a Mary Berry Victoria sponge, Holland is on the rise \u2013 coming from Grand Designs\u2019 maker Boundless a year ago to take over the old job of Charlotte Moore, controller of channels and iPlayer and ex-BBC1 controller. Since he arrived nobody could accuse his department of shying away from tough subjects \u2013 from Camila\u2019s Kids Company: The Inside Story to How to Die: Simon\u2019s Choice and Abused: The Untold Story.</p> <p>A year into his job, documentary-makers are keen to hear what his plans are. While the \u201cwinds of change\u201d are blowing outside the corporation, Holland says in his department they have \u201chunkered down\u201d and some \u201cextraordinary\u201d programmes are on the way. Coming up are The Cancer Club (which charts from the moment of patients\u2019 diagnoses through to their treatment), a look at couples having mediation in a programme provisionally called Divorce Clinic and a series about London\u2019s ambulance service.</p> <p>There\u2019s also The Last Mine \u2013 which had access to the closure of Britain\u2019s last deep-pit mine, Kellingley Colliery \u2013 plus a new perspective on the refugee crisis for BBC2, Exodus: Breaking Into Europe.</p> <p>Economic and war migrants\u2019 hazardous journeys are followed by producers Keo Films but also through their own eyes via 70 camera phones given to the refugees, who went through \u201csome places that you literally cannot travel through\u201d, such as areas of West Africa, says Holland. He describes the material as \u201cextraordinary\u201d and \u201cheartbreaking\u201d. Not all make it through and in episode one viewers will see a father struggle with the terrifying decision of putting his family on a boat, which could have the kind of tragic ending that has featured in so many news bulletins.</p> <p>Out later this year too is Louis Theroux\u2019s follow-up to the programme on Jimmy Savile he made in 2000, in which he asks how the late presenter got away with years of abuse and why his victims were not heard. When asked if the BBC will be examined in it, Holland says: \u201cThe film will definitely address the sense of corporate and personal responsibility \u2013 it has to. How did he get away with it and there\u2019s responsibility at the heart of that. It\u2019s a Louis Theroux film, it\u2019s not a current affairs investigation.</p> <p>\u201cHe visits victims, people who worked with Savile, and he asks those questions and tries to explore the bigger corporate question but also the question for him personally.\u201d Sources say that past and present BBC staff are being asked to take part, although it is understood that the former BBC director general Mark Thompson has not been contacted. Holland will only say \u201cwait and see\u201d on who is appearing.</p> <p>Moore, with whom Holland has worked in the past, said in March that she wanted to \u201cbring back the director\u2019s voice to BBC2\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe importance of the director, who has a point of view, is at the heart of the mission really,\u201d explains Holland, pointing to commissions from distinctive directors such as Nick Broomfield, who is making a film about Whitney Houston. He says BBC3 is settling into its new online role. A new series, War on Drugs, will explore the social impact of drugs, plus there are \u201cimmersive\u201d documentaries with Reggie Yates and Stacey Dooley (Yates reports on prisons and a Mexican police force while Dooley spends time with groups such as anti-abortionists for a series about brainwashing).</p> <p>Having Moore now across BBC1 and BBC2 helps give \u201cgreater clarity\u201d and means \u201cthey aren\u2019t in competition\u201d, helping Holland to establish where documentaries should air depending on their scale and tone.</p> <p>Therefore Lawful Killing, a docu-drama about the shooting of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/mark-duggan\" title=\"\">Mark Duggan</a>, which \u201cwas one of the most significant things in race relations in Britain for years [and which was] obviously a massive tragedy to Mark\u2019s family and has had a huge impact on the Metropolitan Police, is a BBC1 film\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cOur core brief is to be making the big stories that respond to the most important issues in Britain and the world through storytelling,\u201c Holland adds. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened in TV over the past 15 to 20 years is that those skills of storytelling have meant different ways of telling stories at the edge of documentaries, so formats, drama-doc have all proliferated out from that \u2026 all the way through to Bake Off which is a format but began life in documentaries because it was about Britain\u2019s relationship with baking.</p> <p>\u201cDocumentaries we see as a mindset, a way of people putting stories, things they care about, at the heart of programmes.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the serious nature of much of his job, cricket fan Holland retains his sense of humour and admits, like many, to enjoying Gogglebox on a Friday night at home in Brighton.</p> <p>The son of a shoe salesman, who also had a market stall that the future BBC executive helped out on (\u201cI love people who are good at selling\u201d, says the man who once oversaw The Apprentice), Holland was \u201cobsessed with David Attenborough as a child\u201d.</p> <p>He got into television on his own merits, writing to companies whose shows he liked until he got a job. A keen advocate of social and racial diversity, he now worries that \u201cthere are huge barriers to entry. Rightfully we\u2019re doing something now and thinking \u2018how do you make it more than token?\u2019.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing that really annoys me,\u201d he concludes, is that when he ran talent schemes 10 years ago, \u201cthere were more black and Asian entrants then than black and Asian assistant producers I see now. It seems like there is less diversity in TV than there was. I say all that and of course now I\u2019m a white middle-class male, I\u2019m everything I despise!\u201d</p> <h2>Curriculum vitae</h2> <p><strong>Age </strong>47</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> Newport Free Grammar School, Essex; Emmanuel College, Cambridge (BA philosophy); University of Sussex (MA philosophy)</p> <p><strong>Career 1995</strong> researcher, The Big Story, ITV <strong>1997</strong> assistant producer, BBC Modern Times <strong>2000</strong> producer/director RDF Television <strong>2005</strong> executive producer, Ricochet <strong>2012 </strong>managing director, Boundless<strong> 2015</strong> head of commissioning, BBC Documentaries</p>",

      "body": "<p>Madeleine LeBeau, the last surviving cast member of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/feb/09/casablanca-review\">Casablanca</a>, whose tear-stained face framed in closeup while La Marseillaise played became a defining image of resistance during the second world war, has died aged 92.</p> <p>LeBeau, who played Yvonne in the 1942 film, died in Spain on 1 May from complications following a broken thigh bone, her stepson, filmmaker Carlo Alberto Pinelli, told the Hollywood Reporter.</p> <p>LeBeau was able to draw on her own experience fleeing the Nazis when she was cast along with her husband, Marcel Dalio, in the Oscar-winning movie. Dalio played casino croupier Emil and LeBeau featured as the scorned lover of Humphrey Bogart\u2019s Rick Blaine.</p> <p>When cast aside by the world-weary nightclub owner, Yvonne becomes involved with one of the Nazi soldiers occupying Morocco. But once she hears the rousing chorus of La Marseillaise sung by defiant drinkers in the nightclub bar, she repents her dalliance with the enemy and joins their song.</p> <p>Born near Paris in 1923, LeBeau fled France with Dalio just days before the Nazis swept into Paris in 1940.</p> <p>The couple feared for their lives after Dalio\u2019s image was used on a Nazi propaganda poster as an example of how to spot Jewish-looking features. They made their way to California and, thanks in part to Dalio\u2019s connections in Hollywood, LeBeau was signed up to the Warner Brothers studio. She landed parts in Hold Back the Dawn in 1941 and Gentleman Jim in 1942.</p> <p>In 1942 the pair were cast in Casablanca. LeBeau\u2019s marriage to Dalio fell apart during the making of the film; he divorced her citing desertion and Warners ended her contract soon after.</p> <p>Although no longer backed by a major studio, she won roles in two more Hollywood films: Paris After Dark (1943) and Music for Millions (1944). When the war was over she returned to Europe and in 1963 starred in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/1999/apr/22/derekmalcolmscenturyoffilm.derekmalcolm\">Fellini\u2019s 8\u00bd</a> (1963).</p>",

      "body": "<p>This whole occasion degenerated into a dissection of the body language of a player who had not even taken part. John Terry, not for the first time over an 18-year senior Chelsea career, took centre stage here having led a rather sheepish post-match lap of appreciation and taken the microphone to address the home support.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2016/may/02/the-season-of-the-fearless-foxes-leicester-city-in-pictures\">The season of the fearless Foxes, Leicester City \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The message he delivered has been heard plenty of times before, except the part congratulating Leicester City and Claudio Ranieri on their Premier League title success. But, as ever, the timing added resonance.</p> <p>Terry pledged that the club he joined at 14 would \u201cbe back next year and fighting for the title\u201d. That drew wild cheers, not for the tone of defiance but for the implication he would still be among their number when Antonio Conte starts pre-season preparations in mid-July, a fortnight after the expiry of his current contract.</p> <p>\u201cThis season has been tough for me, very emotional... Chelsea is my life, as it is yours,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been a big part of the best moments of my life inside this stadium.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"684eff2f8a00f64bb0ed0e4bcb32397e506072be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/684eff2f8a00f64bb0ed0e4bcb32397e506072be/290_718_4393_2635/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leicester City received a guard of honour\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Leicester City receive a guard of honour from Chelsea and the match officials before the final game of the season.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Plumb Images/Leicester City FC via Getty Imag</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The praise he subsequently lavished on Guus Hiddink, pointing out the \u201cgrace\u201d with which the Dutchman had conducted himself over a second spell in interim charge, was swiftly drowned out as a chorus of \u201cwe want you to stay\u201d swept round the arena. Cue tears stinging his eyes. Then came the crux. \u201cWe all want the same thing,\u201d he said. \u201cFor a very long time I\u2019ve said I want to be here for the rest of my career. We\u2019ve had a few days speaking to the club, and I want to stay. The club knows that. The fans know that. I want to stay.\u201d</p> <p>That drew applause not least from a beaming Roman Abramovich, surveying the scene from his box up in the west stand. Yet it did not necessarily add anything new. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/13/chelsea-john-terry-one-year-contract-offer\">offer of a new one-year contract</a> has been on the table since Wednesday, the terms of which are clearly inferior to those being proposed by clubs in China. Terry\u2019s heart will always be to stay. At 35, and in the likelihood of having to endure a reduced role in the side next year, his head could yet tell him the time has come to move on. Perhaps there is still scope to renegotiate the offer. The next few days or weeks should provide proper clarity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/15/claudio-ranieri-an-apology-leicester-city\">Claudio Ranieri: an apology | Marcus Christenson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Terry\u2019s domestic season ended with him being granted the bumps by his team-mates out on the turf. As bizarre as it was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/john-terry-red-card-last-game-for-chelsea\">for a suspended player</a> to draw such focus, Chelsea\u2019s other players were probably privately relieved they could shuffle around the pitch almost unnoticed in the captain\u2019s shadow given how underwhelming this campaign has been. In that respect it was appropriate this was an occasion when the football felt incidental. When the home fans were not bellowing support for Terry, chorusing his name and holding up his number in the 26th minute, they were serenading Leicester\u2019s staggering achievement in wresting away their Premier League title, or welcoming Ranieri back to familiar haunts.</p> <p>The Italian had been met in the tunnel by Abramovich, the photographers neatly placed to capture the oligarch offering <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/jun/01/newsstory.sport2\">the first Chelsea manager he had sacked 12 years ago</a> a warm embrace and congratulations. \u201cHe just said \u2018welcome to the champions\u2019,\u201d Ranieri said. \u201cIt was very warm.

No one begrudged them their glorious equaliser eight minutes from time as Danny Drinkwater belted the ball into the corner of the net from 30 yards. The shot had dipped wickedly just in front of Thibaut Courtois, an utterly fitting way for the champions to conclude a season where they have been 10 points better than the next best opponent. That chasm from the rest is testimony to their dominance.</p> <p>Chelsea only briefly threatened to inflict a fourth league defeat of the season on Leicester, Nemanja Matic feigning to shoot from the edge of the area and luring Jeffrey Schlupp to ground as he sought to block. Matic duly took a touch round the player and drew the contact, with Cesc F\u00e0bregas converting from the penalty spot. Kasper Schmeichel had done wonderfully well to deny Willian before then but, ultimately, it mattered little. This was all about the appreciation of a team of champions, and a public airing of a game of politics that is still being played by club and stalwart player. There will be further twists and turns yet before that matter is resolved.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Danny Drinkwater (Leicester City)</p>",

Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s players needed only a point to finish second but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/15/arsenal-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report\">ended up third</a> and looking anything but a team capable of competing in next season\u2019s Champions League.</p> <p>Any Championship managers watching this will most definitely not be looking forward to next season\u2019s meetings with Newcastle, which rather begs the question: how on earth did it come this?</p> <p>While Ben\u00edtez\u2019s players shrugged off the inhibitions imposed by fear of relegation, Tottenham\u2019s shockingly abject performance emphasised their failure to recover from the blow of losing out to Leicester in the title race.</p> <p>At other times, on other days, St James\u2019 Park might have staged protests against their watching owner, Mike Ashley; instead Newcastle were politely applauded on to the field before kick-off. If part of that was probably about old habits dying hard, a bigger reason was the \u201cKeep Rafa\u201d agenda.</p> <p>It meant that, rather indulging in \u201csack the board\u201d chants, home fans held up placards proclaiming: \u201cRafa the Gaffa. Please stay. The Toon need you.\u201d Such messages were backed up an incessant two-word soundtrack set to the tune of La Bamba. \u201cRafa Ben\u00edtez, Rafa Ben\u00edtez,\u201d fans chorused, with the volume being raised appreciably once Gini Wijnaldum gave them lead.</p> <p>Spurs had begun in unusually jaded fashion with Toby Alderweireld fluffing an attempted clearance and the ball falling to Moussa Sissoko who played in Mitrovic. The Serbia striker\u2019s deft lay-off found Wijnaldum who shot low into the bottom corner from 12 yards. It was the Dutchman\u2019s 10th goal of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/18/newcastle-united-norwich-city-premier-league-match-report\">a season he had started so brightly</a> before sinking into a prolonged midwinter slump.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b33b630826ba1d720f9f0292d94ca6e80d781204\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b33b630826ba1d720f9f0292d94ca6e80d781204/537_0_1300_780/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Georginio Wijnaldum\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Georginio Wijnaldum, right, opened the scoring at St James\u2019 Park as Newcastle ended a disappointing season with an emphatic victory.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Owen Humphreys/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fortunately for Wijnaldum, the crowd were clearly in a forgiving mood and the Gallowgate End briefly celebrated with a few blasts of \u201cStand up if you love the Toon,\u201d before reverting to their previous refrain. Their spirit was barely dampened by the sight of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/14/sunderland-fans-auf-wiedersehen-prem-plane-taunt-newcastle\">small aeroplane circling the skies above them</a> trailing a large banner bearing the message: \u201cAuf Weidersehen Prem: Tyne to go.\u201d It offered proof that some people really do have more money than sense \u2013 there are surely much better ways to spend the best part of \u00a31,000.</p> <p>As if determined to defy that mocking eye in the sky Newcastle swiftly scored a second. Sissoko delivered a fabulous cross from the right and, having beaten both Alderweireld and Kyle Walker to the ball, Mitrovic evaded Hugo Lloris\u2019s reach with an imperious header. Loud as the resultant applause was it seemed bitter-sweet, underscored by a certain sadness. Spurs, meanwhile, had created a solitary first-half chance which featured Karl Darlow doing well to block Christian Eriksen\u2019s fierce shot.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/15/arsenal-aston-villa-premier-league-match-report\">Arsenal finish second as Olivier Giroud hat-trick sees off Aston Villa</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As the half wore on, the prospect of second spot and putting Arsenal in their place receded ever faster for Tottenham. Admittedly they reduced the deficit but the consequences stemming from the moment Harry Kane and Eric Dier combined to free \u00c9rik Lamela down the left were destined to serve as the most academic of footnotes. Initially it looked as if Lamela would cross but instead, from a seemingly impossible angle, he unleashed a shot which beat Darlow at his near post, the ball deflecting off the keeper and into the roof of the net.</p> <p>If Darlow appeared less than delighted about that concession, Mitrovic should have been disgusted with himself for an appallingly reckless high, over the top, challenge which caught Walker on the shin and could easily have resulted a broken leg for England\u2019s right back. Mitrovic even tried to contest the inevitable red card before being ushered off by Sissoko.</p> <p>This being a perverse sort of afternoon 10-man Newcastle\u2019s reaction was merely to extend their lead. When Sissoko\u2019s long legs took him into the penalty area he collapsed dramatically after Eriksen\u2019s perceived interception and Wijnaldum sent Lloris the wrong way from the spot.</p> <p>Buoyed by that rather generously awarded penalty, Andros Townsend hit a post, Daryl Janmaat crossed and Rolando Aarons half-volleyed a brilliant goal.

In recent summers that might have seemed an overly bold promise but on what became a buoyant afternoon at St Mary\u2019s the sense of possibility was tantalising.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/may/15/tottenham-arsenal-battle-second-premier-league-clockwatch-live\">Few teams have played</a> with anything resembling the verve and ambition of Ronald Koeman\u2019s team since the turn of the year and now, with the minimum reward of a place in the Europa League third qualifying round, the chance to build upon a wonderfully bright and talented core looks too good to pass up.</p> <p>That is the primary concern for Koeman, who will discuss his future with the club this week and reiterated after a mildly flattering margin of victory that a new contract on top of his remaining year \u201cdepends on the ambition of the club\u201d. His tone at that moment was serious but there was much more to revel in; Southampton won 12 of their final 18 Premier League games and here, eventually picking off a much-changed but willing Crystal Palace, was further evidence of the elan that might have yielded even greater reward had an awkward early winter spell not given them ground to make up.</p> <p>Sadio Man\u00e9, who has played as if reborn in recent weeks, was Palace\u2019s main tormentor. He had already come close when, gifted the chance by a weak Julian Speroni punch, he lofted a shot into the unguarded net towards the end of a first 45 minutes that had tended to meander. After the substitute Graziano Pell\u00e8, with a trademark hanging header from Cuco Martina\u2019s cross, had swapped second-half goals with Jason Puncheon \u2013 whose clean left-footer was the pick of the afternoon \u2013 Man\u00e9 outpaced Adrian Mariappa to win a penalty that was converted confidently by Ryan Bertrand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e830611f9ad06b9c8591c955ac5aac0102ce5000\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e830611f9ad06b9c8591c955ac5aac0102ce5000/788_465_3673_2204/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Southampton manager Ronald Koeman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Southampton manager Ronald Koeman was serenaded by the home fans, with the Dutchman recently linked with the vacant job at Everton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Childs/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Southampton\u2019s second and third goals were contested by Alan Pardew, who claimed Pell\u00e8 had committed a foul and probably had a point in believing Man\u00e9 was impeded just outside the box. \u201cI\u2019m not saying for one moment that we deserved to win the game but we could have eked a draw out of it,\u201d the Palace manager said, but the regret will not linger long. He had made five changes with the FA Cup final against Manchester United on Saturday in mind, giving the 36-year-old Speroni \u2013 who equalled John Jackson\u2019s record of 388 appearances for a Palace goalkeeper \u2013 the sentimental vote and throwing another bone to Emmanuel Adebayor, who did nothing to suggest he has long-term prospects at Selhurst Park.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/15/premier-league-2015-16-fans-verdicts-parts-2-newcastle-west-ham\">Premier League 2015-16 fans\u2019 verdicts part two: Newcastle to West Ham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Koeman hopes his own team\u2019s future is clearer. \u201cI call this season even more special than last year, with great football, great players and the big support of our fans,\u201d he said. All were in evidence when Steven Davis, finishing crisply after a cute Pell\u00e8 chest-down, completed the scoring to a backing track of jubilation that Stoke City were doing the required job against West Ham.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we did this season is maybe more than the maximum we can do as a team and it\u2019s a big compliment to the players,\u201d said Koeman, who attributed greater squad depth as the primary factor behind his team\u2019s relentless late-season performance. That will need to be reinforced if Southampton, who will begin their European campaign at the group stage if Manchester United lose to Bournemouth in their rearranged fixture, intend to carry on breaking ground; persuading Koeman to sign on for the long term before he goes on his holidays next weekend would, though, send out the clearest signal of all.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Sadio Man\u00e9 (Southampton)</p>",

Those were the headline facts on an afternoon when City secured the point that guarantees them fourth spot and a shot at the Champions League group stage provided they can negotiate a play-off round in the middle of August.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/15/chelsea-leicester-city-premier-league-match-report\">Danny Drinkwater\u2019s late goal earns champions Leicester a final point at Chelsea</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is not the way that City envisage gaining entry to Europe\u2019s premier club competition and the celebrations among the travelling supporters at the final whistle were probably a mixture of relief at keeping that door open as well as joy at their neighbour\u2019s expense, given that Manchester United will be absent guests when the Champions League gets underway next season.</p> <p>City\u2019s players went over to their fans at the final whistle and Pellegrini followed them, removing his jacket on the way before throwing it into the crowd. It looked like a good fit judging by the picture of the supporter that ended up with it on. \u201cI don\u2019t have a shirt so that was my way to say thanks to the fans,\u201d Pellegrini said.</p> <p>It was Pellegrini\u2019s final act as manager and his post-match press conference turned into a defence of his record as he reeled of all sorts of statistics, including the number of points City have accumulated and the number of goals that they have scored during his three-year reign. The only numbers that really matter, though, at a club with City\u2019s ambitions relate to trophies.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been a good season because we won the Capital One, after that we reached the semi-finals of the Champions League, it\u2019s not easy for the first time in the club\u2019s history,\u201d Pellegrini said.</p> <p>\u201cMaybe we didn\u2019t play in the way I like it against Real Madrid. But we finished qualifying the team for next season and unfortunately in the moment that we had to prioritise one competition, we couldn\u2019t continue playing the FA Cup. We were for the third season the highest scoring team of the Premier League and the team that won more points if you compare the big teams. I think that\u2019s a good cycle of three seasons here.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85867f811b319c86245e8b53b4e99e05d2e5b2be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85867f811b319c86245e8b53b4e99e05d2e5b2be/143_244_2957_1774/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Andr\u00e9 Ayew\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Andr\u00e9 Ayew equalised with a deflected strike for Swansea City to set up a tense finish at the Liberty Stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Geoff Caddick/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ultimately it feels like City have underachieved this season, although in Pellegrini\u2019s defence it was a strange situation that he found himself in when the club announced on 1 February that Guardiola would be replacing him as manager on 1 July.</p> <p>City were second in the table, three points behind Leicester City at the time \u2013 and it is difficult to know how big an impact, if any, that decision had on the manager and his players.</p> <p>The requirement for Pellegrini and his players in south Wales on Sunday was straightforward and although the scoreline suggests that City could have been vulnerable to missing out on a place in the top four, Swansea never really liked getting a winner.</p> <p>Pellegrini\u2019s team had 18 shots compared to Swansea\u2019s four, yet the fact that only five of them were on target tells its own story.</p> <p>Sergio Ag\u00fcero should have scored the goal that would have seen him tie with Harry Kane for the golden boot, and on another day Kelechi Iheanacho could have grabbed a hat-trick. In fairness to Iheanacho, he was in the right place at the right time to score City\u2019s opener \u2013 prodding in from six yards after Kristoffer Nordfeldt had repelled Ag\u00fcero\u2019s initial attempt to turn home Kevin De Bruyne\u2019s low centre \u2013 for his 15th goal of the season. It will be fascinating to see how Guardiola harnesses the 19-year-old\u2019s precocious talent.</p> <p>Despite Swansea being without all four of their Euro 2016 players, who were given an extended break, as well as Ki Sung-yueng, who had to return to South Korea to take part in military service, they played with confidence. The Welsh side had as much possession as City, yet the absence of an out-and-out striker \u2013 Andr\u00e9 Ayew was dropping deep and playing almost like a false nine \u2013 meant that too many neat passages of play came to nothing. Swansea did have the ball in the net shortly after Iheanacho scored but Mike Dean penalised Jefferson Montero for pushing Bacary Sagna.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/14/manchester-united-city-fourth-battle-champions-league\">May the fourth be with you: United and City in final-day battle of Manchester | Paul Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whatever the rights and wrongs of that decision, good fortune was not smiling on Pellegrini\u2019s side at the end of the first half. After a couple of free-kick routines that went horribly wrong and looked like they had been planned on the back of a fag packet, Swansea equalised from a set piece in first-half injury time. Ayew\u2019s left-footed shot deflected off the head of Fernando, who was stood in the wall, and flew into the opposite top corner, leaving Joe Hart stranded.</p> <p>City played with greater intensity after the break. Eliaquim Mangala profligately headed De Bruyne\u2019s cross over the bar and five minutes later the ball broke kindly to Iheanacho, only for it to get stuck between his feet and wriggle out the wrong side. Ag\u00fcero, who had been denied by Nordfeldt in the first half, then dragged a bouncing ball well wide.</p> <p>Although Federico Fern\u00e1ndez sent a free header wide, Swansea rarely looked like troubling City in the second half, when the sight of Wilfried Bony warming up for the visitors prompted the home supporters to serenade a striker they would love to have back at the Liberty Stadium next season. Whether that happens or not, Swansea will be glad to put this chaotic campaign behind them and welcome the chance to regroup.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Jack Cork (Swansea)</p>",

      "body": "<p>If West Ham United\u2019s failure to secure their place in Europe needs to be put into perspective, then it is worth remembering that it was five years to the day since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/may/15/avram-grant-sacked-west-ham-united-manager\">Avram Grant was sacked in the tunnel</a> at the DW Stadium after relegation to the Championship was confirmed by a 3-2 defeat against Wigan Athletic.</p> <p>A banner in the away end at the Britannia Stadium, given a rousing send-off by Stoke City before Bet365 takes over the naming rights, captured the overriding mood of positivity amongst West Ham\u2019s supporters. \u201cBe careful what you wish for,\u201d it read, a wry reference to all those grave warnings about the dangers of letting go of Sam Allardyce last summer, and it is impossible to regard Slaven Bilic\u2019s debut season as anything other than a success bearing in mind that even his bosses regarded his appointment as a gamble.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/15/swansea-city-manchester-city-premier-league-match-report\">Manchester City draw at Swansea City to all-but ensure top-four finish</a> </p> </aside>  <p>West Ham have finished in their best position in 14 years, achieved their highest points tally in the Premier League and ended with a positive goal difference for the first time since 1986, while finishing seventh means that they will enter the third qualifying round of the Europa League if Manchester United beat Crystal Palace in the FA Cup final on Saturday. Maybe West Ham\u2019s supporters will travel to Wembley to give United\u2019s team bus a rapturous reception.</p> <p>Equally, however, there is clear room for improvement given that West Ham dropped 11 points from winning positions and conceded 20 goals in their final 10 league matches, which helps to explains why they relinquished sixth place to Southampton or Manchester United and Bilic came into his press conference admitting that he was gutted.</p> <p>This was their season in a nutshell. Despite the absence of the injured Dimitri Payet, who suffered a minor foot injury in the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/10/west-ham-manchester-united-premier-league-report-upton-park\">win over United last Tuesday</a>, they dominated for long spells and should have killed off Stoke after Michail Antonio\u2019s early opener. \u201cI said to the players at half-time that if it was basketball we would be 15 or 20 points clear,\u201d Bilic said. \u201cBut it is football.\u201d</p> <p>It was a familiar story. Shortly after Diafra Sakho spurned a glorious chance to make it 2-0 early in the second half, shooting straight at Shay Given from close range after splendid wing play from Antonio, the impressive Giannelli Imbula hauled Stoke level with a powerful shot from 20 yards and Mark Hughes\u2019s side snatched an unlikely win, their first since 19 March, thanks to Mame Biram Diouf\u2019s late winner.</p> <p>Diouf\u2019s header from Charlie Adam\u2019s corner in the 88th minute meant that Stoke rose above Chelsea to finish ninth for the third consecutive season. \u201cIt was more difficult this year,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cWe put ourselves in a fantastic position six or seven games ago but we were clearly hurt by losing Jack Butland.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e76257507c1faf5db7e482817c9f84fd2a09fdfa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e76257507c1faf5db7e482817c9f84fd2a09fdfa/0_282_4052_2431/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mame Biram Diouf\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mame Biram Diouf paid tribute to his late mother with his celebration \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/07/mame-biram-diouf-stoke-city-mother-died-hajj\">she was killed</a> in last year\u2019s stampede during the annual Hajj pilgrimage.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Carl Recine/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For all Stoke\u2019s resolve, however, West Ham threw it away. They knew that a win would clinch European football and the only possible disappointment for the visitors when Mike Jones blew for half-time was their failure to add to Antonio\u2019s goal in the 23rd minute. Winston Reid headed Manuel Lanzini\u2019s corner back into the middle and although there was a hint of handball as Antonio brought the ball down with his chest, the winger swivelled and drove a low finish past Shay Given for his 13th goal of the season.</p> <p>Stoke were on the verge of capitulating in the moments after West Ham took the lead, with the home fans exasperated by their team\u2019s fragility at the back, and they surely would have collapsed if Sakho, who also wasted two clear sights of goal in the first half, had converted Antonio\u2019s low cross.</p> <p>The mood changed when a powerful shot from Imbula, who had a swashbuckling game in midfield, fizzed past Darren Randolph. It had taken Stoke 55 minutes to register their first meaningful effort and West Ham must have suspected it was not going to be their afternoon when Cheikhou Kouyat\u00e9\u2019s overhead kick was hacked away by Glenn Whelan, with the ball millimetres away from crossing the line.</p> <p>Before <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/west-ham-swansea-city-premier-league-match-report\">losing to Swansea City</a> last weekend, West Ham still had an outside chance of qualifying for the Champions League. Yet their lack of ruthlessness held them back. Enner Valencia and Emmanuel Emenike were wasteful after coming off the bench and Diouf\u2019s accurate header was a rare show of composure.</p> <p>\u201cI will be a Manchester United fan,\u201d Bilic said. \u201cWe really deserve to be in Europe. We are desperate.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Giannelli Imbula (Stoke City)</p>",

      "body": "<p>Tim Howard signed off with a clean sheet \u2013 Everton\u2019s first at home since 3\u00a0February \u2013 but it was his prediction that Roberto Mart\u00ednez\u2019s successor would be \u201csitting on a goldmine\u201d of talent that resonated most at Goodison Park. Teenage debutants shone as Everton ended a tumultuous week and season with a convincing victory against Norwich City.</p> <p>David Unsworth, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/13/david-unsworth-everton-performance-goodison-park-norwich\" title=\"\">the under-21s coach in temporary charge</a> following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/12/roberto-martinez-sacked-everton\" title=\"\">Mart\u00ednez\u2019s dismissal on Thursday</a>, believes that Everton have \u201cseven or eight players who are ready now or in 12 months to play in the first team\u201d. He backed those words with action, handing the 17-year-old Tom Davies and the 18-year-old Kieran Dowell full debuts in midfield and giving the under\u201121s captain Jonjoe Kenny his first senior outing from the bench.</p> <p>All three excelled as Everton recorded only their second win in 11 matches thanks to goals from James McCarthy, Leighton Baines and Kevin Mirallas, although the uncertainty around Goodison includes whether the trio will also be valued by whoever is in permanent charge next season.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/14/rafael-benitez-everton-newcastle-talks\">Rafael Ben\u00edtez could talk to Everton but is negotiating with Newcastle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI think they will play a part in the club\u2019s future because they are good players,\u201d Unsworth said. \u201cYou know from seeing Tom, Kieran and Jonjoe today that they are here to stay. I had no hesitation in putting Jonjoe in. Kieran showed flashes of genius and the quality he\u2019s shown for the under-21s all season. And for me Tom Davies was man of the match. He was everything we want in an Everton central midfield player \u2013 all action, good on the ball and quick to spot danger. It was a great all-round midfield performance.\u201d</p> <p>Unsworth\u2019s selection, taken in conjunction with Joe Royle and the first-team coach Duncan Ferguson, was also instructive for the omission of Ramiro Funes Mori and Oumar Niasse. Young potential is part of Mart\u00ednez\u2019s legacy at Goodison but so too is the \u00a324m spent on two imports who did the former manager few favours before this summer\u2019s recruitment drive.</p> <p>Davies and Dowell repaid their coach\u2019s confidence with assured, creative displays. They had the trust of senior players, judging by how they were given the ball at every available opportunity, and were instrumental in the defeat of a Norwich team that brought commitment but precious little quality to Goodison.</p> <p>John Ruddy, the visiting goalkeeper, had saved twice in quick succession from Romelu Lukaku before McCarthy swept Everton ahead. The goal owed plenty to Dowell\u2019s determination and Unsworth\u2019s decision to play the Republic of Ireland international in a more advanced role. The teenager drove at the heart of the Norwich defence and, when the ball broke loose 20 yards out, the midfielder sent an excellent first time finish inside Ruddy\u2019s left-hand post.</p> <p>\u201cThe first goal summed us up this season,\u201d lamented Alex Neil, who could only say it \u201clooks likely\u201d he will be Norwich\u2019s manager <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/11/norwich-city-watford-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">in the Championship next season</a>. \u201cCameron [Jerome] has a good chance from eight yards out, the keeper makes a comfortable save and 20 seconds later it is in the back of our net. It was a good strike by McCarthy but you\u2019ve got to look at how it\u2019s got there.\u201d</p> <p>Nathan Redmond and Matt Jarvis both put decent chances to equalise over Howard\u2019s crossbar. The veteran goalkeeper was making his 414th and final appearance for Everton after a decade at the club. A clean sheet and an emotional farewell to the Gwladys Street provided the perfect send-off for his move to Colorado Rapids.</p> <p>Unsworth\u2019s side doubled their lead, somewhat fortuitously, when Romelu Lukaku collapsed inside the Norwich area following slight contact from Robbie Brady. Goodison erupted with ironic cheers when Leighton Baines stepped forward to take the penalty having had the responsibility removed under Mart\u00ednez. Baines duly sent Ruddy the wrong way from 12 yards. \u201cIt was really soft and changed the dynamic of the game,\u201d Neil claimed.</p> <p>Everton\u2019s third was a rewarding moment for the club\u2019s academy, Unsworth included. The tenacious Davies regained possession with a strong tackle in central midfield, Dowell released Kenny down the right and when the full-back\u2019s cross deflected across the Norwich goalmouth, Kevin Mirallas was unmarked to convert at the back post.</p> <p>Dowell had a brief spell in his favoured playmaker\u2019s role as Unsworth shifted to a 4-4-1-1. His awareness and his accurate left foot had Goodison purring before he departed to a deserved standing ovation when replaced by Ross Barkley. The future appears both bright and blurred for Everton.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Tom Davies (Everton)</p>",

      "body": "<p>Two goals wrongly disallowed, one questionable penalty conceded and Sam Allardyce still ended the game with a smile and a wave. This was a world removed from the great majority of Sunderland\u2019s season, a day in which the sun shone, the fans sung incessantly and the manager could make nine changes, give debuts to three promising young players, leave the man credited with single-handedly saving their top-flight status, Jermain Defoe, on the bench and still enjoy a convincing, and very nearly match-winning, performance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/15/manchester-united-abandon-final-premier-league-game-after-security-alert-leads-to-old-trafford-evacuation\">Controlled explosion at Old Trafford after Manchester United abandon final game</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Allardyce was too relieved to criticise the match officials furiously, although he did appear tempted. \u201cWe\u2019re very glad those decisions had no bearing on where we finished in the league,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we\u2019d needed three points today we\u2019d have been in serious trouble, with offsides we didn\u2019t think were offside and a penalty we didn\u2019t think was a penalty.\u201d</p> <p>He explained his team selection by saying: \u201cThe players who worked so hard to get us safe had no need to come out and exert themselves any more, and put themselves through the mill.\u201d However, the decision to field a starting XI featuring a left flank, in the left-back Tom Robson and the winger Rees Greenwood, populated entirely by 20-year-old debutants, carried with it a risk that a wildly promising conclusion to the season would end on a slightly downhearted note. Instead, they offered only further encouragement.</p> <p>\u201cThese were 11 players who don\u2019t play on a regular basis, yet they matched a Watford side that was at full-strength on their own ground,\u201d Allardyce said. \u201cIf you consider we averaged two points per game over the last six games, that\u2019s top-six stuff. If we can start where we\u2019ve left off, we can have a better season than this one. Next season let\u2019s get 12 points from the first six games, not the last six.\u201d</p> <p>Watford\u2019s season, on the other hand, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/08/everton-watford-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">ended precisely as it began</a>: with a 2-2 draw. For all their reliance on the match officials, they fashioned many more opportunities than their opponents, ending with a 21-6 advantage on shots taken, although many of them were sent from distance either into the hands of Jordan Pickford or, more frequently, into the crowd.</p> <p>Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores ended <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/13/watford-part-company-quique-sanchez-flores\" title=\"\">his final match as Watford manager</a> \u201ccompletely happy\u201d \u2013 both with the game and his single season in charge. \u201cI think the first year [after promotion] is the most difficult year,\u201d he said. \u201cTo build a squad in pre-season was completely difficult because players want security and Watford was new in the division. Watford is now established in the Premier League, so next year is coming more players, more quality.\u201d</p> <p>The home side made the better start, with Almen Abdi, Sebastian Pr\u00f6dl, Odion Ighalo and Jos\u00e9 Manuel Jurado coming close in the opening half-hour, but Sunderland proved much more clinical, scoring from their first significant opportunity. Pr\u00f6dl\u2019s slip on the halfway line allowed Dame N\u2019Doye to run unhindered down the left before passing inside to Jeremain Lens, whose drive was well saved. The ball was immediately worked back to Lens and this time his low centre was turned into a now totally exposed goal by Jack Rodwell.</p> <p>From there, Sunderland could have had the game won by half-time. Two minutes later Duncan Watmore had a goal disallowed, even though Nathan Ak\u00e9 appeared to have played him onside, and two minutes after that N\u2019Doye was denied a fine chance by Pr\u00f6dl\u2019s last-ditch challenge.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5ab6d1e78012069a5cbbbe491b7e2d5c47d5dc86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ab6d1e78012069a5cbbbe491b7e2d5c47d5dc86/619_59_2921_1753/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Quique Sanchez Flores\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores acknowledges the fans at the end of his last game in charge of Watford.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Three minutes after the break Watford equalised, Pr\u00f6dl heading in Adl\u00e8ne Guedioura\u2019s corner, though he appeared to shove his marker, John O\u2019Shea, out of the way first. When Watford won another corner two minutes later O\u2019Shea wasn\u2019t taking any chances, with both arms around the giant Austrian defender as the ball came in. It was cleared, Sunderland broke and moments later Watmore played in Lens, who turned inside Ak\u00e9 and scored from 10 yards.</p> <p>Sunderland might have felt those two incidents evened themselves out but eight minutes later they were cursing. Sebastian Larsson\u2019s right-wing free-kick was headed in by a diving Lens at the far post \u2013 but again it was disallowed for an extremely marginal offside. Watford took the free-kick, sped up the other end and promptly won a rather soft penalty, after O\u2019Shea and Lamine Kon\u00e9 simultaneously ran into Jurado, the referee blaming the former as he blew his whistle. Deeney swept in the spot-kick as Pickford dived the wrong way.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Duncan Watmore (Sunderland)</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-16T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>This match was illuminated by two brilliant goals, first by Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n and then by Jordon Ibe, but the brightest points for Liverpool were the returns from injury of Jordan Henderson and Danny Ings. The draw meant J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team finished eighth in the Premier League but their season will end in glory \u2013 and qualification for next season\u2019s Champions League \u2013 if they beat Sevilla in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/14/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-europa-league-final-sevilla-basel\">Wednesday\u2019s Europa League final</a>.</p> <p>Henderson, who had been out of action with knee trouble since early April, is now <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/09/liverpool-jurgen-klopp-jordan-henderson-fit-euro-2016\">in contention to feature</a> in that game, and most of the players in line to start in Basel spent Sunday training at Melwood while a largely second-string held their own in a keenly contested conclusion to the domestic campaign at The Hawthorns. Divock Origi also trained at Melwood as he continues his recovery from an ankle injury but seems unlikely to be fit enough to feature on Wednesday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/15/newcastle-united-tottenham-hotspur-premier-league-match-report\">Georginio Wijnaldum leads Newcastle in astonishing rout of Tottenham</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Klopp scoffed at the suggestion that he could be punished by the Premier League for not fielding his strongest available side here. \u201cI thought I decide what\u2019s the strongest side?\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem would have been that we come with other players and they already have their minds on the next game, which would be absolutely normal for human beings. You cannot change this. If the situation is that [if] I come here with those players everybody thinks I\u2019m silly, and if I don\u2019t come here with those players everybody thinks I did not do the right job, then obviously it\u2019s not possible for me to do the right thing.\u201d</p> <p>The German was pleased that Henderson and Ings showed no ill-effects of the knee injuries that had kept them out of action \u2013 for five weeks in the case of the captain, for 224 days in the case of Ings. Klopp suggested that fielding the striker was \u201cabout giving this really nice lad something before the break, being able to say: \u2018I am back and able to play football again,\u2019\u201d whereas Henderson could play on Wednesday. \u201cI haven\u2019t made a decision yet about the lineup for Wednesday but it\u2019s nice to have the option,\u201d he said.</p> <p>After a well-judged tribute by Albion to the victims of the Hillsborough tragedy, sporting hostilities at The Hawthorns got under way, and with slightly less ruggedness than when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/13/liverpool-west-brom-premier-league-match-report\">the sides met at Anfield</a> in mid-season, when Klopp was angered by Albion\u2019s approach. Tony Pulis\u2019s side had no intention of making things easy for the visitors here but it was magic rather than muscle that inflicted the first wound on Liverpool in the 13th minute.</p> <p>Jonathan Leko, a 17-year-old with thrilling dribbling skills, seized on a slack ball by Joe Allen before skedaddling past three defenders and flipping a clever pass through to Rond\u00f3n. The Venezuelan smashed a low 10-yard shot in at the near post. The drive was ferociously struck but Adam Bogdan, making his first appearance since January, might have done better.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6650ddaf625be4ee38fa1d136abb5ef65be9f4de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6650ddaf625be4ee38fa1d136abb5ef65be9f4de/15_111_3697_2218/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jordan Ibe\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jordan Ibe scored his first league goal of the season at West Brom.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Baylis - AMA/WBA FC via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Liverpool were looking lethargic until Ibe injected urgency in the 23rd minute. The winger made Jonny Evans seem oafish as he feinted his way past him on the right and then glided 20 yards forward before racing into the box, past Jonas Olsson, and firing into the net despite an attempted block by Craig Dawson. If you are going to wait until the final game of the season to score your first Premier League goal, best make it a beauty.</p> <p>Liverpool, Ibe included, offered little by way of attacking threat thereafter even if they retained possession quite well for the remainder of the first half. Albion refocused during the break and almost regained the lead soon afterwards, Rond\u00f3n darting between Christian Benteke and Allen to head a free-kick by Craig Gardner against the post and then skew the rebound over the bar from a tight angle.</p> <p>Rond\u00f3n went close again in the 61st minute after another fine run by Leko, who offloaded for Dawson to fizz a cross from the right into the near post. Rond\u00f3n got to it first but glanced his header wide. Four minutes later the Venezuelan was presented with yet another chance but miskicked when left free at the back post. He shanked his second effort wide.</p> <p>Lamenting his side\u2019s failure to win here and ignoring grumbles about the dull style of his team throughout most of the campaign, Pulis declared this a triumphant season for Albion. \u201cYou can\u2019t become blase because you just have to look at the teams that have gone down this year and look at what we have done,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe will be the only West Midlands club in the Premier League next year and that\u2019s the first time in 138 years, so I think that\u2019s something to be proud of.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Man of match</strong> Craig Gardner (West Bromwich Albion)</p>",

And the London and Bristol results show that.\u201d</p> <p>Remain campaigners, including the home secretary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/02/theresa-may-announces-intention-to-back-eu-membership\">Theresa May</a>, have insisted that the principle of free movement of people, enshrined in EU treaties, does not mean the UK is forced to have an open border, because it is not part of the passport-free Schengen zone.</p> <p>But Stuart said: \u201cThey\u2019re stretching the use of the English language: they say we have \u2018control\u2019 of our borders because we\u2019re not part of Schengen, but all we have is the power to ask someone to show a piece of paper.\u201d</p> <p>She believes there is an attitude among many pro-EU campaigners that voters who are sceptical about the benefits of membership must be naive, or even racist. \u201cThere\u2019s a bit of sneering, which is, if you\u2019re voting for leave, you\u2019re probably the wrong side of 60, you\u2019re probably not very well educated.\u201d</p> <p>Stuart also argued that Labour voters will struggle to understand how the party\u2019s leadership can appear to offer tacit support to the austerity policies being visited on peripheral European countries, including Spain and Greece.<br /></p> <p>As the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/08/rioters-take-to-the-streets-ahead-of-greek-austerity-vote\">Greek government legislates for the latest set of tough spending cuts and reforms</a> demanded in return for continuing to receive bailout funds from its eurozone partners, Stuart said: \u201cI find it extraordinary that the left in particular is almost prepared to say: 50% youth unemployment is a price worth paying for EU integration. The southern Mediterranean is in the process of sacrificing an entire generation of their youth for something which may not work.\u201d</p> <p>Corbyn, a long-time critic of the EU, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/14/the-guardian-view-on-mr-corbyns-newfound-enthusiasm-for-europe-a-mark-of-more-mature-leadership\">persuaded to throw his party foursquare behind the campaign to remain</a>, and he launched a Labour In battlebus on Tuesday, which will tour the country trying to persuade voters. </p> <p>But the Labour leader struck a carefully sceptical tone in his only major speech on the issue so far, saying he believed EU membership offered the best chance of collective action on issues including pollution and tax avoidance, but he would continue to criticise the EU\u2019s neoliberal economic policies.</p> <p>Stuart believes her party\u2019s enthusiastic embrace of Brussels goes back to the mid-1990s, when Labour began to see Europe as a way of inflicting damage on the Conservatives. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/14/labour-struggling-attract-working-class-voters-analysis-fabian-society\">Labour is struggling to attract working-class voters, analysis finds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cFrom 1992 to 1997, we became an awesome opposition, and we knew that the one way to destroy the Tory party was to utter the word Europe,\u201d she said. By 2005, she says, Labour had \u201cstopped intellectually engaging\u201d on the issue, and had failed to appreciate how the EU was changing.</p> <p>Stuart had personal experience of the Brussels machinery in the early 2000s, when she was sent as the UK\u2019s parliamentary representative to the European convention, which was given the job of drawing up a constitution for the EU. What she saw turned her into a committed Eurosceptic.</p> <p>She angrily rejects the argument made by the prime minister earlier this week that the EU had helped prevent armed conflict since its foundation in the aftermath of the second world war. \u201cThe idea that the EU has been responsible for 70 years of peace \u2026 tell that to the Bosnians, where the EU stood by and watched 100,000 people die before it took some action.\u201d<br /></p> <p>She added: \u201cThe deal was always twofold: Nato would do defence, and the common market would provide economic stability \u2013 it hasn\u2019t done that.\u201d</p> <p>She derides the deal struck by David Cameron with the other EU member states, saying it does not, as he had hoped, create \u201ctwo different types of country\u201d, giving members including Britain that do not want to pursue greater political integration a special status.</p> <p>Echoing the argument of Michael Gove, chair of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/13/vote-leave-official-brexit-campaign-eu-referendum-boris-johnson\">Vote Leave</a>\u2019s campaign committee, who compared EU membership to \u201cvoting to be hostages locked in the back of the car and driven headlong towards deeper EU integration\u201d, Stuart said the EU will continue to evolve, dragging the UK along behind.</p> <p>She pointed to the Five Presidents report, published last summer, which included proposals for greater economic integration among eurozone countries, including closer coordination of tax and spending policies, in an attempt to make the single currency work better.</p> <p>\u201cThe trajectory of the EU and its entire history has always been one of: you create the institutions first and then you make them work,\u201d she said.</p> <p>She believes the eurozone, which has been struggling to avoid sliding back into recession and deflation, is inherently unstable in its present form, and could either break up, or \u201crequire the creation of a state called Europe\u201d. In either case, she said, it is not in the UK\u2019s interests to be dragged along for the ride.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>Name:</strong> Eastbourne.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Seasidey.</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> About 150 years old.</p> <p><strong>Like most of its residents, eh? Get it? Because people move there when they retire and \u2026</strong> Yes, I understand the joke. But it\u2019s rather out of date. Like many coastal towns in the south, Eastbourne has been getting younger and groovier. The band <a href=\"http://www.toploaderofficial.com/\">Toploader</a> were formed there.</p> <p><strong>Um, yes. You can\u2019t get much groovier than that. I suppose I can see why young people might want to live where they can frolic on the beach, where they and their eventual children can breathe the fresh sea air.</strong> Yeah. Um. Except, actually, that\u2019s out of date as well. Eastbourne has <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/seaside-towns-clean-image-bites-the-dust-fk7n9w2cs\">some of the worst air pollution in the country</a>.</p> <p><strong>What? How? Half of it is sea.</strong> I know. It\u2019s all rather embarrassing, especially as the cover of <a href=\"http://www.visiteastbourne.com/?AskRedirect=true\">this year\u2019s Visit Eastbourne brochure</a> reads: \u201cBreathe it in.\u201d</p> <p><strong>So, what\u2019s going on? </strong>Well, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/12/eastbourne-a-surprise-name-among-uks-most-polluted-towns-and-cities\">according to the World Health Organisation</a>, among all the towns in the UK, Eastbourne has the third-highest levels of very small particulates in the air, and the seventh-highest of slightly bigger ones. It\u2019s at least as bad as London, and fractionally worse than Scunthorpe, which is a big steel town. Only Glasgow is decidedly smoggier.</p> <p><strong>Worse than Scunthorpe! What\u2019s going on in Eastbourne? Do Toploader constantly ride around in a coal-fired steamer?</strong> They may do. I haven\u2019t heard much about them lately. But no, that isn\u2019t the problem.</p> <p><strong>Didn\u2019t Eastbourne pier burn down? </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jul/30/eastbourne-pier-centrepiece-building-fire\">Part of it did, yes</a>, but that was two years ago, so the smoke has probably dispersed by now. The problem is other people.</p> <p><strong>Isn\u2019t it always! I keep saying that, but they don\u2019t listen.</strong> Yeah, well, in Eastbourne\u2019s case, it\u2019s true. There\u2019s no heavy industry in the town, and only about 100,000 people, but they happen to be in just the wrong place, where wisps of smog drift over from London and from the continent.</p> <p><strong>Brexit! Let\u2019s do a Brexit!</strong> That won\u2019t fix the problem, I\u2019m afraid. Smog doesn\u2019t need a passport. Besides, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/sep/04/eu-car-pollution-laws-have-improved-uks-air-quality-say-carmakers\">EU air pollution laws</a> have been forcing our reluctant governments to tackle the problem (a bit).</p> <p><strong>Still, at least Eastbourne is the sunniest town in Britain.</strong> Unless Hastings is. Which it is, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/weather/9022770/Eastbourne-the-sunniest-Hastings-wont-be-outshone.html\">according to Hastings</a>.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> \u201cLet\u2019s attack France and make it cut its pollution!\u201d</p> <p><strong>Don\u2019t say:</strong> \u201cWith special low-emission battleships!\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Charities have accused the Eurovision song contest of fuelling the stigma surrounding mental illness by featuring jokes about mental health during the live broadcast.</p> <p>Saturday\u2019s programme, which was expected to be watched by more than 200 million people, featured a segment, intended to be light-hearted, in which a line of models showed off Eurovision \u201cmemorabilia\u201d. </p> <p>After highlighting conventional items such as a baseball cap as she moved down the line, the Swedish co-presenter Petra Mede said: \u201cIf you\u2019re a really crazy fan I strongly recommend the Eurovision straitjacket.\u201d A man wearing a Eurovision-branded straitjacket then came into view, modelling the item by turning around as Mede observed: \u201cYou know what they say \u2013 crazy is the new black.\u201d</p> <p>There was some laughter and applause from the audience. But <a href=\"http://www.time-to-change.org.uk/\">Time to Change</a>, a partly government-funded campaign, run by the charities Mind and Rethink Mental Illness, to tackle the stigma of mental illness said the jokes were inappropriate and could have harmful consequences. </p> <p>Kate Nightingale, the campaign\u2019s head of communications, said: \u201cIt\u2019s disappointing that mental health problems, which affect one in four of us in serious and sometimes devastating ways, are being used as part of a Eurovision gimmick.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/tahiramirza1/status/731584636606918656\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Why is there a man wearing a straitjacket and why is this woman saying &quot;crazy is the new black&quot; <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/Eurovision?src=hash\">#Eurovision</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/z7yhBRZ5kX\">pic.twitter.com/z7yhBRZ5kX</a></p>&mdash; Tahira Mirza (@tahiramirza1) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tahiramirza1/status/731584636606918656\">May 14, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>\u201cTrivialising mental health problems and reinforcing outdated stereotypes of people in straitjackets has harmful consequences, making it harder for people to reach out for help and support. The Eurovision song contest is watched by many and it would be great to see it used as a platform for raising mental health awareness, not fuelling stigma.\u201d<br /></p> <p>The controversy is similar to that generated when a singer on a Halloween-themed edition of The X Factor <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/head-quarters/2014/nov/08/x-factor-mental-health-stigma-lola-saunders-cheryl-fernandez-versini-crazy\">performed a cover of Gnarls Barkley\u2019s Crazy accompanied by dancers dressed in straitjackets.</a></p> <p>Concerns have been raised in recent years about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2013/sep/26/asda-halloween-mental-patient-costume\">the sale of straitjackets as Halloween costumes</a>. In 2014, the then <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/oct/31/halloween-outfits-demonise-mentally-ill-sell-psycho-schizo\">health minister Norman Lamb urged retailers not to stock such costumes,</a> which he said demonised people with mental illness.</p> <p>Lamb said the Eurovision stunt was \u201cextraordinary\u201d, particularly as it must have been planned in advance. \u201cThis sort of language is just wholly unacceptable and inappropriate in this day and age,\u201d he said. \u201cI think a lot of people have now recognised we have got to move on from this offensive, stigmatising language but there are some people \u2013 clearly including this presenter \u2013 who are stuck in the dark ages. Careless language causes great offence to people suffering and coping with challenging conditions.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2013/sep/26/asda-halloween-mental-patient-costume\">Asda, offensive halloween costumes and mental health stigma | Dean Burnett</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A former patient at a psychiatric hospital who blogs anonymously about mental health and tweets under the name <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Sectioned_?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@Sectioned</a>_ wrote that she had stopped watching after seeing the offending section: \u201cI\u2019d like to be able to carry on enjoying <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23eurovision\">#eurovision</a> but I\u2019m crying that folks like me were just ridiculed &amp; demonised for fun\u201d.</p> <p>Lamb said broadcasters in the UK have generally moved on in depicting people with mental health problems and he was shocked that something like this could still be broadcast to such a large audience. </p> <p>Saturday\u2019s show was shown live in Europe, China, Kazakhstan, Australia, New Zealand and, for the first time, the US.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-16T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Sarah Corp, who has died of lung cancer aged 41, was a rare and gifted television news producer. If Channel 4 News, with whom she worked for 17 years, is identified by the quality of its foreign reporting, it is in large measure down to her vast contribution.</p> <p>She was never seen or heard on television. That kudos went to the men and women she produced. But a TV reporter, or presenter, is only as good as the producer sustaining them. That was never truer than with Sarah. A brilliant example came when, in 2006, she produced a week-long series of live programmes of news from Iran in the darkest days of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\u2019s eight-year presidency. Few western journalists were able even to get into the country, let alone travel around once they got there. Somehow, Sarah persuaded the authorities to let us broadcast from a different city nightly.</p> <p>She fixed the first ever transmission from the holy city of Qom. She had an eye for a shot that said it all. She captured scenes on camera of turbanned mullahs in serried ranks bobbing about behind computers, messaging their flocks from their desks in some of the sprawling religious colleges in the city. Transmissions from Isfahan followed, Shiraz too, and then Tehran. She was setting up interviews with the president himself, at a time when nation states could not even get his people to answer the telephone. She loved Iran, its 6,000-year-old civilisation, its beauty and its complexities.</p> <p>Sarah was born and brought up in Blackheath, south-east London. Her father, John, was an oil trader, her mother, Prue, a modern languages teacher and concert manager. From both she inherited a love of music, and was herself a considerable musician, playing the piano, the trumpet and, in particular, the cello. Sarah was a scholar at James Allen\u2019s girls\u2019 school in Dulwich, and read history at Selwyn College, Cambridge. She sang in the choir there, and went on to tour Europe with a youth orchestra. She continued to sing with choirs and choral societies until the end of last year.</p> <p>Sarah joined ITN in 1998 and started her career with Channel 4 News as a junior producer in the Washington office the following year. She would go on to criss-cross the world. Yet despite the horror that she witnessed, she never lost either her perspective or her humanity. She would hurry home to catch a rehearsal, and then a concert. She was one of the most rounded people I ever encountered \u201con the road\u201d. Her music is perhaps a clue to who she was. No war junkie fixated upon dodging bullets, Sarah covered conflicts because she cared. She made absolutely sure that she understood the antecedents, the issues, and above all the people whose lives were at risk.</p> <p>During the invasion of Iraq in 2003, she not only oversaw the immensely complex processes of getting live and recorded reports safely on to the air, but also ensured that what we said in our reports was right, balanced and beyond the superficial. Even before the day was done, she would be planning the interviews, journeys, drivers, security, food, fuel, and more, for the next round of our coverage. And when the digital age dawned, she grasped it, seizing the new opportunities to go live, to put the viewer in the very heart of what was happening.</p> <p>Her formidable intellect played a great part in shaping her journalism. Indeed, many of us now feel daunted at the prospect of reporting from any of her many and varied beats, from Haiti to Japan, from wartorn Sri Lanka to Gaza and the occupied territories, without her.</p> <p>Sarah worked with Channel 4 News for most of her adult life. She was a true friend, a brilliant journalist and a member of our family. Yet she never neglected her own. In 2008 she married Charles Bates, an analyst with Deloitte; he was both the mainstay and the priority in her life.</p> <p>He survives her, along with her parents and her two sisters, Eli, a musician, and Rachel, a fellow journalist.</p> <p>\u2022 Sarah Corp, television producer, born 24 April 1975; died 10 May 2016</p>",

The inquests found the 96 fans who died after the crush at the stadium were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/26/hillsborough-families-27-year-struggle-for-truth-vindicated\">unlawfully killed and attached no blame to the fans</a>.</p> <p>Crompton was due to retire in November and is not expected to return to his post, which is occupied by North Yorkshire\u2019s chief constable, Dave Jones, on a temporary basis.</p> <p>Jones was appointed after Billings\u2019s first choice for the interim role, the South Yorkshire deputy chief constable, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/28/new-south-yorkshire-police-chief-hillsborough-dawn-copley-offers-resign-over-conduct\">Dawn Copley, stood down</a> a day after taking up the position when it emerged she was being investigated over her conduct at a previous force.</p> <p>The advert stresses the need for applicants to \u201chave a track record of ethically based decision-making and substantial evidence of leading with integrity in a demanding executive role, including leading the delivery of fundamental change in organisational culture and service provision\u201d.</p> <p>It is accompanied by a letter from Billings to would-be applicants, which says: \u201cYou will not need me to tell you that this is a challenging post and needs, therefore, an exceptional individual to lead the service in building public trust and confidence.\u201d</p> <p>The letter goes on to outline the importance of traditional areas of policing such as community safety, protection of vulnerable people and tackling crime, before adding: \u201cI recognise that delivering these priorities would be extremely challenging in any police area in the present climate of financial reductions across the public sector. But it is especially demanding in South Yorkshire given our unique legacy issues.\u201d</p> <p>There were calls for South Yorkshire police to be disbanded or merged with neighbouring forces after the Hillsborough inquests and Billings\u2019s letter appears to acknowledge the need for an overhaul of the force.</p> <p>It says: \u201cThe next chief constable must be able to transform South Yorkshire police and lead fundamental change in organisational culture and service provision. This is the only way to meet the demands of today\u2019s policing and ensure the future sustainability of an efficient and effective service.\u201d</p> <p>The advert says the PCC\u2019s office will hold an open day on 1 June to provide further information on the role and the issues facing the force.</p> <p>The closing date for applications for the role, which has a basic salary of \u00a3150,000 but is likely to top \u00a3190,000 with pension contributions, is Friday 3 June.</p> <p>Shortlisted candidates will face psychometric testing the following week, after which there will be what is described as an \u201cassessment centre\u201d on 14 June before final interviews the next day.</p> <p>The final appointment has to be ratified by the local police and crime panel, which is largely made up of councillors from South Yorkshire\u2019s four local authorities \u2013 Sheffield, Rotherham, Barnsley and Doncaster \u2013 with the process set to be concluded by the end of June.</p> <p>The advert says it is hoped the new chief constable will be in post by the end of November. </p>",

Poldark star Aidan Turner had 3-1 odds while Mad Max: Fury Road actor Tom Hardy was at 4-1.<br /></p> <p>Bond producers have made no comment on whether Daniel Craig will continue after four films, and Craig denied reports in January he had quit the role.<br /></p> <p>Hiddleston, who played spy Jonathan Pine in The Night Manager, played down speculation, recently telling the Graham Norton Show: \u201cThe position isn\u2019t vacant as far as I\u2019m aware. No one has talked to me about it.<br /></p> <p>\u201cI think the rumours have come about because in The Night Manager I play a spy and people have made the link.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this month <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/may/09/double-agents-007-elba-and-hiddleston-bond-at-the-baftas\">Hiddleston and Elba made fun of their supposed rivalry over the role by pretending to fight when they greeted each other at the Baftas. </a><br /></p> <p>In the past Elba has spoken of being weary of the constant speculation. \u201cI\u2019m probably the most famous Bond actor in the world, and I\u2019ve not even played the role,\u201d he said in an interview with the Daily Telegraph last year. \u201cEnough is enough. I can\u2019t talk about it any more.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>The medieval church spires of rural England are to bring superfast broadband to the remotest of dwellings, with the Church of England offering their use as communication towers.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>David Cameron pledged in November <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34753331\">that every home in the UK would have access to fast broadband by 2020</a>, but has since then been <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/05/ministers-halt-automatic-broadband-roll-out-for-rural-families-b/\">accused of watering down the plan</a>. Connecting the final 5% of homes \u2013 about a million properties \u2013 is challenging but the Guardian has learned that the C o E has offered its 10,000 rural churches to help complete the roll-out.</p> <p>It has already provided a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://wispire.co.uk/residential/about-our-services/network-coverage/\">broadband service from 47 churches</a> across Norfolk through a company it owns called WiSpire. Each church provides wireless internet coverage within a 2.5-mile (4km) radius. In February, Sir Tony Baldry, who chairs the Church Buildings Council, met rural affairs ministers and offered the use of the spires and towers.</p> <p>The rural affairs minister, Rory Stewart, said the government was now working to take up the opportunity. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/shortcuts/2016/mar/06/miserden-cotswolds-village-worse-internet-mount-everest\">Miserden, the UK village with worse internet than Mount Everest</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cChurch spires are ideally located in remote rural areas to allow point-to-point broadband coverage. The offer from the church commissioners is greatly appreciated, and we are working closely with our colleagues in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to take advantage of the technological opportunities,\u201d he said. </p> <p>A C of E spokeswoman said it was also working on guidelines for its dioceses.</p> <p>Many churches are listed buildings. Steve Maine, chief executive of WiSpire, said: \u201cWe do get issues from time to time on the visual appearance. But we have gone to a great deal of trouble to design it in a way that does not have a great visual impact and does not damage the fabric of the building or penetrate lead roofs.</p> <p>\u201cThe interest [from local people] in having a much better internet service greatly outweighs any concerns about the visual impact.\u201d</p> <p>There have been <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-norfolk-14734574\">concerns about possible health impacts</a> too, but Main said there was a lot of evidence that the wireless signals were safe. The churches are also paid a fee for hosting the equipment.</p> <p>A small number of churches outside Norfolk have also become rural internet providers, including the <a href=\"https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/what-is-designation/listed-buildings/\">grade II* listed</a> church of St Cyriac and St Julitta in Swaffham Prior, Cambridgeshire, established in the early 13th century. </p> <p>The church, with its octagonal bell tower, is cared for by the Churches Conservation Trust, whose director for the south-east, Peter Aiers, said: \u201cWe concluded that the installation of broadband would be beneficial to the church, adding a much-needed, 21st-century facility for the local community without affecting the aesthetic value of the building. It has helped improve the quality of life in the village, while also providing some funds to help with the upkeep of the church.\u201d</p> <p>Several churches in Lincolnshire have also become <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.quickline.co.uk/news/148/church-joins-connecting-communities-campaign\">internet beacons for the company Quickline</a>, including the Grade II* listed St Radegund church at Grayingham.</p> <p>Many of those people without broadband access are farmers. The <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nfuonline.com/cross-sector/rural-affairs/rural-concerns/rural-concerns-news/government-must-back-rural-broadband/\">National Farmers Union says just 4% are connected</a>. Achieving universal access is essential to run safe and efficient farms, comply with regulation and allow farmers to develop other businesses, said the NFU\u2019s vice-president, Guy Smith.</p> <p>\u201cPoor access to broadband is neither sustainable nor acceptable. We have heard of farmers waiting 15 hours to download a Countryside Stewardship guidance booklet,\u201d he said, adding that the government was failing to provide the infrastructure the farming industry needed to flourish.</p> <p>The Countryside Alliance, which described recent government moves on rural broadband as \u201c<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/05/ministers-halt-automatic-broadband-roll-out-for-rural-families-b/\">very disappointing</a>\u201d, said it supported the use of church spires and towers. </p> <p>A spokeswoman said: \u201cIt gives an opportunity for much needed good coverage in even the remotest of rural areas and, as long as it is done in consultation with the church and local community, we see no reason why it should pose a problem. Obviously it is important that the masts are sited sensitively so there are no visual impacts and believe this is easily achievable by hiding them within the church spires and towers themselves.\u201d</p> <p>Cameron has promised a \u201cuniversal service obligation\u201d for broadband, placing the service alongside essential services like water and electricity. \u201cAccess to the internet shouldn\u2019t be a luxury, it should be a right.\u201d he said six months ago. \u201cWe\u2019re getting Britain, all of Britain, online.\u201d However, a <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/510148/Broadband_Universal_Service_Obligation.pdf\">recent consultation suggested</a> fast broadband would only be provided on request in remote rural areas, with people having to pay some of the cost of connecting them.</p> <p>\u201cIt is unlikely that everyone will want to be connected \u2026 so we do not believe that an additional broadband roll-out programme at this time is proportionate or would represent value for money,\u201d the document said. </p> <p>The digital economy minister, Ed Vaizey, said: \u201cTaking fast broadband to rural areas is one of the government\u2019s top priorities, with thousands more being reached every week. Our plans will give every farm in the UK the legal right to request a fast broadband connection.\u201d</p> <p>A further consultation on the universal service obligation is expected soon, with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://goo.gl/thAQuz\">Cameron promising last week</a>: \u201cWe will be setting out [in the Queen\u2019s speech] the next steps of how we make sure that access to this absolutely vital highway is there for all our citizens.\u201d</p> <p>Paul Miner, of the Campaign to Protect Rural England, said: \u201cRural areas continue to suffer from poor coverage and slow speeds, so we must do more. There have been cases where masts have unnecessarily harmed landscapes. Adding new infrastructure to existing buildings like churches or farm building roofs can often be preferable, provided that damage to their heritage value is avoided.\u201d</p>",

Inhabitants find that they can escape rationing because the district was once part of Burgundy during a conflict that has never formally ended. They set up their own kingdom within a kingdom, defiantly resisting attempts by Westminster to bludgeon them back into line.</p> <p>The mood of stubborn resistance is summed up by one of the characters whose Englishness is called into question. \u201cWe always were English and we always will be English and it\u2019s because we are English that we are sticking up for our right to be Burgundian.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/15/brexit-minister-bank-of-england-dangerous-intervention-andrea-leadsom-financial-markets-eu\">Brexit minister accuses Bank of England of 'dangerous intervention'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Something of this mood has pervaded the EU referendum debate, so far at least. Warnings about the dire consequences of a vote to leave have come in thick and fast. The <a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/economy/oecd-study-finds-britons-will-be-paying-a-heavy-brexit-tax-for-many-years-if-uk-leaves-eu.htm\">Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development</a> said Brexit would be the equivalent of a tax increase, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/12/bank-of-england-keeps-interest-rates-on-hold-as-brexit-fears-bite\">Bank of England</a> said it might tip the economy into a technical recession and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/13/imf-warns-stock-market-crash-house-price-fall-eu-referendum-brexit\">International Monetary Fund</a> said Britons should brace themselves for a stock market crash and plunging house prices. Appearing on The Andrew Marr Show, the pro-Brexit energy minister Andrea Leadsom described it as \u201cinstitutional ganging up on the poor British voter\u201d.</p> <p>One of the leaders of the gang, Mark Carney, was also interviewed on the BBC programme. The Bank of England governor was unrepentant about his public warning last week that the higher inflation and slower growth Threadneedle Street thinks would result from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/09/meet-the-europeans-in-britains-brexit-heartland\">a Brexit vote</a> might be enough to tip the economy into recession.</p> <p>What\u2019s interesting about the campaign so far is that the bloodcurdling warnings about the horrors that will be visited on the economy in the event of Brexit seem to have had such little effect. The remain camp think the intervention of Carney will prove decisive in swaying undecided voters, and some on the leave side privately agree. It is possible that the polls are understating support for the status quo, which will only become apparent in the last few weeks before the 23 June vote, when people really start to concentrate on how they will vote. But so far, the Brexit camp must be pretty pleased with how things are going. The bloody-minded spirit of Passport to Pimlico lives on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f5860e41259d283f17a87a72057dce3adf8b204\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f5860e41259d283f17a87a72057dce3adf8b204/0_110_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Carney speaking to Andrew Marr\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Mark Carney, right, speaking to Andrew Marr on Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are umpteen possible explanations for that. It could be the heavy-handed way the government has gone about things, which has allowed the leavers to portray themselves \u2013 in true Ealing comedy fashion \u2013 as underdogs. As one small example, the IMF\u2019s annual health check on the UK economy was delayed last year because it did not want to be dragged into politics at the time of the general election. Those niceties have been cast aside this year, with the fund\u2019s report used as a campaigning weapon by George Osborne. The initial findings of the IMF team sent to the UK were published last Friday: the full report will appear the week before the referendum.</p> <p>The remain camp also needs to be careful not to overstate its case. There would undoubtedly be a great deal of uncertainty in the immediate aftermath of a vote to leave. Sterling would take a hit and dearer exports would push up inflation. A slowdown in the economy has been under way for several quarters and was happening long before the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/09/prospect-of-brexit-is-the-biggest-risk-that-uk-economy-faces\">prospect of Brexit</a> surfaced. It is not outlandish of the Bank of England to float the idea that the economy could slide into technical recession given that growth was 0.4% in the first three months of 2016 and a further slowdown looks highly probable in the second quarter as investment is delayed in the run-up to the 23 June vote. There would then be a further hit to activity after a Brexit vote. Clearly, two quarters of negative growth \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2008/may/02/businessglossary\">definition of a recession</a> \u2013 cannot be ruled out.</p> <p>But the sky would not fall in. Britain would remain a member of the EU for at least two years after a no vote and the full weight of the UK political establishment would instantly switch from warning about the dire perils of Brexit to ensuring that the costs of divorce would be minimised. There is no certainty that Christine Lagarde\u2019s prediction of a crash in house prices would come true and it would be a net benefit to the economy if it did. Likewise a fall in the value of the pound, which would do something to help rebalance the economy by making exports cheaper. Conversely, a remain vote is likely to lead to a stronger pound, making the imbalances worse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/09/meet-the-europeans-in-britains-brexit-heartland\">Meet the Europeans in Britain's Brexit heartland</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both the Bank and the IMF assume that the economy is in pretty good shape and will bounce back quickly once the threat of Brexit is removed. But as the IMF noted in its Article IV report, the underlying problems of the economy \u2013 the low level of household savings, an abysmally poor productivity performance and a terrifyingly large current account deficit \u2013 have actually got worse in the past year. The Bank\u2019s growth forecasts, which assume that the UK will stay in the EU, have been cut since February as a result of the continuing weakness of productivity. The underlying problems of the economy are the result of decades of under-investment in the economy\u2019s productive base, not the Brexit threat.<br /></p> <p>It is therefore open to the remain side to make the case that leaving the EU is a shock the UK could do without at a time when the economy is not in the greatest shape. This has the virtue of being true and might impress voters put off by hyperbolic claims that Britain risks becoming an economic wasteland within weeks of 23 June.</p> <p>Yet, it doesn\u2019t suit Osborne\u2019s narrative, which is that the economy has flourished under his stewardship these past six years and that Britain will be a land overflowing with milk and honey once the threat of Brexit has been banished. <br /></p> <p>Instead, he will crank up the volume still higher over the next few weeks, confident that the tactic that has been so successful in swaying floating voters in general elections \u2013 Labour is bad for your wealth \u2013 will work just as well in the referendum.</p> <p>But maybe it won\u2019t. Veteran economics commentator <a href=\"http://www.omfif.org/analysis/commentary/2016/may/lessons-of-1776/\">Brian Reading</a> made the point last week that the 13 American colonies were fully aware of the consequences for trade and capital flows from Britain if they chose independence. Noting that George Washington et al preferred making their own laws rather than having them made in London, Reading said: \u201cNo one today would argue that the American states would have been better off remaining UK colonies.\u201d</p> <p>Is Britain gearing up for a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/04/british-emigre-american-independence-day\">1776 moment</a>? It seems improbable. In Passport to Pimlico, remember, the film ends with the status quo restored. But polls suggest many voters are looking beyond Carney\u2019s \u201ctechnical recession\u201d. And that\u2019s making the remain camp very nervous.<br /></p>",

It\u2019s a first step in our Olympic journey,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s just about looking forward to Rio now and it\u2019s important to race the best in Europe. I can\u2019t wait for the Olympics, I just want to enjoy racing this week, race well and race hard. It\u2019s tough to race the best in Europe, it\u2019s never easy, but I just want to get stuck in and relax. We\u2019ve definitely got that buzz and that excitement and it\u2019s starting to feel a lot more real.</p> <p>\u201cWe had our Olympic trials about four weeks ago and have been in that hard block of training, it\u2019s just about racing hard. Sometimes when you\u2019re racing the best in Europe you can surprise yourself. It\u2019s going to be a great crowd here supporting the British team.\u201d</p> <p>Carlin, who will be joined in the team by compatriots and fellow Olympic medal hopefuls Adam Peaty and James Guy, secured qualification for Rio in Glasgow last month with a 400m time of 4min\u00a04.33sec.</p> <p>She said: \u201cWe\u2019re a few months out from the Olympics so we want to see where we\u2019re at. It\u2019s not very often that you get a home championships, it\u2019s exciting to race a world-class field and I\u2019ve got great memories from Berlin two years ago.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t wait to race and having that home crowd support is going to spur us on this week.\u201d</p>",

A substantial solar operation had been largely sold off three years before that.</p> <p>Rival BP also promised to go \u201cbeyond petroleum\u201d and established an Alternative Energy business with its own London headquarters and chief executive, only to gradually wind it down.</p> <p>Paul Stevens, a fellow at the Chatham House thinktank, said in <a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/publication/international-oil-companies-death-old-business-model\">a research paper</a> that the oil majors were no longer fit for purpose \u2013 hit by low crude prices, tightening climate change regulations and wrongheaded strategies.</p> <p>In the report, Stevens argued the only way forward for the companies lay in diversifying into green energy, drastically reducing their operations or consolidating through mega-mergers.</p> <p>\u201cThe prognosis for the IOCs [international oil companies] was already grim before governments became serious about climate change and the oil price collapsed \u2026 their old business model is dying,\u201d said Stevens, a visiting professor at University College London.</p>",

      "headline": "I\u2019ve sold all my CDs. Can I live without those cracked plastic cases of magic and memories?",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-16T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>For sale. 937 CDs. No longer played. <a href=\"http://dangerousminds.net/comments/ernest_hemingway_and_the_six-word_short_story\">Hemingway himself might have shed a tear at the heartbreaking story</a> unfolding in my living room last week. A lifetime\u2019s hoard of albums, EPs, singles \u2013 some of which had been dragged through every home I had ever lived in, many of which had done little more than sit in their boxes once they got there, wondering when I\u2019d finally find a place with proper central heating \u2013 were about to depart.</p> <p>My wife is expecting our first child, and it was gently conveyed to me that assets such as space and cash were likely to be more important in the future than, say, the second album by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/aug/30/popandrock1\">Soledad Brothers</a>. I found it difficult to launch a decent counterargument. Since iPods and hard drives entered my life, the wall of CDs that has followed me through life has taken a backseat. Then Spotify and Sonos came along, and I have barely touched them since. The Herculean task of searching through the rack, putting a disc in a machine, ejecting it to wipe the fingerprint that made it skip through track two and then putting it into the machine again felt so arduous in this new world that it may as well have predated the industrial revolution.</p> <p>And yet \u2026 these were my CDs! Cracked plastic cases that contained magic and memories! Waving goodbye to them was surely going to break my heart. I made a last-minute plea to my wife to think about the lifetime of stories wrapped up in these broken jewel cases. She replied: \u201cNobody needs one copy of <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/3927-make-up-the-breakdown/\">Hot Hot Heat\u2019s debut album</a>, let alone two.\u201d</p> <p>The sorting began. Thirty-five shelves would have to be reduced to just 10. I lined up every Beatles album next to every <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2007/jun/02/popandrock.cribs\">Cribs</a> album and realised that this was almost an entire shelf in itself. I knew I could justify keeping the greatest band of all time\u2019s recorded output, but what about the Beatles \u2013 would there be room for them, too?</p> <p>Working out the rules on what to keep became the hardest task. With the exception of the odd thing that wasn\u2019t on Spotify, none of these things would ever be played again. So, why was I keeping any of it? It seemed perverse to get rid of huge swathes of \u201cclassics\u201d \u2013 Dylan, Springsteen. But I\u2019d never truly fallen in love with them, so I ruthlessly tossed them in with the Adele and Elbow albums I had somehow acquired like Bic pens.</p> <p>Instead, I concentrated on the ones with memories \u2013 CDs I\u2019d scratched beyond repair as a teenager, or albums by bands I had interviewed during my early days as a music writer for NME. They had stories, ones I would be able to bore on about, #indieamnesty style, to my future child as I sat in a big leather chair. The more I thought about this, though, the more visions of future offspring leaping up on my knee and saying: \u201cDaddy! Tell me again about meeting Moving Units backstage at the Highbury Garage,\u201d seemed far-fetched.</p> <p>Maybe, I thought, I should simply judge things purely on an ornamental basis \u2013 that was, after all, the sole purpose they would now serve. I focused for a while on CDs that had a nice sleeve design, or made me look cool and knowledgable. But it was hard to stack compilations of Dutch cold wave acts next to solo albums by former members of Can without feeling like a fraud at best, and an Urban Outfitters store outfitter at worst.</p> <p>And what about the things that were just plain weird? Not many people had been personally sent an album from prison by Jonathan King with a note explaining that he was innocent of sex crimes against children \u2013 should I keep that?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"29c8d0e217e107d8abefb28b6804fff2be636f4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29c8d0e217e107d8abefb28b6804fff2be636f4c/0_871_3401_4249/800.jpg\" alt=\"CDs.

Why bother?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the end, I clumsily settled on a hotchpotch mix of everything \u2013 some cool stuff, stuff with nice art, stuff that felt too canonical to sell, some stuff that had personal memories. Was that what I\u2019d imagined my new-look record collection to look like? Every Beach Boys album coexisting with a Long Blondes promo and something with a photo of taxidermied cats having a tea party on the sleeve? Not exactly, but the CD man was knocking, so it would have to do.</p> <p>As the guy rifled through them, he sadly informed me that they hadn\u2019t exactly aged like a fine Margaux. Instead, I would be getting rid of over 1,000 of them for around \u00a3700. \u201cConsider yourself ahead of the curve,\u201d he said, trying to offer solace. \u201cIf you\u2019d waited another five years, you\u2019d be paying me to take them away.\u201d</p> <p>I watched him box up my memories and helped him carry them to the car. Where would they be going? The guy admitted he had no idea who was actually buying this stuff. Perhaps it was all for him \u2013 maybe running a second-hand CD business was all a dubious front so that he could finally get his hands on that second Soledad Brothers album. That seemed unlikely. But no more unlikely than the thought of two people existing, somewhere, in 2016, who both wanted to own the debut album by Hot Hot Heat on CD.</p> <p>As the car left, I expected to feel a momentous rush of sadness, maybe one so strong that I would fling myself under the wheels screaming, \u201cA life without <a href=\"http://www.nme.com/reviews/7369\">The Delay\u2019s Faded Seaside Glamour</a> is no life at all!\u201d But the truth is, I felt precious little \u2026 except, maybe, possibly, a bit of relief.</p> <p>Back inside, I looked at my new, streamlined collection. Rid of all the baggage, it actually felt like mine again. I realised this was less me selling my record collection and more me restoring it to something curated and personal again.</p> <p>I felt a deep sense of satisfaction about the whole affair, one that lasted right up until the point I heard my wife say: \u201cWhy the hell have you kept All Change by Cast?\u201d</p>",

Novelist David Foster Wallace, in <a href=\"https://web.ics.purdue.edu/~drkelly/DFWKenyonAddress2005.pdf\">his distillation of life and learning</a>, sums this up quite nicely: \u201cYour education really is the job of a lifetime. And it commences: now.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Jill Abramson at Wake Forest University, 2014</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--showcase\" data-alt=\"Jill Abrahmson at Wake Forest\">  <iframe width=\"620\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/uoqsACsDyb0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>We human beings are a lot more resilient than we often realize. Resilient and perseverant. And there are so many examples of this. For me professionally, my heroes are Nan Robertson, a ground-breaking reporter at the New York Times, and Katharine Graham, the publisher of the Washington Post, which broke the Watergate story. They both faced discrimination in a much tougher, more male-dominated newspaper industry and they went on to win Pulitzer prizes.<br /></p> <p>I coauthored a book about Anita Hill, who testified about sexual harassment before an all-white, all-male Senate judiciary committee in the 1990s. The senators portrayed her as being, as one of her detractors so delicately put it, \u201ca little bit nutty and a little bit slutty\u201d. She turned that potential humiliation into a great career teaching at Brandeis University and writing books that tell truth to power. Anita was one of the many people who wrote me last week to say they are proud of me. Those messages are so appreciated.</p> <p>Some of you have faced danger or even a soul-scorching loss, but most of you haven\u2019t. And leaving the protective cocoon of school for the working world must seem scary. You will have a dozen different jobs and will try different things. Sure, losing a job you love hurts, but the work I revere, journalism that holds powerful institutions and people accountable, is what makes our democracy so resilient. And this is the work I will remain very much a part of.</p> <p>When I was leaving my office for the last time, I grabbed a book off my shelf, Robert Frost: Speaking on Campus. In closing, I\u2019m going to leave you with some wisdom from the Colby College commencement speech the great poet gave in 1956. He described life after graduating as piece of knitting to go on with. What he meant is that life is always unfinished business, like the bits of knitting women used to carry around with them, to be picked up in different intervals. And for those of you who have never knitted, think of it as akin to your Tumblr: something you can pick up from time to time. My mother was a great knitter and she made some really magnificent things. But she also made a few itchy and frankly hideous sweaters for me. She left some things unfinished. So today, you gorgeous, brilliant people, get on with your knitting.</p> <p><a href=\"http://apps.npr.org/commencement/speech/jill-abramson-wake-forest-university-2014/\"><em>Read the speech in full</em></a></p> <h2><strong>Arnold Schwarzenegger at the University of Southern California, 2009</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--showcase\" data-alt=\"Arnie Schwarzenegger\">  <iframe width=\"640\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/i5ZeIVPe5dg\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Now, of course, people ask me all the time, they say to me: \u201cWhat is the secret to success?\u201d And I give them, always, the short version. I say, \u201cNumber one, come to America. Number two, work your butt off. And number three, marry a Kennedy.\u201d<br /></p> <p>And what I mean by that is, so many young people are getting so much advice from their parents and from their teachers and from everyone. But what is most important is that you have to dig deep down, dig deep down and ask yourselves, who do you want to be? Not what, but who.</p> <p>I was lucky growing up because I did not have television, didn\u2019t have telephones, I didn\u2019t have the computers and the iPods. And, of course, Twitter was then something that birds did outside the window. I didn\u2019t have all these distractions and all this.</p> <p>And I recognized very quickly that inside my head and heart were a burning desire to leave my small village in Austria \u2013 not that there was something wrong with Austria, it\u2019s a beautiful country. But I wanted to leave that little place and I wanted to be part of something big, the United States of America, a powerful nation, the place where dreams can come true.</p> <p>I knew when I came over here I could realize my dreams. And I decided that the best way for me to come to America was to become a bodybuilding champion, because I knew that was the ticket the instant that I saw a magazine cover of my idol, Reg Park. He was Mr Universe, he was starring in Hercules movies, he looked strong and powerful, he was so confident.</p> <p>So when I found out how he got that way, I became obsessed, and I went home and I said to my family, \u201cI want to be a bodybuilding champion.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/09/obama-howard-university-speech-activism\">Activists on Obama's speech to Howard graduates: 'It's one for the ages'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Now, you can imagine how that went over in my home in Austria. My parents, they couldn\u2019t believe it. They would have been just happy if I would have become a police officer like my father, or married someone like Heidi, had a bunch of kids and run around like the Von Trapp family in The Sound of Music.</p> <p>The things that the agents said would be totally a detriment and would make it impossible for me to get a job all of a sudden became an asset for me \u2013 all of those things: my accent, my body and everything.</p> <p>So it just shows to you: never listen to that you can\u2019t do something. And: \u201cYou have to work your way up, of course, run for something else first.\u201d I mean, it was the same when I ran for governor, the same lines, that you have to work your way up \u2013 it can\u2019t be done. And then, of course, I ran for governor and the rest, of course, is history.</p> <p>They said you have to start with a small job as mayor and then as assemblyman and then as lieutenant governor and then as governor. And they said that\u2019s the way it works in a political career. I said, \u201cI\u2019m not interested in a political career. I want to be a public servant. I want to fix California\u2019s problems and bring people together and bring the parties together.\u201d</p> <p>So, like I said, I decided to run. I didn\u2019t pay attention to the rules. And I made it and the rest is history.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.graduationwisdom.com/speeches/0067-schwarzenegger.htm\"><em>Read the speech in full</em></a></p> <h2><strong>Gloria Steinem at Tufts University, 1987</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b4a7a875846977e2866acb0581398dfb35911f5c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4a7a875846977e2866acb0581398dfb35911f5c/0_0_3600_2159/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gloria Steinem\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gloria Steinem.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BFAnyc.com/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A person who has experienced something is almost always far more expert on it than are the experts. A corollary is that any process including only experts, with no contribution from those with personal experience, will probably go wrong. An extension is that our educational system is long on book learning, but short on apprenticeship. A further extension is that our social policy is long on theorists, and short on organizers.<br /></p> <p>For a personal example: I wish someone had warned me that book learning, as valuable and irreplaceable as it may be, can also make you self-critical, reverential and otherwise fearful of acting. (Of course, this is especially true if you are female, or a different race or ethnicity, and nobody in the books looks like you \u2013 but I hope you have had more inclusive textbooks than I did.)</p> <p>So whatever you want to do, just do it. Don\u2019t worry about making a damn fool of yourself. Making a damn fool of yourself is absolutely essential. And you will have a great time.</p> <p>Politics is not just what goes on in the electoral system, or in Washington. Politics is any power relationship in our daily lives. Anytime one human being is habitually powerful over another, or one group over another, not because of talent or experience, but just because of race, or sex or class \u2013 that\u2019s politics. So when we look at the fields of your state and mind, and see that one color of human beings owns them, and another color works on them as migrant labor, that\u2019s politics. When we find a hundred of one kind of human being in the typing pool, and a few of another in the boardroom, that\u2019s politics. When children have only their father\u2019s name, that\u2019s politics. When most men have only one job, while most women have two \u2013 one inside the home and one outside it \u2013 that\u2019s politics, too. And when students of color are still in smaller proportion than are people of color in the population, or women are a lesser percentage of dentists and engineers, or men a lesser proportion of physical therapists and nutritionists, that\u2019s politics.<br /></p> <p>For both women and men, progress probably lies in the direction we haven\u2019t been. For women, it may lie in becoming more active in public life. For men, it may lie in playing a real part of private life. But for both, the pleasure and reward is becoming a whole human being.<br /></p> <p>I wish I had realized this earlier. It means progress is not always a straight line, in which we must defeat or outstrip others and there is only one winner. Progress is a circle in which we strive to use all our talents and complete ourselves. Potentially, we are all winners.</p> <p>It is time to carry out the greatest mission and legacy of our culture: that we are the world\u2019s biggest experiment in multicultural and multiracial living. Our fragile planet needs to learn exactly this lesson of cherishing each other\u2019s differences. This campus is imperfect, but it is far better than the world outside it, and the world could be much more like it \u2013 with politicians as open to visitors as are the deans in the hall I face; women heading newspapers and governments as they do here, and commitment to mutual support and non-violence.</p> <p>Bigger is <em>not</em> better. America\u2019s military might is <em>not</em> our best legacy.</p> <p>One more point. This is the last period of time that will seem lengthy to you at only three or four years. From now on, time will pass without artificial academic measure. It will go by like the wind.</p> <p>Whatever you want to do, do it now. For life is time, and time is all there is.</p> <p><a href=\"http://gos.sbc.edu/s/steinem1.html\"><em>Read the speech in full</em></a></p> <h2><strong>Ira Glass at Goucher College, 2012</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--showcase\" data-alt=\"Ira Glass\">  <iframe width=640\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/t9HiMoJlpM8\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>My parents, throughout my 20s when I was working in public radio, they completely opposed everything that I was doing working in public broadcasting. Somehow, my parents are the only Jews in America who do not listen to public radio. They thought I should be a doctor. I was a pre-med student, among other things. Their idea for my life was to have some kids and live here in the Baltimore suburbs where I grew up, like their parents\u2019 kids. I hope this is not embarrassing to say this: I had my own national radio show; I had been on David Letterman; there had been a New York Times magazine article about me before they stopped suggesting medical school was still an option.<br /></p> <p>And to their great credit, they changed. I think one of the most difficult things for a parent is to readjust what their kids should be with what their kids want to be. And I think when you\u2019re the kid in that situation, it\u2019s really easy to be glib and just want your parents to catch up to who you\u2019re turning yourself into. And in my case, my parents, they were worried about money. My parents both grew up in really, really poor households, really financially insecure. They saw that I was making no money, and it just pushed all of their buttons, and they were really, really worried. When I was in my 20s, things were said between us that ... </p> <p>My mom passed away a few years ago of cancer, and there are things I said in my 20s \u2013 I mean, we made up well before then \u2013 but there are things I said to her, and to both my parents, in my 20s that I still regret as we fought over what I was doing. I would just say to you guys, as your parents catch up to you, like I think my parents caught up to me with as much grace as anybody could ... don\u2019t be a dick.</p> <p>There\u2019s a show on HBO that I admire a lot called Girls. It\u2019s about what it\u2019s like in the years after college when you\u2019re trying to make a life for yourself. It\u2019s about what you guys are about to launch yourselves into. Every single fact about that show is completely different from my life when I was in my 20\u2019s, but the essence of that show feels exactly the same. What\u2019s great about that show is that it\u2019s a completely unromantic view of what your life is about to be. The young women on that show, they flounder, they pretend to know what they\u2019re doing when they absolutely don\u2019t. They strongly believe things that are transparently untrue. I myself spent years \u2013 years \u2013 in a terrible kind of politically correct phase where I travelled to Nicaragua and called it \u201cNiquragua\u201d to observe the Sandinista revolution firsthand.</p> <p>You will be stupid. You will worry your parents as I worried mine. You will question your own choices. You will question your relationships, your jobs, your friends, where you live, what you studied in college \u2013 that you went to college at all \u2013 and the thing I want to say is: that is totally OK. That is totally normal. If that happens, you\u2019re doing it right.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.goucher.edu/commencement/past-commencements/ira-glass\"><em>Read the speech in full</em></a></p> <h2><strong>Martin Scorsese at NYU Tisch School of the Arts, 2014</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--showcase\" data-alt=\"Martin Scorses\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;iframe src=&quot;https://player.vimeo.com/video/106196480&quot; width=&quot;800&quot; height=&quot;500&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>Any of you, whether you\u2019re actors, writers, directors, painters, dancers, musicians, all of you in different disciplines, but every one of you are engaged in the same struggle. To preserve that initial desire, that animating impulse, that brought you here and will carry you along.</p> <p>The thing is, your position is never secure. So what you have to make secure and guard with your life, because it is your life, is the same pure creativity that brought you here and that brought me here, too. It\u2019s the one thing that\u2019s got to carry you through so irresistibly that sometimes it seems like it\u2019s barely in your control, and, you know, mostly it shouldn\u2019t be.</p> <p>There\u2019s a way that the force of disappointment can be alchemized into something that will paradoxically renew you. You either learn it or you\u2019re undone by it.</p> <p>It\u2019s the work of the old masters, whoever your masters are, really, that remind you that you have to be singular, inflexible, unyielding in your own work so that even the struggle, that very struggle to achieve, becomes its own reward. The hard simple ability to continue is a kind of blessing.</p> <p>You can\u2019t do your work according to other people\u2019s values.</p> <p>I\u2019m not talking about \u201cfollowing your dream\u201d, either. I never liked the inspirational value of that phrase. Besides being sentimental, it\u2019s beside the point. Dreaming is a way of trivializing the process. The obsession that carries you through the failure as well as the successes. If you\u2019re dreaming, you\u2019re sleeping, and it\u2019s important and imperative to always be awake to your feelings, your possibilities, your ambitions, and don\u2019t get hung up on the consequences.</p> <p>The seductions of the rewards are as risky as the temptations of anger and self-doubt.</p> <p>Theodore Roosevelt said, in 1910, in another springtime, at another university:</p> <p>\u201cIt is not the critic who counts. Not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles. Or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena. Whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood. Who strives valiantly, who errs, comes short again and again because there is no effort without error and shortcoming. But who does actually strive to do the deeds. Who knows great enthusiasms; the great devotions. Who spends himself in a worthy cause. Who at the best knows, in the end, the triumph of high achievement. And who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly. So his place will never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.\u201d</p> <p>You may be shy. You may be tentative. And even, at times, you may be fragile. But you have to protect your own voice, your creative spirit, no matter what it costs. That takes tenacity, confidence, and resilience.</p> <p>I still find that trying to weave together into a visual narrative and cutting together two pieces of a film \u2013 two different images. When they come together in a way that\u2019s unique and that\u2019s different, something you hadn\u2019t expected, that\u2019s surprising and revelatory. It\u2019s still exhilarating to me. It\u2019s still satisfying. It\u2019s still fulfilling. It\u2019s still worth it.</p> <p><a href=\"http://apps.npr.org/commencement/speech/martin-scorsese-new-york-university-tisch-school-of-the-arts-2014/\"><em>Read the speech in full</em></a></p> <h2><strong>Neil Gaiman at the University of the Arts, 2012</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--showcase\" data-alt=\"Neil Gaiman\">  <iframe width=\"640\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ikAb-NYkseI\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>I will pass on some secret freelancer knowledge. Secret knowledge is always good. And it is useful for anyone who ever plans to create art for other people, to enter a freelance world of any kind. I learned it in comics, but it applies to other fields too. And it\u2019s this.</p> <p>People get hired because, somehow, they get hired. In my case, I did something which these days would be easy to check, and would get me into trouble, and when I started out, in those pre-internet days, seemed like a sensible career strategy: when I was asked by editors who I\u2019d worked for, I lied. I listed a handful of magazines that sounded likely, and I sounded confident, and I got jobs. I then made it a point of honour to have written something for each of the magazines I\u2019d listed to get that first job, so that I hadn\u2019t actually lied, I\u2019d just been chronologically challenged ... You get work however you get work.</p> <p>People keep working, in a freelance world, and more and more of today\u2019s world is freelance, because their work is good, and because they are easy to get along with, and because they deliver the work on time. And you don\u2019t even need all three. Two out of three is fine. People will tolerate how unpleasant you are if your work is good and you deliver it on time. They\u2019ll forgive the lateness of the work if it\u2019s good, and if they like you. And you don\u2019t have to be as good as the others if you\u2019re on time and it\u2019s always a pleasure to hear from you.</p> <p>When I agreed to give this address, I started trying to think what the best advice I\u2019d been given over the years was.</p> <p>And it came from Stephen King twenty years ago, at the height of the success of Sandman. I was writing a comic that people loved and were taking seriously. King had liked Sandman and my novel with Terry Pratchett, Good Omens, and he saw the madness, the long signing lines, all that, and his advice was this:</p> <p>\u201cThis is really great. You should enjoy it.\u201d</p> <p>And I didn\u2019t. Best advice I got that I ignored. Instead, I worried about it. I worried about the next deadline, the next idea, the next story. There wasn\u2019t a moment for the next fourteen or fifteen years that I wasn\u2019t writing something in my head, or wondering about it. And I didn\u2019t stop and look around and go, this is really fun. I wish I\u2019d enjoyed it more. It\u2019s been an amazing ride. But there were parts of the ride I missed, because I was too worried about things going wrong, about what came next, to enjoy the bit I was on.</p> <p>That was the hardest lesson for me, I think: to let go and enjoy the ride, because the ride takes you to some remarkable and unexpected places.</p> <p>We\u2019re in a transitional world right now, if you\u2019re in any kind of artistic field, because the nature of distribution is changing, the models by which creators got their work out into the world, and got to keep a roof over their heads and buy sandwiches while they did that, are all changing. I\u2019ve talked to people at the top of the food chain in publishing, in bookselling, in all those areas, and nobody knows what the landscape will look like two years from now, let alone a decade away. The distribution channels that people had built over the last century or so are in flux for print, for visual artists, for musicians, for creative people of all kinds.</p> <p>Which is, on the one hand, intimidating, and on the other, immensely liberating. The rules, the assumptions, the now-we\u2019re-supposed-to\u2019s of how you get your work seen, and what you do then, are breaking down. The gatekeepers are leaving their gates. You can be as creative as you need to be to get your work seen. YouTube and the web (and whatever comes after YouTube and the web) can give you more people watching than television ever did. The old rules are crumbling and nobody knows what the new rules are.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.uarts.edu/neil-gaiman-keynote-address-2012\"><em>Read the speech in full</em></a></p> <h2><strong>Seamus Heaney at the University of Pennsylvania, 2000</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"dd4ae7b7621a855274d3318e6b4f0cfc99468245\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd4ae7b7621a855274d3318e6b4f0cfc99468245/0_15_5368_3221/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Seamus Heaney\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Poet Seamus Heaney.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kazam Media/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have always loved, for example, the story of the anthropologist who was doing field work in a community of the Inuit people living up close to the Arctic circle. \u201cWhy,\u201d the anthropologist asked a wise woman of the tribe, \u201cwhy are all your songs so short?\u201d And the wise woman replied: \u201cOur songs are all so short because we know so much.\u201d In other words, the experience of living as a single people in a single place, where each new generation follows the same old paths \u2013 such an experience produced a wonderful, enviable confidence about the reliability and the knowability of the world.<br /></p> <p>But that experience of living in a closely knit, ethnically homogeneous, hermetically sealed culture is everywhere a thing of the past. The Amish carriage now shares the highway with the Mercedes car; the Australian bushman may still go walkabout, but he goes connected up to his Walkman; the recluse in the beach hut north of Sausalito may look like a beachcomber, but he is probably an internet millionaire.</p> <p>Living in the world of the year 2000 means that you inhabit several different psychic and cultural levels at the same time. And the marvellous thing about us as human beings is that we have been provided with a whole system of intellectual and imaginative elevators that whisk us from floor to floor, at will and on whim ...</p> <p>There is a dreamlike quality to every commencement day. But the veil trembles more mysteriously if you are graduating in the year 2000. It makes you wonder if the date is a destiny or an accident. A turning point in your life has coincided with a turning point in our era. It is like the moment when a tide has risen to its highest and then rests: everything is at the full and yet everything is volatile. And for the duration of this moment, you are held between two worlds. It\u2019s like those few seconds when you pause and hold the pose, and are photographed standing between your parents and your professors ...</p> <p>You stand between whatever binds you to your past and whatever might be unbounded in your future.</p> <p>One kind of wisdom says, \u201ckeep your feet on the ground. Be faithful to the ancestors.\u201d</p> <p>Remember the short songs of the wise woman. Another says: lift up your eyes. Spread your wings. Don\u2019t renege on the other world you have been shown.</p> <p>All of you are likely to be caught between these conflicting wisdoms, and indeed you are unlikely ever to be able to choose confidently between them, now or in the future. And so my advice to you is to understand that this in-between condition is not to be regarded as a disabling confusion but that it is rather a necessary state, a consequence of our situation between earthly origin and angelic potential.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/current/node/1003\"><em>Read the speech in full</em></a></p> <h2><strong>Vaclav Havel at Harvard University, 1995</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3133d3f290b23ae38c1c0c1e6524f5825c437e07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3133d3f290b23ae38c1c0c1e6524f5825c437e07/0_0_2562_1537/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vaclav Havel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former Czech Republic President Vaclav Havel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David W Cerny / Reuters/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is my belief that this state of affairs contains a clear challenge not only to the Euro-American world but to our present-day civilization as a whole. It is a challenge to this civilization to start understanding itself as a multicultural and a multi-polar civilization, whose meaning lies not in undermining the individuality of different spheres of culture and civilization but in allowing them to be more completely themselves. This will only be possible, even conceivable, if we all accept a basic code of mutual coexistence, a kind of common minimum we can all share, one that will enable us to go on living side by side. Yet such a code won\u2019t stand a chance if it is merely the product of a few who proceed to force it on the rest. It must be an expression of the authentic will of everyone, growing out of the genuine spiritual roots hidden beneath the skin of our common, global civilization. If it is merely disseminated through the capillaries of the skin, the way Coca-Cola ads are \u2013 as a commodity offered by some to others \u2013 such a code can hardly be expected to take hold in any profound or universal way.<strong><br /></strong></p> <p>The veneer of global civilization that envelops the modern world and the consciousness of humanity, as we all know, has a dual nature, bringing into question, at every step of the way, the very values it is based upon, or which it propagates. The thousands of marvellous achievements of this civilization that work for us so well and enrich us can equally impoverish, diminish, and destroy our lives, and frequently do. Instead of serving people, many of these creations enslave them. Instead of helping people to develop their identities, they take them away. Almost every invention or discovery \u2013 from the splitting of the atom and the discovery of DNA to television and the computer \u2013 can be turned against us and used to our detriment. How much easier it is today than it was during the first world war to destroy an entire metropolis in a single air raid? And how much easier would it be today, in the era of television, for a madman like Hitler or Stalin to pervert the spirit of a whole nation? When have people ever had the power we now possess to alter the climate of the planet or deplete its mineral resources or the wealth of its fauna and flora in the space of a few short decades? And how much more destructive potential do terrorists have at their disposal today than at the beginning of this century.</p> <p>I do not believe in some universal key or panacea. I am not an advocate of what Karl Popper called \u201cholistic social engineering\u201d, particularly because I had to live most of my adult life in circumstances that resulted from an attempt to create a holistic Marxist utopia. I know more than enough, therefore, about efforts of this kind.</p> <p>This does not relieve me, however, of the responsibility to think of ways to make the world better.<br /></p> <p>Even in the most democratic of conditions, politicians have immense influence, perhaps more than they themselves realize. This influence does not lie in their actual mandates, which in any case are considerably limited. It lies in something else: in the spontaneous impact their charisma has on the public.</p> <p>The main task of the present generation of politicians is not, I think to ingratiate themselves with the public through the decisions they take or their smiles on television. It is not to go on winning elections and ensuring themselves a place in the sun till the end of their days. Their role is something quite different: to assume their share of responsibility for the long-range prospects of our world and thus to set an example for the public in whose sight they work.</p> <p>Their responsibility is to think ahead boldly, not to fear the disfavor of the crowd, to imbue their actions with a spiritual dimension (which of course is not the same thing as ostentatious attendance at religious services), to explain again and again \u2013 both to the public and to their colleagues \u2013 that politics must do far more than reflect the interests of particular groups or lobbies. After all, politics is a matter of servicing the community, which means that it is morality in practice. And how better to serve the community and practice morality than by seeking in the midst of the global (and globally threatened) civilization their own global political responsibility: that is, their responsibility for the very survival of the human race?</p> <p>I don\u2019t believe that a politician who sets out on this risky path will inevitably jeopardize his or her political survival. This is a wrongheaded notion which assumes that the citizen is a fool and that political success depends on playing to this folly. That is not the way it is. A conscience slumbers in every human being, something divine. And that is what we have to put our trust in.</p> <p><a href=\"http://apps.npr.org/commencement/speech/vaclav-havel-harvard-university-1995/\"><em>Read the speech in full</em></a></p> <h2><strong>Melissa Harris-Perry, Wellesley College, 2012</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-embed element--showcase\" data-alt=\"Melissa Harris-Perry\">  <iframe width=\"640\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3KSlJRUT88E\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>If you\u2019ve read The Velveteen Principles, then you know that everything that you need to know about how to have an authentic, successful life is actually conveyed in the book The Velveteen Rabbit.</p> <p>I thought, I\u2019ll do a little riff on Mo Willems with The Pigeon Principles series. You know the Pigeon books? Don\u2019t Let the Pigeon Stay Up Late. Don\u2019t Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus. (I\u2019m sorry, I have a 10-year-old; this is what I read.) At first glance Pigeon is selfish and whiny, manipulative ... but if you read the pigeon with love, we will see that the pigeon actually gives us clues about how to be persuasive, kind, adventurous, and assertive. It would have been a great speech\u2014I was going to tell you how to look at your own sometimes whiny, narcissistic self with love and actually find your best selves underneath all that fragility.</p> <p>Now I do have to say, thank God that Kate and Haley said Beyonc\u00e9 before I did. It is an indication that you are truly a part of Nerdland if you too love Beyonc\u00e9! Beyonc\u00e9 ... OK! So after I\u2019d gotten through the great men\u2019s advice and the pigeon parables, I thought, how about hip-hop? I mean, who better to give advice to young graduates going off into recession-era America than rappers?</p> <p>We\u2019ve got KRS One asking, \u201cWho gets weaker? The king or the teacher / It\u2019s not about salary \u2013 it\u2019s about reality.\u201d It\u2019s good, right? It\u2019s a nice message \u2013 you know, pick the thing you love that makes a difference, not self-importance. </p> <p>We\u2019ve got The Roots \u2013 right? And in their track, \u201cThoughts @ Work,\u201d they say: \u201cF--- gettin\u2019 money, for real, get freedom.\u201d That\u2019s a good message, right? Right. Follow your passion, don\u2019t follow the money.</p> <p>And then of course I got to the most important piece of hip-hop advice ever dispensed by that prophet the Notorious BIG. \u201cNever get high on your own supply.\u201d</p> <p>At that point I decided maybe the hip-hop lecture was ill advised.</p> <p>In a few moments you\u2019re going to walk across this stage and you\u2019re going to have your accomplishments acknowledged in the acquisition of a certification that you <em>know</em> something.</p> <p>But even as you accept your hard-won degree, I encourage you to embrace the reality that you know almost nothing.</p> <p>I love my iPad. I\u2019m reading my lecture right now from my iPad. I love that it streams books and knowledge and information to me, Matrix-like, at a moment. Like, toowoosh! Anything that I need to know. But it is important for me to pretty regularly just go stand in the library. It is an <em>awe</em>-full experience standing in a library. I think of myself as quite accomplished. I\u2019ve written two books \u2013 heh-hey. But when you stand in the library and you are surrounded by those stacks of all of those thousands of volumes of texts of things that you know nothing about, written in languages that you cannot decipher, on topics you can barely fathom, it is humbling.</p> <p>So remember, ignorance is not your enemy. Only complacency with ignorance is to be resisted. Never become so enamored of your own smarts that you stop signing up for life\u2019s hard classes. Remember to keep forming hypotheses and gathering data. Keep your conclusions light and your curiosity ferocious. Keep groping in the darkness with ravenous desire. </p> <p><a href=\"http://www.graduationwisdom.com/speeches/0113-harris-perry-best-pieces-of-commencement-advice.htm\"><em>Read the speech in full</em></a></p>",

      "body": "<p>The delivery of the prodigy Max Verstappen, who became the youngest winner of a Formula One race when he triumphed in Sunday\u2019s Spanish Grand Prix, brought an iridescence to a sport that for too long has laboured in the single colour of the silver Mercedes.</p> <p>Everyone apart from the stricken people at Mercedes appeared to be joyous. And it felt as though it was the shortest race in history. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/15/lewis-hamilton-nico-rosberg-crash-out-f1-spanish-gp\" title=\"\">early crash between Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg</a>, which removed both men from the contest, had so dominated the first hour of proceedings, with constant replays, quick-fire post-mortems and the assessment of consequences, that the race itself felt like a backdrop to weightier issues.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/15/lewis-hamilton-nico-rosberg-crash-out-f1-spanish-gp\">Mercedes inquest as Hamilton and Rosberg crash out and Verstappen wins Spanish GP</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Verstappen\u2019s victory represented a great day for him and his team, Red Bull, who had not won a race since Spa in 2014. But it was a wonderful occasion for Formula One too.</p> <p>When Verstappen made his F1 debut for Toro Rosso as a 17-year-old last year he was so young that the concerned people at the FIA changed the rules; now you have to be 18. Verstappen was actually only 16 in 2014, when it was first announced that he would be driving in F1. Many sagacious voices said he was too young but there can be no doubts now.</p> <p>He crossed the winning line aged 18 years and 228 days, beating Sebastian Vettel\u2019s previous record by two and a half years \u2013 Vettel was 21 and 73 days when he won in Italy in 2008.</p> <p>Verstappen led from lap 44, which was roughly the time everyone started concentrating on the race. He was the beneficiary of a split strategy from Red Bull. The team decided to give their other driver, Daniel Ricciardo, a three-stopper (Verstappen had two) to cover the threat from Vettel, who they thought would be the fastest driver in the race after the removal of the Mercedes.</p> <p>But this is to take nothing away from Verstappen, who resisted a long and persistent challenge from Kimi Raikkonen to win the race on his debut for Red Bull. He joined Red Bull this month because the team were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/may/05/max-verstappen-daniil-kvyat-ruuthless-f1-red-bull\" title=\"\">unhappy with the start to the season made by Daniil Kvyat</a>.</p> <p>Verstappen, who also became the first Dutch winner of an F1 race, also had a spot of luck, of course, when Hamilton and Rosberg collided.</p> <p>Hamilton took the lead from pole but Rosberg went past him on the outside on the first corner. But coming out of the third bend, Hamilton saw a gap in Rosberg\u2019s defence and attempted to overtake him on the inside.</p> <p>Rosberg moved over and squeezed Hamilton on to the grass. The world champion went into a spin and clipped Rosberg\u2019s car as he did so, putting both cars out of the race, leaving the field clear for Red Bull and Ferrari to battle it out for\u00a0glory.</p> <p>Rosberg appeared to be over-aggressive but you are allowed to make one block to defend your lead. Hamilton, possibly piqued after making yet another indifferent start, may have had a rush of blood and was determined to get straight back at his team-mate. But there was a gap, and he was travelling much faster than Rosberg, whose engine was in the wrong mode.</p> <p>It was a terrible day for both drivers but Rosberg, with a 43-point lead from the first four races, clearly came out of the situation the better.</p> <p>The day, however, belonged to Verstappen. Christian Horner, Red Bull\u2019s team principal, said: \u201cIt\u2019s been an unbelievable performance, from the moment Max stepped into the car until the chequered flag he\u2019s been exemplary. He\u2019s not put a wheel wrong. He\u2019s been quick, measured, mature. He\u2019s defended incredibly well against a seasoned pro like Kimi. To score his first grand prix victory, becoming the youngest victor, on his debut for the team is fairytale stuff.\u201d</p> <p>Horner, enthusing in the unexpected spotlight, added: \u201cThe biggest aspect of his performance has been in calmness. He\u2019s obviously got a lot of capacity when he\u2019s driving the car. We were all getting tense with five laps to go because the tyres were at the end of their life and he had Kimi breathing down his neck.</p> <p>\u201cBut he calmly came on the radio and said please could we ask Charlie [Whiting] to deal with the blue flags swiftly. There was no agitation in his voice, no panic, no tension. He was a young man completely in control of what he was doing. And that\u2019s what he\u2019s done from the moment he stepped in the car.\u201d</p> <p>Horner thought it was \u201cuncanny\u201d how Verstappen reminded him of Vettel. \u201cThere are an awful lot of similarities. The mechanics were telling me that even the way he gets in the car is similar, the same side, the way he pulls his knee up to get in the chassis. But he\u2019s his own man as well. He\u2019s a very together young guy. You\u2019d never think he was 18. He\u2019s the first driver I\u2019ve had that legally I could be his father.\u201d</p> <p>The man of the moment said: \u201cIt\u2019s amazing, I couldn\u2019t believe I was leading. I was looking at the pitboard, saw my name with 10 laps to go, then started to watch the board.</p> <p>\u201cI was thinking: \u2018Don\u2019t look at it, focus on the tyres and bring it home.\u2019 It\u2019s a great feeling. I absolutely didn\u2019t expect this.\u201d</p> <p>In the general excitement it was scarcely noticed that Carlos Sainz, the man Verstappen left behind at Toro Rosso, finished sixth, his best result. He must have had mixed feelings.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Few films at the Cannes film festival have been as highly-anticipated as American Honey, British director Andrea Arnold\u2019s first movie made outside the UK. But speaking to press on Sunday, in the wake of largely rave reviews and ahead of the film\u2019s official red carpet gala, Arnold revealed that the experience of driving round the country researching the movie was almost as transformative as making it. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/14/american-honey-review-andrea-arnold-mislays-map-but-us-roadtrip-still-sweetly-intriguing\">American Honey review: Andrea Arnold mislays map on sweet, indelible roadtrip</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI had some quite difficult times travelling by myself, being in that open wilderness,\u201d said Arnold, who won the jury prize at Cannes for Red Road in 2006 and three years later for Fish Tank. \u201cBeing on my own in those big open spaces was quite interesting but it was quite solitary at times.\u201d Arnold recalled tornado lessons offered to her by one woman in an especially remote and stormy part of Alabama. </p> <p>The film follows a ragtag crew of young magazine salespeople going from doorstep to doorstep trying to persuade people to subscribe to various publications. It shows a country which, says Arnold \u201cis a mix of the America I grew up with \u2013 which I mostly saw though Hollywood; my romanticised idea of it \u2013 and the contemporary America I saw when I did my trips.</p> <p>\u201cI was quite upset about some to the towns I went to, and some of the poverty I saw. It seemed really different to me than in the UK. When people don\u2019t have money they can\u2019t have health care and they can\u2019t do things like go to the dentist. Those kind of things really shocked me.\u201d</p> <p>Arnold said she had arrived at one very small town in West Virginia with a cut-price store, a funeral directors (\u201cwhich was thriving\u201d) and three pharmacies, all busy. \u201cI asked them what they were dishing out and they said painkillers to older people and antidepressants to younger people. There was a lot of addiction.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc67755d9b4c9309c4cba65439a83ed86c390651\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc67755d9b4c9309c4cba65439a83ed86c390651/0_99_3500_2099/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Riley Keough, Sasha Lane, Andrea Arnold and Shia LaBeouf at the film\u2019s photocall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Riley Keough, Sasha Lane, Andrea Arnold and Shia LaBeouf at the film\u2019s photocall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UPI / Barcroft Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shia LaBeouf, the highest-profile member of Arnold\u2019s cast, said it was an America with which he was familiar. \u201cIn Bakersville, where my father lived for a time, the only thing there is a prison. So everyone works in the prison. I\u2019m part of that underclass. That\u2019s where I come from, so I know about it.\u201d</p> <p>Echoed Arnold: \u201cIn small towns there\u2019s not a lot of industries if you\u2019re coming out of school and need to work. A lot of the opportunities were working in fast food restaurants. That seemed quite sad to me.\u201d</p> <p>The film\u2019s leading character is Star, an 18-year-old who joins the crew to get away from her dead-beat existence in Texas, and fuelled by an attraction to LaBeouf\u2019s character, Jake. But the pressure to sell subscriptions \u2013 or simply persuade people out of cash with a sob-story \u2013 is considerable. It is applied by the group\u2019s formidable ring-leader (Riley Keough, Elvis Presley\u2019s granddaughter), who cracks with whip wearing heavy fake tan and a stars-and-stripes bikini. </p> <p>The gang, said Arnold, is \u201ca small potted version of the American dream. They\u2019re working hard at selling themselves, which is what capitalism is all about.\u201d She also compared the transaction to that attempted in the UK by charity workers or Big Issue sellers. \u201cYou\u2019re not really buying the magazine, you\u2019re buying the person.\u201d</p> <p>Arnold discovered most of her cast scouting around America; it includes a construction worker, a skateboarder and a former exotic dancer. She found her star, student Sasha Lane, now 20, when she was sunbathing on the beach for spring break, just a month before shooting began. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"13794806c5af02c93d4104735a82377b2cf40630\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/13794806c5af02c93d4104735a82377b2cf40630/0_464_2988_3728/802.jpg\" alt=\"Sasha Lane at the premiere.\" width=\"802\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sasha Lane at the premiere.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ian Gavan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The newcomer recalled how although she was initially sceptical of Arnold\u2019s approach (adult film producers also cruise the shore), the director swiftly won her trust. \u201cI felt Andrea\u2019s vibe,\u201d Lane said. \u201cShe just seemed really nice and smiley \u2026 I didn\u2019t really know what she was talking about, she was in her overalls. But she seemed so sweet.\u201d</p> <p>A followup meeting in a Waffle House and a brief audition in a hotel lobby sealed the deal. \u201cWalking down the pier,\u201d remembered Lane, \u201cI felt so whole; I was so happy to have met her. I knew she was someone important and going to look out for me and that this wasn\u2019t going to be a porn scam.\u201d</p>",

He said he was proud of his latest pairing.</p> <p>\u201cYou have two physical comedians,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best kind of comedy for me is not one that takes its cue from being pretentious. It\u2019s one that is more like a juggler on the street corner who\u2019s constantly aware that they\u2019re going to throw tomatoes unless you keep it lively. Ryan in particular was particularly willing to fling himself off of stuff onto other stuff and sometimes there was glass in the middle\u201d.</p>",

Her dreams may have come true, but Katy B hasn\u2019t lost touch with her inner shop assistant. In her black outfit and pumps she could easily pass for one of her own fans, and her sprightly songs of looking for love on the dancefloor make an instant connection.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/28/katy-b-clubbing-has-gotta-be-better-than-tinder\">Katy B: \u2018Clubbing has gotta be better than Tinder\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Brien, unlike many pop stars, refuses to sex up her set or rely on high-end production values to dazzle the audience. Nor does she carry herself with the earnest self-regard and faux humility of the new-school singer-songwriters. Crying for No Reason proves she can belt it out with the best of them, but she does so without any hand-waggling histrionics. Her new album, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/24/katy-b-honey-review\">Honey</a>, features numerous cameos, although the only guest to join her tonight is the dubstep MC Sgt Pokes \u2013 a move that is both endearingly homely and somewhat anticlimactic.</p> <p>The downside of keeping it so real is that Brien can come across as a little ordinary. Whether dabbling in drum\u2019n\u2019bass, house or R&amp;B, many of her tunes end up as formulaic high-street dancepop. Ultimately, Katy B faces a paradox: her songs are so rooted in Saturday nights out in south London that when you\u2019re already on a Saturday night out in south London, they struggle to transport you anywhere else.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>\u2022 At <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.ticketline.co.uk/common-people#tour\">Common People festival</a>, Oxford, 28 May.

She said Wood, whom she has met a few times, agreed with the broader remit and that the charity would seek to educate the public and improve standards in the industry.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to see preventable, accidental deaths among travellers reduced to the same level as for non-travellers carrying out similar activities, but we want to have the most effect on the most things. We have to go out and see what the numbers look like.\u201d</p> <p>Thomas Cook, which announces financial results on Thursday, is paying for the charity\u2019s startup costs, including Phipps\u2019s pay and legal fees, so that its \u00a31m donation will be intact when the foundation is launched.</p> <p>\u201cThat means the charity will get off to a flying start and the new chief executive will be in a better position than they often are in a new charity,\u201d Phipps said.</p>",

It was her first title in nine months.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/may/12/roger-federer-french-open-back-injury\">Roger Federer finds time catching up with him as French Open decision awaits | Kevin Mitchell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On a cloudy Roman Sunday afternoon, her compatriot Madison Keys began brightly, shone for a while then faded under late pressure as Williams reminded us that, at 34, she is still the best player in the women\u2019s game by more than 3,000 ranking points, with plenty more to come. She won 7-6, 6-3.</p> <p>Williams fell short of the calendar slam last year in New York and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/30/serena-williams-angelque-kerber-australian-open-final-tennis\" title=\"\">she botched the start of her 2016 campaign in Melbourne</a>. So she goes to Roland Garros without the pressure of those expectations at least.</p> <p>This was the first all-American final in Rome since Billie Jean King defeated Julie Heldman 46 years ago, and Americans had not contested a WTA claycourt title since Serena beat her sister Venus in Paris in 2002. Those distant dates serve to underline what giants of the game the sisters have been although Venus, 35, who lost in the second round here against Timea Babos then stayed on to watch the final, is closer to the end than is her younger sibling.</p> <p>Serena, who made her professional debut in 1995, is \u2013 and possibly always will be \u2013 the only player, male or female, to win 10 singles slam titles in different decades. It is ludicrous to imagine she will go into a third decade but she seems determined to stay long enough to overhaul the records of the two players who bar her progress to the very summit of her sport.</p> <p>Margaret Court won 24 majors and Steffi Graf 22. Williams has 21. If all goes to plan in Paris she could insinuate herself between those two pillars of the game by retaining her title at Wimbledon, leaving the US Open as another grand staging post in September. After that, serious speculation kicks in. She will be 35 and more vulnerable. It will not be easy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/may/15/serena-williams-v-madison-keys-italian-open-final-live\">Serena Williams beats Madison Keys to win the Italian Open \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Not only is the women\u2019s game as unpredictable as it has been for many years, with any one of maybe 20 contenders capable of winning any of the majors, but there were moments on Sunday when Williams had to battle harder than normal to get into the match. What once came to her easily now is often a chore \u2013 understandable, given that she is operating practically on one good knee.</p> <p>Keys, 13 years and 23 ranking places adrift of the world No1, broke at the start, before Williams had properly warmed up, and tried desperately hard to resist her charge thereafter.</p> <p>One of the Tour\u2019s light-hearted souls Keys could only laugh at a pair of serves from comedy central in the first set, the first ballooning harmlessly into the wrong service box and the second dribbling into the middle of the net. If Williams allowed herself a grin it must have been a very quick one.</p> <p>In the end Keys out-aced the biggest server in the women\u2019s game, 7-4, but 32 unforced errors cost her dearly.</p> <p>They fought hard through the tie-break before Williams, alert to the danger of an upset, found her old championship spirit in the second set.</p> <p>There was a blip in the fourth game when she served a double-fault for 0\u201140 and Keys clawed back one of two breaks. She broke again to stay in the match at 3-5 but Williams\u2019s power off the ground was too strong for her in the ninth game.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Building an exoskeleton of a goat and a prosthetic stomach to digest grass before attempting to cross the Alps on all fours must rank as one of the weirder research projects funded by the <a href=\"http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/\">Wellcome Trust</a>. But London designer <a href=\"http://www.thomasthwaites.com/\">Thomas Thwaites</a> has turned his bizarre mission to bridge the boundary between <em>Homo sapiens</em> and other species by becoming \u201cGoatMan\u201d into an enlightening and funny book. Informed by advice from a Danish shaman, neuroscientists, prosthetists, animal behaviourists and Swiss goat herders, it explores what connects and separates us from other animals. Here are 10 things Thwaites learned.</p> <h2><strong>1. The gap between Homo sapiens and other animals is wide</strong></h2> <p>\u201cLook at that goat skeleton and that human skeleton \u2013 they are basically the same,\u201d says Thwaites, looking at the magnificent collection of bones housed by <a href=\"http://www.ucl.ac.uk/museums/zoology\">the Grant Museum of Zoology in London</a>. \u201cThese skeletons all have a skull and ribs, and almost all mammals have the same number of vertebrae in their necks.\u201d But Thwaites found the physical challenges of becoming a creature that moved on all fours almost insurmountable. Primates are \u201cweird\u201d, Thwaites says, for putting almost all their weight on their back legs; he required prosthetics to put 60% of his weight on his \u201cfront legs\u201d. His pelvis was also 135 degrees out of alignment. \u201cI was sort of shocked at how bad a goat I was,\u201d he says, \u201cand I was really trying.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1b7d88ac7cd3294b6faeb884520263abf5318043\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b7d88ac7cd3294b6faeb884520263abf5318043/0_960_3840_4800/800.jpg\" alt=\"GoatMan\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of Thwaites\u2019s many attempts at building a goat suit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Bowditch</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>2. Storytelling makes us human</strong></h2> <p>\u201cIf Neanderthals and other types of human were still extant, there would be much less of a jump between orangutans and <em>Homo sapiens</em>,\u201d he says. Many traits once thought to define <em>Homo sapiens</em>, such as complex language and the ability to use tools, have been demonstrated in other animals. Thwaites suggests the defining characteristic of being human is our ability to move backwards and forwards in time and think in stories. \u201cAny way of being where we\u2019re being rational, we\u2019re thinking in stories,\u201d he says. \u201cWe become the stories we tell ourselves.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>3. We have always wanted to be animals</strong></h2> <p>\u201cThis dream of becoming an animal is as old as humanity itself,\u201d says Thwaites. Some paintings of bison- and bird-headed men found in European caves are more than 30,000 years old; similarly ancient cave paintings have been identified in Indonesia. The Danish shaman that Thwaites visited as part of his research demonstrated how, through dance and imitation, it is possible to enter a \u201cbetween-the-worlds state\u201d and begin to see the world through the eyes of an animal. \u201cIt\u2019s not a physical transformation, it\u2019s not like a flash of lightning and then you\u2019re a wolf, it\u2019s having different ideas about where the boundaries are,\u201d says Thwaites. \u201cI was surprised by how matter-of-fact she was about stuff I considered mystical \u2013 it was just her view that we could become another animal.\u201d Perhaps this is the biggest irony of all: wanting to be an animal is part of what makes us human.</p> <h2><strong>4. Obscure science is inspiring</strong></h2> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a lot more interesting trying to become a goat when there are people with arcane knowledge,\u201d says Thwaites. His project offers a window into neuroscience, animal behaviourism, biomechanics and some of the less feted scientific endeavours undertaken in labs across the country. He was most inspired by a visit to a microbiologist who was researching the goat rumen, the largest of its four stomachs. \u201cThere are tens of thousands of different organisms in the rumen. It\u2019s inspiring that a poo-ey mixture that is still not understood allows a goat to live on grass. Maybe I liked the grossness of it, that mixture of chemistry and microbiology and guts.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"57e1354d02ae7ec79eee15c232c8db7cdc11d39e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57e1354d02ae7ec79eee15c232c8db7cdc11d39e/0_0_719_1019/706.jpg\" alt=\"GoatMan\" width=\"706\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I liked the grossness of it, that mixture of chemistry and microbiology and guts.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Bowditch</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>5. Technology could help us connect with animals</strong></h2> <p>Although Thwaites was warned off using technology to get closer to being a goat by the shaman, he deployed a basic shamanistic principle \u2013 that physical imitation helps change consciousness \u2013 alongside the latest scientific work in prosthetics to build himself forelegs and trot like a goat. \u201cJust being in that physical position probably helped,\u201d he says. \u201cAll of a sudden, you are face and mouth first.\u201d The goat\u2019s reputation for eating everything is widely misunderstood \u2013 goats are curious, and touch and check things with their mouth, as we do with our hands.</p> <h2><strong>6. Being a goat is exhausting</strong></h2> <p>Thwaites spent three days in Alpine meadows, doing his best to mix with a herd of goats. \u201cNo one was using that much energy, there weren\u2019t wolves around, we weren\u2019t being driven along a mountain path, but it was still difficult, especially going downhill,\u201d says Thwaites. \u201cAfter a while, the prosthetics started rubbing, and I got sweaty and cold.\u201d This physical discomfort \u201cencroached\u201d on his attempts to think like a goat.</p> <h2><strong>7. Acceptance is bliss</strong></h2> <p>Thwaites blundered when he briefly took up the \u201cdominant\u201d position in the herd at the highest point in the meadow. After some initial wariness, however, his fellow goats came to tolerate the strange GoatMan among them. Thwaites was also delighted when the Swiss goat herder remarked to the local farmer that he had been accepted. \u201cI genuinely think I made a kind of goat friend, a bit of a pal, and hung out with Goat No 18,\u201d says Thwaites. \u201cNot being able to read that number on his tag was the goal, not being able to see that goat as a goat but as another person was the goal. I tried, but you can\u2019t stop your brain from being itself.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"58ab88624a69f51adb81c785f62e22848fe36c84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/58ab88624a69f51adb81c785f62e22848fe36c84/0_0_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"GoatMan\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I was sort of shocked at how bad a goat I was \u2013 and I was really trying.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Bowditch</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>8. Becoming another animal can make us more humble</strong></h2> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important to remember every now and again that we are animals,\u201d says Thwaites, \u201cbecause it helps us to think ourselves away from some of the more crazy aspects of our society and humanity. Being an animal would help us remember that there is no manifest destiny to the human species \u2013 we are just among all these other creatures. The innate certainty that everything will be OK in the end and we\u2019ll get to that Star Trek utopia \u2013 that is definitely not certain. That is just a story.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>9. Being a goat could be the new mindfulness</strong></h2> <p>\u201cAnimals are very in the moment. They don\u2019t have an idea of the future or the past as a narrative that they tell themselves,\u201d says Thwaites. \u201cThe mindfulness-wellness sphere is all about being present in the now \u2013 it\u2019s remembering that you\u2019re an animal, being present in your physical body, being in nature; it\u2019s a way to engage with your less self-conscious side.\u201d Perhaps Thwaites could become a wellness guru? \u201cI\u2019d need an investor to help make the goat-suit a little more comfortable. Perhaps I could go on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/dragons-den\">Dragon\u2019s Den</a> and say: \u2018I want to start a new wellness movement.\u2019\u201d</p> <h2><strong>10. GoatMan will stalk the fields again</strong></h2> <p>If that doesn\u2019t quite take off, Thwaites has at least received messages from goat herders across Europe inviting him to become a temporary member of their herds. He\u2019d like to try again, because he felt that his obligation to document the project through cameras inhibited a more meditative attempt to become a goat. \u201cThere\u2019s a goat herd in the Czech Republic to which I\u2019ve been invited, and I\u2019ve always wanted to go to the Czech Republic,\u201d says Thwaites. \u201cI\u2019d also love to keep some goats. It\u2019s a bit difficult in Peckham, but that\u2019s definitely the long-term plan.\u201d</p> <p><em>GoatMan: How I Took a Holiday from Being Human by Thomas Thwaites is published on 17 May</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>I\u2019d seen smatterings of publicity for this over last summer, but I only managed to get round to reading it for the CILIP Carnegie Medal shadowing. From the irritating blurb and tag line, I wasn\u2019t expecting it to be great. Bu grudgingly I do admit that this book was better than I had initially anticipated. I suppose it did well to crack through the negative first impression it gave me.<br />The element that lifted the premise for me was the art. It differentiated Fire Colour One from what could have been your typical sad-yet-uplifting-story of grief, and I loved it. I\u2019ll keep no secrets when I say I love books about the world of art (especially its underworld). </p> <p>Iris\u2019 fires were the other element that I enjoyed. I particularly didn\u2019t <em>like </em>her, per se. She was trying very hard to be \u2018not like other girls\u2019 and hanging out with boys and dangerous. But such people in real life are irritating, and I thought she was a very well-crafted character. I\u2019ve never seen anything like her addiction to fires. I loved it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9ba23def528215dd888cb3e99260272fbcb48b8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ba23def528215dd888cb3e99260272fbcb48b8a/0_0_263_400/263.jpg\" alt=\"Fire Colour One by Jenny Valentine\" width=\"263\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Things go downhill when we reach the rest of the cast. Firstly, I was confused as to the lack of any other characters than the core people. It gave the whole book a surreal sense. I felt everyone other than Iris was reduced and simplified to archetypes: the father with whom she has an immediate connection, the greedy step-parents, the quirky best friend. Oh, <em>Thurston</em>. It seemed as though his only purpose was to provide meaning and danger to Iris\u2019 story. He seemed very Manic Pixie Dream Boy to me. Perhaps it was Iris\u2019 first person viewpoint \u2013 I can\u2019t be sure \u2013 but I didn\u2019t care about any of the characters and I think that was why I could never quite lose myself enough to enjoy this.</p> <p>\u00a0The writing style also frustrated me. This might not be so for everyone, but for me the incredibly purple prose was stretched too thin. Everything is like something else or even <em>is </em>something else. Although, there were certainly some excellent lines in there, mostly I was just rolling my eyes at the out-of-character narration for such a blunt and cynical character as Iris.</p> <p>\u00a0The ending certainly surprised me, and although it was perhaps a bit gimmicky it did lift the book in my opinion. Overall, though, I couldn\u2019t connect to this book and I spent most of my reading time complaining. I\u2019d recommend it for fans of more slow-moving, lyrical contemporary books, but it wasn\u2019t for me.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?</a> </p> </aside>  <ul> <li><strong>Buy this book at the\u00a0<a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/308353/s/fire-colour-one/\">Guardian Bookshop</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Want to tell the world about a book you\u2019ve read?\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site</a>\u00a0and send us your review!</strong></h2>",

      "body": "<p>A walk through Harlem at dusk with Marcus Samuelsson is less gentle stroll than royal procession. The chef may be wearing a flat cap, pulled down over his eyes, and a dark jacket, but they all know who he is out here north of Manhattan\u2019s 110th Street. And they want him to know they know. As we barrel from neon-gilded diner to cocktail place, from his own rotisserie chicken joint to the jazz bars he wants me to see, he is constantly greeted with shouts of \u201cHey chef!\u201d from passersby which he returns with a gentle, \u201cOh, pur-leeze\u201d, and a shrug as if to say: \u201cI\u2019m just another guy.\u201d</p> <p>For many people in Harlem, Samuelsson is not just another guy. For a start, the Ethiopian-born chef with the aquiline features, the Swedish surname and the only-in-America story, is a major employer. Through his various ventures, including his flagship restaurant the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2011/may/06/new-york-restaurants-uptown-manhattan\">Red Rooster on Lenox Avenue</a>, he has given jobs to 200 locals. Paul McCartney and the jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis have eaten there, along with former state governors and superstar basketball players. It is liberal New York\u2019s fantasy come to life; a single room in this splintered city where its various social tribes really do seem to break bread together.</p> <p>The food festival Samuelsson launched, Harlem EatUp, held each year in May, brings big-name chefs from all over America to their doorstep. What\u2019s more, having <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/24/obama-state-dinner-india-singh\">cooked for Barack Obama at the White House</a>, he even brought the president back to his place in Harlem for a $30,000-a-plate election fundraiser. Making his home neighbourhood the star is, he claims, what really matters. \u201cIt\u2019s Harlem first, the Red Rooster second,\u201d he says. \u201cA menu you can learn. But the place? Learning a place is different.\u201d</p> <p>Right now, he is trying to learn an entirely new place. In the autumn, he opens a second Red Rooster, inside the new Curtain Hotel in London\u2019s Shoreditch. His take on American soul food subtly refracted through the lens of his African heritage is coming to London. \u201cWe must get 20 requests a year to open a new Red Rooster,\u201d he says. \u201cI only wanted to do it in a city with a dynamic we could learn from.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"74ead17995ed3241d474c5a0090866c4c8881314\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/74ead17995ed3241d474c5a0090866c4c8881314/0_361_5131_3079/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dinner at the Red Rooster, 310 Lenox Avenue, New York\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dinner at the Red Rooster, 310 Lenox Avenue, New York</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colin Clark for Observer Food Monthly</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This, he tells me, \u201cis a humble journey. It\u2019s not some big New York chef rolling into London.\u201d I suggest to him gently that the Curtain\u2019s owners may have different ideas. \u201cLook,\u201d he says. \u201cI really believe in what we have to say.\u201d It\u2019s why he wants to take me on a tour of Harlem, so I can understand how he went about launching the Red Rooster and making it a part of the community. He insists it\u2019s not all about him.</p> <p>That may well be true, but his personal story is compelling. Samuelsson, now 45, was born Kassahun Tsegie in rural Ethiopia in 1971. When he was one, he and his three-year-old sister were taken by their mother to hospital in Addis Ababa so all three could be treated for tuberculosis. His mother died there, and the children were quickly adopted by Lennart and Ann Marie Samuelsson, a geologist and his wife from Gothenburg in Sweden. \u201cApparently my birth mother\u2019s side wanted to keep us but they couldn\u2019t track us down. My father\u2019s side was happy to let us go.\u201d</p> <p>Samuelsson recognises that it looks like a curious upbringing, the black African boy raised amid the blond, blue-eyed Scandinavians, but as a child, he says, you accept the reality you are given. \u201cI had two parents who didn\u2019t look like me,\u201d he says, with a shrug. More important to him, was his dad\u2019s obsession with fishing. \u201cWe lived in a fishing village and though we didn\u2019t have a lot, we ate well. I was pickling mackerel and herring. My grandmother Helga was a big cook and four nights a week we ate with her. There was lots of foraging. I remember shelling peas in front of the TV. September meant mushrooms.\u201d He played football (developing an obsession with Arsenal, which had Swedish-born players) but quickly gravitated to weekend jobs in kitchens, finding a similar team vibe in both places.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You can from somewhere else, yet be American. I\u2019d tried to fit in before but you realise it\u2019s not going to happen</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At 16, he went to catering college before finding his first professional jobs. In 1989 he got a position in a grand Swiss hotel that made him so nervous he threw up before every service. He was taught pastry in Austria before landing a place at the three Michelin-starred restaurant of Georges Blanc in France, where he started right back at the bottom. \u201cIf you work for Georges Blanc even the lowest guy is fantastic.\u201d</p> <p>He visited New York for a stage \u2013 an unpaid period of employment \u2013 at Aquavit, a Swedish-influenced restaurant that was beginning to make a name for itself. He immediately knew he\u2019d found a town in which he could belong. \u201cHere you could be from somewhere else, yet be American,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d tried to fit in but eventually you realise it\u2019s just not going to happen that way. I wanted somewhere where the conversation was based on talent.\u201d</p> <p>He returned to New York in the early 1990s, and a job at Aquavit, this time on the staff. After the untimely death of the head chef he was put in charge. \u201cI was only meant to hold the fort until they found a replacement.\u201d None was ever appointed. Shortly after that, Samuelsson received three out of four stars from the <em>New York Times</em>; at 23 he was the youngest chef ever to do so. And so he dug into life as a feted New York chef. He could, he says, have carried on like that were it not for his sister Linda, who 15 years ago tracked down their birth family through the adoption agency. Samuelsson admits this was not something to which he\u2019d given much thought; he\u2019d simply considered himself fortunate. He credits his sister with \u201cliving a fuller life\u201d than he does.</p> <p>Together they went back to the village of their birth and met their father, a priest and farmer. Samuelsson discovered he had eight half siblings, whose education he now supports. Not long after that he was teaching a class at the Culinary Institute of America when he was heckled by a student. He could talk fluently about the food of Sweden and France, the young trainee said, but what could he tell them about Africa? \u201cHe had a point,\u201d Samuelsson says. \u201cIt was time to do some research.\u201d He travelled throughout Africa.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"82ead51618028f9f904fbffc5b04be9c2039e435\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/82ead51618028f9f904fbffc5b04be9c2039e435/0_0_3840_5760/667.jpg\" alt=\"Inside the Red Rooster\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside the Red Rooster</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Colin Clark for Observer Food Monthly</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The book that resulted from the journey, 2006\u2019s <em>The Soul of a New Cuisine: a Discovery of the Food and Flavours of Africa</em>, came with a foreword from Archbishop Desmond Tutu, and was named best international cookbook by the James Beard Foundation. \u201cI was both trying to find out about the food and myself.\u201d The African restaurant he opened on the back of it was less successful, which made the Red Rooster project \u2013 a rebirth for the Red Rooster name, a long-gone Harlem institution \u2013 that much more important. I ask whether he set up the classy soul food restaurant, up here in then down-at-heel Harlem, out of guilt: guilt that he had led such a comfortable life when so many in Ethiopia had not, guilt that he had enjoyed so much success. He thinks for a moment. \u201cIt\u2019s a good question. The thing is as a chef you can\u2019t just cut from the centre cut.\u201d</p> <p>You mean you can\u2019t just always work with the best ingredients? \u201cExactly. Having been to Africa I couldn\u2019t be blind to all that. But I also knew Africa wasn\u2019t just about poverty. Getting away from Africa brought with it a responsibility. When I was growing up in Sweden we had a saying in my family that you should never get stuck on bitter.\u201d</p> <p>I first came across Samuelsson in 2009 when I was judging <em>Top Chef Masters</em>, a US TV show in which big name chefs competed for a $100,000 cheque for charity and bragging rights. Samuelsson\u2019s story, always expressed through his food \u2013 a Swedish-inspired fish dish here, an African stew there \u2013 was thrilling and that, combined with killer technique, took him to the title. He seemed ineffably chilled. But, if anything, the man I meet now is much more at ease with himself.</p> <p><strong>The first stop on our tour of Harlem is Sylvia\u2019s, </strong>a local institution just the next block down from the Rooster on Lenox, which has been trading there for over half a century. Samuelsson moved up to Harlem with his Ethiopian-born model wife, Maya Haile, five years before he opened the restaurant. They are now expecting their first child. Sylvia\u2019s is all Formica-topped counter, and clatter and hiss. Behind that counter is a long \u201csteam table\u201d, a holding place for oxtail and fried chicken and collard greens cooked in volume. \u201cI used to come up here to eat after service downtown because it\u2019s relaxed,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s rooted in African-American dining. Here they want to know how you\u2019re doing, how\u2019s your uncle, how\u2019s your mom.\u201d A place like Sylvia\u2019s, he says, is one long conversation.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/13/harlem-gentrification-new-york-race-black-white\">What will happen when Harlem becomes white?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Didn\u2019t he worry that he was going to be stepping on their toes by opening the Rooster? After all, they\u2019re famed for their fried chicken and he was going to be doing that too. \u201cTheir chicken is boneless breast meat. I decided I would do only bone-in brown meat. Right there you have a difference. There had to be a divide.\u201d He says he\u2019ll be trying to apply the same ideas at the London venture.</p> <p>Yes, he\u2019ll be bringing his \u201cyardbird\u201d fried chicken to Shoreditch and Helga\u2019s meatballs, named after his grandma\u2019s recipe. There will be gravadlax and fried fish, and the sudden outbreaks of African spicing that speak of his beginnings. \u201cBut some of the dishes are going to be interpretations of east London, of the dishes of the Jewish community that used to be there and of the Bangladeshi community that\u2019s there now. In London, the world is there.\u201d He has been coming and going from London for months now, he says, grazing his way along Broadway Market in Hackney, or having breakfast at Roast above Borough Market.</p> <p>Which leads to the inevitable question: just how much time will he be spending in London? \u201cI\u2019m not just gonna be phoning it in. Come the fall I\u2019ll be relocating, certainly for a while.\u201d It transpires that his wife\u2019s sisters live in west London, and with the baby arriving, living there, albeit temporarily, makes an awful lot of sense. Plus, he says, it\u2019s the only way to get it right. \u201cI can\u2019t claim to have lived in London for five years as I did with Harlem before opening. I have to hit a completely different drumbeat.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca977281b0bb156910f062ac7acef23b8af26066\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca977281b0bb156910f062ac7acef23b8af26066/80_0_2840_1705/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marcus cooks with first lady Michelle Obama\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marcus cooks with first lady Michelle Obama during the White House Easter Egg Roll on the South Lawn of the White House April 9, 2012</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Win McNamee/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>We leave Sylvia\u2019s and walk back past the Red Rooster to look at the site of what was once the Lenox Lounge, one of Harlem\u2019s great jazz spots. Now it\u2019s closed and boarded up. \u201cIt\u2019s a sad sight,\u201d he says. But he\u2019s tried to rebalance things, by having jazz in the front of the Rooster by the bar, and downstairs in the basement at Ginny\u2019s Supper Club, where Alicia Keys has played. \u201cI\u2019m led through culture,\u201d he says. \u201cWithout culture we are nothing.\u201d Music, he says, is a part of that. \u201cI take pride in having musicians sitting next to the ladies just in from church and bankers.\u201d</p> <p>As night falls we take a short cab ride over to 8th Avenue. Unlike Lenox, which still has its rough edges, its discount stores and fast food joints, 8th Avenue is starting to feel like a creeping extension of the well-to-do Upper West Side a few streets south.</p> <p>Streetbird, Samuelsson\u2019s rotisserie chicken restaurant, is a few blocks away. We step inside. The air is thick with the smell of roasting hen and the sound of music. It\u2019s themed around hip hop, and received flak when it opened because the decor included pairs of hanging trainers, which in New York can be used to <a href=\"https://www.wbez.org/shows/curious-city/shoes-on-a-wire-untangling-an-urban-myth/f46d882f-dd38-452b-98dc-be406135429a\">reference inter-gang killings</a>. In 2012 he published a memoir, <em>Yes, Chef</em>; the review of it in the <em>New York Observer</em> accused him of a condescending approach to Harlem, of using it for his own purposes. He shrugs at this and looks around the full tables, as if wearied by such political point scoring. He says simply that the site occupied by Streetbird was once one of the biggest crack houses in Harlem. \u201cThe name Harlem is not just some name tag,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was here before us. My ambition is to make having worked in Harlem as a cook mean something.\u201d</p> <p>We make our way back to the Rooster, via a couple of still empty jazz venues. His own restaurant is now heaving. We are meant to have dinner together, eating some of the dishes his team is planning for London. As well as the obvious \u2013 a whole chicken, tenderised in buttermilk, then deep fried and served with mace gravy \u2013 there are more refined touches: a savoury macaroon of chicken livers, cured salmon on sushi rice, slices of barbecue pork with slippery ribbon noodles in a chicken stock that punches hard with ginger. But this, Samuelsson says, is a work in progress.</p> <p>Or at least he says this when I can catch him, because he keeps disappearing to hop tables and work the room. Clearly he feels a responsibility to be present. Here in this corner of Harlem, he has created much more than just a restaurant. Now all Marcus Samuelsson has to do is work the same magic in London. </p> <h2>Helga\u2019s meatballs with lingonberry preserves, pickled cucumbers and braised cabbage</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4c1ff0886dec8bf8c3413ee1c872c320956dc88\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4c1ff0886dec8bf8c3413ee1c872c320956dc88/69_2379_4599_2759/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Helga\u2019s meatballs with lingonberry preserves, pickled cucumbers and braised cabbage\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Serves 4-6<br />For the lingonberry preserves (makes about 650g)<br /><strong>lingonberries</strong> 100g (available from <a href=\"http://www.scandikitchen.co.uk/\">scandikitchen.co.uk</a>)<br /><strong>sugar</strong> 450g<br /><strong>water</strong> 950ml </p> <p>For the pickled cucumbers <br /><strong>cucumber</strong> 1 <br /><strong>sea salt</strong> 1 tbsp <br /><strong>water</strong> 360ml <br /><strong>white wine vinegar</strong> 120ml <br /><strong>sugar</strong> 225g <br /><strong>bay leaf </strong>1 <br /><strong>allspice</strong> 2 berries</p> <p>For the meatballs<br /><strong>dry breadcrumbs</strong> 60g <br /><strong>double cream</strong> 60ml <br /><strong>red onion</strong> 1 medium, finely chopped<br /><strong>olive oil</strong> 2 tbsp <br /><strong>ground chuck or sirloin beef</strong> 225g<br /><strong>ground veal</strong> 225g<br /><strong>ground pork</strong> 225g <br /><strong>honey</strong> 2 tbsp <br /><strong>egg</strong> 1 <br /><strong>salt</strong> 1\u00bd tbsp <br /><strong>black pepper</strong> \u00bd tbsp <br /><strong>unsalted butter</strong> 3 tbsp </p> <p>For the sauce<br /><strong>chicken stock </strong>480ml <br /><strong>double cream </strong>120ml <br /><strong>lingonberry preserves</strong> 165g (see above)<br /><strong>pickle juice </strong>2 tbsp, from the pickled cucumbers (see above)<br /><strong>salt </strong>\u00bd tbsp <br /><strong>black pepper</strong> 2 tsp</p> <p>For the braised cabbage <br /><strong>bacon</strong> 225g, diced<br /><strong>onion</strong> 100g, sliced thin<br /><strong>carrots</strong> 75g, sliced thin<br /><strong>red cabbage</strong> 300g, thinly sliced <br /><strong>green cabbage</strong> 300g, thinly sliced<br /><strong>apple cider vinegar</strong> 60ml <br /><strong>salt</strong> 1 tbsp<br /><strong>black pepper </strong>2 tsp </p> <p>To make the lingonberry preserves, combine all the ingredients in a pot and bring to a boil.

Add the onion and carrot, and cook for 10 minutes. </p> <p>Add the cabbage and cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Finish with vinegar, salt and pepper. </p> <p>To serve, place the cabbage on a plate and top with the meatballs. Spoon some sauce over each individual meatball.

But coming out of the third bend Hamilton saw a gap in Rosberg\u2019s defence and attempted to overtake him on the inside. Rosberg moved over and squeezed Hamilton on to the grass. The world champion went into a spin and clipped Rosberg\u2019s car as he did so, putting both cars out of the race.</p> <p>Rosberg appeared to be over aggressive but you are allowed to make one block to defend your lead. Hamilton, possibly piqued after making yet another indifferent start, may have had a rush of blood and was determined to get straight back at his team-mate. It was a terrible day for both drivers, but Rosberg, nursing a 43-point lead from the first four races, clearly came out of the situation the better.</p> <p>Niki Lauda, Mercedes\u2019 non-executive chairman, was in no doubt about who was the guilty party. \u201cIt is stupid, we could\u2019ve won this race,\u201d he said. \u201cLewis is too aggressive. I need to talk to them and hear their explanation and then we will see what happens.\u201d But BBC\u2019s Radio 5\u2019s analyst Allan McNish was probably more accurate in his assessment when he said: \u201cNico Rosberg was in front at turn three, but it was a little bit of a misunderstanding. It was very robust from both drivers. Rosberg was moving over to defend the corner \u2013 it was two guys going for the same piece of tarmac, but the big loser out of this is Lewis Hamilton.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/may/15/f1-spanish-gp-live-lewis-hamilton-nico-rosberg\">F1: Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg crash out of Spanish GP \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The stewards were meeting to assess the situation and they and Mercedes were anxious to speak to both drivers. If Hamilton does receive reprimand he will be hit with a 10-place penalty for the next race in Monaco \u2013 the worst race on the schedule for overtaking.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/dec/02/rosberg-hamilton-warned-mercedes-axe\" title=\"\">These two have history</a>. In 2014 Rosberg was blamed for crashing into Hamilton and earlier that year he appeared to be guilty of compromising the world champion\u2019s efforts to win pole at Monaco. Then, in Austin last year, the race Hamilton won to take his third title, there was another coming together of the two. Rosberg felt that Hamilton had been too aggressive in completing an overtaking move. Replays vindicated Hamilton but there was bad blood after the race. When Hamilton lobbed a cap into Rosberg\u2019s lap the German furiously flung it back at him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2370ff1e1bc8e1393a56777f68a42387edb1a965\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2370ff1e1bc8e1393a56777f68a42387edb1a965/0_0_3500_2335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen leads Ferrari\u2019s Kimi Raikkonen in Catalunya\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Red Bull\u2019s Max Verstappen leads Ferrari\u2019s Kimi Raikkonen in Catalunya.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Albert Gea/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It did not take Mercedes long to come out with a safe party line. Their head of motorsport Toto Wolff said: \u201cNiki Lauda has the drivers\u2019 opinion and instinct reaction and it is fair enough. From a teams perspective we have looked at all the pictures and looked at the data and it is not clear cut. Lewis tried to dive in, Nico closed the door so I would say let\u2019s wait for what the stewards say. Both of them were upset about the situation and they know what effort went into building the car and there was not any finger pointing.\u201d</p> <p>When asked if Mercedes would change their view on the two racing each other he was very clear. He said: \u201cNo. We didn\u2019t have such an incident for a long time. If you let them race and if you don;\u2019t have team orders there will be contact. I am upset and angry about it but I don\u2019t think I will change the approach.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>The big four supermarkets in Britain have pledged to save women hundreds of pounds on sanitary products over the course of their lifetimes following the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/mar/18/tampon-tax-scrapped-announces-osborne\">government\u2019s promise to scrap the so-called tampon tax</a>, the Guardian can reveal.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Tesco, Asda and Morrisons have written to Paula Sherriff, the Labour MP who led the parliamentary campaign to scrap the 5% VAT on sanitary products, confirming that the price tag will be reduced in line with the abolition of the levy. A spokeswoman for Sainsbury\u2019s told the Guardian that this was \u201cdefinitely\u201d its plan.</p> <p>Smaller rival Waitrose and the high street chemist Boots have confirmed they will do likewise.</p> <p>David Cameron confirmed in March he would end the VAT charge <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/16/mps-plan-budget-rebellion-against-tampon-tax\">after facing a backbench rebellion backing a Labour finance bill amendment to introduce a zero rate</a>.</p> <p>The Eurosceptic Conservative rebels were angry that EU rules meant individual countries could not abolish VAT on selected products. The UK and other countries pushed for a relaxation of the rules. </p> <p>Brussels has since announced options to permit a zero rate on sanitary products, which campaigners believe are a basic need that should not be subject to VAT. </p> <p>The chancellor, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/25/tampon-tax-15m-womens-charities-george-osborne-spending-review\">George Osborne, had proposed to redistribute the estimated \u00a315m a year in VAT to women\u2019s charities</a> but agreed to scrap the levy entirely when the European commission changed its stance.</p> <p>However, there were concerns such savings would not be passed on to consumers: France recently reduced its VAT rate on sanitary products from 20% to 5.5% but French prices have remained broadly similar.</p> <p>Sherriff said: \u201cI\u2019m delighted to have reached this agreement with Britain\u2019s largest retailers that they will guarantee to pass on the tampon tax cut at the point of sale. It would be completely unacceptable if this measure just led to big businesses boosting their bottom line at the expense of women buying what are essential goods.</p> <p>\u201cI will be pressing some of the smaller chains to sign up to the same deal and for the manufacturers to recognise the cut in their recommended retail price. </p> <p>\u201cIf for any reason we don\u2019t get full agreement to this voluntary deal, I am prepared to push the case for the finance bill to include powers to impose a windfall tax in future.\u201d</p> <p>Osborne has yet to set a deadline for the abolition. Sherriff will table a further amendment to the bill setting a firm date if the government does not set out its own timetable soon. This is again expected to attract cross-party support.</p> <p>In its letter to Sherriff, Morrisons\u2019 head of policy and corporate affairs, David Scott, said: \u201cThis [reduction] is designed to directly benefit women and I am pleased to confirm that Morrisons will be passing the 5% reduction on to our customers when the relevant regulations come into force.\u201d</p> <p>Una Kent, communications director at Boots, told Sherriff that the chain would \u201cabsolutely\u201d reflect the abolition in its pricing and added: \u201cIt\u2019s encouraging to see these proactive steps being taken to help essential sanitary items become more accessible for all women.\u201d</p> <p>Writing on behalf of Asda\u2019s chief executive, Andy Clarke, the senior director for corporate affairs, Chris Lowe, told Sherriff that abolishing the tax is a policy that the Walmart-owned supermarket \u201chas long campaigned for and was the top action our Asda mums said they would like the government to take\u201d. </p> <p>Sherriff is also concerned that continued financial pressure on poorer families following the financial crisis has forced some women to visit food banks to get tampons, a situation likely to be the focus of a forthcoming campaign.</p> <p></p>",

      "body": "<p>Domaine Alain Chavy Les Chenes 2011 is a rather good, oak-influenced dry white from one of France\u2019s most celebrated regions, Chassagne-Montrachet in Burgundy. According to Oddbins, , its \u201celegant palate of crisp citrus, white flower, hints of honey and stony minerality\u201d would make a fine match for \u201cseared scallops with tarragon butter\u201d. To make the combination really soar,<a href=\"http://www.oddbins.com/wine/mood-matching\"> Oddbins\u2019 website makes another proposition</a>: why not try serving Les Chenes and the scallops with a blast of Simple Minds\u2019 bombastic 1980s pop-rock anthem Don\u2019t You (Forget About Me)?</p> <p>What makes the track work with this particular wine isn\u2019t explained. Does it have some specific quality, a certain tinny-ness of synthesizer, or a windy earnestness of vocal, that suits the chardonnays of Chassagne-Montrachet? Or had the Oddbins copywriter run out of ideas, exhausted after finding musical matches for each of the hundreds of wines on the website, from Paul Simon\u2019s Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes for a dense Puglian Primitivo to anything by Elgar for Pol Roger champagne?</p> <p>To be fair to Oddbins, you get the impression that their approach to wine-music matching, while comprehensive, isn\u2019t intended as anything other than a bit of fun: one wine, Ch\u00e2teau Haut Courneau from Bordeaux, is \u201cpaired\u201d with The Hokey Cokey. But they\u2019re not alone in attempting to make the link between these two sensory experiences more explicit. Many writers, bloggers and merchants have begun to match music and wine, whether it\u2019s my predecessor,Tim Atkin, proposing Mexican guitar duo Rodrigo y Gabriela with Zucchardi tempranillo from Argentina\u2019s Uco Valley, or the American master sommelier and blogger Daniel Levin suggesting <a href=\"http://www.chicagonow.com/your-somm/2016/04/prince-a-wine-tribute/\">bottles to enjoy with some of Prince\u2019s greatest hits</a> within hours of the announcement of his death (including another Argentine red, Achaval-Ferrer Mendoza Malbec, which \u201cwith its purple flowers\u201d among other qualities, is made for Purple Rain).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"565598839a7f9cb0993e0459029eec998934e75e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/565598839a7f9cb0993e0459029eec998934e75e/75_218_5365_3220/1000.jpg\" alt=\"wines\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>Vi\u00f1a Leyda Pinot Noir Reserva, Leyda, Chile 2014, </strong><strong>AJ Adam Hofberg Kabinett, Mosel, Germany 2014, </strong><strong>Fattoria San Lorenzo Verdicchio dei Castello di Jesi Di Gino, Italy 2014, </strong><strong>Oddero Barolo 2011</strong></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A number of live events have also explored the connection. These can be highbrow, such as Champagne house Krug highlighting the affinities between its Grande Cuv\u00e9e blend and a recording of Stravinsky\u2019s Rite of Spring by the London Philharmonic Orchestra,or pop cultural, like Californian \u201cwine raves\u201d, and American celebrity chef Joe Bastianich\u2019s Led Zeppelin dinners , where<a href=\"http://nypost.com/2009/03/04/its-a-red-zeppelin/\"> each course was matched with a wine and one of the band\u2019s hits</a>.</p> <p>While obviously a gift for satirists, referencing music may also be helpful; of all the ways of communicating a wine\u2019s character and appeal,it\u2019s among the more vivid and apt. This applies to the basic structure of the wine, with, say, high acidity being described as sharp or \u201chigh pitched\u201d, with savoury flavours, tannin and more weight , perhaps, being more \u201cbass-heavy\u201d. It can also apply to a wine\u2019s overall feel \u2013 a light, elegant, high acid wine such as Mosel Riesling really does seem to have, to me at least, spiritual kinship with a Mozart string quartet.</p> <p>Much depends on your frame of reference \u2013 and there\u2019s no doubt music and wine matching is sometimes used as a way of boasting about cultural erudition. But recent work by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2014/jun/20/food-presented-artistically-taste-salad-kandinsky\">experimental psychologists such as Professor Charles Spence</a>, head of the Crossmodal Research group at Oxford University, suggests associations between taste and sound may be much more ingrained and widespread than was previously thought.</p> <p>According to Spence and his colleague Qian Wang, writing <a href=\"http://flavourjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13411-015-0046-9\">in a paper on the subject published in December last year</a>, we really do regard sweet and sour as \u201chigh-pitched\u201d and bitter as \u201clow\u201d \u2013 and playing low-pitched music while drinking \u201chigh-pitched wines\u201d, or vice-versa, can influence our experience of the wine.</p> <p>In their conclusions, Spence and Wang admit the research still has some way to go and doesn\u2019t yet include such important components of a wine\u2019s structure as tannins, viscosity, oak, alcohol level (or the more nebulous \u201clength\u201d of the aftertaste or the effects of age). We are, in other words, some way off scientifically precise wine-and-music matches. In the meantime, I can confirm one thing from my own amateur \u201cresearch\u201d: drink enough white burgundy of an evening, and anything \u2013 even Simple Minds \u2013 starts to sound pretty good.</p> <p><strong>Vi\u00f1a Leyda Pinot Noir Reserva, Leyda, Chile 2014 </strong>(\u00a39.75, <a href=\"http://www.oddbins.com/leyda-reserve-pinot-noir\">Oddbins</a>)</p> <p>Oddbins suggests matching this superbly crafted Chilean pinot, with its racy freshness and delicious berry fruit, with Tom Jones and Cerys Matthews\u2019s cover of Baby It\u2019s Cold Outside, a reference both to the wine\u2019s jaunty character and the \u201ccool\u201d Pacific-influenced climate of its origins.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNWsk6AUqGU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wNWsk6AUqGU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p><strong>AJ Adam Hofberg Kabinett, Mosel, Germany 2014 </strong>(\u00a322.50, <a href=\"http://shop.thesampler.co.uk/store/product/12220/AJ-Adam-Hofberg-Kabinett-2014/\">The Sampler</a>)</p> <p>Superb single-vineyard riesling from a rising star in Germany\u2019s Mosel region.

And if you are, can you distinguish worry from anxiety, and regular, bearable anxiety from a disorder?<br /></p> <p>According to Laura Whitehead, the partnerships manager of <a href=\"https://www.anxietyuk.org.uk/\">Anxiety UK</a>, anxiety becomes a problem when it is disproportionate to the risk or obstacle that causes it. She advises observing when worry begins to interfere with daily life. \u201cIf you start to lose interest in what you would usually be doing, if you\u2019re noticing physical pain or rapid heartbeat, if you\u2019re finding excuses not to go places because you\u2019re worried about certain things occurring \u2026\u201d The physical manifestations include trembling, headache, pins and needles, sweating, stomach ache, muscular pain, excessive tiredness or awakeness and a change in appetite.</p> <p>These symptoms seem common enough for most people to claim a few. But begin to look for them and you might spur a hyper-vigilance which itself induces anxiety, causing more symptoms to present. You can see how anxiety spirals. Why are these such anxious times?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jan/05/scott-stossel-my-age-anxiety-extract\">My anxious life in an age of anxiety</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Obvious social, cultural and economic factors include the financial crisis of 2008 \u2013 the year when the word \u201canxiety\u201d reaches its highest frequency since 1860, according to <a href=\"https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=anxiety&amp;year_start=1800&amp;year_end=2016&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=3&amp;share=&amp;direct_url=t1%3B%2Canxiety%3B%2Cc0\">Google Ngram</a> \u2013 and the subsequent austerity, overwork, unemployment and unaffordable housing. <a href=\"http://www.ruthwhippman.com/\">Ruth Whippman</a>, the author of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Pursuit-Happiness-Making-Anxious/dp/0091959152\">The Pursuit of Happiness and why it\u2019s Making us Anxious</a>, adds the search for happiness to the list \u2013 because \u201cthe expectations of how happy you should be are so high, you always feel you are falling short\u201d. From global terrorism to loneliness, there is a worry to suit us all. And a drug, too: maybe the pharmacological companies are the big winners of rampant anxiety.</p> <p>Cynics may think those who report anxiety overstate their worry because they have nothing better to fret about. (This view is complicated by the fact that cynicism is sometimes a coping mechanism for anxiety.) Even Stossel, despite having been diagnosed as having several anxiety disorders including specific phobias, doesn\u2019t rule it out. He thinks that \u201cthe critics who say this is invented are wrong, but not completely wrong \u2026 If you lived in the middle ages, you were born what you were born and you did what you did. It may be that some increase in the quantum of overall anxiety is the price we pay for more economic freedom, more choice.\u201d</p> <p>As a clinical condition, anxiety is fairly young \u2013 even 30 years ago, it did not exist in the US. But while the terminology has changed, the experience itself is ancient. Witness the work of writers through Auden, Freud, Kierkegaard and Darwin to Hippocrates in the fourth century BC. \u201cWhich suggests to me,\u201d Stossel says, \u201cthat even though it can get filtered through culture, it\u2019s a condition that has been with us since humans emerged.\u201d</p> <p>Maybe the difference is that people are now more attuned to anxiety. \u201cThey may be more willing to recognise it as a problem,\u201d says <a href=\"http://www.kcl.ac.uk/ioppn/depts/psychology/research/ResearchGroupings/CADAT/About-Us/Staff.aspx\">Nick Grey</a>, the joint clinical director of the Centre For Anxiety Disorders and Trauma at King\u2019s College London. After all, it is less of a taboo to be stressed than depressed. To be busy is to be valued. And anxiety can be stimulating, especially if <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/03/can-three-words-turn-anxiety-into-success/474909/\">reframed as excitement</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/16/what-is-it-like-to-live-with-an-anxiety-disorder\">What is it like to live with an anxiety disorder?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the UK, general practitioners wait six months before diagnosing anxiety. For some sufferers, the most effective recourse is pharmacological. For others, simple changes make a huge difference. Address sleep deficiency. Exercise. Seek <a href=\"https://www.anxietyuk.org.uk/\">help</a>. Eat a proper meal, even when busy. Start yoga. And, in the moment when anxiety strengthens its grip, when you can\u2019t find air for worry, Stossel advises: \u201cAs much as possible, be in the present \u2013 the feel of your arm on the chair, your feet on the floor. Don\u2019t fight anxiety, but allow it to crash over you, knowing it will pass.\u201d There is one last recommendation that might help everyone.

I was a cool baby and a mellow kid and a chilled-out teen and when things went sideways \u2013 such as the time I plopped my purse on top of my car and drove away in an unfamiliar area of Los Angeles, or the time I had to decide whether or not to put my parents\u2019 dog to sleep while they were in Botswana, or the time my drunk friend fell ass-first through the glass coffee table \u2013 I\u2019d make sure no one was dead (minus the dog), mutter some combination of \u201cproblems have solutions\u201d and \u201cthey can\u2019t all be winners\u201d, and triage each disaster like the Fonz. Not saying I always nailed it, but I never panicked.</p> <p>I think that\u2019s because I was an impeccably cared-for child raised by an overpreparer (Mom) and an improviser (Dad), and, to the best of their abilities, they insulated my formative years from chaos and pain. I always felt safe. I had fears, of course. I feared my parents\u2019 deaths obsessively, which manifested in crystalline dreams from which I\u2019d wake up sobbing. Later, I feared being unlovable and alone for ever, which wasn\u2019t an acute worry so much as a crushing, persistent sense of doom. But I didn\u2019t develop sick, fluttery, asphyxiating anxiety until decades later \u2013 oddly, until I\u2019d lived through a parent\u2019s death and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/21/my-wedding-perfect-fat-woman\">married my very best friend</a>, replacing those old fears with something foreign and unexpected: the anxiety of having something to take care of, and something to lose.</p> <p>I am so happy now, and I am so afraid. I\u2019m afraid every time my husband drives or flies or walks home alone late at night. From the moment he\u2019s out of my sight, my brain cycles reflexively through a laundry list of potential perils \u2013 carbon monoxide leaks, brain aneurysms, racism, ice \u2013 until he\u2019s back again. When he\u2019s out of town, I\u2019m afraid that an electrical short circuit will burn down his hotel, or he\u2019ll slip in the shower, or choke on food and no one will be there to save him. As vacation nears, I silently list all the ways that famous people have died (skiing into a tree, falling off a boat, swimming in Australia) and subtly discourage my family from having those kinds of fun. I blurt \u201cdrive safe\u201d any time anyone leaves a room; I always unplug the toaster and I don\u2019t even know why.</p> <p>The happier I get, the more fixated I am on catastrophe.

Each year, you feel less invincible and more overwhelmed. People you know die. People your age die. Part of it is responsibility: I had plenty to lose as a kid, but it wasn\u2019t my responsibility to protect. Now I have kids in my care. Now I\u2019m the net. And part of it is love. I just love them all so much. I don\u2019t believe in heaven. I only get one life with these people.</p> <p>I wish I could say I had a brilliant coping strategy beyond chamomile tea, breathing and calling once every 30 seconds until my husband or my mother or my stepdaughter finally picks up to reassure me that, no, they weren\u2019t the source of those sirens I just heard. Statistics help. Did you know that you are tremendously unlikely to be killed by a bear, or a murderer, or a jinx that you triggered by voicing a bunch of your deepest fears in a newspaper column? I like to tell myself: \u201cIt would be an impossible coincidence for the exact thing you\u2019re thinking of to actually happen,\u201d as though my anxiety itself somehow makes disaster less likely. Sometimes I find crowds comforting. Well, I think, just look at all these people who aren\u2019t dead!</p> <p>I have a test coming up. My husband is going to Nigeria for a month to visit family, so I\u2019ll have to get used to disconnection and uncertainty. We\u2019ll be able to check in once a day, maybe twice. He\u2019ll be navigating massive, unfamiliar cities, tromping through the countryside to visit his family\u2019s village, inevitably forgetting to wear his mosquito repellant. He doesn\u2019t leave for a month and I\u2019m already cycling: he\u2019ll get lost, he\u2019ll get sick, he\u2019ll get cavalier and make some irreversible mistake without me there to warn him.</p> <p>But he\u2019ll also be meeting dozens (if not hundreds) of family members for the first time, connecting with people who really knew his father, feeling the embrace of a country that has shaped his entire life from 7,000 miles away. At first, I tried to wheedle him into going for only three weeks; his brother, aghast, protested: \u201cBut I have 31 days of activities planned!\u201d What kind of monster argues with 31 days of activities? What kind of fool wastes time worrying about hypotheticals when the person she loves the most has real food to eat, real music to play, real siblings to meet?</p> <p>I don\u2019t want to keep us from living in the service of keeping us alive.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e1c8030883c44c89e1de6786884fc54076ef66c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e1c8030883c44c89e1de6786884fc54076ef66c2/1_0_5330_3200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"anxiety\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Chitra Ramaswamy: \u2018I\u2019m anxious about losing the roof over my head\u2019</h2> <p>I remember the first time I peered inside my toilet cistern. There it was: the deep pool of water quivering in expectation of a flush (or perhaps because of the dodgy foundations of our building?), ballcock bobbing like a buoy, that valve thingy. I flushed and as the water rushed away and began to rise again, my panic surged with it. So many litres for so little wee! And could this wobbly little mechanism really be responsible for sending all the world\u2019s waste away? It felt like relying on an arsey robin with one wing to deliver the mail. I closed the cistern. Wished I could unsee what I had seen.<br /></p> <p>When it comes to bricks and mortar, knowledge for me is anxiety rather than power. The more I know about how my boiler works, the more I realise the ease with which I could be gassed on my sofa at night. Which is why, after our boiler exploded years ago, we decided to get a carbon monoxide alarm. It should really have been marketed as an anxiety-inducer. It beeped intermittently and flashed a worrying green. I wouldn\u2019t have been surprised if it was secretly monitoring our heart rates. We got rid of it in the end.</p> <p>Home is where the heart is, for sure, but it is the heart that houses the panic attack. So I think of a roof over my head and see leaks. See a nail going into a wall and consider dry rot. Feel the ground beneath my feet and remember that scene in The Money Pit when Tom Hanks pours a final kettle of water in the bath then watches the tub fall through the floor. Ever since our family home was repossessed when I was 12, I have found houses and flats \u2013 only the ones I live in, mind \u2013 to be weak, unreliable, the old friend you can never truly trust.</p> <p>The first flat I got a mortgage on was in Glasgow, at the top of an old building. I bawled outside the estate agent\u2019s and refused to go in and get the keys. That\u2019s how happy I was to become what has long been considered one of the most revered things to be in our society: a homeowner. Whenever it rained \u2013 which in Glasgow was pretty much every day \u2013 I freaked out about the roof tiles (not that I could go up in the loft and check them \u2013 TOO MANY SPIDERS). In Edinburgh, where I now live in a building that has been standing for more than 150 years (so it must be about to fall down), the wind is the power in my anxiety generator. On really stormy nights, when a gale off the Firth swaggers up our street, the lights attached to our flat\u2019s outside walls judder and sway and I watch them from our windows, imagining them breaking away, smashing the glass, and \u2026 what? Killing me, I suppose. That\u2019s the thing about anxiety. It trades on abominable but vague future threats that are absurd when you speak them out loud. Which is precisely why it\u2019s such a good idea to do so.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f95020a4f8fa913729121a293edbd77fe3305dd0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f95020a4f8fa913729121a293edbd77fe3305dd0/1_0_5330_3200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"anxiety\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <h2>Michael Hann: \u2018I suffer social phobia \u2013 a fear of being called on to perform\u2019</h2> <p>I don\u2019t suffer everyday anxiety, or panic attacks. I worry about things, to an extent that makes me unhappy, but that\u2019s not the biggest problem for me. What I identify as anxiety takes the form of months-long periods of catastrophic fear, falling years apart. I become unable to eat more than the bare minimum, my sleep suffers and I find the prospect of pretty much everything terrifying.<br /></p> <p>My first spell of anxiety is the easiest to explain. It was the approach to my A-levels and I knew I hadn\u2019t revised enough. Cue the only spell of panic attacks I ever had: waking up in the morning, unable to breathe. In what I now recognise as being a means of trying to gain control over something, anything (and in a way that reflects being an arsehole teenager), I found that the only thing that would calm me was to go out for long walks in the twilight, committing petty acts of vandalism against what I perceived of as bastions of privilege: hiding the bunker rakes from the local golf club in the hedgerows, for example. Then the exams were done, and the fear faded.</p> <p>There have been three subsequent spells, all much longer, and each time my anxiety has manifested itself in social phobia. I fear going out, being called on to perform. All I want to do is lie on the sofa; those are the only times I can free myself from the world. Social phobia \u2013 my need to be in complete control of my environment \u2013 doesn\u2019t just incapacitate me; it causes problems for those around me. When my wife and I first started seeing each other, more than 20 years ago, she was horrified at one dinner party when I had to leave the table and lie on the bathroom floor for half an hour, just long enough to top up my internal batteries for the last part of the evening.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/sep/15/anxiety-epidemic-gripping-britain\">Living with anxiety: Britain's silent epidemic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>My last attack, in the autumn of 2013 and spring of 2014, was the worst yet. It lasted long enough to topple over into depression, and for months all I could think of was my desire to be in a coma. Nothing mattered to me. Nothing made me happy. For the first time, I began to worry it would never pass. I began to wonder if it was really worth living like this. I needed to stop feeling.</p> <p>Next month brings the greatest challenge I\u2019ve yet faced. Even though I am the Guardian\u2019s music editor, I have always refused to go to Glastonbury. Just the thought of being among 170,000 people in a field for several days, with no escape, fills me with dread. I can feel my palms prickle just writing a sentence about it. This year, though, I suspect there is no alternative. I\u2019m really not sure how I\u2019m going to get through it, despite friends telling me how great it is, what a brilliant time I\u2019ll have. They don\u2019t quite get that I\u2019m not worried about it being rubbish; I\u2019m worried about <em>me</em> being rubbish.</p> <p>At this point, you might think I\u2019d have sought serious therapy to work out what is at the root of it all. And a couple of years back, when I did see a therapist for a while, I was told it all related to my childhood. Well, I thought, doesn\u2019t it always? I was happier with Sertraline. Perhaps the day will come when I feel I really do need to talk. But goodness only knows what misery I will have let myself go through to reach that point.</p> <h2>Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett: \u2018Post-traumatic stress disorder has left me on constant alert\u2019</h2> <p>How does post-traumatic stress disorder feel? To me, it\u2019s the closest I will ever come to being a caveperson. Though I am a modern, civilised, 21st-century young woman, there is a pesky corner that still thinks it is roaming the terrifying landscape our ancestors navigated thousands of years ago. As hard as I might try, this primitive, instinctive side of me is calling the shots, at the expense of almost all rational thought. Day-to-day existence is, as a result, quite difficult. It\u2019s upsetting, to be sure, but it\u2019s also extremely tedious.<br /></p> <p>Being confronted with the very real possibility that you might die, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/26/post-traumatic-stress-disorder-treated-not-erased\">as I was in 2010 when a man tried to strangle me to death</a> as I walked home, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/20/defiance-paris-attacks-survivors-inspiration\">then again while visiting Paris</a> last November, can do extremely funny things to your brain. There was a gap of five years between these events and, by last year, I was at a point where I felt that I had largely recovered from the anxiety disorder the first assault caused. Unfortunately, the terrorist attacks that I was so unlucky to be affected by have revived a lot of my previous symptoms. In fact, this is an understatement: they are a hundred times worse.</p> <p>No matter how many people attempt to convince me otherwise, the atavistic part of me is convinced I am going to die. Naturally, like many people I have spoken to, I am terrified that another terrorist attack will happen in London. But I struggle to control that fear, which makes being out and about very difficult. Everywhere I go, I scan for the exit. Without logic, I fixate on people who I decide are behaving suspiciously, convinced they have a gun, or a bomb. I avoid the city centre. I struggle with public transport, crying uncontrollably on trains, even after taking Valium, and go nowhere near the tube. Over the Christmas holidays, I was left breathless with fear by a low-flying helicopter above my house. There are nightmares.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/commentisfree/2016/may/07/mental-health-policy-anxiety-natasha-devon-young-people\">Only fundamental social change can defeat the anxiety epidemic</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rationally, I know what is going on. My fight-or-flight response is misfiring, perceiving threats where there are none. But knowing this makes very little difference. It feels horribly, lawlessly base. A loud noise sees me shoot up from my seat like a startled rabbit. My heart quickens, my whole body shakes and I\u2019m horribly dizzy. I move through the world with the hyper-vigilance of stalked prey in a nature documentary. It is faintly ridiculous, and I am ashamed. I feel pathetic, worthless, that I cannot get on a train or sit in a busy bar with my friends, all of whom have been very understanding and often come to me so we can see each other. I worry that their patience will run out.</p> <p>I have always been a worrier (it runs in the family), but this is some next-level anxiety. In an attempt to rationalise why I unconsciously feel under attack, my conscious mind keeps trying to come up with reasons for my imminent death. So I decide I have the symptoms of life-threatening diseases that I research for hours on the internet, then head to the GP or urgent care centre only to be told I am fine. I fear everyone I love dying, too: every ring of the phone, every unanswered call or text, means catastrophe. Everywhere I look, I see impending-doom scenarios. It is exhausting.</p> <p>The thing is, I know I will get better. I got better before. Time, and a significant amount of reprogramming of what my therapist calls \u201cautomatic maladaptive thoughts\u201d is required. The trauma-focused CBT that I previously had through the NHS honestly saved my life. It is an approach that suits me in its practicality. Several psychotherapists have tried to suggest my anxiety is a result of a traumatic childhood, and have avoided the topic of my assault, or the terrorist attack, almost entirely. While I do think I am prone to anxiety \u2013 and the lack of stability I feel in my life generally doesn\u2019t help with this \u2013 it is clear to me what is going on: I was afraid for my life. I thought I would die, but I didn\u2019t. This will take a while, and a bit of help, to get over.</p> <p>To achieve this, I will not wrap myself in cotton wool, protecting myself from \u201ctriggers\u201d (though a bit of a news detox has helped a little). I will do my best not to accommodate my anxiety, avoiding situations that I am convinced might kill me. I will not waste the time I have on this Earth feeling frightened all the time, because it has got to the point where I feel a life lived in thrall to anxiety is not one worth living. And as one therapist I saw said, life is brilliant and exceptional, and I should get to experience that again. I know that one day I will.</p>",

WNO\u2019s latest premiere \u2013 composer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/may/05/classical-concerts-opera-summer-2016-john-luther-adams-iain-banks\">Iain Bell</a>\u2019s setting of the epic poem <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poets/detail/david-jones\">In Parenthesis</a> by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/10/soldier-poet-painter-david-jones-britains-outsider\">David Jones</a>, is a brave, emphatic statement of intent. Everything about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/14/william-tell-review-welsh-national-opera-rossini\">David Pountney</a>\u2019s direction, Robert Innes Hopkins\u2019 design, Carlo Rizzi\u2019s conducting and the strong cast bespeaks total commitment.</p> <p>The story is Jones\u2019 attempt to counter the trauma of the first world war\u2019s slaughter of innocents by invoking the humanity of those he had fought alongside with. (The WNO opera is allied to the UK-wide <a href=\"http://www.1418now.org.uk/\">14-18 Now</a> programme.) Seeking to examine the essence of life and regeneration rather than that of conflict, Jones translates himself into John Ball, clumsy private, possessed of two left feet, an innocent Johnny Head-in-Air whose natural condition \u2013 to adapt Robert Frost \u2013 is poetry, not soldiering. Jones is also reflected in Dai Greatcoat, the archetypal Everysoldier who has fought in all battles since time immemorial. As Dai, Donald Maxwell\u2019s bravado boasting \u2013 in duet with Graham Clark\u2019s Marne Sergeant \u2013 conjures vivid images, while the moments of greatest compassion are the small gestures and kindnesses imbued with a sacramental quality, the Catholicism to which Jones became a convert.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"b728a9e1323ba4564ba6d9ab1976205d1711009d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b728a9e1323ba4564ba6d9ab1976205d1711009d/0_0_4016_2410/1000.jpg\" alt=\"In Parenthesis with Alexandra Deshorties, right.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In Parenthesis with Alexandra Deshorties, right.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bill Cooper</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The libretto by David Antrobus and Emma Jenkins retains enough of Jones at his most lyrical to honour his intentions. Many of the myriad historical and mythological allusions resonate, with lines from the medieval Welsh poem <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://faculty.arts.ubc.ca/sechard/492godo.htm\">Y Gododdin</a> appearing as leitmotif. But the librettists go a step further in turning to a later Jones drawing, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.artfund.org/supporting-museums/art-weve-helped-buy/artwork/2034/epiphany-1941-britannia-and-germania-embracing-david-jones\">Epiphany 41, Brittania and Germania Embracing</a>, for their two bardic figures who represent the two nations. Sung by Peter Coleman-Wright and Alexandra Deshorties, they are comparable to Britten\u2019s male and female chorus in The Rape of Lucretia. That symbolic embrace is periodically echoed: in a kiss; in Christmas morning\u2019s Es ist ein Ros entsprungen heard from over the enemy lines; and in the transformation of Deshorties\u2019 Bard of Germania into the Queen of the Woods, anointing the soldiers slain at Mametz. Thus both Christianity and a pantheistic aura combine in the final garlanding of the dead and the Marian hymn Salve Regina.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMniIaU2zOI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/eMniIaU2zOI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Director David Poutney and others on creating In Parenthesis</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Iain Bell\u2019s instinct for words and vocal line is apparent, evocative when moving into John Ball\u2019s more hallucinatory state with orchestration that is sparse and otherworldly. The music conceived on a more bombastic scale is less convincing, and the female Chorus of Remembrance \u2013 already a slightly invasive presence \u2013 are overwhelming when they reappear as Dryads. If the score ultimately lacks the emotional impact the subject demands, the WNO\u2019s achievement should not be understated. Two things emerge: the extraordinary vision that is Jones\u2019s legacy in art and literature; and the talent of tenor Andrew Bidlack who, as Private Ball, sings heroically.</p> <p>\u2022 At Millennium Centre, Cardiff, 21 May and 3 June.

      "body": "<p><strong>John Birt was director general of the BBC from 1992 to 2000 </strong></p> <p>The storm engulfing the BBC has abated, and the damage can now be assessed. Two issues matter above all others.</p> <p>A second raid in five years on the BBC\u2019s finances will mean a vast reduction in investment in original British production. With ITV and Channel 4 themselves investing progressively less - as unavoidable technology change bites into their economics - we are witnessing the long-term decline of UK production, and the slow destruction of nearly a century of inspired policy innovation in UK broadcasting \u2013 a system which has created by far the most successful stage for national expression and creativity on the globe. And no UK political party is addressing this impending national disaster.</p> <p>We have also discovered that a royal charter, far from safeguarding the BBC\u2019s independence, opens the way for British governments, like medieval kings, to have their way in privy council, to meddle with and fundamentally to change one of our most important institutions with no accountability to parliament whatsoever. Amendments were made mid-charter, for instance, to shift responsibility for funding World Service from the tax-payer to the domestic licence-payer. Ministers have dipped into the licence-fee pot to fund pet schemes the BBC itself would never have deemed suitable for licence funding. The BBC must now enjoy the protection of parliament and of statute.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54e54852ee731d5570b1be795da4fe90ac061d6e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54e54852ee731d5570b1be795da4fe90ac061d6e/0_0_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Miriam O\u2019Reilly in Costing the Earth\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Miriam O\u2019Reilly in Costing the Earth</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Miriam O\u2019Reilly was a presenter of Countryfile who successfully sued the BBC for age discrimination</strong></p> <p>I was pleased to read the corporation will be required to give greater focus to under-served audiences, because it is being far too slow in doing this.</p> <p>The requirement will not go down well with the creatives who will not want to be made to consider whether their \u201cvision\u201d for a programme reflects its audience - but they have brought this upon themselves.</p> <p>I have heard a lot of management talk since winning my ageism case against the broadcaster in 2011 about including more older female faces but very little has changed. A Lords communications committee report found it had an \u201cinformal policy\u201d of discrimination against older women. Nothing is being done to tackle this. During my tribunal, the then controller of BBC Daytime was asked why he had given an on-screen role to a young, pretty, blond presenter when there were others with equal or more experience. He replied, \u201cBecause I liked the look of her [see footnote].\u201d If personal preferences of this sort dictate who we end up watching on TV - and they do - no wonder the BBC has a diversity problem.</p> <p>Our national broadcaster makes a lot of noise about its commitment to diversity but we as viewers are just not seeing it - this is why I would welcome diversity being enshrined in the new BBC charter.</p> <p><strong>Richard Ayre is a BBC trustee and a former deputy chief executive of BBC News</strong></p> <p>The white paper calls for even greater financial transparency from the BBC, imposing the National Audit Office as the corporation\u2019s auditor. So when it comes to funding the BBC, let\u2019s have the same transparency. Let the new charter commit governments to proposing the right level of the BBC\u2019s future funding; let the BBC and independent scrutiny assess the consequences of that funding; let the public have their say about what they\u2019re willing to pay, and then let parliament debate the proposition \u2013 publicly, transparently.</p> <p>It\u2019s good that a new BBC board will have the ability to push ahead with our drive for greater distinctiveness in programming. But the BBC must still appeal to everyone, because everyone pays, and the interests of the audience must come ahead of the interests of commercial broadcasters who want less competition. Ofcom is to be charged with assessing BBC distinctiveness, and the government will give them \u201cguidance\u201d on \u201ccontent requirements and performance metrics\u201d. Benign? Maybe. Deeply troubling? Possibly. Licence fee payers\u2019 number one requirement from the BBC is that it should entertain them, and it\u2019s far from clear that ministers or civil servants have a better idea of how to deliver distinctive entertainment than the people at the BBC. There is much work still to be done.</p> <p><strong>Armando Iannucci is a satirist, writer, television director and radio producer</strong><br /></p> <p>Well, the good news is we\u2019re well away from last summer\u2019s anti-BBC shouting. The most draconian suggestions aired last year - cutting the BBC down to size, closing down networks, selling off stations - had all gone. But a lot of damage has been done to our TV industry by the prolonged uncertainty whipped up along the way. The priority now is to repair that damage, and go out and sell the BBC to the international market. Encourage it to make money from its content abroad, which can be plugged back into production at home.</p> <p>That means persuading the government to change its public attitude to the BBC. If the corporation is as wonderful as the white paper says it is, then ministers need to show they believe it. You can\u2019t praise BBC drama in one breath, but then denigrate those who make it as \u201cleftwing luvvies\u201d in another. If you support the content, you need to support the people responsible for it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"765c40d87722c112e8ee9216606f31bf2a816457\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/765c40d87722c112e8ee9216606f31bf2a816457/0_0_2043_1226/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Thick Of It\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Thick Of It</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Mike Hogan/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Diane Coyle is an economist and former deputy chair of the BBC Trust </strong></p> <p>The erosion of the BBC\u2019s independence has been under way for years: the inexcusably rushed and non-transparent licence fee settlement last year; repeated top-slicing of licence fee funds; the classification of the BBC as part of general government spending; and the frequent requests for appearances at parliamentary committees. It is not much comfort that the white paper could have been worse. It still marks a further erosion of BBC independence. Highest profile is the question of how many board members the government can appoint, which Tony Hall has rightly indicated is not settled. This government has placed supporters in every senior public appointment; and it is now unlikely any government will restore the former non-partisan appointments process.</p> <p>There will be a five-year \u201chealth check\u201d on BBC performance. What chance politicians will not use this as an opportunity for more top-slicing for pet projects? The new charter must also set clear limits on the National Audit Office\u2019s oversight of BBC activities to protect editorial independence, and it should report to the BBC board, not to parliament. What will the \u201cguidance\u201d to Ofcom about the distinctiveness of the BBC\u2019s output say, exactly? How will Ofcom and the BBC engage with each other in practice?</p> <p>Above all, what will the process for renewing and setting the licence fee (or subsequent funding methods) be? The BBC should be more transparent about how it spends its funds, but the government also needs to commit to an orderly and open debate about BBC funding. Licence fee payers overwhelmingly want the level decided independently. At a minimum there must be a proper process.</p> <p><strong>Michael Foster is an agent to BBC stars such as Chris Evans and a founder of Creative Access</strong></p> <p>The BBC is in a very good position to absorb the pretty hard and spot on, body blows inflicted by the white paper\u2019s demands for greater diversity and in its offer to the Bame community who are presently very poorly served by the licence fee.</p> <p>Tony Hall and James Harding have acted over the past two years in anticipation of what they realised would be expected of the BBC at charter renewal in terms of diversity following its appalling inaction on diversity under Greg Dyke and Mark Thompson.</p> <p>All of the BBC ancien regime\u2019s HR team has been pushed aside in the past two years, a diversity team with real bite and spending power has been put in place and over 60 BAME graduate interns taken on within the last year. More BAME interns alongside the normal intake will come this year and next and an apprenticeship scheme for BAME school leavers will also change socio-economic diversity in an organisation where over 65% of the workforce have degrees (the norm in British industry is 28%). It will not be until these BAME youngsters assume positions of executive power over commissioning and casting that we as a society will see the real long-term effects of these changes. Meanwhile these internal actions and Sir Lenny Henry\u2019s external campaign have been instrumental in driving more investment in productions by BAME companies and many more BAME people fronting drama, entertainment and news. Independent companies who supply programmes to the BBC will be from 2017 mandated to employ many more Bame members of staff in a scheme copied from the very successful Channel 4 two tick system.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/12/director-general-fears-ministerial-influence-over-bbc-in-white-paper\">BBC chief voices fears over ministerial influence outlined in white paper</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>David Puttnam is the former deputy chairman of Channel 4, who is chairing an inquiry into public service broadcasting</strong></p> <p>While the more apocalyptic predictions may not have been realised, there\u2019s still a need to remain vigilant about threats to the BBC\u2019s independence, as well as its ability long term to operate as a universal public service broadcaster. The most pressing issue is that the proposals for appointments to the new unitary board mean government appointees will, for the first time, sit at the heart of the BBC\u2019s operational and editorial decision-making structures.</p> <p>I\u2019m particularly troubled by this in the light of recent situations in which a number of European governments have been able to place undue pressure on public broadcasters specifically through the appointments process.</p> <p>I\u2019d like to see an appointments process that is not contaminated by the possibility of \u201cpolitical or personal patronage\u201d, the phrase used by the former commissioner for public appointments, Sir David Normington, when setting out his own concerns.</p> <p>It\u2019s also vital that Ofcom has a remit explicitly recognising the BBC\u2019s unique position as a universal public service broadcaster, one that prevents rivals from vexatiously calling for sanctions because the BBC is being insufficiently \u201cdistinctive\u201d \u2013 a word that rather chillingly recurs throughout the white paper. The paper also rejects the proposal that the licence fee should be set by an independent body, but I remain unconvinced that limited parliamentary scrutiny will ever be sufficient to make the process fully transparent. Finally, I\u2019m concerned by any diminution of the public purpose on \u201ctechnological innovation\u201d. The BBC has a strong record in this area, and it would be a huge loss to both licence payers and the industry if the BBC was not tasked with developing new technologies that could operate in the broad public interest.</p> <p><strong>Jimmy Mulville is a comedian, comedy writer, producer and TV presenter who co-founded Hat Trick Productions</strong><br /></p> <p>The white paper appears to more of a white flag waved by a minister who underestimated the love both the industry and public have for the BBC. As a result there is no question that the BBC has emerged largely unscathed from this charter review. For that I think the creative community within the television industry and public alike will be grateful. Ironically I think the overtly aggressive and bullying position assumed by the increasingly ludicrous John Whittingdale backfired. He overplayed his hand, quickly showing himself to be a playground bully.</p> <p>The recommendation that high salaries be published is an interesting one. It speaks to the current increased antipathy towards the wealthy. We all know that the public generally think television people are over-paid egomaniacs. Is this move to \u201cout\u201d the big earners a plot to shame both the talent and the BBC to accept less after the ensuing predictable Daily Mail outrage?</p> <p>The great thing to come out of this review is that the question of the licence fee has been shelved for a decade. Everyone needs to start seeing this comparatively small charge as a great deal for the audience. At 42p a day for all its radio, television and online services the BBC is still the best value for money on the broadcasting landscape. It\u2019s a failing of generations of BBC management that this message is not seared into the public consciousness. We should stop calling this a public tax and see it as an annual insurance payment against the loss of our possibly most important cultural asset.</p> <p>But what does the call for more distinctive content mean? Is this another way of telling the BBC not to compete with its commercial rivals? If so this should be resisted. The BBC keeps everyone else honest. It has to be able to commission not just niche programming which no one else would touch, but also big crowd pleasers against which the rest have to measure themselves. Now that the the Sword of Whittingdale has been removed from above its head, let\u2019s hope our BBC can flourish in a more certain future.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6ebb3c25ef6826055c15070eb0e116dbbafa4648\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ebb3c25ef6826055c15070eb0e116dbbafa4648/171_0_2681_1609/1000.jpg\" alt=\"2012 Olympics\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">2012 Olympics</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Roger Mosey is a former controller of BBC Radio 5 Live and head of BBC Television News</strong></p> <p>The most obvious bear-trap in the coming weeks is the EU referendum. The BBC has made a confident start \u2013 it\u2019s being accused, if anything, of being too impartial \u2013 but if the polls remain close then the pressure will grow. I\u2019d be keeping a keen eye on the audience debate programmes which can easily go wrong, and especially the grandiose Wembley event close to polling day. Then there could be further tests of impartiality around any government changes or the future of the opposition, where the BBC \u2013 like much of the rest of the media \u2013 has struggled with the Corbyn phenomenon. Not forgetting, of course, the American election in which explaining the inexplicable Trump will not be easy.</p> <p>Though special programmes are helping shake up stale schedules in peak hours, the BBC should be planning to refresh its programming \u2013 especially on BBC1. It\u2019s time to lead some of the old warhorses out to pasture. But I\u2019m worried about the challenges facing BBC Studios: this is going to be difficult to make work for a whole variety of structural and creative reasons. I\u2019m also unconvinced about \u201ccompete and compare\u201d in radio, where the old model wasn\u2019t broken so there was no need to fix it.</p> <p>Finally, I hope the biggest opportunity for the BBC will be in the Olympics and Euro 2016 where they can show that nobody beats them in sports coverage \u2013 and audiences will again unite around those huge events.</p> <p>\u2022 The following footnote was appended to this article on 9 June 2016: After this article was published, the BBC contacted us to say \u201cThe BBC categorically denies that this quote is accurate\u201d.</p>",

At the age of 38, having defeated Cain Velasquez to take the title 11 months ago in Mexico City, Werdum acted as carefree as any fighter could. Perhaps too much. He took to making goofy faces, a sort of silly brand identity to complement his easygoing personality. Paper cutouts of the odd expression were handed out to fans at the Arena da Baixada for Saturday\u2019s fight.

Werdum turned his march into a carnival, and even after stepping up into the cage he continued to make the face that is destined to occupy meme-makers.<br /></p> <p>With trainer Rafael Cordeiro in his corner, a man instrumental in building Curitiba into arguably the fight capital of Brazil, Werdum engaged Miocic from the opening bell, trading kicks and punches with a challenger eager to return fire.<br /></p> <p>The 240lbs Werdum proved quicker than Miocic expected, yet the challenger show more than enough skill and dexterity while moving back to remain dangerous. A pro fighter since 2010, Miocic moved well as Werdum, an elite martial artist who evolved over the past few years from a Brazilian jiu-jitsu world champion to a total fighter, recklessly charged forward.<br /></p> <p>The attack brought the fighters near the Octagon fence and the 241lbs Miocic, who wrestled and played third base for the Cleveland State University baseball team, snapped off a short right hand that shook Werdum. A few beats later <a href=\"https://vine.co/v/i0u5VBpg6WX\">a second short right cracked Werdum\u2019s jaw</a>, and at the 2:47 of the first-round mark he fell face first to the canvas. <br /></p> <p>\u201cI caught him with a good right hand,\u201d said Miocic, a son of Croatian immigrants. \u201cThank God.\u201d<br /></p> <p>The capper was more precision than power, a sign Cleveland\u2019s newest champion, now 15-2, is better than a mere puncher. \u201cCleveland we got a champion, baby!\u201d he yelled. \u201cCroatia we got a champion, baby!\u201d<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/picture/2016/may/15/sport-picture-of-the-day-ufcs-renato-moicano-takes-down-zubaira-tukhugov\">Sport picture of the day: UFC's Renato Moicano takes down Zubaira Tukhugov</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Overall, it was an evening of mixed results for the 14 Brazilians who fought in UFC\u2019s first stadium event in their country.<br /></p> <p>In the co-main event, the crowd couldn\u2019t rely on patriotism to assign their allegiances. They couldn\u2019t even claim city ties.<br /></p> <p>Ronaldo \u201cJacare\u201d Souza tore into fellow Rio de Janeiro fighter Vitor Belfort to score an emotional opening-round stoppage. Jacare (23-4) worked Belfort (25-12) over on the floor to devastating effect. The near 20-year veteran, a star from the moment he began his career, was rendered bloodied and beaten after a barrage of elbows and punches on that ended his challenge at 4:38 of the first round.<br /></p> <p>Afterwards, an animated Souza, a former Strikeforce champion until he was upended in a close decision by current UFC middleweight king Luke Rockhold, called for a title shot. \u201cI think I earned this fight,\u201d he said.<br /></p> <p>Perhaps the most raucous moment of the card for the Brazilian faithful came after Cris Cyborg entered the Octagon for the first time to somber music. It wasn\u2019t long, though, before her hometown supporters rose to their feet in wild celebration. Cyborg was hard-hitting and accurate from the opening bell. The long-reigning queen at 145lbs had agreed to a catch-weight contest at 140lbs against an outgunned and vulnerable Leslie Smith, and scored a violent win at 1:21 of the opening round.<br /></p> <p>The 30-year-old slammed fierce punches and kicks into Smith (8-7-1), who came in as the easiest fighter to hit on the card. It just so happened Cyborg (16-1) was the most accurate and active striker. That was a good or bad combination, depending on your perspective.<br /></p> <p>The victory was a resounding performance for the Curitiba fighter, who called the chance to showcase in her hometown a dream come true. Cyborg did not use the occasion to layout her future plans. Long considered the most dangerous female fighter in MMA, she passed on calling out UFC\u2019s female stars such as Ronda Rousey at 135lbs, saying instead that she was open to catch-weight contests and defending her belt at 145lbs for Invicta FC, an all-female MMA promotion affiliated with the UFC.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/04/the-fight-game-reloaded-how-mma-conquered-world-ufc\">The fight game reloaded: how MMA and UFC conquered the world | Andy Bull</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Also fighting at home, Mauricio \u201cShogun\u201d Rua (24-10) gave the Curitiba throng something to cheer when the former Pride star was announced a split decision winner over American Corey Anderson (9-2). Opening the pay-per-view card, Warlley Alves (11-1), a previously-unbeaten welterweight prospect, became the first Brazilian to lose at UFC 198. American Bryan Barberena (12-3), a tough and chippy fighter who upended Sage Northcutt\u2019s rise in January, engineered another upset, this time by decision.<br /></p> <p>On the undercard, master grappler Demian Maia won his fifth straight bout at 170lbs by subduing Matt Brown primarily from back-control with a body-lock. Brown (22-14) had no response to Maia and succumbed to a rear-naked choke at 4:31 of the third round. Maia, now 23-6, is set up to be a top contender for the UFC welterweight belt.<br /></p> <p>Maia and Cyborg stood out among the 14 Brazilian competitors assigned to UFC 198, the third stadium card for Zuffa in a year and a half. Over the course of nine contests pitting Brazilian and American fighters on Saturday, the home side went 7-2. That included important wins by bantamweight John Lineker and the old warhorse at light heavyweight, Antonio Rogerio Nogueira, on a night it was revealed his twin brother, heavyweight \u201cMinotauro\u201d Nogueira, would be inducted into the promotion\u2019s Hall of Fame in July.<br /></p> <p>Like Werdum, Nogueira won and lost UFC title belts in consecutive fights. \u201cVai Cavalo\u201d said he aimed to regain the UFC belt, which for the time being resides in Cleveland.<br /></p>",

      "body": "<p><br />The fate of two Trinidadian prisoners, both of whom have been condemned to death despite having extremely low IQs, will be decided by British judges this week. </p> <p>The two-day hearing at the judicial committee of the privy council (JCPC) in London may set an international precedent that could prevent the execution of people on death row who have been diagnosed as \u201cintellectually disabled\u201d.</p> <p>The JCPC, based in Westminster, acts as an ultimate court of appeal for smaller Commonwealth countries, including many in the Caribbean that retain capital punishment. Justices from the UK\u2019s supreme court hear its cases. </p> <p>Lester Pitman was convicted of a joint enterprise, triple killing of three Britons carried out in the island\u2019s capital, Port of Spain. In December 2001, the bodies of a former BBC newsreader, Lynette Lithgow, 51, her mother Maggie Lee, 83, and brother-in-law John Cropper, 59, were found in a blood-splattered bathroom at a 12-room bungalow. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d5f30d1bf3fb4a7c71396c00ba3af24618020ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d5f30d1bf3fb4a7c71396c00ba3af24618020ab/0_143_1568_941/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Former BBC newsreader Lynette Lithgow\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Former BBC newsreader Lynette Lithgow pictured in 1985.

All three were found with their hands tied behind their backs and their throats slit. The initial motive appeared to have been robbery. </p> <p>Pitman, who is now 36, was convicted of the killings in 2004 and sentenced to hang. The death penalty for murder is mandatory in Trinidad. Because he had waited for so many years on death row, however, his sentence was commuted in 2013 to 40 years in jail. </p> <p>At the end of the hearing, Trinidad\u2019s court of appeal declared that Pitman had previously been \u201cproperly sentenced to suffer the death penalty\u201d. </p> <p>Pitman\u2019s IQ was measured initially at 52 then at 67 \u2013 both figures are below the World Health Organisation guideline that classifies anyone with an IQ of below 70 as being \u201cintellectually disabled\u201d. His mother, Cheryl Pitman, told the Trinidad Guardian: \u201cPeople should have mercy for Lester because his IQ is very low. He thinks like a child.\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"06a62f1ebcb47d382899832321fb2827f02ef96d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06a62f1ebcb47d382899832321fb2827f02ef96d/0_12_350_438/350.jpg\" alt=\"Neil Hernandez after his arrest in 2000\" width=\"350\" height=\"438\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Neil Hernandez after his arrest in 2000. Evidence at his trial showed he had an IQ of 57.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: newsday.co.tt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Neil Hernandez was convicted of killing a woman, Christine Henry, and her six-year-old son, Philip, in the coastal village of Toco on Trinidad in May 2000. He was found to have slashed them with the cutlass he used for harvesting coconuts. Hernandez claimed he had not intended to kill them and had been tricked into signing a confession. In 2004, he was sentenced to hang. </p> <p>At a hearing in 2014 , the Trinidad appeal court commuted his death sentence to 25 years on the same principle as Pitman, that he had already spent too long on death row. Evidence given showed he had an IQ of 57. </p> <p>Delivering their decision, the appeal court judges in Port of Spain said: \u201cIf the members of this society [in Trinidad] hold the view that it is repugnant to evolving standards of decency to impose the death sentence on mentally retarded persons, then those members are entitled to make their views felt and to lobby members of parliament to introduce legislation which reflects those standards.\u201d </p> <p>An earlier Jamaican JCPC case, known as Pratt and Morgan, established in 1993 that it was \u201cinhuman or degrading punishment\u201d to impose a delay of more than five years after sentencing on anyone facing execution. </p> <p>Pitman and Hernandez are being represented at the JCPC by Saul Lehrfreund, the co-executive director of the Death Penalty Project, which is based at the London law firm Simons Muirhead and Burton, and provides free legal assistance to prisoners facing the death penalty around the world. He said: \u201cThese cases raise a novel constitutional point about the imposition of the death penalty on people who have intellectual disability. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"23dc20e4e7a20255595ef823774392b00b44e468\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/23dc20e4e7a20255595ef823774392b00b44e468/0_71_2680_1608/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The court of the judicial committee of the privy council\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The court of the judicial committee of the privy council in Westminster, London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s important for both Commonwealth countries and the wider world where the death penalty is still in use. This could establish a principle that it\u2019s cruel and unusual punishment to impose a sentence of death on someone if they are intellectually disabled or suffer from significant mental illness.\u201d </p> <p>In court, the cases will be argued by Edward Fitzgerald QC and Paul Bowen QC. Pitman\u2019s appeal is against both conviction and sentence, Hernandez\u2019s only against sentence. </p> <p>Lehrfreund added: \u201cNeither Pitman nor Hernandez are going to be executed, because the court in Trinidad has recognised they have been on death row for too long. If we are right, however, they should never have been sentenced to the cruelty of the death penalty in the first place. </p> <p>\u201cWe say there should have been a judicial determination to look into their intellectual disability before they were sentenced. If we are successful, it will create a precedent that would be persuasive and resonate in other countries [including Malaysia and Singapore] which also continue to impose mandatory death penalties for murder and other offences.\u201d </p> <p>Pitman\u2019s conviction is also being contested on the grounds that it was on the basis of joint enterprise with others \u2013 a legal principle that the UK\u2019s supreme court recently ruled had been wrongly interpreted for more than 30 years. </p> <p>Arguments over whether an IQ level of below 70 should prevent executions have also featured in US courts. Two years ago, the US supreme court reprieved a Florida man who was deemed to have the mental age of a toddler even though his IQ was just over 70. </p>",

Endings are left untied, characters nameless and one-dimensional, plots thin and haphazard. After maximalist, wholehearted novels such as <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/libra-2.html\"><em>Libra</em></a>, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/white-noise.html\"><em>White Noise</em></a><em> </em>and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/21/don-delillos-underworld-hits-home-run\"><em>Underworld</em></a>, DeLillo\u2019s austere, mindful, laconic late novellas feel, like those of Philip Roth, as if they\u2019re trying to deconstruct the machinery of fiction, to back away from the world.</p> <p><em>Zero K</em> initially seems like a break from the abstruse and impressionistic recent work. We are plunged into a vividly realised world: an underground cryonics laboratory called the Convergence, situated in a place where Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan meet, a \u201charsh geography, beyond the limits of believability or law\u201d. The narrator of nine-tenths of the novel, Jeffrey Lockhart, is the 34-year-old son of one of the Convergence\u2019s backers, Ross, who\u2019s in his 60s and a financier of fabulous wealth. Ross\u2019s second wife, Artis Martineau, was an archaeologist, but is now dying of complications from MS and has come to the Convergence to be frozen.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/06/don-delillo-kid-from-the-bronx-interview-xan-brooks\">Don DeLillo: \u2018I think of myself as the kid from the Bronx\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Towards the end of the novel, Jeffrey refers to cryonics as \u201ca form of visionary art\u201d, but this also seems to me to be a good description of DeLillo\u2019s writing. He doesn\u2019t tell stories, he summons visions. The Convergence is perched at the cusp of reality, science fiction and dreamscape, and we\u2019re never sure what in the novel draws on DeLillo\u2019s extensive research into the world of cryonics (the KrioRus site outside Moscow is clearly one model for his <em>unheimlich </em>body warehouse), and what springs from the author\u2019s visionary imagination. DeLillo is a seer \u2013 we know this from his uncanny prediction of 9/11 in <em>Players</em>, his proleptic portrait of the 2009 financial crash in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/may/04/fiction.dondelillo1\"><em>Cosmopolis </em></a>\u2013 and <em>Zero K </em>again feels like a demonstration of the way a great novelist moves one or two steps ahead of the real, constructing pathways into the future.</p> <p><em>White Noise </em>turned around the paralysing death-angst suffered by Jack and Babette Gladney. When Jack is exposed to the deadly but slow-acting Nyodene D, the abstraction of his death becomes concrete, prompting an existential crisis that propels the novel towards its violent ending. Here, it is not fear of death that appears to drive Ross and Artis in their attempt to overthrow mortality, but rather a kind of philosophical project, even a wish to construct their lives as works of radical art. \u201cYou are completely outside the narrative of what we refer to as history,\u201d one of the amorphous Convergence employees tells a group of those about to be frozen, the \u201cheralds\u201d. \u201cThere are no horizons here. We are pledged to an inwardness, a deep probing focus on who and where we are.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/aug/03/100-best-novels-underworld-don-delillo\">The 100 best novels: No 98 \u2013 Underworld by Don DeLillo (1997)</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The novel is sliced in two by an extraordinary passage, a chapter of luminous poetry told from Artis\u2019s post-frozen perspective. We realise that the preserved brains, liberated from their bodies, exist in a kind of Beckettian netherworld, a life, as one of the Convergence staff describes it later, \u201cin touch only with yourself\u201d. It is a horrifying picture of a conscience locked in on itself, freed from the final release of death, deprived of sensation, merely waiting. \u201cOn and on. Eyes closed. Woman\u2019s body in a pod.\u201d</p> <p>After this bravura performance, the novel begins to drift into more predictable territory. We join Jeffrey in New York, where he wanders into a host of DeLillo-ish careers \u2013 \u201ccross-stream pricing consultant\u201d and the like \u2013 applying for jobs he doesn\u2019t want, becoming increasingly obsessive about the locking and unlocking of doors, the turning on and off of his stove. He is haunted by a figure who seems to be praying in public, meets a woman, Emma, and her adopted son, Stak, a Ukrainian who, at 14, is learning Pashto and speaks as if he reads a lot of Don DeLillo novels. When Ross, who in the wake of Artis\u2019s not-quite-death has suffered a <em>crise d\u2019\u00e2ge</em>, suggests to Jeffrey that it is time for him to join his wife, and that Jeffrey should come to witness his father\u2019s freezing, it comes as a relief.</p> <p>At the Convergence, Jeffrey reacquaints himself with characters from his earlier visit \u2013 a monk of no fixed religion who ministers to those about to be frozen and tells obscure, suggestive stories about his early, evangelical life; a pair of twins who act as evangelists for the project, uttering bold statements about the world into which the reanimated, cyberhuman patients will emerge. As in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/mar/21/don-delillo-point-omega\"><em>Point Omega</em></a> and <em>Libra </em>DeLillo uses film to convey atmosphere, to subtly play with our experience of time within the novel. These ekphrastic images are projected on screens, which descend as Jeffrey makes his way around the underground warren of the Convergence, and move from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/bill-viola\">Bill Viola</a>-ish meditation-scapes to montages of monks self-immolating, wars in which children are killed by jackbooted soldiers, women in tears. It is as if the Convergence is seeking to convince its heralds of the need to retreat from the Earth, to hibernate until they \u201cemerge in cyberhuman form into a universe that will speak to us in a very different way\u201d.</p> <p>This is a book that is both beautiful and profound, certainly DeLillo\u2019s best since <em>Underworld</em>, and will reward repeated reading. Like Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/feb/19/features.review\"><em>Never Let Me Go</em></a><em> </em>and Atul Gawande\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/02/being-mortal-review-atul-gawande-death-palliative-care-alzheimers\"><em>Being Mortal</em></a>, it forces us to confront the spectre of our own mortality, to ask deep questions of our motives in wishing to prolong our span on Earth. We finish the novel with a sudden recognition of the kindness of death, the balm of a bounded life.</p> <p><em>Zero K is published by Picador (\u00a316.99). </em><em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/400538/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Click here to buy it for \u00a312.99</a></em></p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 16 May.

      "body": "<p>If you read the Guardian, the chances are you don\u2019t spend that much time reading <a href=\"http://www.breitbart.com/\">Breitbart</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.redstate.com/\">Red State</a>, or listening to <a href=\"http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/\">Rush Limbaugh</a> or <a href=\"http://www.hannity.com/\">Sean Hannity</a>.</p> <p>If you get most of your news from Facebook, then you might not be exposed to those sources much, either. <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/former-facebook-workers-we-routinely-suppressed-conser-1775461006\">Gizmodo reported</a> on Monday that Facebook employees had deliberately filtered out conservative sources from its trending bar. Facebook has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/12/zuckerberg-denies-facebook-bias-invites-conservatives-talk\">denied allegations</a> of bias. </p> <p>To find out what I might be missing, I have spent the last three days getting all my news from conservative media. I got rid of my <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2009/11/palin-trashes-lamestream-media-029693\">lamestream media</a> apps and went straight to the angry, rightwing source.</p> <p>One of most startling things I learned is just how willing the federal government is to waste taxpayers\u2019 money. On Tuesday, <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/10/feds-pay-researcher-have-bee-sting-his-penis/\">the Washington Times reported</a> that taxpayers had \u201cpaid for one scientist to have a bee sting his penis\u201d, in a study that had been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/sep/18/ig-nobel-prizes-2015\">reported</a> by the Guardian the year before. </p> <p>The study was conducted by a researcher named Michael L Smith, who was trying to find out which was the most painful place to be stung by a bee. The penis was the third-most painful place, behind the nose and the upper lip.</p> <p>While I didn\u2019t know about penis-bee-sting-gate, I did already know that Hillary Clinton\u2019s email server, and the problems therein, were a big deal to conservative media. </p> <p>But I hadn\u2019t realised just quite how big of a deal. Or how vague of a deal.<br /></p> <p>\u201cEmails. Clinton. Scandal. Emails. Her emails. Corrupt.\u201d</p> <p>Barely five minutes goes by on rightwing radio without Clinton\u2019s emails being mentioned. Most of the time there is no explanation of the story, or any update to the story. Instead, \u201cHillary\u2019s emails\u201d is used as a two-word dismissal of Clinton\u2019s bid for president. It\u2019s also used as a two-word reprieve for any Republican politicians, frequently invoked when discussing any Donald Trump mishap. </p> <p>\u201cDonald Trump still hasn\u2019t released his tax returns.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYeah. But Hillary\u2019s emails.\u201d</p> <p>Since Ted Cruz dropped out of the race for president, most conservative news outlets and commentators have fallen into line in backing Trump. But some are extremely sensitive about it.</p> <p>During his radio show on Thursday evening, Sean Hannity addressed people who he said were criticising him for supporting Trump. He didn\u2019t care what people were saying from their computers, he said. It didn\u2019t bother him at all. Because he had never backtracked. He had never said he wouldn\u2019t support Trump anyway. </p> <p>For a man not bothered, he certainly talked for a long time about it. I made it nearly five minutes. But it shows the toxicity around Trump, even within conservative media.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15636e00efe2b2e1dc1c3806321c4070336d5ab1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15636e00efe2b2e1dc1c3806321c4070336d5ab1/0_149_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, speaks to Sean Hannity in New York City.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, speaks to Sean Hannity in New York City.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Lamparski/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If the more mainstream of the conservative outlets are backing Trump, there are bastions of anti-Trump sentiment out there.</p> <p>One of my favourite websites became the Right Scoop. It\u2019s great. It doesn\u2019t get any scoops. Instead, it\u2019s more a series of rants written by one angry person who really hates Trump.</p> <p>Anyone who displays support for Trump is labelled a \u201cTrumpbot\u201d. Fox News personalities Tucker Carlson and Eric Bolling were <a href=\"http://therightscoop.com/trumpbot-eric-bolling-says-you-can-have-your-principles-back-after-the-election/ \">both labelled</a> Trumpbots last week for suggesting people should support the billionaire. </p> <p>One post, <a href=\"http://therightscoop.com/okay-fox-news-i-think-im-gonna-gag/ \">headlined</a>: \u201cOkay Fox News, I think I\u2019m gonna gag ...\u201d, was just a video of a Fox presenter asking Donald Trump if he thought Budweiser had changed its name to \u201cAmerica\u201d because of his campaign. Trump agreed.</p> <p>The comments section is vitriolic. Under a piece about Trump refusing to release his tax returns, Trump <a href=\"http://therightscoop.com/bombshell-of-unusual-size-mitt-romney-just-called-out-the-trumpster-on-his-taxes-again/#comment-2671232339 \">is dubbed \u201cDon the con\u201d</a> in one comment, and his missing tax returns <a href=\"http://therightscoop.com/bombshell-of-unusual-size-mitt-romney-just-called-out-the-trumpster-on-his-taxes-again/#comment-2671166812\">are compared to</a> Clinton\u2019s missing emails (there we go again) in another. And this is by conservative voters.</p> <p>Away from the political trail, one common theme among conservative media is the idea that white people are under attack in America.</p> <p>It was brought home when I was listening to New York\u2019s WOR radio on Friday. Len Berman \u2013 he\u2019s like a poor man\u2019s Rush Limbaugh \u2013 and Todd Schnitt \u2013 an extremely down-on-his-luck man\u2019s Glenn Beck \u2013 host the morning show.</p> <p>On Friday morning, the pair discussed <a href=\"http://abc7ny.com/news/police-4-more-boys-arrested-in-jewish-school-bus-fire/1335925/\">a news story</a> about a bus for a Jewish school that had been set on fire. Five boys, aged between 11 and 14, had been arrested in connection with the fire. A video accompanying the story showed that the children alleged to have caused the fire were African American.</p> <p>Berman and Schnitt posited that if the children who had set fire to the bus were white, and had been attacking a school bus for black children, there would have been more of a furore in the media.</p> <p>In this case, \u201clittle black kids\u201d had attacked white Jewish kids, Berman and Schnitt told us. But we don\u2019t hear that reported, they said. </p> <p>White people are persecuted. People of colour get a free pass. Sean Hannity had made a similar point on his show earlier in the week, when he brought up comments made by Barack Obama\u2019s national security adviser, Susan Rice. <a href=\"http:// http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/may/11/susan-rice-us-national-security-agencies-too-white/\">She had said</a> that there was a lack of diversity in key government posts.</p> <p>Hannity noted that we have been told before that the government is too white.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve heard this before: that we\u2019re cowardly when it comes to race,\u201d Hannity said. He didn\u2019t say when we had been told we are cowardly when it comes to race.</p> <p>Hannity said that African Americans only make up 12% of the population. By that measure, there have to be a lot of white people who voted for Obama. </p> <p>\u201cSo we\u2019re not that cowardly,\u201d Hannity concluded \u2013 responding to an accusation that he only had made. If the government is too white, \u201cmaybe Obama hired the wrong people\u201d, Hannity said. </p> <p>So there you go. There\u2019s no problem with race in America. At least not from the white side.</p> <p>The problem is Obama. Still. Amid all the Clinton-Trump-race-federal waste noise, Obama was the recurring theme.</p> <p>Obama is hiring the wrong people. Obama and his staff are antagonising white people.</p> <p>Obama is also running an \u201canti-American agenda\u201d, according to Mark Belling, a pundit who filled in for Rush Limbaugh on Wednesday.</p> <p>This was because the president was going to Japan to \u201capologise\u201d for bombing Hiroshima, Belling said. Belling said this despite having just played a clip in which an Obama spokesman said that the trip was not an apology.</p> <p>Limbaugh himself had told listeners on Tuesday that Obama had an anti-suburb agenda. The president is \u201cwaging war\u201d on them, Limbaugh said, by forcing developers to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2016/05/09/the_next_step_in_obama_s_war_on_suburbia\">build affordable housing</a> in some suburbs.</p> <p>\u201cThe one thing you have to understand about liberals is they hate suburbia,\u201d Limbaugh told his listeners on Tuesday. </p> <p>\u201cThey despise it. They despise suburbia because of who lives there. They despise suburbia because it exists. They despise suburbia because there\u2019s no mass transit. They despise suburbia because it\u2019s a lot of cars and SUVs and soccer moms destroying the planet by climate change.\u201d</p> <p>While it\u2019s unlikely that Obama is actually targeting suburbs, the Limbaugh rant was quite revealing in how different sides of the political spectrum see each other. It\u2019s easy to scoff at the lumping in of all liberals as hating suburbs. But is it that different from liberals characterizing Trump supporters, for example, as angry bigots who hate anything that isn\u2019t American?</p> <p>Maybe there\u2019s a lesson there for us all. Two lessons, actually. </p> <p>The second is that, in the world of rightwing media, some may like Donald Trump. Some may dislike Donald Trump. But no one likes Hillary Clinton, and, especially, no one likes Barack Obama.</p> <ul> <li><em>This article was amended on 15 May 2016 to correctly identify the Facebook feature from which conservative sources were allegedly filtered out</em></li> </ul>",

      "body": "<p>Today marks the 68th anniversary of the Palestinian Nakba (catastrophe): the Palestinians\u2019 dispossession and the loss of their homeland. Yet while the Palestinians\u2019 plight remains without redress, in the UK over the last few weeks we have witnessed a different, if related, debate, which has deflected attention to another issue; that of antisemitism in the Labour party.</p> <p>Few genuine supporters of the Palestinian cause can be ignorant of the distinction between antisemitism and anti-Zionism. Indeed, this distinction has long been part of the Palestinians\u2019 national and political discourse, and has been embraced and cultivated as a matter of demarcating a sharp line between racism and opposition to a political ideology.</p> <p>Anyone who knows anything about the history of the Palestine-Israel conflict should thus be well aware of the danger of evoking the Nazis when talking of Israel or Zionism, not only because the analogy is in principle repugnant, but because it distorts the true character of this conflict. Whatever else this may be, it is emphatically not a rerun of Hitlerite attempts at extermination.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/29/ken-livingstone-marxist-book-lenni-brenner-defence-israel-comments\">Ken Livingstone cites Marxist book in defence of Israel comments</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But whether by accident, design or sheer ignorance, the charge of antisemitism in the Labour party has raised issues that merit serious attention, despite the mudslinging, posturing and manipulation that have accompanied the debate. Why, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/29/left-jews-labour-antisemitism-jewish-identity\">some have asked</a>, is Israel being singled out for a degree of animosity that, had it been directed against, say, a black movement, the left (along with everyone else) would have recognised as a morally unacceptable racist bias? Whatever Israel\u2019s historical or current faults, the Jews who see Israel as an act of national redemption should be accorded the same respect as any other national/ethnic group. The failure to do so is itself an act of unconscionable discrimination and is the litmus test of opposition to racism.</p> <p>Seven decades after the Nakba and Israel\u2019s creation out of the debris of the Palestinian homeland, there is a valid question as to why and whether Israel is a \u201cspecial case\u201d. True, many other countries were born of a less-than-immaculate conception, but they do not receive the kind of hostility as Israel.</p> <p>But we are not talking history here. The struggle for the land of Israel/Palestine is an active and continuing one. Unlike the natives of North and South America, Australia and elsewhere, the Palestinians have yet to be defeated and subdued. Furthermore, Israel was born in the full light of the 20th century. Its actions are to be measured by contemporary mores, not by those of the 15th-19th centuries, particularly in light of Zionism\u2019s claims to be a moral force with benign intent; if so, its actions and their consequences are liable to be measured accordingly, its emphatic claim to be moral otherwise invites the charge of hypocrisy.</p> <p>Another more immediate reason for why Israel is a special case is because it is a living example of an ongoing occupying and colonising state. No other self-proclaimed western-style democracy currently claims the territory of another people as its own, or is implementing a large-scale colonial enterprise by illegally implanting its people on another\u2019s lands. This is a unique occurrence in the 21st century.</p> <p>No other self-proclaimed western-style democracy grounds its laws and political practices in ethnic/religious distinctions; no other such state sets ethnic quotas such as maintaining a 70%-30% Jews/Arabs ratio for Jerusalem or \u201cJudaising\u201d Galilee, or rejects the notion that it is a \u201cstate for all its citizens\u201d. No other leader of a western-style democracy would survive the gumption of evoking the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/17/binyamin-netanyahu-israel-arab-election\">indigenous population\u2019s participation in the democratic process as a threat</a>, as Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu did last year.</p> <p>The active political forces in the west generally bear a special responsibility for Israel\u2019s creation as well as for its subsequent actions. This is reinforced by the fact that all major western governments and most mainstream political forces continue to assert their support for Israel and what it purportedly represents, regardless of its actions \u2013 even when they fly in the face of their stated values.</p> <p>The UK bears a special responsibility due to the insidious and critical role it played in the dispossession of the Palestinians via the iniquitous Balfour Declaration and the terms of the British mandate that enforced it, and the shabby retreat from Palestine in 1948. By accepting the mandate\u2019s terms in favour of a Jewish homeland, the UK took on the responsibility for the Palestinians\u2019 fate. Without the active sponsorship and facilitation of the mandate, the Palestinians would not have lost their homeland.</p> <p>As we approach the 100th anniversary of the Balfour Declaration next year, it behooves the UK \u2013 whose leaders from Winston Churchill to Gordon Brown to David Cameron have openly professed to be Zionists \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/mar/25/mandated-history-britain-middle-east\">to acknowledge its role in the dispossession of the Palestinians</a>, just as it should stand rightful guard against the scourge of antisemitism.</p> <p>There is no need to embellish the Palestinian case with false and misleading analogies, the least compelling of which is a Nazi-Zionist comparison. By allowing Israel\u2019s supporters to raise the counter-charge of antisemitism, this analogy deflects the world\u2019s attention away from the misery inflicted on the Palestinians and taints their cause. This cause rests on its own moral and political merits and is based on the simple proposition that a people were turfed out of their homeland against their express will, in favour of an ethnic minority imposed on them by outside powers and, eventually, by force of arms. The Palestinians paid the ultimate price for European antisemitism, of which they were innocent</p> <p>Some may want us to understand why Jewish people have pride in Israel and cannot characterise its creation as a sin. But by the same token, one may want them to understand why Palestinians cannot be expected to rejoice in their national dispossession, or do anything but mourn their Nakba. This has nothing to do with antisemitism, for the ethnic or religious identity of those doing the dispossessing makes not a hoot of difference. We would have opposed them just the same.</p>",

      "headline": "Christy O\u2019Connor Sr obituary",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-16T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>The Irish golfer Christy O\u2019Connor Sr, who has died aged 91, was sufficiently revered in his home country to be known simply as \u201cHimself\u201d. But he was also a star in other parts of the world and became one of Europe\u2019s most recognisable sportsmen of the 1950s, 60s and 70s. Plying his trade largely before the advent of an organised European Tour, O\u2019Connor dominated the Irish golfing scene, won a number of lucrative, high-profile tournaments in Britain, and was a familiar face in the US as he played in 10 consecutive Ryder Cups for Great Britain and Ireland from 1955 to 1973 \u2013 a record surpassed only by Nick Faldo.</p> <p>He also represented Ireland 15 times in the <a href=\"http://www.pgatour.com/tournaments/world-cup-of-golf.html\">World Cup of Golf</a>, which he won for his country with Harry Bradshaw in Mexico in 1958, and was victorious in big events such as the News of the World Matchplay tournament (1957), the British Masters (1956 and 1959), and the John Player Classic (1970), which was at the time the richest prize in golf. In 1961 and 1962 he won the PGA Order of Merit for the most points accrued during European events.</p> <p>O\u2019Connor had a graceful, relaxed swing that many described as \u201cnatural\u201d \u2013 a term that irked him, as it was anything but. He pointed out that in his early days he was \u201clightning fast\u201d and too upright, and that his rhythm had developed only after years of intense practice. When snow covered the grass in Ireland, he would set off to the beach \u201cand hammer hundreds of balls at a time into the blizzard\u201d. Hitting off the sand helped him to clip the ball cleanly off the surface and earned him his later nickname of \u201cwristy Christy\u201d. He also became renowned for playing outrageous recovery shots, a product of practising from the most appalling lies in the rough or from behind obstacles. If he had a weakness, it was his inconsistent putting, although it served him well enough to get him to the very top of the game.</p> <p>O\u2019Connor was born in Galway, in the west of Ireland, to Michael and Margaret, who managed a small farm and a large family next to <a href=\"http://www.galwaygolf.com/\">Galway golf club</a>, where Christy became \u201cconsumed by golf from the moment I set eyes on it\u201d. With the game so close at hand, even before the age of 10 he was spending most of his free time at the club, sneaking on to the course with borrowed clubs.</p> <p>Although his father reckoned golf would get him nowhere, O\u2019Connor later began to make some extra money for his hard-pressed family by caddying, and at the age of 23 he was appointed assistant professional at Galway, moving two years later to the nearby Tuam course, where he also worked on the ground staff. The Irish Professional Golfers\u2019 Association, feeling that O\u2019Connor\u2019s greenkeeping duties meant he was not entirely a professional golfer, dragged its feet over accepting him as a member until 1951, delaying his move into tournament golf until the late age of 27.</p> <p>Losing no time, the Tuam members raised \u00a370 to finance O\u2019Connor\u2019s entry into the 1951 Open Championship at Royal Portrush, where he repaid them by finishing in a creditable 19th position. His performance in the Open attracted interest from the Bundoran club in Donegal, which invited him to become their professional, and it was there that he met Mary Collins, an assistant in a chemist\u2019s shop, whom he married in 1954. They took their honeymoon at Gleneagles in Scotland, where he entered his first tournament outside Ireland.</p> <p>In 1955 O\u2019Connor came to much wider attention when he won the Swallow Penfold event at Southport and Ainsdale, the first European golf competition with a four-figure first prize \u2013 exactly \u00a31,000. The victory launched him on to the British golfing scene, and led him to become the playing professional at <a href=\"http://www.theroyaldublingolfclub.com/index.htm\">Royal Dublin</a>, which was more conveniently located for commuting to Britain.</p> <p>O\u2019Connor\u2019s near 20-year unbroken run in the Ryder Cup began within four years of his turning professional, and on his second appearance, at Lindrick in Yorkshire in 1957, he figured in what was Great Britain and Ireland\u2019s first Ryder Cup victory against the US since 1933, contributing to the win with a thumping 7&amp;6 triumph over Dow Finsterwald in his singles match. O\u2019Connor\u2019s tally of 36 matches over 10 appearances is still among the highest, and he remains one of the oldest golfers to have played in the competition, having made his last appearance aged 48 in 1973 at Muirfield.</p> <p>A tendency in his core playing days to public taciturnity probably deprived O\u2019Connor of the captaincy of a Ryder Cup team, though he had strong enough claims to the office. While he was essentially an affable fellow, by his own admission his intense concentration on the course often created a \u201cfearsome, pained and serious exterior\u201d, and he occasionally became involved in disputes with other players on the circuit, chiefly over alleged rule infringements, slow play or etiquette breaches.</p> <p>He also had a reputation as an enthusiastic drinker who was liable to get into scrapes \u2013 including the occasion when he was punched into the clubhouse rose bushes by his friend and fellow Ryder Cup player <a href=\"http://www.chgc.co.uk/history/default.aspx\">Harry Weetman</a> at Stoke Poges in Buckinghamshire, where both were competing in the 1968 Agfa-Gevaert tournament. O\u2019Connor played the next day with a black eye hidden behind dark glasses, but typically remained the best of pals with Weetman, and for the most part also stayed on good terms with anyone he had ever fallen out with. He maintained that most of the stories relating to his drinking entourage, which sometimes included a coterie of golf-loving Irish priests, either did not happen or were highly exaggerated.</p> <p>O\u2019Connor\u2019s major playing regret was that he was unable to claim an Open Championship, though he played in the event 26 times between 1951 and 1979 and was frequently tipped as a possible winner. He finished in the top six seven times, and his best performance came at Royal Birkdale in 1965, when he was tied in second place behind Peter Thomson.</p> <p>Having won the Irish Professional Championship a record 10 times, in the late 70s O\u2019Connor switched his attention to the fledgling seniors circuit, winning the PGA Seniors Championship tournament on six occasions and continuing to compete in seniors events until his mid-70s. He won plenty of money over his career, but his tastes were never expensive. He and Mary, who handled his affairs as his manager and agent, continued to live in the semi-detached house they had bought in Dublin in 1959.</p> <p>He is survived by Mary and their children, Marguerite, Therese, Joan, Peter and Christopher. A daughter, Ann Marie, predeceased him. Both of his sons became professional golfers, as did his nephew, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/07/christy-oconnor-jr\">Christy O\u2019Connor Jr</a>, who died in January.</p> <p>\u2022 Christy (Patrick Christopher) O\u2019Connor, golfer, born 21 December 1924; died 14 May 2016</p> <p> \u2022 This article was amended on 18 May 2016. O\u2019Connor joined the Bundoran club in Donegal in the 1950s, rather than Bandoran, as originally stated. </p>",

When Kimmel reminded Clinton that her husband, Bill, had looked for information while president and found nothing, she was defiant. </p> <p>\u201cWell, I\u2019m gonna do it again,\u201d Clinton said.</p> <p>The pledges \u2013 she also told the <a href=\" http://www.conwaydailysun.com/newsx/local-news/123978-clinton-promises-to-investigate-ufos\">told the Conway Daily Sun</a> that she would \u201cget to the bottom\u201d of whether the government has tucked away information on aliens \u2013 are exciting UFO enthusiasts.</p> <p>But they are puzzling some experts on the subject.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not quite sure what she thinks there is out there,\u201d said <a href=\"http://www.nickpope.net/biography.htm\">Nick Pope</a>, an author and journalist who used to investigate UFOs for the British government\u2019s ministry of defence.</p> <p>Pope ran the British government\u2019s UFO project from 1991 to 1994 (the investigation unit was wound up in 2009). But America\u2019s own dedicated UFO research effort, called Project Blue Book, ended in 1969, Pope said.</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s embrace of the UFO discussion has been credited to her campaign chairman, John Podesta. The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/us/politics/hillary-clinton-aliens.html?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=1\">New York Times reported</a> that he ran an X-Files fan club while he worked under Bill Clinton in the White House, and wrote in a foreword for a book on UFOs that it was \u201ctime to pull back the curtain\u201d on the subject.</p> <p>Podesta was a counsellor to Barack Obama until February 2015. Upon leaving the White House, he lamented that no new information on UFOs had been released.</p> <p>\u201cFinally, my biggest failure of 2014: once again not securing the disclosure of the UFO files,\u201d Podesta <a href=\" http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/02/17/john-podesta-regrets-no-ufo-disclosure_n_6699646.html\">tweeted</a>.</p> <p>But Pope said there weren\u2019t actually any \u201cUFO files\u201d. Since Project Blue Book ended, the US has not had a formal unit investigating UFOs. And the files from Blue Book are already available in the national archives.</p> <p>\u201cPodesta\u2019s statements, like Clinton\u2019s statements,\u201d he said, imply something \u201clike in the Raiders of the Lost Ark movie, some kind of government warehouse where there\u2019s something above and beyond the old Blue Book files.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAnd as far as I know,\u201d he added, \u201cthere isn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Pope said that there may have been \u201cad hoc investigations done\u201d when pilots saw something unusual in the sky, but they were not part of a \u201cformally constituted research effort\u201d. </p> <p>Ted Roe is the executive director of the <a href=\"http://www.narcap.org/FrequentQuestions.html\">National Aviation Reporting Center on Anomalous Phenomena</a> (Narcap), an independent body that collects reports from pilots and radar operators on unidentified aerial phenomena, the term apparently preferred by Clinton. Roe suspects the government may not be telling us everything it knows.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e0030729f880dbddda4fd5a6d78b3d6829d03f61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e0030729f880dbddda4fd5a6d78b3d6829d03f61/0_198_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"hillary clinton on Jimmy Kimmel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clinton told Jimmy Kimmel she would seek information on UAPs as president.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Randy Holmes/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He recalled that Leslie Kean, a journalist who concentrates on UFOs, made a freedom of information request to the government regarding an incident in Pennsylvania. The government refused, and a lawsuit ensued. The government lost and was ordered to provide the files and documents relating to the Pennsylvania incident.</p> <p>\u201cThose documents were not forthcoming. She never did get them,\u201d Roe said. \u201cThey claim they\u2019re lost. So there may well be files that we don\u2019t know about.\u201d</p> <p>But if there are questions over what Clinton expects to be able to release, there are also questions as to why she would be discussing UFOs at all.</p> <p>\u201cI just can\u2019t understand what she\u2019s playing at,\u201d Pope said.</p> <p>\u201cI can\u2019t see there\u2019s any votes in it. It\u2019s not as if there\u2019s some kind of swing vote middle ground that\u2019s desperately keen on this issue. </p> <p>\u201cAnd it\u2019s an absolute gift to Donald Trump, because you can almost see him up at that podium saying: \u2018I\u2019m committed to American jobs for American workers and reinvigorating the economy and my opponent seems to be more interested in space aliens.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Clinton\u2019s interest in UFOs during an election cycle has raised the issue high enough that Barack Obama\u2019s press secretary <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/279564-obama-not-planning-to-release-area-51-files\">had to field questions</a> on Area 51, the secretive Nevada air base, on Wednesday. Josh Earnest said he was \u201cnot aware of any plans the president has to make public any information about this\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/03/hillary-clinton-declassify-government-documents-ufos\">Clinton would consider declassifying government documents related to UFOs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Area 51 has become synonymous with UFOs and extraterrestrials among some enthusiasts. If there were UFO files, they would likely have information on anything stored in the base, and some conspiracy theories suggest the site contains parts of an alien vessel. Others suggest there could be actual alien remains.</p> <p>Pope was not optimistic.</p> <p>\u201cI would love there to be aliens,\u201d he said. \u201cThe world would be a much more interesting place if we did have a spaceship in a hangar.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBut A, without wanting to sound too arrogant, I hope that I would have heard about it through having security clearance and need to know. </p> <p>\u201cAnd B, yes, I know we can keep some secrets but in these days of whistleblowers and Wikileaks and Snowden and Manning and Assange, all of that, you\u2019d think there would have been something tangible by now.\u201d</p> <p>Roe, who has spent the last 16 years working with Narcap, patiently logging thousands of reports on unidentified aerial phenomena, is sceptical that any documents on alien life will be released any time soon. He said Clinton\u2019s quest for information was likely doomed.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know that a president is even in the need to know on certain aspects of security. This might be one of those subjects,\u201d he said. \u201cShe may not ever know about this stuff or ever get the access to it.\u201d</p> <p>And even if Clinton did come across evidence of extraterrestrial life, Roe warned that the knowledge would come with a heavy burden.</p> <p>\u201cThis is some serious, serious stuff and a lot of our best minds, like Stephen Hawking, have suggested that any exposure to an extraterrestrial civilisation would be catastrophic,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cIt could be an extinction-level event.\u201d</p>",

So where does this leave a man whose shtick is to be a human firework, straining every sinew to burst out of his skin? </p> <p>In the case of 69-year-old Iggy Pop, it leaves him exactly where he\u2019s always been. By the end of tonight\u2019s first song, the carnal manifesto that is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQvUBf5l7Vw\">Lust for Life</a>, his jacket is gone and he is capering and gurning across the stage, his impossibly leathery torso exposed. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/picture/2016/may/14/eyewitness-london-uk\">Then he is in the crowd</a>, on his back, blood oozing from a cut on his temple.

If so, it is a fitting farewell. Co-written and produced by Queens of the Stone Age\u2019s Josh Homme, it is a brooding, simmering record, barbed and heavy with intimations of mortality \u2013 as exquisitely poignant a career kiss-off as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/07/david-bowie-blackstar-review-a-spellbinding-break-with-his-past\">David Bowie\u2019s Blackstar</a>.</p> <p>The parallel is telling. It was Bowie who saved Iggy\u2019s career, co-writing and producing his two classic 1977 albums, The Idiot and Lust for Life. Bowie infiltrated tunes and melodies into Iggy\u2019s trademark raw, insatiable energy and existential angst. Four decades on, Homme has performed a similar feat \u2013 at Iggy\u2019s request \u2013 and is a skilled conduit for the star\u2019s animal restlessness. With just two exceptions, tonight\u2019s set is drawn from the new record and those talismanic 1977 albums. The intervening 40 years are entirely disregarded.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c27fa25dda74d31d9846dca8ff9d216882868131\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c27fa25dda74d31d9846dca8ff9d216882868131/190_187_2977_1979/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Primal, priapic, peerless \u2026 Iggy Pop at London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Primal, priapic, peerless \u2026 Iggy Pop at London\u2019s Royal Albert Hall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christie Goodwin/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Homme is a towering titan of cool on guitar here, clad, like the rest of the band, in a velvet smoking jacket as an ironic contrast to his half-naked gibbering frontman.

      "body": "<p>Black American culture is experiencing a kind of delicious dominance at the moment. It\u2019s one that might seem odd given its contrast with the resurgence of racism embodied by some supporters of Donald Trump. But Trumpism, as my colleague Steven Thrasher has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2016/may/11/trump-has-to-be-the-next-president-american-history-dictates-it-video\">noted</a>, is just the latest version of a pattern in America: black progress beckons white rage. </p> <p>This artistic triumph isn\u2019t a new<em> </em>movement, then, but rather reads like one because this time around, creators aren\u2019t making work that over explains black life or that makes white society comfortable, centered or even included. Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/25/beyonce-lemonade-jay-z-infidelity-emotional-project-depths\">was made</a> to speak to black women. Larry Wilmore\u2019s N-word use at the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/02/larry-wilmore-n-word-i-felt-black-pride\">wasn\u2019t meant</a> for the white people it offended. Shonda Rhimes is the most successful showrunner in television, creating space for black actors to feature complex representations of black life. Claudia Rankine\u2019s critically acclaimed volume, Citizen, explicitly interrogates micro aggressions that shape black life in America. </p> <p>As black deaths overtake the news cycle and the current presidential campaign slog has shaken awake racist, inflammatory rhetoric that many non-black Americans want to believe was dead, black art is unconcerned with the emotional wellbeing of white folks. The cultural work of black American creators at this moment is exciting, energizing and a reflection of the ever maturing consciousness in black America.</p> <p>The dominant narrative of American identity, one centered in whiteness and its aesthetics, is one that black American artists have explored, confronted and challenged since the nation\u2019s beginning. Black American artists, writers and creators have long asserted the personhood of black people. From Phyllis Wheatley\u2019s poems <a href=\"http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems-and-poets/poems/detail/45465\">On Being Brought From Africa to America</a>, to the compulsive portraiture of Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth, to the novels and poets of the Harlem Renaissance era, the paintings of Jacob Lawrence to the works Carrie Mae Weems, Mikalene Thomas and Kehinde Wiley, these artists have pivoted from a presumed white gaze, and expanded definitions of the American self.</p> <p>But those efforts, while vanguard and significant, have stayed at the mainstream\u2019s margins: when I ask people of all ages and shades to tell me what they know of the American story \u2013 and as a professor, that opportunity comes up more than you\u2019d think \u2013 they tell me spotty ramblings from their high school history and civics classes that they can recall, mostly centered in a narrative of exceptionalism.</p> <p>The current wave of scholarship, criticism, novels, works of art from global pop artists, rappers, painters, playwrights, film-makers and photographers is crucial to resisting the old narratives that have been taught across generations. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2016/may/11/trump-has-to-be-the-next-president-american-history-dictates-it-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4j3tx\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2502415\"            data-video-name=\"Trump has to be the next president.

American history dictates it</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade blurs the lines between music video and art installation. The television series Underground challenges convention in its focused retelling of antebellum America and slave resistance. Novelist Angela Flournoy\u2019s The Turner House upends rigid narratives about working-class Detroit, and Nate Parker\u2019s forthcoming film, subversively titled The Birth of a Nation, aims destroy the racist association of the title, attaching it forever to the courageous acts of Nat Turner. These works insist that as a people we remain awake in this great revolution.</p> <p>Because if we don\u2019t, the backlash might end up simply furthering what has often looked like the natural arc of US history: black equality and success leads to white retrenchment and violence. Instead, we must push on.</p> <p>When you, say, reject the birth certificate of the first black president, what you mean to say is that to be American is to be white. The billionaire who declared that the birth certificate was invalid is now the presumptive nominee for the party against slavery \u2013 the party of Lincoln. Rejecting the authenticity of Obama\u2019s American-ness is by proxy a rejection of black American authenticity. To protest, demanding, \u201cI want my country back\u201d in 2009, or to be flummoxed or enraged by the affirmation \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d in 2016 and not admit that anti-black racism fuels this ignores the nation\u2019s true history.</p> <p>If you doubt me on this point, then consider that the Trump campaign claimed to have accidentally <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2016/5/10/11652822/donald-trump-delegate-white-nationalist\">named </a>a white nationalist as a primary delegate for the upcoming California primary, who reportedly wants to deport anyone with \u201cnegro blood\u201d. Or just watch any of the video in which crowds physically assault people of color at his campaign rallies. </p> <p>\u201cI love America more than any other country in the world,\u201d James Baldwin wrote in 1955, \u201cand, exactly for this reason, I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually. I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually.\u201d Baldwin was one of a long line of black American artists, thinkers and writers, who resisted the singular story of the American people that occluded black people.</p> <p>To declare an American identity, an American-ness as a black artist has always felt like a political act. And as the era of the nation\u2019s first black president draws to a close, black artists and people aren\u2019t seeking permission or acceptance from the dominant cultural narrative of old. We are simply declaring: we are. </p> <p>It\u2019s our country, we\u2019re not apologizing anymore for telling it how we see it. </p>",

But these secrets are always going to be revealed at the worst moment...</p> <p>The main character is called Alix. As I said, her life is great.

No, it\u2019s not some brand new modern software. It\u2019s a guy. A guy who caused a massacre in her school. A guy who approached Alix and was talking to her before the accident. How did he know about Alix? Or maybe it is more appropriate to say <em>what</em> did he know?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"06b345cf91384fa382ccc02a78952b9466c064bd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/06b345cf91384fa382ccc02a78952b9466c064bd/0_0_261_400/261.jpg\" alt=\"The Doubt Factory by Paolo Bacigalupi\" width=\"261\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alix is confused and scared. Why did he do this? What did she do to him? He was saying some strange things about her father. Instead of worrying and not thinking about this accident, Alix is more and more sure that she wants to see 2.0 again. Is it crazy? Yes. But what can you do with your needs. When she tells her father that 2.0 has been talking to her, he immediately calls a private security company which now guards Alix and her family everywhere they go. But when Alix meets 2.0 outside her house in the night, she isn\u2019t scared. She is relieved, but feels disgust. He is telling some more \u201clies\u201d about her father and a seed of doubt starts to grow inside her. Can this strange boy with a mysterious smile really claim truth? </p> <p>And then, the group around 2.0 kidnaps Alix and throws her into the cage. They will let her go only if she agrees to cooperate with them. Her father works for a law firm that supports enormous companies, for example a pharmaceutical company which has a problem with their medications. For them, it doesn\u2019t matter that their painkillers actually kill people. And when someone is trying to sue them, they just hire her dad\u2019s company to solve it. Her father helps to kill people, the 2.0 group is saying. And now, it\u2019s only up to Alix how she will decide. Will she be with her father or against him? How can she know that this strange group is saying truth? But on the other hand, how could they gather so much information? And what about their parents who died because of bad painkillers? Well, to solve this mystery, you should read this book!</p> <p>This book has totally surprised me. Why? Firstly because of the original story. This gripping book with really fascinating details is worth the reading. The author knows how to choose the right and appropriate words to make the moment thrilling. He has also created really elaborated characters. To say the truth, on the one hand, Alix was brave, I can\u2019t deny it. But on the other hand, I wouldn\u2019t do or wouldn\u2019t be able to do such things as Alix did. The story is quite confusing in the beginning, but believe me, soon you will be turning the pages as fast as you can. And you will be shocked all the time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Someone has to be the black sheep of the family.

      "body": "<p>British photographer <a href=\"http://www.celinemarchbank.com/\" title=\"\">Celine Marchbank</a> has described her new book as a \u201cdelicate\u201d project. The word is well chosen. Marchbank is a quiet observer of the everyday and here she applies her steadfastly low-key, almost diaristic approach to an immensely difficult subject: the last year of her mother\u2019s life.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The camera allowed me just a couple of split seconds a day to record the things that would go on to mean so much</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The subtitle of the book is <em>My Mother\u2019s Favourite Flower</em>, and the narrative is punctuated by images of flowers in bloom outdoors and in vases by her mother\u2019s bedside. Their complex symbolism is suggested throughout: life, death, the transience of things and people, the natural beauty of the everyday that we often take for granted until it is rendered luminous by the sudden, dislocating awareness of our own mortality.</p> <p>In September 2009, Marchbank\u2019s mother, Sue Miles, was diagnosed with stage four cancer. Marchbank immediately began photographing her mother and \u201cthe things that reminded me of her, or things I wanted to remember of her\u201d. In April the following year, her mother\u2019s illness was confirmed as terminal and the memory project took on an even more delicate aspect. \u201cThat is when it became really difficult,\u201d writes Marchbank in her foreword; \u201cafter all, I was her daughter, not her photographer.\u201d</p> <p>Still, she continued, though fraught with doubt about what it was exactly that she was doing \u2013 \u201cwhy had I introduced a camera to this dreadful situation?\u201d A few lines later, she answers that question: \u201cThe camera allowed me just a couple of split seconds a day to record the things that\u00a0would go on to mean so much to me, the little things that would be\u00a0gone.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cdb700f8659f7896e2907f1bb6761a2ddd8ffd4f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cdb700f8659f7896e2907f1bb6761a2ddd8ffd4f/0_110_3543_2125/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A steadfastly low-key approach to an immensely difficult subject\u2019... from Tulip by Celine Marchbank.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A steadfastly low-key approach to an immensely difficult subject\u2019... from Tulip by Celine Marchbank.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Celine Marchbank</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Tulip</em> is not, as Marchbank points out, a record of her mother\u2019s death. It\u00a0is more an inventory of the quotidian\u00a0details that can define even\u00a0the most painful situations, but are soon forgotten when we finally emerge from the strange hinterland we\u00a0enter when attending someone who is seriously ill. That heightened but hazy place is evoked throughout in quiet imagery \u2013 light falling on a medication chart, raindrops on a windowpane, her mother\u2019s sewing box \u2013 but also in portraits of her mother as her illness takes its toll. It is a determinedly honest evocation of a terrible time.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/oct/13/sue-miles-obituary\">Sue Miles obituary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The narrative shifts in tone again towards the end with a landscape of grey sky above a thicket of trees. \u201cLooking out of her bedroom window, I realised this is the start of the first day of my life without her,\u201d reads the\u00a0caption. A few pages later, a snapshot of the <em>Guardian</em> obituary page reveals that her mum was, among other things, a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/oct/13/sue-miles-obituary\" title=\"\">doyenne of counterculture</a> and the restaurant revolution\u201d. One life contains many lives.</p> <p>The penultimate image is a wilfully blurred still life of wilting flowers in a vase, and the final one a black and white portrait of her mother, young and alive, cradling her newborn daughter in her arms, while chatting on the phone. It seems a fitting conclusion to this singular collaboration.</p> <p><em>Tulip is published by </em><a href=\"http://www.dewilewis.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Dewi Lewis</em></a><em> (\u00a335).</em></p>",

Infections such as MRSA which have developed resistance to drugs have become a notorious threat in hospitals, where the bacteria can survive on surfaces for up to seven months.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nature.com/articles/srep24770\">But a new discovery by scientists in Ireland</a> could soon be working to combat them.</p> <p>A research team led by Prof Suresh Pillai has developed a coating for everyday objects that prevents the spread of MRSA and E coli bacteria. The coating, which can be used on items such as smartphones, door handles and remote controls as well as surgical surfaces, has a 99.99% success rate in killing the bugs.</p> <p></p> <p>John Browne, the chief executive of Dublin-based company <a href=\"http://www.kastus.com/about-us/\">Kastus</a>, which is working to commercialise the solution, says: \u201cIt is very hard to get rid of these things once they are there.

Another study showed that almost 93% of writing tools taken from a group of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(05)63642-2/abstract\">42 doctors were contaminated</a>.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>The Kastus anti-microbial solution is made up of titanium oxide, with fluoride and copper. The solution is first baked on to a surface such as glass. When light is shined on it, a series of reactions on the surface of the material make it resistant to MRSA and E coli as well as trichophyton rubrum, the main cause of athlete\u2019s foot.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"345b11bd6ede608709de2651ade28171c63c25a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/345b11bd6ede608709de2651ade28171c63c25a8/0_49_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Prof Pillai in the nanotechnology lab at IT Sligo with the new anti-superbug solution.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Prof Pillai in the nanotechnology laboratory at IT Sligo with the new anti-superbug solution.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou prepare the material in a water-based solution and spray it on the surface. It will form a thin coating on the surface and then you bake it in the oven or furnace and that will make a transparent thin film. You will not even see that there is a coating there,\u201d says Pillai, who is from the nanotechnology research group at the Institute of Technology, Sligo.<br /></p> <p>Any MRSA or E coli landing on the surface of the tile will die over the subsequent 24 hours, so the solution stops it forming a colony and spreading \u2013 in effect creating a reliably sterile surface, he says. </p> <p>Even when doctors adhere to proper hygiene practices, everyday objects and areas such as door handles and other surfaces can foster the bacteria.</p> <p>\u201cIn the [US], if you go into a hospital with a broken leg and get a case of MRSA and don\u2019t survive it, your estate has to sue that hospital because the health insurance won\u2019t pay because the hospital is being treated as liable. I think a lot of us know people who have gone into hospital for minor surgeries as patients and have contracted bugs,\u201d says Browne.</p> <p>\u201cI think we have all been in hospitals and we have seen dirt in floors and corners that have just not been cleaned. They are ceramic tiles. If there is a dirty corner then it is likely that the entire surface has been affected and it is likely that you are walking it through the building.\u201d</p> <p>Browne aims to have the solution applied to smartphone and tablet screens, said to be fertile grounds for bacteria because they typically do not go through rigorous cleansing. In 2012, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/27/ebola-phone-theft-steals-infected-patient_n_1832927.html\">a man contracted Ebola after stealing a mobile phone</a> from an isolation ward in Uganda.</p> <p>\u201cThe product is scaleable so the idea is that it gets out there and becomes a standard on smartphones and on ATMs. It is there and it is not adding any significant cost for the manufacturer of the end product,\u201d he says. </p> <p>\u201cYou are using an eco product, it is safe and it is helping to stop the spread of harmful bacteria.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/08/the-innovators-slow-fashion-zero-waste-movement-designer-dan-vo\">The innovators: slow fashion that cuts waste and lasts longer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is little hard data to show how wide a problem the spread of bacteria via mobile devices is, but they certainly harbour bacteria and some of the keenest interest in the new product has so far come from electronics companies. </p> <p>\u201cMobile phones contain 10 times more bacteria than the toilet seat because toilet seats are cleaned regularly and mobile phones are never cleaned,\u201d says Pillai.</p> <p>There are plans to develop towels which will stop the spread of superbugs by the solution adhering to the fabric. \u201cYou need special types of spray or cottons which will withstand several washes,\u201d he says. </p> <p>Pharmaceutical firms that use \u201cclean rooms\u201d for research will also be targeted, says Browne. \u201cIf a fungus enters a clean room, it could close a building down. A lot of these clean rooms are separated into different buildings to stop this happening. The cost to do that is enormous and if a fungus gets in, it is serious.\u201d</p> <p>The company also plans to investigate possible uses for the technology in food packaging, for instance as the coating on a glass bottle. \u201cThere has been a test on milk bottles showing that an anti-bacterial coating can extend the life of milk by 15 days,\u201d adds Browne. <br /></p>",

      "body": "<p>Freedom, as the far left used to say, is the right to choose your jail. School, job, family, marriage: no cage is distraction enough for Gabrielle (Marion Cotillard), who \u2013 with a dreamer\u2019s conviction \u2013 will do anything to escape the box being built for her.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/14/american-honey-review-andrea-arnold-mislays-map-but-us-roadtrip-still-sweetly-intriguing\">American Honey review: Andrea Arnold mislays map on sweet, indelible roadtrip</a> </p> </aside>  <p>From the Land of the Moon is a choc-cake rich drama that oozes along on the strength of a committed performance from Cotillard and the odd sprinkle of visual flair. It presents a kind of no-frills silliness, almost tricking you into believing its balderdash. It\u2019s based on Italian author Milena Agus\u2019s 2006 novella, which has been relocated by director Nicole Garcia to 1940s Provence, the French coastal town of La Ciotat, the Swiss alps and Lyon, sometime later in what looks to be the mid-60s. The story is told in flashback from this point.</p> <p>Gabrielle and her husband, Jos\u00e9 (Alex Brendem\u00fchl) are taking their son to a regional music competition, where \u2013 in respect to mama\u2019s gloomy sensibilities - he\u2019ll mournfully trot out some Tchaikovsky. The mood in the car is peculiar. Mum\u2019s distant, dad and son clearly more connected. They roll into Lyon in a funk. Then Gabrielle spots an address that stirs a violent memory. And from there, we\u2019re off.</p> <p>Sort of. For a fairly simple plot the story rolls out awfully slow. It emerges that Gabrielle, the daughter of a successful lavender farmer, was always the wild child. Stultified by country life, she has channeled her frustrations into a crush on her teacher, partly fuelled by his on-point literary recommendations (Wuthering Heights is, according to teach, \u201cAbout a girl who never leaves the countryside\u201d). The flirtation ends, disastrously, at a family meal to celebrate the harvest. Luckily, there is someone there to pick up the pieces: Jos\u00e9. A Spaniard who fought against Franco and now works for the family, he\u2019s picked as a solid candidate for a marriage of convenience. The family hand over responsibility for Gabrielle, she gets to leave the lavender and he can marry money. \u201cWhy choose to be unhappy?\u201d, Gabrielle asks Jos\u00e9 as they wrangle with the idea. Jos\u00e9, played delicately by Brendem\u00fchl, gives the impression he has seen several lifetimes of unhappiness already. A little more will hurt, but manageably.</p> <p>The couple move to the coast, where dependable Jos\u00e9 begins to build a house. Gabrielle is still afflicted, now with paralysing cramps that may or may not be real. She\u2019s sent, on doctor\u2019s orders, to a spa in the Swiss mountains. There \u2013 finally \u2013 she meets someone who might help her escape herself: a floppy-haired hottie called Andr\u00e9 Sauvage (Louis Garrel). A veteran of the war in Indochina, he\u2019s picked up a kidney infection that manifests itself in bouts of exhausted sighing. His treatment is gob-fulls of opium and the odd manly grunt to help through the pain. All this Byron-esque suffering is, unsurprisingly, right up Gabrielle\u2019s street.</p> <p>A lot has been made of female sexuality coming to the fore at this year\u2019s Cannes. From the Land of the Moon continues the trend to a degree. It\u2019s implied that much of Gabrielle\u2019s pain is rooted in sexual frustration. There\u2019s a lot made of what Gabrielle calls \u201cthe principal thing\u201d. This, in Agus\u2019s novella, is love. But Garcia suggests sexual fulfilment is strong in the mix here too. In an early scene Gabrielle stands, dress hiked up and lets a river wash over her. It\u2019s the pursuit of orgasm as escape. Getting off to get out.</p> <p>Elsewhere the expression of inner turmoil is a lot less interesting. There is loads of Gabrielle running away desperately - into the woods, the sea, a ditch. Cotillard\u2019s ability to tear up in an instant is used to the point of exploitation. Gabrielle is, on many occasions, simply too nasty to care about. \u201cEvery time you visit it rains,\u201d she tells Jos\u00e9. \u201cPeople are right: you\u2019re mean,\u201d he says later. He sticks around, still.</p> <p>The film takes on Gabrielle\u2019s listlessness, slumps into an opiated fug. The malady is mysterious and not easily treatable. It just exhausts you. It transforms from a story about release to just another jail. At times it felt like there was no escape. </p>",

It puts the former mayor of London in the same league as rampaging Donald Trump, another intellectual conman from the metropolitan elite, currently busy trying to mislead poor people for career advantage. </p> <p>Desperate stuff. It is frivolous because Hitler is a uniquely awful figure with whom glib comparisons are invariably misplaced, whether made by Anthony Eden (Egypt\u2019s Nasser was \u201canother Hitler\u201d), George Bush (ditto Saddam Hussein) or the Tory MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip. </p> <p>It is offensive to the memory of millions of Europeans who suffered and \u2013 many of them \u2013 died under the Nazi occupation. David Cameron made a similar error when he likened Vladimir Putin\u2019s seizure of the Crimea to a Hitler grab. What Putin did was wrong but 20 million Soviet citizens \u2013 yes, 20 million \u2013 did not die in the process. Russians were offended and rightly so. Another round to Putin.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/15/boris-johnson-likens-eu-to-nazi-superstate\">Boris Johnson criticised for 'desperate' link between EU and Hitler</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Johnson seems vaguely aware of this, but is intoxicated by the baroque magnificence of his own verbosity. \u201cNapoleon, Hitler, various people tried this out and it ended tragically \u2026 the EU is trying to do this by different methods,\u201d he told the Sunday Telegraph, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/boris_tax_summary_11-12_to_14-15_2.pdf\">whose company payroll he is on</a>.</p> <p>It sounds as though Johnson was struggling to remember if it was Philip II of Spain, Phillip, Duke of Edinburgh, or Phillip Roth, who also had a crack at the project (\u201cmemo to self: get the researcher to fact check it before my next column\u2019\u2019). He wings it as he does most things because he is clever enough and funny enough to get away with it.</p> <p>What\u2019s worse in some ways is that Boris is half right. Memories of the Roman empire before its western half collapsed under barbarian invasion in 476 AD have remained powerfully lodged in the European imagination. Charlemagne, crowned emperor on Christmas Day 800 (history\u2019s easiest date) of what would be later called the Holy Roman empire, was the first revivalist of many. Napoleon forced the that empire to be dissolved in 1806. A century later HG Welles called the papacy \u201cthe ghost of the Roman empire sitting on its grave\u201d.</p> <p>So it is OK to urge to unity after centuries of bloody conflict which culminated in the self-destructive wars of 1914-45. But quite apart from the fact that Germany was never conquered by Rome \u2013 except in Gladiator \u2013 Hitler is utterly toxic. In a TV discussion of Margaret Thatcher years ago I interrupted the pompous polymath Dr Jonathan Miller who said: \u201cI don\u2019t want to compare her to Hitler, but \u2026\u201d \u2013 \u201cWell, don\u2019t,\u201d I snapped at the great man, possibly my bravest ever action.</p> <p>The Hitler comparison is usually grotesquely misplaced, even if it plays for five minutes in the Dog and Duck and for longer in some of our tax-shy offshore oligarch-owned newspapers. If Johnson were being serious \u2013 give it a try Boris, it might be stimulating \u2013 he could have tried to explain a much more serious problem with contemporary German conduct.</p> <p>No jackboots, no toothbrush moustaches or silly walks, but damaging as Greeks will readily confirm. It is the deflationary economic policies being imposed by well-meaning German leaders on their own people and \u2013 for want of better alternative leadership \u2013 on the wider eurozone. Our exports suffer too.</p> <p>We learned in the 20th century to avoid inflation \u2013 hyper inflation in the 1920s contributed to the rise of that chap \u2013 and to save against rainy days. The German constitution requires the federal government to balance the budget. Individuals save ferociously too. Business is export focused, helped by an under-valued currency (if Germany left the euro the mark would soar), all of it building the trade surplus which is at the heart of the eurozone\u2019s problem. Greek misconduct is more of a symptom.</p> <p>German officials and politicians are reluctant to admit this; clever people like the finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, instead attack Mario Draghi at the European Central Bank for the (limited) credit-creating programme of quantitative easing (QE) which keeps the system just about afloat.</p> <p>As I never tire of saying, \u201cWhen the Germans have bankrupt everyone else and have no more customers to sell to they\u2019ll discover they\u2019ve also bankrupt themselves.\u201d Alas in the process they\u2019ve suppressed domestic demand and allowed their demographics to collapse.</p> <p>Yes, it\u2019s going horribly wrong and much nastier nationalist populists than Johnson are crawling out of the drains to exploit the legitimate fears of voters who may know more about Hitler and Bayern Munich football club than they do about Beethoven, Kant or even Willy Brandt.</p> <p>It\u2019s quite possible that Boris knows this, though he has never shown much interest in economics outside his own. If he really wants to be prime minister despite his shabby role in the Brexit campaign, he\u2019ll have to try to show he can be serious. Nothing wrong with jokes, but a chap has to do both.</p> <p>He knows Britain\u2019s deep-seated problems aren\u2019t caused by Europe and won\u2019t go away if Britain votes for Brexit. He wrote as much in his Telegraph column on 12 May 2013 and probably a few times since. Contrary to what he asserts in his Sunday Telegraph interview most of us feel sort-of-European in varying degrees, certainly less sort-of-American with every Trump day that passes.</p> <p>Europe is in historic decline; we need each other and, if we don\u2019t hang together, we may hang separately. After all, Rome is not the only ancient empire that dazzles posterity\u2019s imagination and is again on the move. What unites Britain\u2019s nostalgic Brexit right and anti-imperial left is their shared inability to spell CHINA. Unlike Mandarin, Rome\u2019s unifying Latin language is fractured, so that few now speak it, not even Hitler.</p> <p> GCSE Mandarin anyone?</p>",

Even Twilight - a series Milo (Eric Ruffin) refuses to engage with (\u201cit seems unrealistic\u201d), and one O\u2019Shea probably doesn\u2019t care for - has more going for it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/14/neruda-review-unconventional-drama-constructs-rather-than-retells-chilean-poets-life\">Neruda review - unconventional drama constructs rather than retells Chilean poet's life</a> </p> </aside>  <p>O\u2019Shea opens The Transfiguration tantalisingly, with a middle-aged man startled by the sounds coming from the stall next to his in a public restroom. Probably thinking he\u2019s hearing sex, he hurries out, perturbed. It\u2019s then that we\u2019re introduced to 14-year-old Milo, sucking the last ounces of blood out of the neck of his latest victim.</p> <p>Despite the ferocious nature of his attacks, Milo is as silent a vampire as they come. \u201cDo people ever tell you you don\u2019t talk a lot?\u201d he\u2019s asked at one point, to which he responds: \u201cNo, no one ever speaks to me.\u201d</p> <p>A loner, living a rundown housing project in Queens, New York with his military vet brother, Milo is constantly bullied by local gang members for his steely reticence. Haunted by the death of his mother, who committed suicide in their apartment (his father died when Milo was eight), Milo spends his days in his room, watching gruesome nature videos online, as well as VHS tapes of his favourite vampire films. <br /></p> <p>When he meets Sophia (Chloe Levine), a slightly older and deeply troubled white girl in the lobby of his complex, he\u2019s visibly tempted to snack on her. Instead, he opts to ask her out after some awkward courting. In one of O\u2019Shea\u2019s many on the nose moments, he has Milo take Sophia out on their first date to a screening of Nosferatu. </p> <p>The Transfiguration is a character study first and foremost, spending all of its time with Milo. Problem is, he\u2019s so opaque that as a protagonist, he\u2019s completely impenetrable. Ruffin holds the camera with his forlorn gaze, but as rendered by O\u2019Shea\u2019s script, his character is inert, only springing to life when he feeds. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2016/may/14/cannes-day-four-rebecca-hall-mark-rylance-and-steven-spielberg-in-pictures\">Cannes day four: Rebecca Hall, Mark Rylance and Steven Spielberg \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s a shame then that O\u2019Shea seems completely disinterested in the attacks themselves. Each one is staged with little-to-no flair, save for an electronic score that swells louder with each bite. <br /></p> <p>The film is at its best in vividly depicting its environs. The rundown Rockaway beachfront that Milo and Sophia frequent, serves as a solemn reminder of the battering the area received in the wake of Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Queens, as seen in The Transfiguration, is a grim and brutal place - worlds away from the neighboring Brooklyn Lena Dunham envisions in Girls.</p>",

He was doing a PhD at Girton College, Cambridge, and was in Egypt in order to conduct research on independent trade unions. He wrote articles under a pen name, relating the difficult situation in which Egyptian democracy and society found itself after the 2011 revolution.<br /></p> <p>He disappeared on 25 January 2016, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/08/giulio-regeni-murder-investigators-italy-egypt-meet-cairo\">his body was found a few days later</a> in a ditch beside the Cairo-Alexandria highway. His body bore the marks of extreme and prolonged torture. Egyptian security services are strongly suspected of being responsible for his disappearance and murder.</p> <p>At a press conference promoted by the human rights commission of the Italian senate to demand truth and justice from Egypt with regard to the Regeni case, the young man\u2019s mother found the strength to sum up her pain in a powerful phrase, describing her son as \u201ca contemporary young man\u201d: in other words, an intelligent, inquisitive person who devoted his life to study and knowledge, travelling, learning languages, attending schools, universities and cultural institutions in different countries \u2013 one of so many young men and women who embody the European dream \u2013 that of a continent without borders and, beyond that, of a world without walls.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/04/woman-defied-neo-nazis-sweden-tess-asplund-viral-photograph\">Woman who defied 300 neo-Nazis at Swedish rally speaks of anger</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Regeni\u2019s murder is an attack on this dream. His death concerns Italy, of course. However, it also concerns the UK, the country where he had been studying for a long time, and of which he was a cultural and spiritual citizen. Actually, it concerns the whole of Europe and should involve our sense of belonging to a culture that hails from much further back, from the Greek way of thinking that identified the notion of Europe with the very concept of freedom and tolerance. Europe symbolises a place \u2013 both physical and ideal \u2013 of exchange, of integration, of differences considered as assets. A place of solidarity and equality.</p> <p>In 1917 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Gramsci\">Antonio Gramsci</a>, one of the greatest thinkers of the last century, who was persecuted by a dictatorial regime and died in a fascist prison, published a magazine to which he gave an evocative, civilised and poetic title: the Future City. That magazine contained, among others, a piece that comes to us in the soberly epic tones of a great political and moral manifesto, entitled Against the Indifferent.</p> <p>\u201cI hate the indifferent. I think to be alive is to take sides. Those who are truly alive cannot avoid being citizens and taking sides. Indifference is lethargy, it\u2019s parasitism, it\u2019s cowardice, it\u2019s not life. Therefore, I hate the indifferent.</p> <p>\u201cIndifference is history\u2019s dead weight, it\u2019s the inert matter in which the most glowing enthusiasm often drowns, it\u2019s the swamp that surrounds the old city and shields it better than the most solid of walls.</p> <p>\u201cI am alive, I take sides. Therefore, I hate those who don\u2019t take sides, I hate the indifferent.\u201d</p> <p>Gramsci\u2019s words seem to match perfectly the dream of European citizenship, the dream of the founding fathers and the young people who travel without frontiers. The dream of a place inhabited by citizens who are free and not indifferent.</p> <p>Being European means not looking away and pretending not to notice. Being European means having the courage to stick to your values, and not fall into the deadly trap of intolerance and hatred. Just like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/17/bataclan-paris-victim-helene-muyal-husband-antoine-leiris-killers-open-letter\">Antoine Leiris</a>, when he addressed the butchers who had murdered his wife and dozens of others at the Bataclan concert hall, telling them that he would not hate them; telling them that he would not give in to fear or sacrifice his freedom in exchange for alleged safety; telling them that even Melvil, his young son, would not hate them but would for the rest of his life be an affront to them with his freedom and happiness.</p> <p>Antoine and Melvil Leiris, European citizens. Giulio Regeni, European citizen. And <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/04/woman-defied-neo-nazis-sweden-tess-asplund-viral-photograph\">Tess Asplund</a>, European citizen, 42, Swedish, black. Alone, her fist clenched and raised, she faced 300 neo-Nazis who had taken to the streets in Borl\u00e4nge, north-west of Stockholm, to demonstrate against immigrants.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not right that Nazis should march down our streets,\u201d she said when asked why she had done it.</p> <p>European citizens.

Festivals and awards present, he said, \u201copportunities to put a message out\u201d which are currently being neglected.\u00a0</p> <p>\u201cAnyone who votes for Baftas shouldn\u2019t just think about what\u2019s best but what puts out some positive signals and celebrates our achievements in a different way.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the responsibility of Bafta members to use that platform to demonstrate that we\u2019re proud of our industry we\u2019re progressive and we\u2019re going to lead from the front.\u00a0</p> <p>\u201cThink about what you\u2019re saying on the night and what that is saying to the commercial sector the critical sector, to audiences to future film-makers.\u201d</p> <p>Roberts also sought to debunk the received wisdom that films directed by women are less easy to sell overseas. When he worked in sales, he said, some Japanese distributors had once told him: \u201cI love your film but it\u2019s good too many black people.\u201d He had discussed the issue with them and they relented. When faced by a similar prejudice in terms of female-directed films, said Roberts, \u201cI would say: \u2018That\u2019s just crap.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Other members of the panel echoed the sentiment, describing the lack of commercial viability of female productions as a \u201cred herring\u201d. Amanda Nevill, BFI CEO, said research they had conducted found that \u201cpound-for-pound female-directed films are a better bet\u201d.</p> <p>Nevill said that although increased parity in public funding was important, both in the opportunities offered and message sent, other practical measures \u2013\u00a0such as childcare \u2013 were needed to encourage women to remain in the film industry.\u00a0<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/apr/08/bfi-ceo-reform-uk-film-industry-amanda-neville\">BFI CEO: Without diversity, cinema will become irrelevant</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Foster also added that \u201csystematic changes in behaviour need to extend to the private sector\u201d if progress is to be achieved. \u201cIf you\u2019re getting public funds you must address imbalances. Mandatory targets are really important as they help us to tell the world we are an open and equal and good creative environment.\u201d</p> <p>The Directors UK report, which led the BFI Film Fund to commit to 50/50 funding by 2020, was informed by the situation in other parts of the world.

      "body": "<p>No one likes to be wrong. It is much nicer to be right. In life, however, it is not possible to be right all the time. We all try our best but there are times when things go horribly wrong.</p> <p>I should know. In July last year I sat down to write <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jul/14/claudio-ranieri-leicester-city-nigel-pearson\">an article about Claudio Ranieri</a>. The 63-year-old had just been appointed the new manager of Leicester City and I decided, in the capacity of being the football editor at the Guardian, that I was the right person to write that piece.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jul/14/claudio-ranieri-leicester-city-nigel-pearson\">Claudio Ranieri: the anti-Pearson \u2026 and the wrong man for Leicester City? | Marcus Christenson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I made that decision based on the following: I have lived and worked as a journalist in Italy and have followed Ranieri\u2019s career fairly closely since his early days in management. I also made sure that I spoke to several people in Greece, where Ranieri\u2019s last job before replacing Nigel Pearson at Leicester, had ended in disaster with the team losing against the Faroe Islands and the manager getting sacked.</p> <p>It was quite clear to me that this was a huge gamble by Leicester and that it was unlikely to end well. And I was hardly the only one to be sceptical. Gary Lineker, the former Leicester striker and now Match of the Day presenter, tweeted \u201cClaudio Ranieri? Really?\u201d and followed it up with by saying: \u201cClaudio Ranieri is clearly experienced, but this is an uninspired choice by Leicester. It\u2019s amazing how the same old names keep getting a go on the managerial merry-go-round.\u201d</p> <p>I started my article by explaining what had gone wrong in Greece (which was several things) before moving on to talk about the rest of his long managerial career, pointing out that he had never won a league title in any country and nor had he stayed at any club for more than two seasons since being charge at Chelsea at the beginning of the 2000s.</p> <p>I threw in some light-hearted \u201clines\u201d, such as the fact that he was the manager in charge of Juventus when they signed Christian Poulsen (not really a Juventus kind of player) and proclaimed that the appointment was \u201cbaffling\u201d.</p> <p>I added: \u201cIn some ways, it seems as if the Leicester owners went looking for the anti-Nigel Pearson. Ranieri is not going to call a journalist an ostrich. He is not going to throttle a player during a match. He is not going to tell a supporter to \u2018fuck off and die\u2019, no matter how bad the abuse gets.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0564865ce99118cf230b61934607a7749772b68d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0564865ce99118cf230b61934607a7749772b68d/0_0_1575_945/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Claudio Ranieri instructs his players during Greece\u2019s defeat by the Faroe Islands, the Italian\u2019s last game in charge of the 2004 Euro winners.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Claudio Ranieri instructs his players during Greece\u2019s defeat by the Faroe Islands, the Italian\u2019s last game in charge of the Euro 2004 winners.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thanassis Stavrakis/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rather pleased with myself \u2013 thinking that I was giving the readers a good insight to the man and the manager \u2013 I also put a headline on the piece, which read: \u201cClaudio Ranieri: the anti-Pearson \u2026 and the wrong man for Leicester City?\u201d</p> <p>I did not think much more of the piece until a few months later when Leicester were top of the league and showing all the signs of being capable of staying there.</p> <p>After a while, the tweets started to appear from people pointing out that I may not have called this one right. As the season wore on, these tweets became more and more frequent, and they have been sent to me after every Leicester win since the turn of the year.</p> <p>At some point in February I decided to go back and look at the piece again. It made for uncomfortable reading. I had said that describing his spell in charge of Greece as \u201cpoor\u201d would be an understatement. I wrote that 11 years after being given the nickname \u201cTinkerman\u201d because he changed his starting XI so often when in charge of Chelsea, he was still an incorrigible \u201cTinkerman\u201d.</p> <p>It gets worse. \u201cFew will back him to succeed but one thing is for sure: he will conduct himself in an honourable and humble way, as he always has done,\u201d the articles said. \u201cIf Leicester wanted someone nice, they\u2019ve got him. If they wanted someone to keep them in the Premier League, then they may have gone for the wrong guy.\u201d</p> <p>Ouch. Reading it back again I was faced with a couple of uncomfortable questions, the key one being \u201cwho do you think you are, writing such an snobbish piece about a dignified man and a good manager?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/nov/12/nicklas-bendtner-defence-of-arsenal\">In defence of Nicklas Bendtner | Marcus Christenson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The second question was a bit easier to answer. Was this as bad as the \u201cIn defence of Nicklas Bendtner\u201d article I wrote a couple of years ago? (The answer is \u201cno\u201d, by the way, few things come close to an error of judgment of that scale).</p> <p>I would like to point out a few things though. I did get \u2013 as a very kind colleague pointed out \u2013 50% of that last paragraph right. He clearly is a wonderful human being and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/29/claudio-ranieri-gentle-man-leicester-city-premier-league\">when Paolo Bandini spoke to several of his former players recently</a> one thing stood out: the incredible affection they still feel for this gentle 64-year-old.</p> <p>All in all, though, there is no point defending the indefensible: I could not have got it more wrong.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/may/13/leicester-city-and-the-tactics-of-champions\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4j6qz\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2504841\"            data-video-name=\"Leicester City and the tactics of champions \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5735c2a0e4b0a00e25404cd1\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/13/160512LeicesterMichaelCoxV3_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/13/160512LeicesterMichaelCoxV3_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/13/160512LeicesterMichaelCoxV3_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11493846&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/13/160512LeicesterMichaelCoxV3.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/may/13/leicester-city-and-the-tactics-of-champions\">Leicester City and the tactics of champions</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>At the start of this piece I said that no one likes to be wrong.

      "body": "<p>A multi-headed monster. An animal of fire. The Beast.<br /></p> <p>As it raged out of control across northern Alberta and burst into Fort McMurray with unparalleled ferocity, the wildfire began racking up a list of colourful nicknames.</p> <p>Within the span of a few days, the blaze had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/07/alberta-wildfire-oil-fort-mcmurray-evacuations\">swelled in size</a>, from some 1,200 hectares (3,000 acres) to more than 220,000 hectares (544,000 acres) . It cut a path of destruction through Fort McMurray, a city <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/11/fort-mcmurray-wildfire-cuts-canadas-oil-output-by-a-third\">in the heart of Alberta\u2019s oilsands</a>, forcing the evacuation of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/05/alberta-fort-mcmurray-wildfires-canada\">more than 88,000 people</a> and flattening some parts of the city, leaving <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/07/charred-earth-canada-dj-wildfire-ruins-fort-mcmurray\">a trail of charred rubble</a> in its wake.</p> <p>Few on the front lines had ever seen anything like it. \u201cIt\u2019s an unprecedented fire with respect to the rate it spread, how it involved the community,\u201d said regional fire chief Darby Allen earlier this week, after cooler temperatures and higher humidity allowed crews <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/08/fort-mcmurray-wildfire-canada-firefighters-months\">to get a handle on the fire.</a></p> <p>\u201cThe way this thing happened, the way it travelled, the way it behaved \u2013 they\u2019re rewriting their formulas on how fires behave, based on this fire,\u201d he said.</p> <p>So what made this fire different from the hundreds of others that ignite yearly in the region, or other wildfires around the world? \u201cWe\u2019ve had faster fire speeds, we\u2019ve had bigger fires, but this one, in terms of impact and where it landed, it is definitely historic,\u201d explained Chad Morrison, Alberta\u2019s manager of wildfire prevention.</p> <p>A 2011 fire in northern Alberta grew to more than 700,000 hectares (1.7m acres). Another, in 1951, burned some 1.4m hectares (3.5m acres), becoming one of the largest recorded fires ever seen in North America. But these fires burned in remote areas of the province, Morrison said. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever seen a community of this size and scale be impacted by a wildfire of this size and ferocity.\u201d </p> <p>The fire pitted firefighting crews \u2013 often more used to battling blazing houses or apartments \u2013 against a wildfire capable of sweeping through entire neighbourhoods. Firefighters <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/10/canada-wildfire-fort-mcmurray-saved-alberta-premier\">managed to save around 85% of the city</a>, leaving an estimated 2,400 homes and buildings to the flames. </p> <p>The cause of the extreme fire, which first ignited in a remote forested area, remains under investigation. </p> <p>Shifting winds early last week saw the fire swiftly transform from one that was largely under control into a raging blaze that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/03/wildfire-alberta-canada-fort-mcmurray-evacuation\">breached the boundaries of Fort McMurray.</a> At one point, the fire managed to jump a kilometre-wide river. </p> <p>\u201cNo amount of tankers or resources, or no size of firebreak, could have prevented it from hitting the community that day,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cSometimes Mother Nature is going to do what it wants to do and bad things happen.\u201d</p> <p>The \u201cnasty, dirty\u201d fire \u2013 in the words of the local fire chief \u2013 surprised scientists by igniting its own fires, said Mike Flannigan, who studies wildland fire at Edmonton\u2019s University of Alberta.</p> <p>Fuelled by tinder and helped along by unseasonably warm weather and low humidity, the fire released massive amounts of energy as it moved, creating its own weather, including lightning. Fires that produce lightning are not unheard of, said Flannigan. \u201cBut this one generated lightning and then generated new fire starts. That\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve heard this.\u201d</p> <p>As the fire made headlines around the world, many were quick to link its extreme behaviour to climate change. But Kerry Anderson, a fire research scientist with Natural Resources Canada, said the long-term records needed to firmly establish whether this link existed. \u201cWe know that forest fires occurred 100 years ago, but it\u2019s not really until the last 15 or 20 years that we\u2019ve gotten a fairly reliable record of the fire area being burned every year.\u201d </p> <p>He pointed to the current El Ni\u00f1o event to explain the extreme fire. A mild winter in Canada saw the fire season start some four weeks earlier than usual and helped created the tinder-dry conditions. \u201cFire is a natural part of the environment in Canada \u2026 If it weren\u2019t for fires, mature forests would suddenly be susceptible to fire and disease.\u201d</p> <p>Others say climate change could make these kinds of extreme fire events the new normal. \u201cWe have a temperature and it\u2019s turning into a fever and we\u2019re trying to ignore it,\u201d said Tim Lynham, a fire behaviour expert with Natural Resources Canada.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/may/05/alberta-drivers-dashcam-footage-of-wildfire-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4tqcf\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2499351\"            data-video-name=\"Alberta driver's dashcam footage of wildfire \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Caters TV\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-572b4647e4b00455bdea3d78\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/05/160505CanadaFireDashcam_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/05/160505CanadaFireDashcam_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/05/160505CanadaFireDashcam_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/05/160505CanadaFireDashcam_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/05/160505CanadaFireDashcam.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/may/05/alberta-drivers-dashcam-footage-of-wildfire-video\">Alberta driver\u2019s dashcam footage of wildfire</a></figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/true-north/2016/may/12/the-arsonists-of-fort-mcmurray-have-a-name\">The arsonists of Fort McMurray have a name | Martin Lukacs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Climate warming has seen snow melt earlier, leaving soil and vegetation drier and helping to push the fire season to begin earlier. The result is a longer period of the year when fires can occur, said Lynham. \u201cAnd with that will come more threats to communities.\u201d</p> <p>More than 500 firefighters continue to fight the blaze in northern Alberta. Its growth has slowed in recent days and its size now hovers around 241,000 hectares. Winds have helped shift its movement away from the communities.</p> <p>Across Alberta, where more than 15 wildfires are currently burning, firefighters continue to aggressively focus on the fire they call the Beast, all too conscious of its latent strength and power to wreak havoc. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s kind of a sleeping giant in that forested area,\u201d Morrison said. \u201cAnd someday, when it gets hot and dry again, it\u2019s going to wake up and go for a little walk in the forest and burn some more.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>On Wall Street, you eat what you kill. And boy, can they eat. According to a just-published annual survey by Institutional Investor\u2019s Alpha magazine, the 25 best-paid hedge fund honchos <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/10/hedge-fund-managers-salaries-billions-kenneth-griffin-james-simon\">pocketed $13bn in 2015</a>, a sum that exceeds the gross domestic products of many nations. </p> <p> What\u2019s interesting is that the huge payout comes in a year that has been more notable for the flight of investors from hedge funds, and that this year\u2019s big winners are more reliant than ever on algorithms to make their money. </p> <p> \u201cThe hedge fund model is under challenge,\u201d billionaire investment guru <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/hedge-fund-star-we-are-under-assault-1463071444\">Leon Cooperman said at the SkyBridge Alternatives Conference</a> (aka Salt) earlier this month. \u201cIt\u2019s under assault.\u201d Cooperman, <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2014/07/15/alpha-addict-the-amazing-career-of-leon-cooperman.html\">a famous workaholic</a>, even openly questioned whether it made sense for him to keep his fund open after some of his investors asked for their money to be returned to them.</p> <p> But then, Cooperman didn\u2019t qualify for Alpha magazine\u2019s rich list. He may be a billionaire, and over the years has often topped the rankings (he took home $825m as recently as 2013), but he lost money for his investors in 2015, and that meant he didn\u2019t make the grade. The hedge fund universe is a ruthless one: if you don\u2019t deliver for your investors, you don\u2019t get to collect fees big enough to brag about.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/10/hedge-fund-managers-salaries-billions-kenneth-griffin-james-simon\">Top 25 hedge fund managers earned $13bn in 2015 \u2013 more than some nations</a> </p> </aside>  <p> Increasingly, so-called active managers such as Cooperman, John Paulson (one of the coterie of hedge fund guys who bet that subprime mortgages would blow up the banking system in the years leading up to the financial crisis), and Bill Ackman, of Pershing Square Capital Management, are doing very badly when it comes to that apparently simple task: identifying a cluster of investments that will perform far, far better than the broad market, and deliver outsize returns to their investors. </p> <p> Although Ackman had a great year in 2014, his 2015 was utterly disastrous. His fund will stay alive: it\u2019s large and his investors pay a 1.5% management fee, regardless of performance. But in the wake of his big losses due to bad bets on pharmaceutical company Valeant (thanks to which countless other hedge funds found themselves swimming in a sea of red ink) and others, Pershing Square has plunged more than 40%. Before he can begin to pocket his incentive fee \u2013 the source of the lion\u2019s share of any hedge fund manager\u2019s earnings \u2013 he\u2019ll have to recover that lost ground. By some estimates, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/antoinegara/2016/03/24/pershing-squares-investment-team-led-by-ackman-made-509-million-in-down-20-year/#3aa1eb207ee3\">he\u2019ll need a 60%-plus rally</a>. </p> <p> The guys who are still making money hand over fist are doing so using not their own brains, but computer models. To be specific, they are \u201cquants\u201d, or quantitative hedge fund managers: eight of the ten top earners on Alpha\u2019s list fall into that category, and half of the 25 richest of the year are quants. Either they rely exclusively on computer models to tell them when and what to buy and sell, as Jim Simons at Renaissance Technologies \u2013 who holds the distinction of being the only person to appear on the list 15 years running \u2013 does, or they use them extensively to guide their decision-making, as does Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates.</p> <p> What this data shows is the beginning of a schism in the hedge fund universe between the traditional active hedge fund managers \u2013 traders or investors who scour the markets in search of a clever idea and then bet on it, sometimes using derivatives or other kinds of leverage to magnify the impact of their position \u2013 and the quant world. The latter group is tied to computer models and their screens, and couldn\u2019t care less about a company\u2019s business model or \u201cstory\u201d, as long as all those numbers they are screening for show up clearly.</p> <p> Last year, David Siegel, cofounder of Two Sigma Investments, one of those quants, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/sites/nathanvardi/2016/01/13/top-quant-hedge-funds-stand-out-with-good-2015/#66d05b26558e\">announced that one day</a> \u201cno human investment manager will be able to beat the computer\u201d. Siegel, himself a computer scientist, now manages more than $35bn, and qualified for Alpha\u2019s \u201crich list\u201d for the first time this year. He debuted at No 7 with estimated 2015 earnings of $500m. </p> <p> Clearly, even if some pension funds, including the California Public Employees\u2019 Retirement System (CalPers), have decided that the <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/calpers-shows-masters-of-hedge-fund-universe-have-no-clothes-heard-on-the-street-1410903036\">hefty fees simply don\u2019t make sense</a> for most hedge funds, they remain willing to pay big money to these \u201cquants\u201d. They don\u2019t mind making the managers rich if those managers deliver blockbuster returns to investors, as well. And while CalPers was earning only 7.1% from its portfolio of hedge fund investments in the year before it pulled the plug on them in 2014, the big quant funds have posted significantly better results. Two Sigma\u2019s two benchmark funds both returned 15% (after fees) last year, when many actively managed hedge funds posted losses or only meager returns. </p> <p> If the trend continues, brace yourself for a shakeup in the hedge fund universe.</p> <p> First of all, we can bid farewell to the adulatory treatment given to the masters of the universe <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2016/05/04/from-einhorn-to-chanos-to-gundlach-live-analysis-of-the-sohn-conference/\">who appear at conferences</a> or on television to share their wisdom and stock picks with us (promoting their ideas in the process, of course, in hopes of making both short and long ideas become self-fulfilling prophecies). This would be an excellent development; very little of this \u201cadvice\u201d is useful to the general investor, and a lot of it risks becoming harmful. At one Ira Sohn conference, hedge fund investor David Einhorn recommended buying SunEdison; the company later filed for bankruptcy. Bill Ackman took to the podium to promote Valeant, and <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/03/15/valeant-hedge-funds/\">the less said about that</a>, the better.</p> <p> It\u2019s likely that the number of hedge funds will continue to diminish, and even that investors will continue to pull assets out of the hands of hedge fund managers. That, too, is good news: with more hedge funds than Taco Bell outlets, it\u2019s simply impossible for each and every one to add the kind of value that they promise. It\u2019s an industry that can only deliver what it pledges if it remains small. But not everyone will do so: UBS already has said <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-19/ubs-boosts-global-hedge-fund-allocations-amid-market-volatility\">it plans to allocate more client assets</a> to hedge funds. </p> <p> To the extent that more of those assets start flowing into the hands of the quants, it\u2019s to be hoped that investors strive to understand what lies behind some of these \u201cblack box\u201d models, not all of which are transparent or easily understood, even by veterans of the investment space. </p> <p> At least, in contrast to some egregious corporate CEO compensation packages, at hedge funds it\u2019s impossible to become extraordinarily wealthy if your investors don\u2019t become wealthy, too. But what kinds of investment strategies are making them wealthy? Now that this is changing, it\u2019s time to look closely at this question.</p> <p> It\u2019s also past time to address the longstanding question of just how these hedge fund billionaires are taxed on their riches. They earn the bulk of their income in the form of \u201ccarried interest\u201d \u2013 or profits on the sale of securities, which the taxman, in his wisdom, chooses to treat as if they were the same as the proceeds your local deli owner gets when selling his business. <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2014/06/taxation_of_carried_interest_the_loophole_for_hedge_fund_managers_could.html\">Both sources of income are taxed at a lower rate</a>, instead of at the normal income tax rate (thus meaning that a hedge fund manager might pay as little as half the top income tax rate of 39%). This loophole could be addressed by the president quite easily, or formalized by Congress \u2013 and it would be a very popular move. </p> <p> Except, of course, with the 25 big earners on Alpha\u2019s \u201crich list\u201d.</p>",

      "headline": "Metamorphosis: 19 True Stories About Change by Polly Morland \u2013 review",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-15T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>A 2013 psychology study asked 19,000 people between the ages of 18 and 68 two questions: first, how much have you changed in the last decade? And, second, how much do you expect to change in the decade ahead?</p> <p>In nearly all cases the subjects of the study believed they and their lives had changed a great deal in the 10 years just ended. But when they looked to the future, they generally anticipated far less alteration in their circumstance and outlook. \u201cAcross the board,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.pollymorland.com/\" title=\"\">Polly Morland</a> points out in this wonderfully wide-ranging study of the principle of inconstancy, \u201cpeople seemed to regard the present as some kind of defining moment in which they had become the person they would be for the rest of their lives. They saw themselves as <em>changed</em> but with little capacity for <em>changing</em>.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If the surveys of fulfilment at work are to be believed, more than 80% of us feel we are in the wrong career</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The authors of that 2013 study coined a phrase for this fallacy; they named it \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jan/19/change-your-life-end-history\" title=\"\">the end of history illusion</a>\u201d. If Morland\u2019s inquiry into the nature of change in human life has a theme, it is to debunk the notion once and for all that stasis is ever an option. You could say that as a writer she has prepared the ground for this study in her previous two astute and substantial books, which were concerned, in turn, with the nature of courage and risk. It would be nice to think that those twin motivators formed the basis of all the stories of alteration that she dwells on here. In fact, though some of her subjects achieve positive change through Gandhi-like effort and force of will (\u201cbe the change you want\u201d), everyone else, like it or not, has change thrust upon them.</p> <p>Though Morland hops adroitly through the philosophy and literature and psychology of life as constant flux \u2013 from Heraclitus\u2019s \u201cno man steps into the same river twice\u201d through William James\u2019s sense that \u201cwe are spinning our own fates\u201d \u2013 this is not one of those \u201cmind, body, spirit\u201d books that is heavy on platitude and light on example. Morland, for many years an award-winning documentary maker, has twitchy antennae for all kinds of surprising stories that will illuminate her theme. She starts as she means to go on with the memorable tale of an Edinburgh police sergeant, Ed Coxon, who lived a previous life as an internationally acclaimed violinist. Music, for Coxon, the son of a university classics professor and a singing teacher, was always what he was meant to do. Until one day in his 30s, after nearly 20 years touring the concert halls of Europe, playing for legendary conductors, he decided it was not. He knew, he had always perhaps known, that if he were author of his own life, he would be doing something \u201creal\u201d (as he puts it). He put down his violin and applied to join the Lothian and Borders police, and never looked back.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/26/risk-wise-nine-everyday-adventures-polly-morland-review\">Risk Wise: Nine Everyday Adventures review \u2013 required reading for the education secretary</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How many of us live lives like Coxon\u2019s but never make that kind of deliberate change? If the surveys of fulfilment at work are to be believed, more than 80% of us feel we are in the wrong career, disengaged, perhaps trapped in the wrong life altogether. The ability to shift gears voluntarily is rarely straightforward and not often simply triumphant. Sometimes the stories Morland tells of change are tragic accidents: 18-year-old Peter, after a long coma that followed a jet-ski crash, emerges with a different personality entirely, and he and his family have to try to make sense of the great disjunction of self. Sometimes they are miracles: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/feb/19/i-saw-my-wife-10-years-after-we-married\" title=\"\">Shander Herian</a>, blind since the age of 10, has his sight partially restored in a pioneering process involving skin from his cheek and enamel from his teeth; he is grateful not only for the change but for the unique perspective of what seeing means. Sometimes, as in the stories of recovered addicts here, or of people who shed 20 of their 34 stone in weight, or discovered their true sexuality, there are 12 steps and determined changes of habit, and plenty of old-fashioned soul-searching.</p> <p>Morland is a measured, ever-curious and approachable guide through these stories, and she never takes the easy way out of them by denying their complexity, or attempting too much in the way of universally applicable self-help. Still, certain themes emerge. It is impossible, for example, to read the story of Hyppolite Ntigurirwa, who, aged seven, watched his family hacked to death in the Rwandan genocide and who has now completed a masters degree in sociology at Bristol University (and found the love to forgive his father\u2019s killers), without believing in the most effective of all change engines: educational opportunity. And it is hard, too, to read of some of the more restless, fulfilled, long-lived lives here \u2013 like that of choreographer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/mar/24/choreographer-gillian-lynne-reality-tv-harms-theatre\" title=\"\">Dame Gillian Lynne</a>, still working at 90 \u2013 without believing that happiness (or unhappiness) is never a settled state, always a pursuit, and that all that does not change is the will to change.</p> <p><em>Metamorphosis: 19 True Stories About Change is published by Profile Books (\u00a314.99).</em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/400564/s/metamorphosis/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a311.99</em></a></p>",

It runs Android, although not Google\u2019s Android, and therefore doesn\u2019t come with Google apps or the Play Store. Instead it has access to the Amazon app store and Amazon\u2019s various media, book and music services, as well as shopping apps and adverts on the screen (which cost \u00a310 to remove). Comes loaded with only 1GB of Ram, so running multiple apps or graphics-intensive games can prove challenging. Despite the touchscreen being only 17.7cm (7in), the tablet is chunky and quite heavy. It has a relatively low-resolution screen, pretty poor cameras and only one speaker. There\u2019s a microSD card slot for adding more storage and Amazon\u2019s Fire OS 5 is pretty good for basic tablet needs.</p> <p><strong>Verdict: </strong>Cheap and cheerful \u2013 and you get a lot of tablet for your money.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"51dc1ac1021ee829927233fa4ad6ee65587586ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51dc1ac1021ee829927233fa4ad6ee65587586ed/741_568_3663_2198/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 8.0\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 8.0.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"http://www.samsung.com/uk/consumer/mobile-devices/tablets/galaxy-tab-s/SM-T715NZKEBTU\">Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 8.0</a></h2> <p><strong>\u00a3295-\u00a3370</strong></p> <p> Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Tab S2 has a stunning 20.3cm (8in) screen (a 24.6cm version is also available) that knocks the socks off the competition in its price bracket.</p> <p>The Tab S2 is also one of the thinnest and lightest Android tablets available, which makes reading on the crisp screen a pleasure. A decent processor, 3GB of Ram and 32GB of built-in storage, plus a microSD card slot, mean you get plenty of performance for the money too.</p> <p>A fingerprint scanner on the front makes unlocking it a doddle, while decent cameras on the back and front will do in a pinch, if your smartphone isn\u2019t to hand.</p> <p>The Samsung runs Google\u2019s Android, which recently got updated to the latest version 6.0.1 Marshmallow, and all the apps and games you can shake a stick at through the Google Play Store.</p> <p><strong>Verdict: </strong>A great small tablet with brilliant screen that doesn\u2019t break the bank.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c0df5055016cd6830744c0858870f56f7d12dc74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0df5055016cd6830744c0858870f56f7d12dc74/638_777_3228_1937/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Google Pixel C\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Google Pixel C.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://pixel.google.com/pixel-c/\">Google Pixel C</a></h2> <p><strong>\u00a3399-\u00a3479</strong></p> <p> Google\u2019s first own-brand Android tablet is arguably the best available. With a solid all-aluminium build that is quite different from most other tablets, a brilliant screen and stereo speakers it is every bit top-end. It also runs the latest version of Android, and is guaranteed to get updates faster than almost anything else. It takes USB-C, both for charging and for data transfer, has a battery that lasts pretty much all day and a processor that can handle almost much anything you\u2019d want to do with it. There\u2019s even a battery monitor on the back that lights up with a double tap. The back and front cameras are good for a tablet, while there\u2019s a choice of 32 or 64GB of storage, but no microSD card slot for adding more. The Pixel C also lacks a fingerprint scanner. A very good optional (\u00a3120) keyboard magnetically attaches to the back, turning it into an Android-powered laptop, and inductively charges when closed over the screen.</p> <p><strong>Verdict:</strong> The best Android tablet that\u2019s capable of both work and play.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6c7d0e209b5d518dc1e72fbc4c629be862a94d4d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6c7d0e209b5d518dc1e72fbc4c629be862a94d4d/943_361_4269_2561/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Apple iPad Pro\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Apple iPad Pro.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"http://www.apple.com/uk/ipad-pro/\">Apple iPad Pro</a></h2> <p><strong>\u00a3499-\u00a31,019</strong></p> <p> Apple\u2019s latest tablet, the iPad Pro, comes in two sizes: 24.6cm (9.7in) and 32.8cm (12.9in). They both share the same processor and storage space, while the larger iPad has twice the amount of Ram at 4GB.</p> <p>Both tablets are arguably the most powerful non-PCs on the market, running Apple\u2019s mobile operating system iOS, just like an iPhone or previous iPads. But the iPad Pro is transformed into more than just a media-consumption device with the help of third-party apps.</p> <p>Both iPad Pros have around a day\u2019s battery, great screens, aluminium bodies and Apple\u2019s new Smart Connector port for connecting optional keyboards, and support for Apple\u2019s optional stylus, Apple Pencil.</p> <p>The bigger iPad Pro is the best non-PC large-screened tablet going, but it\u2019s not that light or portable compared with smaller tablets.</p> <p><strong>Verdict: </strong>The iPad\u2019s strength is in its third-party apps: these devices have plenty of power to make them fly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa4e29b85883175ab3a5fcf66f41202bc332dd3a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa4e29b85883175ab3a5fcf66f41202bc332dd3a/616_617_4653_2792/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Microsoft Suface Pro 4\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Microsoft Suface Pro 4.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msuk/en_GB/pdp/Surface-Pro-4/productID.326546100\">Microsoft Surface Pro 4</a></h2> <p><strong>\u00a3749-\u00a31,799</strong></p> <p> If you need a full PC in a tablet, the Surface Pro 4 is the pinnacle of Windows 10 tablets.

It has a great, high-resolution screen, stereo speakers, a kickstand and nine-hour battery for consuming media. It also has the full suite of Windows software for productivity (although Windows Office is a 30-day trial version), an optional keyboard/cover and full Intel core processors to handle most of what you might do with a powerful laptop.</p> <p>The Surface Pro 4 weighs 786g, so isn\u2019t particularly light for a tablet, but is very light for a PC. It also isn\u2019t always quite as instant-on as most tablets and there\u2019s a dearth of the kinds of good apps you find on iOS or Android, but when you get to a desk you can dock it with multiple monitors and everything else you might connect to a PC.</p> <p><strong>Verdict: </strong>The ultimate combination of work machine and tablet, if your bias is towards work.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-15T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Lunch with Mary Portas presents something of a sartorial challenge. You hardly want to turn up for the Queen of Shops wearing a dodgy outfit hauled from the back of the wardrobe; then again, dress too sharply and you might find yourself becoming an unwitting philanthropist. We meet for lunch in the <a href=\"http://greenberrycafe.co.uk\">Greenberry Caf\u00e9 in London\u2019s Primrose Hill,</a> just a few doors up from one of Portas\u2019s<a href=\"http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/get-involved/charity-shopping/marys-living-and-giving\"> Living &amp; Giving charity shops</a>, which she and Save the Children set up in 2009. There are now 20 of them, and Portas will go along and open new additions to the chain, recalling an occasion when her wife, journalist Melanie Rickey, came too. The couple were having lunch at a nearby cafe afterwards when a woman came up and congratulated Portas on the shop. Alas, Rickey recognised her very own Burberry mac. Portas concedes that she should have asked before donating it \u2013 though, she adds, she hadn\u2019t seen her wearing it for ages.</p> <p>I\u2019m not 100% convinced she\u2019s learned her lesson, given that her daughter Verity recently spotted her Clarks Wallabee shoes in the basement of a branch \u2013 though her mother did let her reclaim them and furnished the shop with a replacement. She tells me she spent the previous day doing nothing, although that turns out to be a Portas kind of nothing \u2013 listening to opera, making an apple crumble and clearing out a cupboard in the house she shares with Rickey, their son Horatio, nearly four, and, when they\u2019re home from university, her older children, Mylo and Verity. \u201cWe have too much stuff in this world!\u201d laughs Portas. I shift my jacket to another chair.</p> <p>This is Portas\u2019s local, and local is one of her favourite words. \u201cThat looks stunning!\u201d she cries, as a colourful salad arrives. \u201cLook, it matches my hair! This is our local caff!\u201d In all truth, you might struggle to find a proper fry-up along this chi-chi street, home to long established restaurants such as Limonia and Odette\u2019s and all manner of upscale boutiques, but Greenberry is popular, filled to bursting on a Monday lunchtime, with punters from architect Ron Arad in his trademark upturned brim hat to tiny-totted families.</p> <p>Over herrings and quinoa and pomegranate seeds, Portas and I fall to talking about the food she grew up eating; it\u2019s a theme that runs through<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/mar/09/shop-girl-mary-portas-breezy-memoir\"> her memoir, <em>Shop Girl</em>,</a> in which she describes growing up as Mary Newton, the fourth of five children in an Irish family in Watford. The book is written in a series of sketches, and dinners range from the salvaged steak that was distributed throughout the neighbourhood following a fire at a butcher\u2019s factory to the advent, in 1974, of Vesta curry, which Portas\u2019s mother serves with a bowl of mash, prompting her daughter to ask, \u201cIs it supposed to be crunchy?\u201d</p> <p>But period nostalgia is only one aspect of the book. When Portas was 16, her mother \u2013 misdiagnosed as menopausal and prescribed antidepressants \u2013 died unexpectedly of meningitis. Portas stepped into the domestic breach, helped by shopkeepers who would advise her on cuts of meat and vegetables. Their role in her life has informed her commitment to the importance of retailers to communities; many of them, she explains, \u201care what kept me rooted in the day, and guided me, and I don\u2019t think you can overestimate that\u201d.</p> <p>Her traumatic introduction to housekeeping stunted any early enthusiasm for the kitchen. \u201cI had it sort of thrust upon me, being a cook,\u201d she says, \u201cand so those early days weren\u2019t very much fun.\u201d What was it like, I ask her, to bring to life years in which her father also died and she found herself adrift? \u201cThe weird thing is,\u201d she replies, \u201cbecause I didn\u2019t really go into the public eye until my mid-40s, you don\u2019t ever really articulate that pain, or have to, unless to your partner, or you have memories, where you\u2019re in those intimate situations where you can reflect on those times.\u201d</p> <p>But things shifted when, in 2010 \u2013 by now, a columnist and TV presenter \u2013<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00pn40m\"> Portas went on <em>Desert Island Discs</em>,</a> and started to talk about her childhoodand family. \u201cI came out of recording and I rang Melanie, and I couldn\u2019t speak. It had uncovered it in the most wonderful way \u2013 stuff that I hadn\u2019t really dealt with. And so I decided to write these little vignettes down.\u201d Aside from her own recollections, she gathered together her siblings, \u201cand it was joyous. Did I cry? Yes. And I remember the day I was looking at Mylo and Verity, who were 16 and 14, and that was me, and that was Lawrence [her younger brother]. And I was running the home. And I think I just grieved for that, really, and I don\u2019t mean in any \u2018poor me\u2019 sense ... I put a shell round myself to get through life, and actually I wanted to protect that girl and write about her, and at the end of it, I liked her.\u201d</p> <p>To hear her speak about the fear she felt following her parents\u2019 deaths \u2013 \u201cyou were an orphan. So there was nobody to go home to on a Sunday. There was no home\u201d \u2013 chimes, unsurprisingly, with Portas\u2019s forthright, no-nonsense persona. If you\u2019ve reached the other side of such a profound loss still standing, you might well be inclined to grasp what life has to offer. Portas got a job dressing windows at Harrods, and later joined Harvey Nichols as creative director, joining the board before she was 30, by which point she also had two children with her husband, Graham Portas. She left when she couldn\u2019t get a bonus for a hard-working colleague: \u201cI thought, GOODBYE,\u201d she remembers, handed in her company Mercedes, got the tube home and started her own agency. She and the family lived out of a tin of money kept in the kitchen.</p> <p>Portas still has her agency, plus media work, charity shops and lecturing. But she has also had some fairly mixed experiences working with politicians \u2013 both as the public face of the \u201cPortas Pilot\u201d towns earmarked for investment, and as the author of a review into the future of the high street commissioned by the government in 2011. Suffice to say she has little time for the manipulations and manoeuvres of political life. At the same time, she has an undimmed enthusiasm for imagining what communities could and should look like. Her current thinking is that town centres need to deliver what online spaces can\u2019t, via \u201canchors\u201d \u2013 yoga centres, libraries, creches \u2013 that extend beyond retailing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/may/17/mary-portas-im-one-of-the-best-in-the-world\">Mary Portas: 'I'm one of the best in the world at retail'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Like many, she bemoans London\u2019s increasing unaffordability, and the narrowing it\u2019s likely to have on cultural life, arguing that government should identify spaces in all parts of the capital in which to build housing with capped prices for the under-35s. We are, she says, \u201cthe most creative country in the world, and undoubtedly, the greatest creativity comes out of this city\u201d. Would she ever want to be mayor of London? \u201cBe an amazing job to do, wouldn\u2019t it? But no, because of all that\u2026 it\u2019s politics\u2026 and it\u2019s a shame because I do realise there are some politicians who genuinely care. And you look at Obama \u2013 he\u2019s been unable to be Obama because of the system. And so we are actually looking at the thought that some shredded wheat, vile, hideous individual, could possibly take over from him. It is beyond shocking.\u201d</p> <p>In the middle of all this activity, Portas, now sipping tea, meditates, reads philosophy and walks to calm her mind; \u201cI\u2019m very thinky,\u201d she says. And she also spends a great deal of time ensuring that her own family enjoys the stability that she herself did until it was abruptly interrupted. \u201cOne of the worst things that ever happened when Mum died,\u201d she tells me, \u201cwas coming home to an empty house. It was just the worst \u2013 from coming home never having a key, opening the gate, opening the back door, the smell of cooking, your mum there, there might be someone chatting with her \u2013 but it was home. To opening the front door \u2013 just, dead. Grey, nothing. Nothing moved since you left that morning, you\u2019d left your dirty dishes because you were in a hurry, nothing smelt clean because you hadn\u2019t been there during the day.\u201d</p> <p>She recalls the tussle between her and Lawrence \u2013 \u201cboth of us wanting to get there first so at least one person would say hello when you got in\u201d \u2013 which led to what she calls an obsession with her own children never having to come into an empty house. She laughs. About four years ago, her daughter casually mentioned that her favourite time was when she got home and the house was empty \u2013 she could get what she wanted out of the fridge, put some music on, normal teenage stuff. Portas was shocked: \u201cSorry? Did you say your fav\u2013\u2026 and then I thought, because you\u2019re safe. And I\u2019ve given you that safety.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62cdaed900f942fbb9f17d0287549e436c65c97a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62cdaed900f942fbb9f17d0287549e436c65c97a/0_71_5206_3124/1000.jpg\" alt=\"They ate (Alex) Pickled herrings, beetroot, horseradish relish, sourdough toast, \u00a38; (Mary) wild rice, quinoa, sweet potato, feta, mint, spring onion, pomegranate salad \u00a310.25; (shared) Greenberry salad.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"><strong>They ate</strong> (Alex) Pickled herrings, beetroot, horseradish relish, sourdough toast, \u00a38; (Mary) wild rice, quinoa, sweet potato, feta, mint, spring onion, pomegranate salad \u00a310.25; (shared) Greenberry salad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Shop Girl is out now (Black Swan, \u00a37.99). <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/391585/\">Click here to buy a copy from Guardian Bookshop for \u00a36.39</a></em></p>",

      "body": "<p>When David Bennett, a passionate music fan, moved to London at the age of 25, he was desperate for any kind of break in the entertainment industry. So when a job came up with a secondary ticketing website \u2013 an online marketplace that matches fans selling gig tickets with buyers \u2013 he took it.</p> <p>A few years later he had quit, disillusioned and appalled by an enterprise that lined the pockets of touts at the expense of fans. \u201cIt was my job to look after the power sellers [industry term for ticket touts] and help them get the tickets they wanted,\u201d said Bennett, who asked for his name to be changed for fear of reprisals. \u201cSome of these guys set up companies with eight or 10 employees using multiple credit cards to buy tickets.\u201d</p> <p>He continued: \u201cI once went to meet a guy in a hotel who took out a stack of credit cards, there must have been 20 or 30 of them, to show how serious he was about getting tickets. I thought that was shady and wasn\u2019t really comfortable dealing with people like that.\u201d The last straw was when one primary ticket website wised up to the actions of one of Bennett\u2019s clients and blocked his credit card. </p> <p>The tout\u2019s response was to use his daughter\u2019s card instead. \u201cThat changed my mind about everything,\u201d said Bennett. He handed in his notice shortly afterwards. </p> <p>Welcome to the world of ticket touting in the UK. For as long as there have been ticketed events, there have been people trading on the fact that demand for live sports or music events outstrips supply. But the advent of the internet put rocket boosters under the trade. You can still find the old-fashioned touts outside venues, repeating their time-honoured mantra, \u201cTickets for the gig, buy or sell\u201d, but these days the real money is made online by armchair touts who target the most popular events.</p> <p>The armchair army will now be gearing up for the annual bonanza that is the British summer. Packed with sporting and musical events such as Wimbledon, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/18/radiohead-tickets-roundhouse-london\">Radiohead at the Roundhouse</a>, the England v Sri Lanka Test series, the AC/DC tour \u2013 not to mention dozens of hugely popular festivals and outdoor gigs \u2013 the next few months will do wonders for the touts\u2019 bank balances.</p> <p>These individuals can hoover up hundreds of tickets at a time and sell them on at a huge mark-up via resale, or \u201csecondary ticketing\u201d, websites<strong> </strong>such as Get Me In, StubHub, Viagogo and Seatwave.</p> <p>The mark-ups can be eye-watering. An extreme example was when a ticket for Adele at the O2 Arena in London in March was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/27/adele-ticket-resale-prices\">listed on Get Me In for \u00a324,840</a>, some 290 times face value. When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/dec/19/ticket-resale-sites-new-scrutiny-touting-seatwave-viagogo\">Elton John tickets went on sale</a> at the end of last year with a top price of \u00a390, minutes later the same tickets appeared on secondary ticket websites priced at \u00a3500.</p> <p>So why is it that touts are able to sell gig tickets at such exorbitant prices?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"056bc3f682e69244f113603890c4cb6175076456\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/056bc3f682e69244f113603890c4cb6175076456/0_79_2000_2500/800.jpg\" alt=\"AC/DC\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The AC/DC tour is another target for touts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Marquardt/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most ordinary fans simply don\u2019t stand a chance. Within seconds of an event going on sale, the tickets are harvested in their thousands by a small but ruthlessly efficient army of touts, many using multiple credit cards to bypass the limit on the number of tickets that one person can purchase. They make their profit by flipping the tickets they secure on to the secondary ticketing sites.</p> <p>Although secondary tickets are often advertised at a huge mark-up, there are usually enough devoted fans willing to pay what it takes to be there.</p> <p>The tout makes a quick and easy profit, while the resale website takes a commission of anything up to 25%, or sometimes more.</p> <p>Even more egregiously, secondary sites Get Me In and Seatwave are both owned by Ticketmaster, which ends up getting paid twice over. Everybody wins, except for the fans.</p> <p>The <em>Observer</em> spoke to one seasoned tout, who has built a business worth hundreds of thousands of pounds, thanks to the secondary ticketing world. Speaking on condition of anonymity, he said that the use of multiple identities and credit cards \u2013 to circumvent limits on the number of tickets one person can buy \u2013 is commonplace.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s standard,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can use multiple credit cards, multiple identities \u2026 it bypasses the ticket limits.\u201d</p> <p>Savvy touts, he said, will pay to join fan clubs in the knowledge that bands sometimes release tickets early to their most devoted followers. Even if they have to pay a subscription fee, the profit margin on the ticket easily covers the cost.</p> <p>\u201cYou can make a lot of money,\u201d he said. \u201cIf somebody buys \u00a350,000 of tickets, they should be able to make \u00a312,500 out of that.\u201d</p> <p>A few key players appear to play a pivotal role in the secondary ticketing game. Andrew Newman, for example, is just 25 years old but has built a business, Newman Corporation, worth \u00a31.6m from his home just outside Glasgow.</p> <p>He declined to comment on how the company operates or the methods he uses to get tickets.</p> <p>One rung below Newman is Peter Hunter, who runs and part-owns TicketWiz, one of the UK\u2019s most successful secondary ticketing businesses. The company has not published accounts since 2014, but these show a business whose assets increased in value from \u00a3157,000 to \u00a3270,000 in a year.</p> <p>Another big player is Norfolk-based Maria Chenery-Woods, owner of Ticket Queen. Companies House filings show that the business had assets totalling \u00a3543,000 as of March 2014, up from \u00a3395,000 a year before.</p> <p>Raymond Sullivan owns Double 8 Tickets, a firm with assets of more than \u00a3405,000 as of November 2014.</p> <p>Asked how they got their tickets, one such individual simply said: \u201cFront door, back door, side door.\u201d An investigation by the <em>Observer</em> revealed at least 10 businesses of similar scale, although the likelihood is that there are dozens, if not hundreds, more.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"050c414bedd7ac75604d052b300dd2aab0ea4213\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/050c414bedd7ac75604d052b300dd2aab0ea4213/0_129_3935_2361/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thom Yorke of Radiohead\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thom Yorke of Radiohead, another band fighting for fairer ticket prices.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Wolff - Patrick/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Whatever one makes of the morality of the ticketing money-go-round, some experts believe that the rules and regulations governing the system are routinely flouted. \u201cThere is no lawful way to harvest tickets in bulk,\u201d argues Reg Walker, Britain\u2019s leading ticket fraud expert and a director of ticket security firm the Iridium Consultancy.</p> <p>He points to the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading regulations 2008, which prohibit \u201cfalsely representing oneself as a consumer\u201d. Anyone masquerading as different people to get hold of multiple tickets for the purposes of a sale risks breaching these regulations, he says. As for selling the tickets on, the Consumer Contracts regulations 2013 say that any trader using online secondary ticketing platforms should provide their identity and their address or contact details.</p> <p>But punters will struggle to find an event on one of the secondary ticketing websites with information about who the seller is.</p> <p>Last year measures were included in the Consumer Rights Act 2015 that require anyone who resells an event ticket via a secondary market website to provide details of the seat row and number, as well as the face value. Critics say that the secondary sites are routinely ignoring this requirement, too.</p> <p>In November consumer group Which? said it had spent eight weeks investigating and had found that the rules were \u201cbeing repeatedly flouted on all the major secondary ticketing sites\u201d.</p> <p>Often there is very little information provided about where someone who buys a ticket will end up sitting. Campaigners say such information would make it easier to cross-check whether tickets were being sold by genuine fans or touts in it for the money.</p> <p>\u201cIt does appear that some secondary ticketing companies are breaking the law in the course of their business,\u201d said Nitin Khandia, director at BTMK Solicitors, a legal adviser on consumer-related problems. These regulations are supposed to be enforced by local authorities, but with central government cuts biting they lack the resources to police the existing law.</p> <p>It is not in the interests of resale websites, which make commission on every ticket sold, to crack down on touts who flout the law. And the touts themselves certainly have no interest in derailing the gravy train.</p> <p>Another tout, who declined to give his name, said: \u201cThe whole system works to the detriment of the consumer. But what does taking the moral high ground mean for touts? It means bankruptcy.\u201d</p> <p>One measure of the power that touts wield is the extent to which they are not just tolerated by secondary websites but courted by them.</p> <p>According to industry sources, back in 2011, before launching in the UK, StubHub threw a lavish party for some of the UK\u2019s biggest touts at the Radisson Blu hotel in London\u2019s Fitzrovia. Unlike Ticketmaster, which can boost secondary sales on Get Me In and Seatwave by redirecting fans to those sites, StubHub needed the touts on board \u2013 after all, they had the tickets.</p> <p>\u201cThese sites are protecting the identity of the touts, and they\u2019re doing it because they need them,\u201d said Labour MP Sharon Hodgson, who is co-chair of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2011/jan/29/stamp-out-ticket-touts\">all-party parliamentary group on ticket abuse</a>. \u201cNobody\u2019s policing this. I would say that the secondary market, and especially touting, is a parasitical business. They\u2019re making money off the backs of other people\u2019s hard work.\u201d</p> <p>The ticket sites have developed sophisticated lobbying efforts to support their opposition to any measures that might curb touting. Fan Freedom UK is a website that casts itself as a grassroots organisation for fans, battling against plans that might prevent ordinary people from selling on their tickets.</p> <p>Only a prolonged look through its US parent website reveals the truth of who is behind it: \u201cInitial funding for Fan Freedom and Fan Freedom UK was provided by StubHub, an eBay company.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/18/radiohead-tickets-roundhouse-london\">Gone in 20 minutes: Radiohead tickets for the Roundhouse, an impossible mission</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So why, with all this apparent evidence of dubious practices, is the government not doing more to crack down on ticket touting via resale sites? One of the reasons is that not all MPs are as anti-secondary ticketing as Hodgson. In a debate on secondary ticketing, Conservative MP Philip Davies branded fellow MPs trying to curb touting in the secondary market as \u201csocialists\u201d.</p> <p>One of the arguments deployed by Davies is that curbing ticket resales would disadvantage the ordinary fan who simply wants to recoup money for a ticket he or she can no longer use.</p> <p>But according to Reg Walker, legitimate resellers are very much in the minority on the major websites. \u201cThere was a WWE [wrestling] event in September where there were only 14,000 tickets released and 1,346 advertised on Get Me In the next day, so 10% of tickets have appeared immediately on the secondary sales.</p> <p>\u201cAre those people who had bought tickets and immediately decided they couldn\u2019t go? Of course not. The overwhelming majority of tickets on resale platforms are being sold by traders.\u201d</p> <p>Now, however, the government has a new opportunity to tighten the law on secondary ticket sales.</p> <p>Last October the government launched a long-awaited <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/nov/21/prince-ticket-resale-websites-government-review-secondary-ticketing-market\">review of how the secondary ticket market</a> was working, and whether consumers were sufficiently protected by the new rules. The review panel, chaired by Professor Michael Waterson, is due to release its findings in the next 10 days.</p> <p>A number of politicians and music industry representatives are calling on the government to enforce the provision already made in the Consumer Rights Act and, ideally, go further by requiring ticket resellers to reveal their identities. \u201cI\u2019d like to see some form of enforcement,\u201d said Hodgson. \u201cThe regulation and the laws that we have should be upheld.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb3917d149b88c441c217e8245572f61dd1f84a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb3917d149b88c441c217e8245572f61dd1f84a1/0_97_4904_2942/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Ashcroft\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Ashcroft: \u00a340 ticket on sale for \u00a3900 on StubHub.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But those who will perhaps have more clout are the growing number of artists, including Elton John, Adele, Mumford &amp; Sons, Little Mix, Royal Blood and Coldplay, who have become increasingly vocal in the past few years in their opposition to the way touts are allowed to use secondary sites. At the end of last year, Chris Martin, lead singer of Coldplay, <a href=\"http://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/stop-ticket-resale-sites-ripping-off-fans-coldplay-tell-uk-government/\">co-signed a letter to the government</a> with a number of other high-profile musicians calling for changes to the law to prevent ticketing resale sites from \u201cripping off fans\u201d.</p> <p>There are also now alternatives emerging to the secondary sites such as mobile ticket exchange app Twickets, which allows fans to offer tickets at face value or below for events they can no longer attend. Its founder, Richard Davies, is fed up with the greed of touts impinging on the rights of music and sports fans, and rejects the notion that touting is simply the free market in action.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/16/mumford-sons-join-the-fight-against-the-ticket-touts\">Mumford &amp; Sons join the fight against the ticket touts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe argument that a crackdown on secondary sales is dangerous because it infringes people\u2019s rights and could drive touting underground is nonsense, because we are already witnessing illicit behaviour,\u201d he said. \u201cProfiteering and deception are rife on the secondary platforms. Those selling through these channels are regularly breaking the law and the platforms themselves do very little about it.\u201d</p> <p>Ticketmaster failed to answer when asked to respond to this article, and StubHub declined to comment.</p> <h2>TOUT MARK-UPS</h2> <p>Before and after\u2026 what they cost when they first go on sale and what they cost when they land on secondary sites</p> <p>ADELE<br />O2, London, 21 March 2016<br />Face value: \u00a385<br />Price on Get Me In: \u00a322,000 - or \u00a324,840 when fees are included<br /></p> <p>RICHARD ASHCROFT<br />Albert Hall, Manchester, 14 May 2016<br />Face value: \u00a340<br />Price on StubHub: \u00a3900</p> <p>RADIOHEAD<br />Roundhouse, London, 28 May 2016<br />Face value: \u00a365<br />Price on Viagogo: \u00a33,934</p> <p>COLDPLAY<br />Wembley Stadium, London, 15 June 2016<br />Face value: \u00a350<br />Price on Seatwave: \u00a3549</p> <p>BEYONC\u00e9<br />Wembley Stadium, London, 2 July 2016<br />Face value: \u00a350<br />Price on Get Me In: \u00a3825<br /></p> <p>DAVID BOWIE PROM<br />Royal Albert Hall, London, 29 July 2016<br />Face value: \u00a320<br />Price on Viagogo: \u00a3250</p>",

Unofficial Chariots of Fire sequel greenlit in China</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Last Race, which is set for release this year in China and the UK, sees Fiennes play Eric Liddell, aka the Flying Scotsman; the athlete played by Ian Charleson in Hudson\u2019s drama. The deeply-religious Liddell was born in Tientsin, northern China, to Scottish missionaries, and returned there a year after his victory in the 400m at the Paris Olympics in 1924. He became a hero to the Chinese people, partly due to his athletic achievements \u2013 some consider him the first Chinese gold medallist.</p> <p>As Fiennes revealed, the film, from Hong Kong director Stephen Shin, tracks his heroics while interned during the second world war at a Japanese prisoner of war camp in 1943. Liddell organised the smuggling of food into the camp for the 2,000 starving inmates, and refused an opportunity to leave after Winston Churchill intervened on his behalf. He asked instead that a pregnant prisoner be allowed to leave the site in Weifang in east China. He died in 1945, aged 43, from a brain tumour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5f341063fa5867c8673ab92ea1dcf7c2ffead8e8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f341063fa5867c8673ab92ea1dcf7c2ffead8e8/0_0_1225_735/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flying Scotsman: as Eric Liddell in The Last Race, the unofficial sequel to Chariots of Fire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flying Scotsman \u2026 Fiennes as Eric Liddell in The Last Race, the unofficial sequel to Chariots of Fire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Flying Scotsman: as Eric Liddell in The Last Race, the unofficial sequel to Chariots of Fire./Cannes Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Fiennes dubbed his film a \u201ccontinuation\u201d of Liddell\u2019s story following the events that transpire in Chariots of Fire. \u201cWhat that film did was depict famously the moment up to the Olympics,\u201d the actor said. \u201cBut what we\u2019re doing is connected. But it also tells many other lives as well, it\u2019s not just Eric\u2019s story. It picks up and finishes at a place that I knew nothing about. We explore China, and we explore Eric.\u201d</p> <p>For Fiennes, The Last Race marks his first time acting in a fully Chinese production. \u201cFor a few actors, you get invited into another culture; this is a really extraordinary thing to be invited and to be able to see that culture through the eyes of another culture,\u201d Fiennes said. \u201cYou don\u2019t get often get that. As an actor that\u2019s a wonderful opportunity. But also as an individual, you get to open up your mind and see beyond the limits of your own culture.\u201d</p> <p>The actor jokingly said he resembles Liddell, due to his receding hairline, which he pointed to. As for training, Fiennes said he did have to do some, \u201cbeing in my mid 40s,\u201d but that he was grateful the film picked up following Liddell\u2019s Olympics experience.</p> <p>The Last Race has courted some <a href=\"http://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/news/chinese-censorship-fears-over-chariots-of-fire-sequel-about-eric-liddell-1-4108810\">controversy</a> for potentially skirting over Liddell\u2019s Christianity \u2013 Chariots of Fire describes how the runner refused to compete in his favoured 100m event in Paris because the heats were held on a Sunday \u2013 due to the Chinese government\u2019s antipathy towards religion. </p> <p>Fiennes briefly addressed the matter during the discussion, saying that the film and Laddell\u2019s legacy \u201ctranscend religion\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/15/joseph-fiennes-what-happened-next\">Joseph Fiennes: the sequel</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWhether you\u2019re atheist, Buddhist, Catholic, I think we can all agree that what Eric did \u2013 and our beautiful film does \u2013 is promote a sense of care,\u201d Fiennes said. \u201cCare towards those who are less fortunate. I looked at Eric and his beliefs as a set of principles that you can put in your daily life, which are not caught up in the dogma of religion. It\u2019s care towards your fellow human being and putting that fellow person before yourself.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s something I try daily to struggle with,\u201d Fiennes added. \u201cI\u2019m fallible. We are fallible.

Two months ago, she was tasked by the archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, with drawing up a plan to implement recommendations of an<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/15/damning-report-reveals-church-of-england-failure-to-act-on-abuse\"> independent inquiry into the way the church handled the case of \u201cJoe\u201d</a>. Over four decades, senior church figures failed to act on Joe\u2019s repeated disclosures of his abuse.</p> <p>Survivors who have been consulted by Mullally and her team have expressed confidence in the bishop\u2019s determination to improve the church\u2019s response to abuse disclosures.<br /></p> <p>But they have also voiced fears that the House of Bishops might be reluctant to acknowledge the extent of the failures and accept the need for radical action.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/15/damning-report-reveals-church-of-england-failure-to-act-on-abuse\">Damning report reveals Church of England's failure to act on abuse</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cDespite promises to change, they have done little,\u201d said Joe, whose identity is known to the Guardian. \u201cThis crucial House of Bishops\u2019 assembly gives them an opportunity to repent and swiftly change their structures, and make their response to survivors safe at last. Their mirage is finished. They must surely recognise this finally.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Phil Johnson of <a href=\"http://www.macsas.org.uk/\">Macsas</a>, an organisation that supports survivors of sexual abuse in the church, said: \u201cIt\u2019s good that Sarah Mullally recognises that the church is at a tipping point, but actions speak louder than words. It\u2019s very difficult to get real change through the House of Bishops.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/15/damning-report-reveals-church-of-england-failure-to-act-on-abuse\">independent inquiry into Joe\u2019s case</a>, led by safeguarding expert Ian Elliott, made 11 recommendations, including a new training programme \u2013 particularly for senior clergy \u2013 on receiving, recording and acting on disclosures. </p> <p>In the case of Joe, who told three bishops and a senior clergyman later ordained as a bishop about his abuse, Elliott said: \u201cThose that received the disclosures \u2026 did not manage that situation appropriately. No available records were created by anyone \u2026 no action was taken.\u201d</p> <p>He also said the church\u2019s national safeguarding team should have the power and responsibility to intervene in dioceses where necessary. \u201cThe lack of authority and responsibility at the centre is viewed as an important deficit in this case.\u201d<br /></p> <p>However, the C of E\u2019s 108 bishops in 42 dioceses strongly defend their local autonomy. \u201cBishops are very protective of their fiefdoms. They will resist any move they see as an attack on their independence,\u201d said a senior member of the clergy.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Johnson said the independence of each diocese was part of the problem. \u201cThe church really needs to tackle and modernise its archaic structures to ensure more accountability,\u201d he said.<br /></p> <p>According to Joe: \u201cBishops need to relinquish a lot of authority and be much more open to scrutiny.\u201d He added: \u201cIf they make the right choices, the church will change very significantly \u2013 and it needs to.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Although Mullally and the national safeguarding team are pressing for action to improve the church\u2019s response to sexual abuse disclosures, they acknowledge that change is likely to take longer than survivors would wish. \u201cNot everyone sings from the same hymn sheet on this,\u201d a church source said.</p> <p>A decision on whether to accept Mullally\u2019s plan may be deferred until September.</p> <p>Another high-profile survivor of clerical sexual abuse has refused to cooperate with an independent review ordered by the church into his case because he says the \u201cbullying and silencing\u201d he experienced as a result of his disclosures is not included in the inquiry\u2019s remit.<br /></p> <p>Graham Sawyer, a C of E vicar, was abused by Peter Ball, a former bishop of Lewes and Gloucester, who was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/oct/07/bishop-peter-ball-escaped-charges-mps-royal-family-intervened-court\">jailed for 32 months last October</a> for offences against 18 boys and young men in the 1970s, 80s and 90s.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Following Ball\u2019s trial, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/feb/23/church-appoints-panel-examine-role-peter-ball-abuse-case\">church ordered an independent inquiry led by Dame Moira Gibb</a> to examine the church\u2019s response to disclosures of the former bishop\u2019s abuse. The church has been accused of failing to act to bring Ball to justice when accusations first surfaced in 1993.</p> <p>\u201cFor me and for many other survivors there are two crimes. One is what Peter Ball did to me and others. But the other \u2013 and it endures \u2013 is the terrible way that the Church of England at its highest levels continues to treat us. And therefore if this review \u2026 doesn\u2019t include that bullying and vilification, then it\u2019s not worth the paper it\u2019s written on,\u201d Sawyer previously told the BBC Sunday programme.</p> <p>A Cof E spokesperson said: \u201cThe House of Bishops takes all safeguarding work very seriously and it is a standing item on the agenda. Bishop Sarah Mullally is working closely with the national safeguarding team to implement the recommendations of the Elliott review, and she will be presenting key messages on this to the House at its meeting this month.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Mullally had offered an unreserved apology for \u201cthe failings of the church towards [Joe]\u201d when she received Elliott\u2019s report on behalf of the C of E in March, the spokesperson added.<br /></p>",

      "body": "<h2>Cornelia Parker, artist</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a87147989695194ed0029f814f357b20bf73d01b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a87147989695194ed0029f814f357b20bf73d01b/1707_124_820_1025/800.jpg\" alt=\"Cornelia Parker\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The Tate always listens to artists: they\u2019ve been very good in bringing people on board to get feedback, so it\u2019s quite democratic. All artists want is something that\u2019s not vanity architecture, where their work is going to be compromised by the spaces. At Tate Modern I like the journey you go on, it\u2019s got a sort of pathway through it. The Turbine Hall is really spectacular \u2013 when it\u2019s got the right work in it, like, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2003/oct/19/features.review17\">Olafur Eliasson\u2019s <em>The Weather Project</em></a><em> </em>or the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2007/oct/14/art1\">Doris Salcedo crack</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/jun/12/artsfeatures.arts\">Juan Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s fake floor</a>, it\u2019s unique. There are not many public museums that have that kind of space. And also the views from the various floors \u2013 it connects you to the wider world. It\u2019s a cultural heavyweight and has put us on the art map internationally: it\u2019s a must-see thing, a bit like the Guggenheim in Bilbao. It\u2019s made the city a much more creative place to be. <strong>Interview by Kathryn Bromwich</strong></p> <h2>Karl Hyde, musician</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"392da418de5b3ea6486c3d21c31765306155192a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/392da418de5b3ea6486c3d21c31765306155192a/1164_1494_519_649/400.jpg\" alt=\"Karl Hyde\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve been going to the Tate Modern ever since it opened. I\u2019ve been taking my children there since they were tiny, the result of which is that my oldest daughter is going to art school. As someone who has grown up in galleries myself \u2013 as an outsider in some ways, because I come from a working-class, industrial part of the world \u2013 I wanted to introduce my children to the magic of galleries. We\u2019d spend hours walking around, listening to them interpret what they thought was going on. I remember my daughter, when she was five, saying that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/beuys\">Joseph Beuys</a>\u2019s ingots of metal looked like metal poo, and saying about a Franz Kline painting, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t look very happy, Dad.\u201d Just fantastic. I think one of the wonderful things the Tate Modern does is that it demystifies the whole gallery thing \u2013 it welcomes people in, even people who are intimidated by galleries, and that\u2019s extremely important. <strong>KB</strong></p> <h2>Jonathan Meades, writer</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"210c6b1f68f52df59a19500886b01331f8ba3dfb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/210c6b1f68f52df59a19500886b01331f8ba3dfb/2050_2276_1557_1945/801.jpg\" alt=\"Jonathan Meades\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The Tate spent a fortune on an eye-wateringly expensive rebranding as \u201cTate\u201d. What is it that graphic designers have against the definite article? Nonetheless, Miles Newlyn\u2019s font is catchy. Which is more than can be said for many of the exhibitions. Still, the frivolous bias towards braindead conceptualism is not specific to it: the same paucity of ideas and mangling of language can be found across the world in every gallery where the wretched, entirely conventionalised curatocracy has power. What the Tate should be thanked for is preserving Giles Gilbert Scott\u2019s magnificent Bankside power station. This great architect\u2019s better-known Battersea station has been transformed into a pile of bricks to be fought over by questionable developers and their lesser architects. And Scott\u2019s Guinness brewery at Park Royal was torn down a decade ago by the boorish philistines who run Diageo. So, a muted hurrah for Serota.</p> <h2>Gavin Turk, artist</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a699b5821c5b06f65086710200add45076f183cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a699b5821c5b06f65086710200add45076f183cc/1110_395_506_633/400.jpg\" alt=\"Gavin Turk\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>People talk about the spring in the step of the YBAs as one of the things that went into the impetus to make Tate Modern. And it\u2019s become a kind of testament to that time. I love the idea of it, that they\u2019ve made an art gallery in an old power station, but travelling around the building can be a slightly confusing experience, akin to the confusion that some people have when they look at art. It\u2019s a slightly awkward space. There\u2019s a strange communication between floors, it seems I can never get the elevator or lift to the floor I want.</p> <p>But the Turbine Hall\u2019s shared-experience artworks have been incredibly successful, the most amazing art experiences in London. When I saw people lying on the floor looking at Olafur Eliasson\u2019s sun, the whole cultural system of looking at art seemed to be transformed. Or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/video/2009/oct/12/miroslaw-balka-tate-modern\">Miroslaw Balka\u2019s huge container</a>, where you walked into blackness, that was really weird, that art could leave you so abandoned.</p> <p>Tate generally doesn\u2019t have much purchasing power so one of the important things about having a prominent and attractive building is it makes collectors want to donate their artworks. If you\u2019ve got a powerful frame people want to put their art into that frame.</p> <h2>Ekow Eshun, journalist</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"16fa5ba32e5c9c5cacf65b4c5a1f1440ba3a9e3f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16fa5ba32e5c9c5cacf65b4c5a1f1440ba3a9e3f/2377_474_1760_2200/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ekow Eshun\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Tate Modern has succeeded in an improbable and wholly welcome feat - it has helped Britain fall in love with contemporary art. This is no mean achievement if you think back to the hooting and cat-calling that accompanied the unveiling of Tracey\u2019s bed or, further back in time, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/jan/23/carl-andre-turner-contemporary\">Carl Andre\u2019s bricks</a>. The sheer scale of the gallery when it opened in 2000 set down a marker that art was a subject worth taking seriously. Yet despite its vastness Tate is no austere cathedral of culture. It doesn\u2019t demand obedience from its visitors. Nick Serota\u2019s masterstroke at the gallery\u2019s launch was to exhibit artworks thematically rather than chronologically, creating displays that seemed to be having a conversation across regions and time periods and cultures, instead of offering yet another assertion of the primacy of 20th century western art. The result is a place that\u2019s open and welcoming to diverse perspectives and experiences. A site that\u2019s more pleasurable and fascinating to explore than any major art gallery in Britain has ever been before.</p> <p>Truth to tell, the British public may never wholly abandon its scepticism about art. But the crowds pouring through Tate\u2019s doors each day suggest that delight rather than derision is now closer to our default setting on the subject.</p> <h2>Sadie Coles, gallerist</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"25c1ee3bb62752d88a0eeacc619171084dcddc7b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/25c1ee3bb62752d88a0eeacc619171084dcddc7b/151_51_618_773/400.jpg\" alt=\"Sadie Coles\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>All London galleries should thank their lucky stars that Nick Serota imagined and then forced Tate Modern into being. It instantly joined the elite of agenda-setting, world-class contemporary museums, with a seriousness and quality in both the exhibition programme and the careful development of collections. Hot on the heels of the YBAs\u2019 energy and in tandem with Frieze, it brought the focus of the international art market to London. It stands for integrity and intelligence, and the balancing effect of its presence is essential and in a true way raises the bar for all of us in the arts. It is Dad (to quote Sarah Lucas). London has its problems but is a city with huge diversity and Tate Modern has served its very broad public well. And if it is a personal anecdote you want: I said yes to love in Tate Modern\u2019s car park after an inspiring visit in 2004. That\u2019s the power of art.</p>",

      "headline": "The Bull & Swan, Stamford, Lincolnshire: hotel review",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-14T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Had you popped out for a pint in Stamford in 1684, you may, if you were unlucky, have bumped into the Honourable Order of Little Bedlam, a drinking club of local aristos whose zany nicknames (Stag, Wild Horse and, erm, Porcupine) give you a flavour of why you would not want them in your local.</p> <p>One of the Order\u2019s favourite watering holes, the Bull &amp; Swan, has chosen to make a virtue of this association, naming and quietly styling its nine bedrooms after this proto-Bullingdon Club, whose members included Sir Isaac Newton. Luckily, this celebration of \u201cBedlam\u201d runs no deeper than that light thematic conceit and the periwigged portraits hung in the bar. The Bull (or the Bull &amp; Swan at Burghley, to give you its full title) is nowadays a model of civilised, democratic hospitality. Chatty manager Jen Totty sets the easy-going tone. Her welcome is as warm as the Bull\u2019s open-fires. I encounter zero Hooray Henrys.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7a9343a2a6dd890014fa6e32098d43e9d9989e1e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a9343a2a6dd890014fa6e32098d43e9d9989e1e/0_0_5352_3568/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Top Bar at The Bull & Swan at Burghley, Stamford\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>It is perhaps hard to reconcile Stamford with such tales of roistering rich folk. Clustered around the river Welland, this almost comically pretty town of historic, honeyed-stone buildings, imposing churches and narrow alleys, exudes serenity. After breakfast at the Bull (decent spread, but my potentially first-rate eggs Benedict was hobbled by its slightly grainy, too vinegary Hollandaise), I walked into the neighbouring Burghley Estate. Under cloudless blue skies, the scene \u2013 manicured cricket pitch, sheep grazing lazily amid ancient oak trees, the extravagant Elizabethan Burghley House in the distance \u2013 was like something out of a glossy period drama. It felt almost unreal.</p> <p>Not that Stamford\u2019s appeal lies solely in 16th-century buildings, of course. The previous night I had sought out the Jolly Brewer, partly to watch the football (when your club reaches the Champion\u2019s League semi-final, architecture takes a back seat), partly because this basic, no-frills boozer does a very good line in craft beer from, among others, Oakham\u2019s and local outfit, Baker\u2019s Dozen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e2079c09faa56261b2b7830656fa1cc6a218808f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2079c09faa56261b2b7830656fa1cc6a218808f/0_0_5108_3405/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Room at The Bull &amp; Swan at Burghley, Stamford\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The Bull\u2019s three grades of bedrooms are anything but no-frills. Differentiated by features such as roll-top baths, they are spacious, well kitted-out (duck-down bedding, Teapigs teas and Nespresso machines, strong Wi-Fi), and notable for their outsize Rajasthani furniture and quirky architectural features. With its handsome exposed-stone walls, swanky walk-in shower and huge original fireplace with log burner, room nine, Newton, is a doozy. The room is dressed, of course, with a copy of Newton\u2019s Principia Mathematica and pieces of antique measuring equipment. Someone should have used it to work out that, when lying in bed, the large chairs at the foot of it partially obscure the TV. They should measure up for some shelves in the bathroom, too. It needs them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eb8be89d6bebe54e6622783b8a7633c0b0492a16\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eb8be89d6bebe54e6622783b8a7633c0b0492a16/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Food at The Bull & Swan at Burghley, Stamford\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>If the Bull\u2019s bedrooms impress, its food \u2013 gussied-up pub grub utilising quality local produce \u2013 was satisfactory without bowling me over. The drinking snugs and a de facto dining room (where you also breakfast) fan out around the bar separated by partitions, and you can eat in either. A Panko-crumbed, still runny scotch egg (\u00a34.95) mined with black pudding was almost exceptional. Fried-to-order and served hot, it would be. Fishcakes (\u00a37.95) were a shade potato heavy but lifted by their distinctive lemony flavour and (good attention to detail, this) a sharply dressed side salad and a sparky tartare.</p> <p>Washed down with a pint of Nene Valley\u2019s blond session ale (the pick of four traditional cask ales, from \u00a33.60 a pint), the BS burger (\u00a314.50) was less successful. We shall draw a discreet veil over the sweet-potato fries (why, why, why?), but the overly dense, if juicy, patty lacked the lubricious, bangingly beefy quality of the best contemporary burgers. Likewise, its traditional, rather dry, seeded burger bun explains why most people now use brioche.</p> <p>A fragrant, spicy burger relish completed a burger that, ultimately, felt dated. Stamford may be steeped in its past and the antics of its ancestors, but \u2013 as the Bull\u2019s rooms do \u2013 you have to simultaneously embrace the 21st century.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Accommodation was provided by The Bull &amp; Swan at Burghley, St Martins, Stamford (01780 766 412, </em><a href=\"http://www.hillbrookehotels.co.uk/the-bull-and-swan/\"><em>thebullandswan.co.uk</em></a><em>, doubles from \u00a399 B&amp;B).

      "body": "<p>Jacques Herzog, the more talkative half of the pair of boyhood friends who founded the architectural practice <a href=\"https://www.herzogdemeuron.com/index/projects/complete-works/426-450/438-new-vancouver-art-gallery.html\">Herzog &amp; De Meuron</a>, is worried about the world. \u201cThe things based on the five senses that we like so much, all these values \u2013 that we treat people well. They are in danger. There is such a threat around.\u201d He is talking firstly about the threat to European urban civilisation from terrorism, followed some paces behind by his perception that \u201cthe middle class is disappearing\u201d. He sees the loss of possibilities of common ground, of cultural experiences shared by different people. In which case <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/visit/tate-modern\">Tate Modern</a>, the vastly successful museum in Bankside, south London, might be considered a redoubt of this endangered world.</p> <p>In 1995, to some bafflement among commentators, Herzog and Pierre de Meuron were appointed architects for what is now called Tate Modern. Who were they? Until that time their best-known works had been signal boxes and facilities for the herbal sweet manufacturer <a href=\"http://www.ricola.com/en-gb\">Ricola</a>. Why had this Swiss practice been chosen ahead of Britain\u2019s glittering array of hi-tech modernists, who had been frustrated for years by Margaret Thatcher\u2019s lack of interest in public commissions and Prince Charles\u2019s hostility to contemporary architecture?</p> <p>Tate had already been criticised for its decision to retain and convert grubby old Bankside power station for use as its new gallery of modern art, rather than commission a sparkling new statement of confidence in the future. It looked like architectural conservation gone mad. Feelings were compounded still further by the fact that, of all the entrants in the competition, Herzog and De Meuron proposed to do the least. Their rather modest drawings seemed to show an art gallery that still looked very much like the power station. It was only when Tate Modern opened, in 2000, that the drama and potential of its enlarged Turbine Hall became apparent.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There should be no safety rails in your architectural perception. You should be able to fall down</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Now they are back, with the opening next month of their <a href=\"https://www.herzogdemeuron.com/index/projects/complete-works/251-275/263-the-tate-modern-project.html\">extension to Tate Modern</a>, one of an elite band of globally renowned Pritzker-prize-approved practices and of an even smaller subsection of that band who retain the ability to surprise with their work, who seem still able to invent rather than recycle their greatest hits. Their sweet factories and signal boxes have been augmented by the <a href=\"http://beijingolympicstadium.com/\">Beijing Olympic Stadium</a>, towers and museums across the world, wineries and villas, Prada stores, pharmaceutical headquarters, several more stadia \u2013 including one proposed for Chelsea Football Club \u2013 a car park, apartment blocks. Their global/local geographic range includes Vancouver, S\u00e3o Paulo, Tokyo, Kolkata, Mexico, Miami, San Francisco, Tenerife, Minneapolis, Beirut, as well as 60 or more projects in and around their home town of Basel. They employ 422 people at the last count.</p> <p>They have remained throughout in the same tranquil Rhine-side base, centred on an old grey bourgeois villa, but infiltrating and adopting surrounding buildings to form a village of studios and courtyards. At the centre are the two founding partners, whose fellowship has lasted for most of their 66-year lives. In some architectural partnerships there is a division of roles \u2013 one the artist, the other the businessman for example \u2013 but they have always insisted that theirs is an indistinguishable collaboration. They have complementary personalities, however. Herzog, shaven-headed, gym-toned, eloquent, alert with contained energy, is happy to be the public face of the practice. De Meuron has a more professorial manner and stays more in the background. As it happens illness prevents him from meeting me in Basel, so I have to catch up by phone.</p> <p>They are not in the business of false modesty, especially Herzog. Last year they opened a new building to house an archive of decades of creativity \u2013 models, test samples, full-scale mock-ups of bits of building and the like, which thanks to their interest in exploring building materials is a vast magpie\u2019s nest of things shiny, matt, bubbling, melting, perforated, sliced, assembled and moulded, chemical and natural, coloured and monochrome. It is at some risk of resembling a pharaoh\u2019s tomb, but effort has gone into making it a working tool, a place where employees and others can learn how past projects were put together. The archive building, which is surmounted by several floors of flats, is an intriguing, partly menacing structure in an industrial area of Basel. \u201cIt is a great building,\u201d says Herzog.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"92460bda54f7b8ac54347fd8133621217666245d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92460bda54f7b8ac54347fd8133621217666245d/0_31_2247_2469/910.jpg\" alt=\"An artist\u2019s representation of the Tate Modern extension.\" width=\"910\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An artist\u2019s representation of the Tate Modern extension.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Hayes Davidson and Herzog &amp; de Meuron</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Their Tate extension, which is partly a new building and partly the adaptation of previously inaccessible parts of the old power station, enlarges the already-not-small institution\u2019s floor area by 60%. At \u00a3260m and nine years in the making, it will have cost more in time, money and agony than the first version. If they cause bafflement now it will be for a new reason: if in the proto-Blair era they were considered minimal, rarely straying from straight lines and right angles, their new work \u2013 to be known as the Switch House after the former electrical facility it partly occupies \u2013 includes a brooding pyramidal tower, a 64.5 metre-high stack of bricks, faceted and oblique-angled, that is anything but reticent. \u201cIt looks like a car park,\u201d says a friend to me. It certainly goes against all the conventions of public cultural institutions, that they should look open, accessible, transparent and friendly.</p> <p>But then Herzog and De Meuron don\u2019t want just to be nice. Herzog says that they dislike \u201carchitecture that is totally affirmative \u2013 that says this is how the world is and we stay here for ever. Everyone wants solid ground under their feet but the important question is, how do you do all this and at the same time communicate transformation and doubt?\u201d Their work is not just sunny and optimistic. They can also do decadent, crepuscular, uncanny, deliquescent, louche, lubricious.</p> <p>Herzog has said that \u201cthe greatest inspiration is the existing world in all its ugliness and normality\u201d. \u201cThe two of us from the beginning,\u201d says De Meuron, \u201cwe were very interested in everything, not just canonic architecture from Egyptians up to modern times. Everything is interesting if you are ready and able to look at it. There should be no safety rails in your architectural perception. You should be able to fall down.\u201d</p> <p>Artists, says Herzog, are much better at uncertainty and instability than architects. He unexpectedly cites Leonardo da Vinci and the way he painted an angel\u2019s wings: \u201cYou can see he was not a believer. When he paints the joint where the wings meet, when he has to work out how you attach a wing, you get a sense of his disgust and disbelief.\u201d Great names of architecture, by contrast, seem to have no such doubt. \u201cThey were almost religious about their work, a bit absurd. <a href=\"http://miesbcn.com/\">Mies van der Rohe</a>, <a href=\"http://www.fondationlecorbusier.fr/\">Le Corbusier</a>: how can they be such heroes?\u201d</p> <p>Sympathy and collaboration with artists is a distinctive feature of Herzog and De Meuron\u2019s architecture. They started out in the 1970s, an arid time for their profession, and instead <a href=\"https://www.herzogdemeuron.com/index/practice/writings/conversations/huerzeler.html\">found inspiration</a> in working on an art project with Joseph Beuys when they were still students. Later they would work on the Beijing stadium with Ai Weiwei, whom they got to know before he became a worldwide celebrity. All arts, says Herzog, share the questions of \u201chow things are made and why things are made. How organic substance goes with nonorganic. They reveal ways of looking at the world, what comes out when someone does a poem, a painting, a sculpture or a building.\u201d</p> <p>From contemporary art they learned that concept is more important than style \u2013 unlike other architects, Herzog and De Meuron avoid a signature look and instead seek almost obsessively to find a different set of materials, details and forms for almost every project. At the same time each, thanks to a consistent underlying attitude, is somehow recognisably theirs.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018I don\u2019t want to sound arrogant,\u2019 says Herzog, \u2018but the Turbine Hall was a stroke of genius\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>They also learned to engage people in different ways, by combining the intellectual with the sensual: they like to build with substances that are delectable, perturbing, earthy, ethereal but in all cases fascinating and engaging. Their means include mud, black lava-like concrete, the multiple reflections of glass, copper, the printing of images on to glass, plastic or concrete such that a wall suddenly resembles the page of a book. They like to give their materials a perceptual twist, such as making the heavy look light or the transparent solid. There is a corresponding range in their projects: they can do a soothing wooden rehabilitation centre for people whose lives have been ripped up by spinal injuries, or the restoration as an arts centre of the sybaritic militia headquarters at the Park Avenue Armory in New York, where sons of the gilded age used to party between going out to subjugate insurrections of the starving.</p> <p>Their affinity with artists helped them to win their first Tate commission, along with a refined gallery that they had by then realised in Munich. They have continued to design spaces for art ever since, such as the recent extension of the <a href=\"https://www.herzogdemeuron.com/index/projects/complete-works/351-375/356-musee-unterlinden.html\">Unterlinden Museum</a> in Colmar, Alsace, which houses Gr\u00fcnewald\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.musee-unterlinden.com/en/collections/the-isenheim-altarpiece/\">Isenheim altarpiece</a>, the hallucinatory masterpiece of agony and exaltation that is one of the greatest works of Germanic renaissance art. Herzog and De Meuron\u2019s design combines subtle insertions with spooky-gothic facades and stairs of baroque dynamism, and exhibits their ability to bring architectural personality to gallery spaces, while also respecting the exhibits.</p> <p>Meanwhile their expansion and success has introduced them to bigger and sometimes cruder commissions. Their chaste early work has, to the dismay of purists, been augmented by spectacle, glitter, going on bling \u2013 the media-friendly Beijing stadium, for example, which imprinted itself on the consciousness of the world. In Basel they have created a long hangar, silvery, scaly and punctuated with a giant circle in the roof, to house the city\u2019s trade fairs.</p> <p>Working at scale puts them in the not-always-nice environments where power and money reside. Their <a href=\"http://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/\">Blavatnik School of Government</a> in Oxford is a wondrous hatchery for future world leaders, but is also an oligarch-sponsored influence machine, a henhouse, as the <em>New Yorker</em> noted, sponsored by the fox. Like <a href=\"http://www.fosterandpartners.com/\">Norman Foster</a>, <a href=\"http://oma.eu/\">Rem Koolhaas</a>, the late <a href=\"http://www.zaha-hadid.com/\">Zaha Hadid</a> or most architects of their stature, some of their commissions expose them to accusations of complicity with tyranny. The involvement of such a well-known dissident as Ai Weiwei in the stadium (though he later regretted it) was some inoculation against criticism, but the project was still clearly central to the propaganda of the People\u2019s Republic of China.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"99fd9903a6ab211bd2b8f7ac5cbba5902b063b8e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99fd9903a6ab211bd2b8f7ac5cbba5902b063b8e/0_1_5545_3327/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tate Modern\u2019s Turbine Hall in the 90s, when it was still Bankside power station.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tate Modern\u2019s Turbine Hall in the 90s, when it was still Bankside power station.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Harris/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>No one has found the perfect answer to these questions, nor the right position between virginity and whoredom. Neither perfect purity \u2013 never engage with any government or institution that is any way questionable \u2013 nor complete complicity \u2013 work with absolutely anyone no matter what \u2013 makes sense. Most such architects argue that western governments and businesses work with nasty regimes, so it would be futile for architects to do otherwise, and that engaging with them might do more to change such societies than standing aloof. \u201cThese are good questions,\u201d says Herzog. \u201cI don\u2019t know the answers because nobody does.\u201d</p> <p>Herzog and De Meuron are not shy of projects controversial for their scale and impact. In Paris they are designing the Tour Triangle, an 180 metre-high hotel and office building on the edge of the Boulevard P\u00e9ripherique, that was first rejected and then, after some pushing and manoeuvring by mayor Anne Hidalgo, approved by city councillors. In Basel a 41-storey <a href=\"https://www.herzogdemeuron.com/index/projects/complete-works/426-450/435-development-plan/IMAGE.html\">tower</a> for the pharmaceutical company Roche, white and stepped, now rises above the predominantly low-lying and historic city. A second, slightly shorter tower is on the way. In both Paris and Basel their towers have a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/the-shard\">Shard</a>-like potential to change the perception and scale of their respective cities, for better or for worse.</p> <p>Herzog is keen to argue that the Basel towers differ from the speculative and attention-seeking Shard, in that it grows out of the needs of Roche, which employs a lot of people in the city, for that much space on that site, not that they were \u201cfighting for visibility\u201d. The Paris project is the first skyscraper in Paris since the still-reviled <a href=\"http://www.tourmontparnasse56.com/fr/\">Tour Montparnasse</a> of 1973, but in Herzog\u2019s view is justified by its location away from the centre. It is part of an emerging policy to put towers at the edge of the city, \u201cwhich I totally support\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jun/28/london-the-city-that-ate-itself-rowan-moore\">London: the city that ate itself</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tate Modern brings together Herzog and De Meuron\u2019s interests in both art and the brute forces of modern cities. \u201cIn Paris,\u201d he says, \u201crigid control makes it so beautiful. London is the greatest city in the world, or at least in Europe, because it gives so much freedom to make money, to do deals. I guess you cannot do both things. The bad thing is that it is more of a struggle [to realise projects like Tate]. The good thing is that there is a network of the most powerful collectors and sponsors. They are great. There are also all these gangsters. That\u2019s London\u201d.</p> <p>The \u201cfight in London\u201d is \u201cmore an individual fight\u201d, in which cultural institutions and their architects have to carve out their physical niche amid the competing claims of property speculation. In this context Tate, and its director Nicholas Serota, constitute \u201ca world wonder. It made itself a space. That is Nick\u2019s great merit. He is the most powerful man in the art world and also the most gifted one. He made it a bastion of publicly accessible space.\u201d</p> <p>The first version of Tate Modern derives its power from the grand declaration of publicness that is the Turbine Hall. The already huge space in which electricity was generated was made still bigger by removing its ground floor and incorporating its former basement into the single void. It was an act of surreptitious extravagance in the architects\u2019 low-key approach that was incomprehensible to the property developers advising Tate. Why would you want to give away all that useful space in the ex-basement? De Meuron says that the hall was \u201cnot in the brief, there was no requirement to have it, but it was given by the building. It created a wholly new way of showing art.\u201d A series of large-scale installations, such as <a href=\"http://www.olafureliasson.net/\">Olafur Eliasson</a>\u2019s artificial sun and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/carsten-holler\">Carsten H\u00f6ller</a>\u2019s helter-skelters, made the hall into a new gathering place for London, Britain and indeed the world.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to sound arrogant,\u201d says Herzog, who is not usually much troubled about giving such an impression, \u201cbut that was a stroke of genius.\u201d In the new, updated Tate Modern, the main move is what De Meuron calls \u201cthe vertical boulevard\u201d, a deliberately oversized staircase that winds its way up the inside of the brick tower. It connects to new art galleries carved out of the parts of the old power station that were still functioning electrical facilities in 2000, and to new spaces for education and other forms of public engagement, a restaurant and a viewing gallery at the top.</p> <p>A high-level bridge connects back, across the Turbine Hall, to the galleries of the first phase, in order to create new ways of moving round the museum. This is a response to prodigious popularity \u2013 currently 5.7 million a year compared with the 2.5 million hoped for before it opened in 2000 \u2013 and it changes the balance of the whole complex. It will now be approachable from several directions, each offering a different experience. In its scale and multiplicity it will begin to resemble a city more than a building, although its monumental shape will still be well defined.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1f533558f485587ab6c46b39a28b130621d8450c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f533558f485587ab6c46b39a28b130621d8450c/0_150_2000_2498/801.jpg\" alt=\"Doris Selcedo\u2019s Shibboleth\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Doris Selcedo\u2019s Shibboleth installation \u2018cracked\u2019 the floor of the Turbine Hall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cHigh attendance is fantastic for a museum but not always for you as a visitor,\u201d says De Meuron. \u201cSometimes you need to be more quiet and peaceful. You need different experiences and different speeds, a variety of activity.\u201d He therefore promises \u201cdifferent spatial constellations. The stairs are wider than we need them; we want to invite people to have a different kind of experience than to rush from one gallery to another. I am curious to see how people walk about it.\u201d Whereas the older galleries are arranged in classical enfilades, one room leading to another, the new ones will include dead ends and spaces standing alone, which are likely to encourage more random patterns of exploration, and unpredictable combinations of eddies and stillness.</p> <p>All of which will be represented on the outside by the aforementioned brick tower, unquestionably fortress-like, which is Tate and its architects\u2019 response to the property free-for-all which, riding on the success of Tate Modern, has caused an anarchy of apartment and office buildings to rise on its doorstep. The brick pyramid is the museum\u2019s bid to assert its presence \u2013 we had \u201cliterally to fight to get some space for the needs of Tate\u201d \u2013 and its material is intended both to cohere with the old power station and assert its difference.</p> <p>As Herzog explains, piling some refined Swiss biscuits on the table in front of him to illustrate his point, an earlier design envisaged stacked-up glass cubes, but the material was too similar to the developers\u2019 stuff. \u201cWe realised that in order to survive we have to strengthen it,\u201d he says. A paradoxical effect is that the private apartments of <a href=\"http://www.neobankside.com/gallery\">Neo Bankside</a>, the development by <a href=\"http://www.rsh-p.com/\">Rogers Stirk Harbour</a> just across the street, are perfectly visible through their glass walls, whereas the public world of the vertical boulevard is only hinted at behind its brick veil.</p> <p>Yet the precedent of the original Tate Modern \u2013 also severe on the outside, lively inside \u2013 shows that a building doesn\u2019t have to gurn and wheedle to be popular. In this and other works, Herzog and De Meuron like to present a protestant moment of denial before pleasure, to forbid before welcoming, to be severe before generous. It is part of their worldview, different from most architects\u2019, in which delight and beauty co-exist with more troubling or mysterious aspects of existence.</p> <p>In this, Herzog believes, architecture can \u201cplay a very good role\u201d in challenging another threat to culture, which he calls \u201cthe negative side of the digital world\u201d. Building is \u201cvery archaic still, and we\u2019ve gone back to more archaic stuff \u2013 gravity, smell, finding roots, not giving pictures, fake images or illusions that you can get on the internet\u201d. It is all part, in their view, of defending and nourishing what is good about civilisation.</p> <p><em>The new Tate Modern opens 17 June</em></p>",

Yet the king\u2019s own future is looking shaky: France\u2019s ills are widely laid at the doors of the Louvre, the nation\u2019s decline blamed on debauchery and Henri\u2019s decadence, and with the Duke of Guise, leader of the fanatical Catholic League, fanning the flames, civil war seems imminent.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/feb/14/crime-fiction-merritt-sj-parris\">Forget 'serious' novels, I've turned to a life of crime</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The life of the real Giordano Bruno \u2013 born in Naples in 1548; burned at the stake by the Inquisition in 1600; Dominican friar, mathematician, philosopher and astrologer \u2013 has already inspired four mysteries penned pseudonymously by <em>Observer</em> journalist Stephanie Merritt. This latest addition to the series will no doubt repeat its predecessors\u2019 success. That we know the king will, despite his precarious position, survive has no impact at all on <em>Conspiracy</em>\u2019s entertainment value, testament to the authentically febrile air of suspense that Parris generates, as well as a shoal of red herrings and some impish, what-if plotting.

You can never be quite sure when it\u2019ll strike. There are some things you\u2019d predict would be embarrassing: farting audibly, discovering your flies have been undone all day, being woken by an usher because you were snoring during a play. But then there are other, less obvious moments: feeling strangely observed while helping yourself at a buffet, running hard to catch a train and missing it, being suddenly noticed by the person you\u2019ve been strangely observing help themselves at a buffet.</p> <p>Being observed is crucial \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to feel embarrassed in utter solitude \u2013 but there\u2019s more to it than that. Otherwise this newspaper\u2019s title would be a mission statement to embarrass the whole world; not so much speaking truth to power as waiting until power\u2019s trousers fall down and then laughing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If someone says to you 'That\u2019s a bit embarrassing', it immediately is, even if it wasn\u2019t. The chain reaction has begun</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The timing of the sensation of being observed is the vital factor. If you\u2019re in control of the timing, everything is much less embarrassing. Hence the difference between striding naked into a crowded room, and a curtain unexpectedly falling away to reveal you naked to a crowded room. I\u2019m pretty sure the latter experience is more embarrassing than the former, though I\u2019ve no intention of conducting an experiment to prove it.</p> <p>Embarrassment can spread, like fire. It\u2019s a chain reaction. People have two main responses to someone else\u2019s embarrassment: to find it funny or to be embarrassed for them. Either outcome increases the embarrassment of the first person: it\u2019s embarrassing to be laughed at, and it\u2019s extremely embarrassing to feel that other people are embarrassed that you\u2019re embarrassed.</p> <p>In the usher-and-snorer-in-the-theatre scenario, the usher will, unless he\u2019s a sociopath, probably be as embarrassed as the snorer \u2013 and a third-party observer might be embarrassed for them both. This spreading stain of mortification is odd as, in this situation, it\u2019s only the snorer who\u2019s done anything at all wrong (unless we count the director and playwright).</p> <p>One of the most intensely embarrassing moments of my life came a few months ago when I accidentally sent an email to my long-time comedy partner, Robert Webb, which was blank apart from the subject line, which read: \u201cRING ROB RE LIFT AND SAY HAPPY BIRTHDAY!\u201d I meant to send it to myself because I use my inbox as a sort of \u201cThings to do\u201d list. (I could probably use \u201cNotes\u201d or \u201cCalendar alerts\u201d or \u201cReminders\u201d, and I swear I\u2019ll get to grips with all that just as soon as I receive confirmation that I\u2019m immortal.)</p> <p>In this case, the things I wanted to make myself do were to ask Rob for a lift to a mutual friend\u2019s stag do the following weekend, and to wish him happy birthday for the week before. But I wouldn\u2019t have chosen to do it that way round. I\u2019d intended to telephone, full of apologies for forgetting his birthday, and then slip in the all-important lift request like an afterthought.</p> <p>It was exactly as my phone made its swish of email-sending irrevocability that I realised some bloody temp of a synapse in my brain\u2019s admin cortex had caused me to send the message <em>to</em> Rob for the totally inadequate reason that it was <em>about</em> him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af99da0b7734e5c4e6518fa1aa996698cd6b950e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af99da0b7734e5c4e6518fa1aa996698cd6b950e/0_0_2086_2877/725.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by David Foldvari.\" width=\"725\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by David Foldvari.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I don\u2019t know why it was such a cringe-inducing moment. I wasn\u2019t particularly ashamed of it: not of sending myself email reminders, nor forgetting Rob\u2019s birthday (I often have before, as he has mine), nor wanting to ask for a lift. I am happy to admit to being a birthday-forgetting lift-scrounger who can\u2019t set up calendar alerts. I suppose the catalyst for my embarrassment was the amusement I knew Rob would feel at the embarrassment he\u2019d know I would.</p> <p>The unintended observers\u2019 expectation of discomfiture is also crucial in the cases of the Queen and the prime minister \u2013 because neither of them has said anything remotely weird, wrong or, in terms of its actual meaning, controversial.</p> <p>The countries that David Cameron called corrupt, Nigeria and Afghanistan, absolutely are corrupt. When <a href=\"http://www.transparency.org.uk/\">Transparency International </a>recently listed the world\u2019s countries in order of governmental probity they featured at 136 and 166 respectively. So the prime minister said something accurate. Why\u2019s that embarrassing?</p> <p>Because those countries\u2019 leaders got to hear it? Well, they\u2019re already coming to an anti-corruption conference, so I imagine the subject was inevitably going to be raised and their attendance implies they might even be amenable to addressing it.</p> <p>Because Cameron\u2019s government indiscriminately sloshes aid those countries\u2019 way and doesn\u2019t lift a finger to make the City of London a less effective haven for the world\u2019s ill-gotten gold? Well, if it\u2019s that, it\u2019s not his one factually correct remark we should focus on, but his whole lamentable regime.</p> <p>And, as for the Queen\u2019s comment, what on earth is she expected to say? President Xi\u2019s delegation was clearly a nightmare. Would it have been better if she\u2019d called them polite? \u201cWhen will we British learn to treat foreign potentates with respect? All they want is to carry guns and have a bunch of protesters thrown in jail \u2013 what\u2019s the problem?\u201d She merely expressed the view that any decent person would hold.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2016/may/11/very-rude-queen-unguarded-comments-chinese-officials-uk-visit-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4j3q6\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2502636\"            data-video-name=\"'Very rude': Queen's unguarded comments on Chinese officials during UK visit \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5732ab33e4b01a6abab1c03e\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/11/160511QueenUPDATED_KP-27926898_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/11/160511QueenUPDATED_KP-27926898.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/11/160511QueenUPDATED_KP-27926898_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/11/160511QueenUPDATED_KP-27926898_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/11/160511QueenUPDATED_KP-27926898_small.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2016/may/11/very-rude-queen-unguarded-comments-chinese-officials-uk-visit-video\">\u2018Very rude\u2019: Queen\u2019s unguarded comments on Chinese officials during UK visit</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>It\u2019s only embarrassing because the media say it is. And if someone says to you \u201cThat\u2019s a bit embarrassing\u201d, it immediately is, even if it previously wasn\u2019t. The chain reaction has begun. A <em>faux pas</em> has occurred. The fact that it consisted solely of the expression of self-evident truths doesn\u2019t matter.</p> <p>This is a consequence of our culture\u2019s increasing comfort with placing limits on freedom of speech, and with the notion that some things simply must not be said \u2013 opinions or, in this case, facts. It\u2019s as if we\u2019re reinventing the proprieties of the Victorian age, when no one would refer to sex or the lavatory, when outward bland placidity concealed a ferment of hypocrisy.</p> <p>We could easily suffer such repression again if we come to accept a climate in which both our head of state and leader of government are made to feel embarrassed when footage emerges of them disdaining to lie.</p>",

But once it was a city with perhaps 16,000 inhabitants, full of temples to gods such as Hera, Aphrodite and the Dioskouroi (Castor and Pollux), and dominated by a vast sanctuary dedicated to the Egyptian deity Amun-Ra, from which a sphinx-lined avenue led to the Canopic branch of the Nile, which long ago flowed here. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y7jiCNNchGU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/y7jiCNNchGU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The Hong Kong of the ancient world \u2026 a 3D animation of Naukratis.

The Greek temples started off as simple affairs, sacred enclosures with outdoor altars, but pedimented structures were built once the Greeks had learned the knack of building colonnaded temples from the Egyptians. Surrounding the sanctuaries were mud-brick houses several storeys high, some with dovecotes on their roofs. The same kind of conical pigeon houses can be seen in the villages today.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"d90e95a52734d2fb2ebf46c71f0bc990fb36e556\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d90e95a52734d2fb2ebf46c71f0bc990fb36e556/0_0_8621_4101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Colossal ... this pharaoh was found in five separate pieces before it was reassembled underwater.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"476\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colossal \u2026 a five-metre pharaoh found at Naukratis\u2019s sister port, Thonis-Heracleion.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christoph Gerigk/Franck Goddio/Hilti Foundation</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All Mediterranean traders who had dealings with Egypt \u2013 not just Greeks, but also Phoenicians, Cypriots, Levantines \u2013 were obliged to come to Naukratis to trade their oil and wine and pay their tax, sailing more than 40 miles inland down the Nile via <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/aug/02/ancient-egyptian-artefacts-thonis-heracleion-canopus-paris\">Thonis-Heracleion</a>, a sister port at the mouth of the river on the Mediterranean.

No monuments remain, nor yet a whiff of the gorgeous Rhodopis, and yet the past is palpable. He points out a jalabiya-clad man sitting outside his house on a classical column base; and the recently ploughed fields are full of ancient potsherds.

Naukratis has been partially excavated before, first by the great <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/biography/Flinders-Petrie\">Flinders Petrie</a> in the 1880s. (He realised he\u2019d stumbled across the city when he read a Greek inscription saying so \u2013 it was built into the house he was staying in. \u201cI almost jumped as I read,\u201d he wrote in his journal. \u201cSo this is Naukratis!\u201d). The course of the river, however, was established only by Thomas\u2019s team, and he is excited at the prospect of discovering the quayside and, perhaps, well-preserved boat remains. It is highly possible, for the site is waterlogged, providing the anaerobic conditions that slow the decay of wood.<br /></p> <p>Today, though, the haul is potsherds from the sixth century BC. Most of them \u2013 bright reddish, sandy to the touch \u2013 are locally made Egyptian wares. There are also Greek mortaria \u2013 bowls for pounding ingredients into sauces \u2013 and all manner of wine amphorae from the east Greek world, the Hellenic cities on what is now the west coast of Turkey. Thomas and his colleague from the British Museum, <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/about_us/departments/staff/greece_and_rome/alexandra_villing.aspx\">Alexandra Villing</a>, sort through them. Petrie and his Victorian successors tended to ignore the Egyptian pottery finds, leading to a skewed vision of what kind of cultural texture this city might have had. Ross and Villing suspect the interaction and cultural exchange between people here was richer and more complex than had been believed. \u201cIt\u2019s not a Greek colony,\u201d says Thomas. \u201cIt\u2019s a mixed community.\u201d (The other matter over which Flinders Petrie discreetly drew a veil was the vast number of little terracotta figures of Harpocrates, the child of Isis and Osiris, that he found around the city. The figurines had comically vast and engorged phalluses, associated with the god\u2019s role in ensuring the land\u2019s fertility.)<br /></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyH70bZrGL0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kyH70bZrGL0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Hidden depths \u2026 IEASM underwater excavations at Abu-Qir Bay, Egypt.

We are looking for a statue. Pass it by and you\u2019d probably take it for another pharaoh: the four-metre-tall figure has an Egyptian ruler\u2019s kilt, rigid arms and left foot striding forward. He\u2019s not one, though: he was erected in the temple of Amun-Ra in Naukratis in around 300BC (a generation after Alexander\u2019s conquest), and his name, according to the hieroglyphs on his back, is Horemheb. So far, so Egyptian, but the inscription goes on to tell us in no uncertain terms that \u201cI am a Greek\u201d \u2013 and that his father was Krates, a very Hellenic name, and his mother was the Egyptian-sounding Shesemtet. </p> <p>There is a lot of this intriguing cultural mingling in Egypt, and it runs right through to the Romans. In the catacombs of Kom el-Shoqafa in Alexandria, a Roman family is buried in an elaborate tomb arranged like a pedimented temple with niches for the sarcophagi, which are decorated with flower garlands and tragic masks \u2013 altogether very classical. But the pediment is carved with Egyptian falcons, the Roman couple are depicted as Egyptian from the neck down (another kilt and striding left leg) and the relief carvings above their tombs are of Egyptian scenes, including Anubis presiding over a mummification. Nearby, in the sanctuary below the temple of Serapis \u2013 a Greek-friendly version of Osiris \u2013 the Roman emperor Hadrian dedicated an extraordinary, lifesize bronze bull representing the Egyptian god Apis. A replica is in situ, but the original can be seen in the British Museum exhibition.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"5fdbecb0e2d6ac0f20359dd1bf1a0f85da9a93dc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fdbecb0e2d6ac0f20359dd1bf1a0f85da9a93dc/0_147_5906_3544/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fish food ... a pharaoh head from the 3rd century BC.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fish food \u2026 a third century pharaoh head on the ocean floor at Thonis-Heracleion.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christoph Gerigk/Franck Goddio/Hilti Foundation</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sometimes it\u2019s bewildering even to attempt to follow these cultural and religious currents as they eddy and flow around the Mediterranean. A pottery object excavated by Petrie in Naukratis, which is about to tour to museums around the UK, also tells a complex tale. \u201cHe\u2019s a mid-sixth-century figure of a man carrying bow and arrows, with two hares and two boar piglets on his shoulders,\u201d explains Thomas. \u201cHe\u2019s wearing a Cypriot cap, an Egyptian kilt and a shirt. The inscription says, \u2018Kallias dedicated me to Aphrodite\u2019. We think the dedicator was probably an east Greek.\u201d In other words, it was made in Cyprus in an Egyptian style, where it was bought and inscribed probably by a Greek trader from Ionia (now Turkey), and then dedicated in a Greek temple in Egypt. There\u2019s a story that comes from the second- and third-century AD author Athenaeus, born in Naukratis, which chimes uncannily accurately with the journey of that votive figure. He tells of a Greek trader from Naukratis who, on his way back to Egypt, bought a figurine of Aphrodite from Paphos on Cyprus. On the way home, he was caught up in a storm and prayed to the goddess. She answered him: the storm calmed and a myrtle bush miraculously sprouted on board. When he arrived in Naukratis, he dedicated his figurine at the temple of Aphrodite and hosted a feast, the guests crowned with myrtle wreaths.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"acc2dbb30c5f2de27a331d5209aa44ecd3dd698a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/acc2dbb30c5f2de27a331d5209aa44ecd3dd698a/0_0_7087_4724/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A 2m statue of the Apis Bull from the reign of Hadrian.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On show \u2026 the two-metre statue of the Apis Bull.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christoph Gerigk/Franck Goddio/Hilti Foundation</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the Naukratis of 2016, there\u2019s a breath of excitement: Ashley Pooley\u2019s team, working at the ancient riverbank, has found some wood, preserved here in the mud since the sixth century BC. It\u2019s not a stern or a prow, but it\u2019s something; perhaps, they think, part of a quayside boardwalk. Not bad for day two in the field \u2013 and a hopeful sign that the fertile black soil of Egypt has more and more knowledge to impart.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.britishmuseum.org/whats_on/exhibitions/sunken_cities.aspx\">Sunken Cities: Egypt\u2019s Lost Worlds</a> is at the British Museum, London, 19 May-27 November.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Born in Chicago in 1986, the musician and songwriter <a href=\"http://ezrafurman.com/\" title=\"\">Ezra Furman</a> played in the four-piece indie band <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0HvpwTS1xc\" title=\"\">Ezra Furman and the Harpoons</a> between 2006 and 2011, before releasing his solo debut in 2012 with money raised on <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ezrafurman/be-a-part-of-the-new-ezra-furman-record-it-will-be\" title=\"\">Kickstarter</a>.

Furman\u2019s effervescent, melodic power-pop frequently addresses his depression, Jewishness and gender-fluid identity. He will release a new EP in the summer, will be performing at Glastonbury, and will tour the UK\u00a0in October.</p> <h2>1 | Book<br /></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/27/the-agronauts-maggie-nelson-observer-review\" title=\"\"><strong>The Argonauts by Maggie Nelson</strong><br /></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f34750c865a7037c087683e6fa9501d13761f940\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f34750c865a7037c087683e6fa9501d13761f940/0_82_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Writer Maggie Nelson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It doesn\u2019t have to be a political betrayal to be domestic\u2019: on Maggie Nelson\u2019s Argonauts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Deirdre O'Callaghan for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is a memoir but also academic queer\u00a0theory: it\u2019s about a woman dating a trans man, and they\u2019re trying to figure out if it\u2019s OK that they want to settle down and have a child \u2013 are they joining \u201cthe other side\u201d? It\u2019s really emotional and personal. I think there\u2019s a large worry\u00a0in\u00a0queer communities about imitating straight people, when queerness has its own identity and maybe can be a radical force that should be dismantling stuff that locks people into structures. But at the same time, everyone wants to be able to live their life, and it doesn\u2019t have to be a political betrayal just to be domestic. And\u00a0there\u2019s something kind of misogynist about the way some of Maggie\u2019s friends disdain motherhood. I may be somehow reacting to this, being off tour for a couple of months, at home with my significant other, tidying up, cooking \u2013 it\u2019s like, \u201cAm I\u00a0still cool right now?\u201d</p> <h2>2 | Band<br /></h2> <p><a href=\"https://slangatlanta.bandcamp.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Slang</strong></a><br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d987974e054dd109f67700b565f5dffa0245dc79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d987974e054dd109f67700b565f5dffa0245dc79/17_49_1235_741/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Slang.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Terrifying and insane\u2019: Atlanta\u2019s Slang.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Slang are from Atlanta, Georgia and they opened for us when we played there. They\u2019re a four-piece rock\u2019n\u2019roll outfit, but the singer plays the character of a southern Baptist preacher, and it\u2019s terrifying and insane and he writes amazing songs. When they were playing, Sam, my drummer, leaned over to me and said, \u201cThis might be the best band I have ever seen,\u201d and I was like, \u201cI know.\u201d They have a self-titled album and every song is stunning. Nobody knows about this band and they\u2019re incredible.</p> <h2>3 | Documentary<br /></h2> <p><a href=\"https://vimeo.com/ondemand/thedogmovie\" title=\"\"><strong>The Dog</strong></a><strong>, directed by Allison Berg and\u00a0Frank Keraudren</strong><br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e9de6aebc004a5136f184164a49407aa6bb305b2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e9de6aebc004a5136f184164a49407aa6bb305b2/20_129_1361_1008/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Still from The Dog of John Wojtowicz\" width=\"1000\" height=\"741\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018He\u2019s really into his own legend of being a gay outlaw\u2019: The Dog by Allison Berg and Frank Keraudren.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Drafthouse Films</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is the real-life story of the guy [<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wojtowicz\" title=\"\">John Wojtowicz</a>] from the movie <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne6KMHLTvik\" title=\"\"><em>Dog Day Afternoon</em></a>, where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/gallery/2015/nov/05/al-pacino-the-godfather-of-broadway-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Al Pacino</a> robs a bank to pay for his lover\u2019s sex-change operation. The story and the real person are way more over the top than in the movie. It was one of the best documentaries I\u2019ve seen. He\u2019s a really compelling person: he\u2019s out of touch with\u00a0reality and is really into his own legend of robbing a bank and being a gay outlaw. When he got out of prison, his plan was to go to work at the bank he had robbed, as a security guard. He would show up there with a shirt that said, \u201cI robbed this bank\u201d, and sign autographs, and he was like, \u201cI\u2019m the guy! From the movie!\u201d He did not get that job, unsurprisingly.</p> <h2>4 | Podcast<br /></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.soundopinions.org/\" title=\"\"><strong>Sound Opinions</strong></a><br /></p> <p>I listen to this a lot. It\u2019s these two celebrated Chicago music critics and writers, Greg Kot and Jim DeRogatis. Part of it is just taking comfort in their Chicago accents. You\u2019d think these two middle-aged nerdy white guys would not be into experimental music and a bunch of hip-hop and soul, but they\u2019re totally adventurous in their listening. Like when Prince died: they don\u2019t just give you the hits, they look at the stuff that people don\u2019t usually talk about. When my debut record came out in 2007, we got our first bad review from one of those guys \u2013 and I like getting a bad review, that\u2019s helpful to me. They kind of make me mad, but I\u2019m still like, yeah, you know what, that could have been better.</p> <h2>5 | Web series<br /></h2> <p><a href=\"https://louisck.net/show/horace-and-pete\" title=\"\"><strong>Horace and Pete</strong></a><br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4cb91bcca1c7335c4c4fbded29d0be4164ca9216\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cb91bcca1c7335c4c4fbded29d0be4164ca9216/66_0_1603_962/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steve Buscemi, Louis CK and Edie Falco in Horace and Pete.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Incredible acting and writing\u2019: Steve Buscemi, Louis CK and Edie Falco in Horace and Pete.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019m a big fan of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/louis-ck\" title=\"\">Louis CK</a> \u2013 I think he\u2019s a master of standup. He told the network, FX, doing his show <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dd5-j_BbH4I\" title=\"\"><em>Louie</em></a> that he was going to go do something else. So, totally self-financed and without any approval from anyone, he made this 10-episode show, <em>Horace and Pete</em>, and released it on his website. It\u2019s dramatic and there\u2019s honestly not much comedy in it. I\u2019ve seen six or seven episodes and it seems like a tragedy \u2013 horrible things happen. It\u2019s exciting to see someone who\u2019s popular and doing well take a left turn and do something that\u2019s totally not what people\u00a0like them for. It\u2019s like theatre \u2013 there\u2019s some incredible acting and writing. One of the episodes is a 45-minute conversation sitting at a table, and nothing else. It\u2019s compelling\u00a0storytelling.</p> <h2>6 | Blog<br /></h2> <p><a href=\"https://loveletterstorocknroll.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>loveletterstorocknroll.com</strong></a><br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"cab683d924221aa3fa5c5fd254fe5c38879b5771\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cab683d924221aa3fa5c5fd254fe5c38879b5771/0_0_479_350/479.jpg\" alt=\"love-letters-logo\" width=\"479\" height=\"350\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>This is a pretty new blog. The idea is that it\u2019s all positive reviews \u2013 anyone can write about anything related to rock\u2019n\u2019roll or pop music. I wrote a couple things for it. I really enjoy its approach as an outlet for gushing about music. I love it when people write rapturously about music they love. I like that it\u2019s pure love letters \u2013 most of them are in the form of letters to the actual people who made the music, or to a record store, or to a piece of music equipment. I love obsessive fandom because I\u2019m an obsessive fan who flips out over music.</p>",

Is this your first singing role?</strong><br />I sang a bit in a play called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2009/mar/04/burnt-by-sun-national\" title=\"\"><em>Burnt By the Sun</em></a>, which we did at the National seven years ago \u2013 I was playing a Puccini-loving member of the Russian white guard. And I used to love singing as a teenager. There was a point in university where I was thinking about leading a choral life, but I thought I wouldn\u2019t be able to do as much acting, so I didn\u2019t pursue it. It has lain dormant for about 20 years.</p> <p><strong>But the foundations are there.</strong><br />Yeah, although I started practising again at the end of last year and it\u2019s amazing how flabby those muscles get. It\u2019s a skill of the mind, singing, as much as the body. The singing lessons are much more of a mental challenge than a physical one, just keeping track of how you are producing your voice. Then once you get into the production, you have to forget about all that and make sure you\u2019re playing the character. I\u2019ve found the whole process really enjoyable.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It chimes with our sense of a growing divide in society, an awareness that the majority are ruled by an elite minority</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Before this, were you constrained to singing in the shower?</strong><br />Yeah, and singing Happy Birthday. I enjoy playing the piano and singing at home, but I can\u2019t say the rest of the family do, so I\u2019ve been banished.</p> <p><strong>Why is <em>The Threepenny Opera</em> relevant today?</strong><br />I don\u2019t think there has ever been a time between 1928 and now when the issues it raises haven\u2019t been relevant. It chimes with our sense of a growing divide in society and an awareness that the majority are ruled by an elite minority. It rings as strongly for an audience today as it did in 1920s Berlin.</p> <p><strong>Your first play, </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/sep/19/the-herd-review\" title=\"\"><strong><em>The Herd</em></strong></a><strong>, was produced at the Bush theatre in 2013 and later staged by Steppenwolf in Chicago. Would you like to write more plays?</strong><br />It was probably the most rewarding experience I\u2019ve had. It was extraordinary to sit in a rehearsal room, knowing that the director, actors and a designer were all there because of something I\u2019d written. But I am very much an actor who wrote a play \u2013 the collected play of Rory Kinnear \u2013 and while I am trying to write another, Simon Stephens [who adapted <em>The Threepenny Opera</em>] writes more plays during my lunch break than I ever will in my entire life. I am still bewildered at the commitment it takes to be a full-time writer.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jun/19/rory-kinnear-my-life-in-five-shows\">Rory Kinnear: my life in five shows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I wrote <em>The Herd</em> because I felt I had something to say about that subject matter. It\u2019s about a family living with a severely disabled young son. In the play, the strain of looking after the son had broken up the marriage, but for my parents [their elder daughter, Karina, was born with cerebral palsy] it brought them much closer together. I don\u2019t want to write something else just for the sake of it, I want to feel I\u2019ve got something to say.</p> <p><strong>You played </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16vp4IBv5WQ\" title=\"\"><strong>Hamlet</strong></a><strong> at the National in 2010, to great acclaim. So much importance is ascribed to that role. Did you experience a sense of deflation afterwards?</strong><br />No, though I did miss the play. We did it for about eight or nine months, during which time my first child was born. So for five months I performed it in a fog and morass of tiredness. But in those first few months of new parenthood, having something to do in the evening gave me a much-needed bolt of energy. People would say, aren\u2019t you knackered? But I think without it, I would have been so much more tired. It probably affected my performance but not necessarily in a bad way.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c0cb587751eaf47a4fbecea002ea86a0c8132b66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0cb587751eaf47a4fbecea002ea86a0c8132b66/0_92_2800_1680/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rory Kinnear as Hamlet at the National Theatre in 2010.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rory Kinnear as Hamlet at the National Theatre in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>In a weirdly prescient 2011 episode of the TV series </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JuJF_dPqED0\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Black Mirror</em></strong></a><strong>, you played a British prime minister coerced into having sex with a pig.

He likes to know what parts I\u2019m playing and what happens to the characters. But neither of them have seen much \u2013 I\u2019m trying to keep them sheltered from that particular disappointment in life. The only time Riley\u2019s seen me on screen was when someone sent over a preview copy of a TV drama I did about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/dec/12/lucan-tv-review\" title=\"\">Lord Lucan</a>. He came in just as I was about to bludgeon the poor nanny to death.

I\u2019m glad I followed this path. I love my job and the life it creates for me. I wouldn\u2019t tell them no, whatever they wanted to do. They wouldn\u2019t listen to me anyway, by the looks of things.</p> <p><strong>Your parents [Roy Kinnear and Carmel Cryan] were both actors. What are the advantages and disadvantages of coming from an acting background?</strong><br />I can\u2019t necessarily think of any disadvantages. In terms of advantages, you recognise acting as a feasible career, as a job that can support life. I was in drama school with people who were the only members of their family to pursue acting and they probably felt a greater pressure to succeed or prove their families wrong than I ever did.</p> <p><strong>Did you ever consider a different career?</strong><br />There was butcher, goalkeeper, maybe lawyer, when I was thinking should I do something sensible as I ended my degree. At first I probably enjoyed acting because it got me attention. I didn\u2019t really have much else in my armoury to get attention apart from acting.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"254f37ef19b600dc3fc2783efe6ac95d80bf57a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/254f37ef19b600dc3fc2783efe6ac95d80bf57a6/0_16_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rory Kinnear\u2019s father, Roy Kinnear, centre, with the cast of That Was the Week That Was.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rory Kinnear\u2019s father, Roy Kinnear, centre, with the cast of That Was the Week That Was.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Of those three forfeited careers, which would have made you happiest?</strong><br />I still nostalgically think of butchery. I liked the smell. When I was growing up, I would go down to East Sheen high street with my dad. I loathed the smell of the fishmongers but loved the butchers. Blood and sawdust smells: there\u2019s still something about them that chimes with a childhood sense of ambition.</p> <p><strong>How do you relax?</strong><br />Reading is the thing I enjoy more than anything \u2013 and listening to music. I\u2019m trying to read one whopper per year and I\u2019ve just finished <a href=\"http://www.lrb.co.uk/v07/n14/nobuko-albery/nobuko-albery-salutes-the-ghost-of-mishima-novelist-and-suicide\" title=\"\"><em>The Sea of Fertility</em></a> by Yukio Mishima.

You read <em>The Sea of Fertility</em> knowing that weeks after Mishima finished writing it, he committed hara-kiri, which does loom over the experience.</p> <p><strong>Do you tend to read dark books?</strong><br />I tend to read older books. I don\u2019t read much contemporary fiction or listen to much contemporary music \u2013 although my son sometimes comes home from school singing whatever\u2019s in the charts. The latest was <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjW8wmF5VWc\" title=\"\">Silent\u00f3</a> \u2013 \u201cWatch me whip, Watch me nae nae\u201d \u2013 so I feel I\u2019m up to date with the best stuff.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s next?</strong><br />The third season of <em>Penny Dreadful</em> starts next week, in which I play Frankenstein\u2019s creature \u2013 with makeup, I should hastily add. Then I\u2019m doing a comedy series about 19th-century doctors called <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/quacks\" title=\"\"><em>Quacks</em></a>.

Fans react to their relegation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was a standard season for Mike Ashley\u2019s Newcastle: listless performances, inept management from top to bottom, a team battling the drop, a no show in the cups \u2026 but, even by our pitiful standards, this will take some beating. McClaren wasn\u2019t the right man for the job, Ben\u00edtez is, yet he was given too little time to save us. And while Rafa reorganised the defence and inspired a minor fightback, he couldn\u2019t be expected to conjure up a Vardy or Kane out of thin air.</p> <p><strong>The stars </strong>Rob Elliot and Karl Darlow kept us in more games than we\u2019d care to remember, and Jamaal Lascelles stepped up. Andros Townsend was the pick of the January bunch - he ran his socks off.</p> <p><strong>The flops </strong>Where do you start? Mysterious January signings Seydou Doumbia and Henri Saviet barely kicked a ball, Florian Thauvin was shipped off after half a season and Steven Taylor and Fabricio Coloccini were past their sell-by dates before it even started. Also, much ire has been directed at Moussa Sissoko, who has been ineffective far too often.</p> <p><strong>Summer targets </strong>Players with experience and guts. And we should do whatever it takes to keep Ben\u00edtez.</p> <p><strong>Best and worst away fans</strong> Bournemouth were best, Man United worst. They only sing when they\u2019re winning \u2026 and they didn\u2019t win.</p> <p><strong>2016-17 title winners </strong>Tottenham.</p> <p><strong>Highlights montage music </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=308KpFZ4cT8\">Long Road to Ruin</a><em> </em>- The Foo Fighters.</p> <p><strong>Richard &amp; David Holmes</strong>, Observer readers</p> <h2>Norwich: 3/10</h2> <p>Not sure if \u201cdisappointing\u201d quite does it justice. Calamitous is probably better. Our hope was for a season free of that sinking feeling, although we knew anything from 17th upward would be a result. But, despite a pre-Christmas flurry, it\u2019s been an all too predictable slow, drawn-out march to relegation, punctuated only by the odd decent result. In three words: not good enough \u2013 and that includes, by his own admission, some of the manager\u2019s decision making.</p> <p><strong>The stars </strong>Just three names: Timm Klose (in his few games), Robbie Brady and Jonny Howson. If Klose, or a centre-back of similar quality, had been signed last summer instead of January then maybe, just maybe, things could have turned out differently. But we\u2019ve been profligate in front of goal, error-prone at the back and lacking in dynamism. Do the maths.</p> <p><strong>The flops </strong>Youssouf Mulumbu has barely featured, Steven Naismith \u2013 our marquee signing in January \u2013 has, a couple of games aside, failed to deliver, and Seb Bassong has been, well \u2026 Seb Bassong.</p> <p><strong>Summer targets </strong>Major surgery is needed at both ends of the pitch. A shiny new pair of centre-backs (a Championship version of Huth and Morgan), and some competition for Cameron Jerome.</p> <p><strong>Best and worst away fans </strong>Palace\u2019s fans on the opening day were a lively and noisy bunch. Man Utd were awful: arrogant, condescending and muted.</p> <p><strong>2016-17 title winners </strong>Man City, via a vast transfer kitty.</p> <p><strong>Highlights montage music </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vt2Y78VgfNQ\">Bringin\u2019 On The Heartbreak</a> \u2013 Def Leppard.</p> <p><strong>Gary Gowers </strong><a href=\"http://norwichcity.myfootballwriter.com\">NorwichCity.MyFootballWriter.com</a></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/13/ronald-koeman-southampton-contract-talks\">Ronald Koeman urges Southampton to show ambition as contract talks loom</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Southampton 8/10</h2> <p>It\u2019s been excellent in many respects, though we never quite got going in the same way as last season. Equalling our record points tally with a game to spare, despite that horror run in the winter, is a definite plus, and could still be rewarded with a return to European football, having barely dipped a toe in the competition at the start of this campaign. Embarrassing cup exits aside, Ronald Koeman continues to get the best out of a much-changed squad. New contract, please!</p> <p><strong>The stars </strong>Virgil van Dijk cleaned up at the awards night, and rightly so. We genuinely haven\u2019t missed Toby Alderweireld. Special mentions to Shane Long and 2016\u2019s Dusan Tadic \u2013 back to the 2014 vintage.</p> <p><strong>The flops </strong>Things just haven\u2019t worked out for Juanmi. The winner of the flop category, though, has to be the train wreck that was Steven Caulker\u2019s loan spell.</p> <p><strong>Summer targets </strong>If Pell\u00e8, Man\u00e9 or Wanyama leave they\u2019ll need replacing. Other than that, some depth in wide areas. Andros Townsend would fit the bill.</p> <p><strong>Best and worst away fans </strong>Villa were full of gallows humour during their visit. Watford were worst, but then it was a horrible midweek January evening.</p> <p><strong>2016-17 title winners </strong>Not Leicester. If Liverpool lose to Sevilla and finish below us, Klopp will have them challenging, with no midweek commitments. Chelsea might recover under similar circumstances, but I reckon they need a pretty big overhaul. Arsenal will be Arsenal, Spurs will be Spurs.</p> <p><strong>Highlights montage music </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tw8mpgccugc\">I Don\u2019t Like it, I Love It</a> \u2013 Flo Rida featuring Robin Thicke and Verdine White.</p> <p>Steve Grant <a href=\"http://saintsweb.co.uk/content.php\">saintsweb.co.uk</a> / <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SteveGrant1983\">@SteveGrant1983</a></p> <h2>Stoke: 7/10</h2> <p>Up until the end of March it was another great season. Since then it\u2019s been one dramatic slump \u2013 seemingly due to a combination of injuries and several players having an eye on the beach or Euro 2016. On paper, expectations have been met: a top 10 finish looks likely and we had a league cup semi-final. But it\u2019ll always be the season of what ifs. Questions are starting to be asked of the manager for the first time: a strong start to next season is vital.</p> <p><strong>The stars </strong>The two stand-out players were Jack Butland and Marko Arnautovic. Results have suffered whenever they\u2019ve both been missing.</p> <p><strong>The flops </strong>Several players just haven\u2019t performed consistently, but for me the major flop has been our record \u00a318m signing, Giannelli Imbula. He obviously has the talent and he made a storming start, but he really fell below par in the past six weeks. Wearing gloves on one of the hottest days of the season at Crystal Palace recently didn\u2019t do much for his image.</p> <p><strong>Summer targets </strong>The team is crying out for a natural scorer: we need to be ready to break the transfer record again to find one. We also need a commanding centre half due to concerns over Ryan Shawcross\u2019s long-term fitness. But arguably our most important deal would be extending Arnautovic\u2019s contract.</p> <p><strong>Best and worst away fans </strong>Villa best, Arsenal worst.</p> <p><strong>2016-17 title winners </strong>Manchester City.</p> <p><strong>Highlights montage music </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXh3sueSxps\">Crossroads</a> \u2013 Blazin\u2019 Squad.

The real improvement came when Sam Allardyce had his chance to revamp the squad. Out went those who were nowhere near good enough, in came three players who changed the season. Allardyce has impressed on and off the pitch: he\u2019s a good fit for a gritty, working class club like ours.</p> <p><strong>The stars </strong>Kon\u00e9, Kirchhoff and Khazri changed the dynamic. Youn\u00e8s Kaboul was poor in autumn and exceptional in spring. Vito Mannone was a fine keeper and Jermain Defoe\u2019s goals and positivity kept us up.</p> <p><strong>The flops </strong>Jeremain Lens looked a good buy in summer but turned out to be a huge disappointment. I don\u2019t expect to be seeing him in August. Jack Rodwell epitomised the way that our game wastes talent.</p> <p><strong>Summer targets </strong>Another forward, because Defoe will not go on for ever. Maybe Ayew from Swansea? There\u2019s a need for a stronger squad and an end to signing players who are clearly unsuited to Premier League football. I\u2019ll leave the detail to the scouts who unearthed Kon\u00e9, Kirchhoff and Khazri.</p> <p><strong>Best and worst away fans </strong>Leicester\u2019s away crowd was noisy and clapperless. West Ham\u2019s was boisterous. Chelsea were charmless.</p> <p><strong>2016-17 title winners </strong>Why not us? We finished on a high and have a solid squad. Lightning can strike twice. Failing that, maybe Tottenham.</p> <p><strong>Highlights montage music </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVsiIxE_6OM\">The Long and Winding Road</a> \u2013 The Beatles.</p> <p><strong>Pete Sixsmith </strong><a href=\"http://salutsunderland.com\">SalutSunderland.com</a></p> <h2>Swansea: 6.5/10</h2> <p>A season featuring three different managers tells its own story really. We were aiming for something like last season\u2019s eighth-place finish \u2013 we never expected to be battling relegation. Alan Curtis and Francesco Guidolin have played a big part in directing us away from the bottom three, and in the end, it has turned out to be a decent finish. Wins against Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Arsenal have been enjoyable. I\u2019ll lift it to a 7/10 if we beat Manchester City and finish in the top 10.</p> <p><strong>The stars </strong>Gylfi Sigurdsson has been our best, with a crucial run of nine goals in 14 games. His improved form coincided with Shelvey\u2019s move to Newcastle.</p> <p><strong>The flops </strong>Bafetimbi Gomis has had an awful season. He scored four goals in his first four games, then just three goals in eight months. He\u2019s the champion of being offside, though. Eder and Tabanou, meanwhile, proved to be a waste of \u00a38m collectively \u2013 they too should be looking for other clubs.</p> <p><strong>Summer targets </strong>Guidolin has plenty to do. With Eder, Gomis and Tabanou most likely to leave, they will need replacing. We\u2019ll also need to boost the midfield.</p> <p><strong>Best and worst away fans </strong>The best were Crystal Palace and Leicester. Worst: Everton and Liverpool.</p> <p><strong>2016-17 title winners </strong>Anyone\u2019s guess. I doubt Leicester can retain it while also coping with European demands. Guardiola will lift Manchester City, and Spurs should give it another good go.</p> <p><strong>Highlights montage music </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GAM9diIDHqs\">Tubthumping</a> \u2013 Chumbawamba, to reflect the last few months.</p> <p><strong>Kevin Elphick</strong> <a href=\"http://www.swansea.vitalfootball.co.uk\">Swansea.VitalFootball.co.uk</a> / <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vitalswansea\">@VitalSwansea</a></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/13/mauricio-pochettino-alex-ferguson-tottenham-newcastle-arsenal\">Mauricio Pochettino drinks in wise words from his inspiration Alex Ferguson</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Tottenham: 8/10</h2> <p>Pochettino has done wonders. We now attack and defend as a team, we\u2019re hard to beat and the players have bought into his philosophy. The only concern now is depth. We have a very good first XI and cover for the back four \u2013 but as soon as one of the midfield or Kane is out, we struggle. For example, with Alli our win percentage is 56; without him it\u2019s 17.</p> <p><strong>The stars </strong>Alderweireld is a masterful reader of the game; Dier marshals the front of the defence; Alli makes so many dangerous runs; Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 has the strength and subtlety to shine in any team; and Kane just gets better. Added to that, Lamela is the most improved player: a fine blend of workrate and skill.</p> <p><strong>The flops </strong>Our midfield and forward replacements are lightweight: Mason, Carroll and Chadli are a notch or three down from the people they have to replace. Eriksen remains in the minor genius category. To borrow that old quote about Wagner, he has some great moments but some pretty awful quarter-hours. And whatever happened to Bentaleb?</p> <p><strong>Summer targets </strong>A proven deputy for Kane, two in midfield and a wide player who can go past defenders.</p> <p><strong>Best and worst away fans </strong>Nothing to distinguish any of them. They all caterwaul the same juvenile stuff about libraries.</p> <p><strong>2016-17 title winners </strong>Pochettino\u2019s English is improving \u2013 I can\u2019t wait to hear his articulate appraisal of our league win this time next year.</p> <p><strong>Highlights montage music </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mzDVaKRApcg\">(Your Love Keeps Lifting Me) Higher and Higher</a> \u2013 Jackie Wilson.</p> <p><strong>Dave Mason</strong>, Observer reader</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/14/quique-sanchez-flores-watford-departure-explained\">Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores was no longer the answer to Watford's question</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Watford: 8/10</h2> <p>A decent season. It\u2019s fair to say it met fans\u2019 expectations, though it probably exceeded those of folk on the outside who hadn\u2019t been paying a lot of attention. Mid-table and a cup run is absolutely not to be sniffed at, a big tick and \u201cjob done\u201d for Quique Flores. Insufficient to keep him in a job, though, at a club where such decisions are often made proactively.<br /></p> <p><strong>The stars </strong>Odion Ighalo\u2019s waning impact defined our season \u2013 a very solid side with a goal threat is a potent thing, a solid side without is not. Otherwise Gomes, Deeney and Watson have been consistent.</p> <p><strong>The flops </strong>A number of the summer imports \u2013 Ibarbo, Diamanti, Arlauskis \u2013 were shipped on pretty sharpish. In the context of our season, though, it\u2019s difficult to label anyone a \u201cflop\u201d.</p> <p><strong>Summer targets </strong>Our full-backs need looking at, with the excellent Nathan Ak\u00e9 heading back to Chelsea. We could also do with some more attacking options: we\u2019ve lined up the Granada forward Isaac Success (yes, really), while Abdoulaye Doucour\u00e9 and Adalberto Pe\u00f1aranda were signed in January, then loaned out.</p> <p><strong>Best and worst away fans </strong>Villa\u2019s gallows humour was well-rehearsed but creative. Spurs fans were the worst, because they\u2019re Spurs fans.</p> <p><strong>2016-17 title winners </strong>Ha. Not falling for that one, not after this season.

It\u2019s been a frustrating season for many reasons, but we have, at least, achieved our aim of staying up. It\u2019s just all been pretty joyless. As far as Pulis goes, he\u2019s been Pulis.</p> <p><strong>The stars </strong>Jonny Evans has turned out to be wonderful value. Swapping him for Lescott must have been the finest bit of business anywhere. Craig Dawson is blossoming into a solid and reliable Premier League defender, and Rond\u00f3n looked promising. He could do so much better with support, though.</p> <p><strong>The flops </strong>Berahino has totally wasted a season.

No one will ever forget that final night: the crowd was the noisiest I\u2019ve ever heard it. Slaven Bilic has done really well to achieve at least a top eight finish, and for a while it looked like our name was on the FA Cup too. To win away at Arsenal, Man City and Liverpool has been exceptional. We\u2019ve played with flair, and the club is now united after the pragmatic years of Big Sam.<br /></p> <p><strong>The stars </strong>No one can quite believe we have Dimitri Payet, whose tricks and free-kicks have won him the freedom of E13. Lanzini is another fantasy midfielder, while Cresswell, Kouyat\u00e9, Noble (too good for England) and Antonio have all had great seasons. Even Andy Carroll is showing signs of fitness and form.</p> <p><strong>The flops </strong>Diafra Sakho has struggled after his off-the-field issues and Valencia has suffered with injuries, but apart from loanees Song and Emenike, we\u2019ve not really had any big underperformers.</p> <p><strong>Summer targets </strong>A 20-a-season striker would add competition up front and help finish off Payet\u2019s work. Another right-back would solve a problem position.</p> <p><strong>Best and worst away fans </strong>Southampton impressed by responding to the standard security announcement \u201cMr Moon has left the stadium\u201d with: \u201cMr Moon, he left \u2018cos you\u2019re shit!\u201d And Swansea did a loud \u201cLand of my Fathers\u201d.

We\u2019ve blown it, big time. With the big spenders failing, this should have been our time to shine \u2013 and it would have been if our blinkered stars had shown 10% more desire. The laissez-faire approach of our scientific gaffer might have been OK if we\u2019d had a genuine leader on the pitch \u2013 but without one we\u2019re starved of inspiration</p> <p><strong>The stars </strong>\u00d6zil shone for some of the season. We also had consistency from Koscielny, Monreal and Beller\u00edn, and the emergence of Elneny and Iwobi.</p> <p><strong>The flops </strong>Ramsey failed to live up to our inflated expectations, Mertesacker has often looked past his sell by date, and, sadly, instead of inspiring team-mates with his enthusiasm, Alexis appears to have been infected with Arsenal apathy. And if Walcott somehow ends up with England in France this summer it\u2019ll be an utter travesty.</p> <p><strong>Summer targets </strong>Our squad has the same glaring gaps as always. We need a 30-goal striker. At the back, why couldn\u2019t we have signed Alderweireld, instead of a liability like Gabriel? It\u2019s hard to imagine Ars\u00e8ne will spend his way out of our depression.</p> <p><strong>Best and worst away fans</strong> Bayern were the best, if only for their wonderfully effective ticket price protest. The worst: need you ask?</p> <p><strong>2016-17 title winners </strong>I\u2019m having a fiver on Burnley.</p> <p><strong>Ideal montage music for Arsenal\u2019s season highlights</strong>: Inspired by Andrea Bocelli\u2019s performance at the King Power: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqYG3f4PaWc\"><em>Con te partir\u00f2 \u2013 Time To Say Goodbye</em></a>.</p> <p><strong>Bernard Azulay </strong><a href=\"http://www.goonersdiary.co.uk/\">goonersdiary.co.uk</a> / <a href=\"https://twitter.com/goonern5\">@GoonerN5</a></p> <h2>Aston Villa: 0/10</h2> <p>It\u2019s been the longest, most painful season imaginable. We were down by November: since then it\u2019s just been one embarrassment after another. We need a total overhaul, but will the new owners be any better than Lerner and his cronies? At least we can look forward to visiting some new grounds (Burton, Bristol City) and some old favourites (Leeds, Sheffield Wednesday). I\u2019d be happy with 10th next season, so long as we build a team with a spine.</p> <p><strong>The stars </strong>Ayew looked good for a bit but was dragged down by the others.</p> <p><strong>The flops </strong>It actually hurts my fingers to type names like Richards, Bacuna, Lescott and (heart-breakingly) Agbonlahor.

The players have been magnificent and Eddie Howe just gets better: we simply can\u2019t afford to lose him or Jason Tindall. The last few games have been as difficult as everyone expected when we saw the fixture list, but we have to remember who we are: every game is a chance to learn about the top flight for our players.</p> <p><strong>The stars </strong>Left-back Charlie Daniels had a special season, and Josh King was most improved. Simon Francis, at centre-back and right-back, was superb.</p> <p><strong>The flops </strong>No one let us down \u2013 I\u2019d just like to have seen more of Juan Iturbe and, of course, Tyrone Mings, who was injured last August. The big disappointment was Lee Tomlin. Shipping him off to Bristol City did him and the club a lot of good.</p> <p><strong>Summer targets </strong>A central defender, two strong central midfield players and a goalkeeper.</p> <p><strong>Best and worst away fans</strong> Everton were fantastic.

Was it the players? Was it the manager? In truth, probably a toxic combination of the two. I don\u2019t envy Antonio Conte walking into this disaster zone \u2013 he\u2019s really got his work cut out.</p> <p><strong>The stars </strong>Willian was the only player who gave 100% for virtually every game, no matter how woefully his team-mates were performing around him. The malaise that was evident throughout the rest of the squad didn\u2019t put him off.</p> <p><strong>The flops </strong>Everyone but Willian. I\u2019m serious \u2013 it was like invasion of the body-snatchers. Hazard, Courtois, Oscar, Costa, Matic \u2013 what happened to them?</p> <p><strong>Summer targets </strong>Deep breath. One right-back, one left-back, two centre-backs, one striker, and, if we give in to Courtois, a new keeper too. Of course, had the club listened to Mourinho last summer we would probably just be looking at a couple of signings: this club has often had a feast or famine approach to squad maintenance. We always seem to learn the hard way.</p> <p><strong>Best and worst away fans </strong>The worst were City \u2013 woeful numbers for a club whose fans surely can\u2019t already be bored of being good. As for the best \u2013 to be honest, no one really stands out. I think our own fans deserve a mention for still filling the ground week after week despite the dire football.</p> <p><strong>2016-17 title winners </strong>I have this horrible feeling that Klopp will weave his magic at Liverpool\u2026</p> <p><strong>Highlights montage music </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TjPhzgxe3L0\">Heaven Knows I\u2019m Miserable Now</a> \u2013 The Smiths.</p> <p><strong>Trizia Fiorellino</strong> <a href=\"http://www.chelseasupportersgroup.net/\">ChelseaSupportersGroup.net</a></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/14/crystal-palace-fa-cup-final-1990-manchester-united\">Crystal Palace\u2019s Cup final class of 1990 hope to inspire this year\u2019s model | Dominic Fifield</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Crystal Palace: 6.5/10</h2> <p>Looking at it rationally, it\u2019s been a brilliant year for Palace. We\u2019re safe from the drop, we\u2019ve secured investment to rebuild the ground, and, of course, we\u2019re in the FA Cup final for just the second time ever. But the glaring, horrible stat of just two league wins in the whole of 2016 has soured things \u2013 the big fear being that the form will be carried over into next season. We\u2019ll see. But of course, if we win the Cup then it immediately goes down as the greatest season in our history, and that 6\u00bd becomes a straight 10.</p> <p><strong>The stars </strong>Zaha has delivered consistently and is improving massively in his defensive duties. It\u2019s baffling how he hasn\u2019t won any more England caps. Bolasie and Dann have been very solid, Wickham has improved, and James McArthur is brilliantly effective.</p> <p><strong>The flops </strong>Wayne Hennessey kept his place despite a string of howlers; Alex McCarthy, Bakary Sako, and Patrick Bamford barely registered; and Emmanuel Adebayor\u2019s one goal wasn\u2019t great value for money.</p> <p><strong>Summer targets </strong>A new keeper, a quality young centre-back and a winger \u2013 Andros Townsend or Nathan Redmond \u2013 to keep Bolasie and Zaha on their toes. Above all, a striker who can manage double figures.</p> <p><strong>Best and worst away fans </strong>Leicester were the best - staying for 20 minutes after the final whistle to celebrate their 1-0 win. West Brom\u2019s crowd, meanwhile, looked like they\u2019d rather be anywhere else.</p> <p><strong>2016-17 title winners </strong>Tottenham.</p> <p><strong>Highlights montage music </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7hmF_IX9Ic\">Take it to the Limit</a> - the Eagles.</p> <p><strong>Chris Waters </strong><a href=\"http://palacetrust.org.uk\">palacetrust.org.uk</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Clapham_Grand\">@Clapham_Grand</a></p> <h2>Everton: 3/10</h2> <p>After last season\u2019s poor finish was blamed on Europe, this time there was no excuse. We started in style with a 3-0 win at Southampton, and put six past Sunderland and four past Villa. But then it all started to go wrong. As the season dragged on, things went from worse to worst, with the last two months particularly hard to watch. It was only the fact that we reached two semi-finals that stopped the protests against Roberto Mart\u00ednez building sooner.</p> <p><strong>The stars </strong>Gareth Barry was strong and Romelu Lukaku set a club record for goals. He hasn\u2019t scored since mid-March, though.</p> <p><strong>The flops </strong>There was talk of this being the best Everton squad for 30 years. Howard, Robles, Cleverley, McCarthy, Lennon and Oviedo just aren\u2019t good enough.</p> <p><strong>Summer targets </strong>All depends on the new manager. We need some major work.</p> <p><strong>Best and worst away fans </strong>Leicester were the best; Liverpool the worst.</p> <p><strong>2016-17 title winners </strong>Tottenham.</p> <p><strong>Highlights montage music </strong>Something to lighten the mood.

Thankfully, no it didn\u2019t, not even close. Leicester are the champions of England. Keep reading it over and over, let it sink in! This season has been a pleasure from start to finish.</p> <p><strong>The stars </strong>Mahrez and Vardy have scooped most of the plaudits and awards, but N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 is the beating heart of this team and has been the outstanding player this season. And a special mention for our captain Wes Morgan, who has been a rock. But really, every single one of our players deserves praise \u2013 they are all heroes in my eyes.</p> <p><strong>The flops </strong>Perhaps Gokhan Inler didn\u2019t live up to his billing but, in his defence, he has been kept out by the imperious Drinkwater/Kant\u00e9 pairing. It would also have been nice to see Shinji Okazaki find the net more, but I can\u2019t fault his workrate, or his infectious grin.</p> <p><strong>Summer targets </strong>The priority is to keep what we have. But we\u2019ll also need a much bigger squad for the rigours of Champions League football. I hope Ranieri and co recruit at least one player in every position. I\u2019d love to see Porto striker Vincent Aboubakar on Filbert Way.</p> <p><strong>Best and worst away fans </strong>My seat is right by the away fans and I\u2019ve struggled to hear most of them over the noise from our end. But West Ham deserve credit for their \u201cJamie Vardy\u2019s having a shower\u201d chant when he was controversially sent off.</p> <p><strong>2016-17 title winners </strong>Even I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll retain it. We\u2019ll jostle again, but Man City look the best bet.</p> <p><strong>Highlights montage music </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RubBzkZzpUA\">Drake - Started from the Bottom</a>.</p> <p><strong>Chris Whiting </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/chrisrwhiting?lang=en-gb\">@ChrisRWhiting</a></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/14/liverpool-jurgen-klopp-atmosphere-anfield-better\">Liverpool\u2019s J\u00fcrgen Klopp: \u2018It is up to the team to make Anfield atmosphere better\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Liverpool: 7/10</h2> <p>It has ended a whole heap better than it started. I had few expectations back in August as a stuttering start gave way to a breakdown and records tumbled with weekly defeats. Out went Rodgers, in came Klopp and we\u2019ve been on the up since. We had a day out at Wembley and still have Basel for the Europa League final to come. And \u2013 finally \u2013 the clubs saw sense and capped away tickets. All in all, not a bad season.</p> <p><strong>The stars </strong>Emre Can has looked the player we hoped he\u2019d be over the past couple of months; Firmino and Coutinho have often shone; and Origi has made huge progress. Also worth plenty of praise: Lucas, who always performs, the manager and the fans, who organised and took part in the 77-minute walkout in February in protest against rising ticket prices at Anfield, forcing the club owners to back down and rethink their pricing policy.</p> <p><strong>The flops </strong>It hasn\u2019t worked out for Benteke, though he doesn\u2019t often get long to show what he can do. Mignolet has his moments and has certainly flapped. Flopped is probably a bit harsh.</p> <p><strong>Summer targets </strong>A keeper for sure \u2013 we can join the queue for Courtois; a centre-half with Sakho out; and a striker \u2013 we could ask across the Park for Lukaku, maybe. And, of course, Mario G\u00f6tze.</p> <p><strong>Best and worst away fans </strong>Spurs and Dortmund were best. The worst were the usual witless suspects.</p> <p><strong>2016-17 title winners </strong>Liverpool.

The Capital One Cup win and the run to the Champions League semis papered over the cracks \u2013 this will be our lowest points total since 2009-10. Much more embarrassing, though, was our failure to beat any of the league\u2019s top eight with the exception of Southampton (once), who we beat at the Etihad. As for the manager \u2013 the writing has been on the wall for a long time. The club has been stuck in a holding pattern in anticipation of Pep Guardiola\u2019s arrival, and the results have suffered.</p> <p><strong>The stars </strong>Fernandinho has been brilliant. He doesn\u2019t get the media attention he deserves but he\u2019s loved by the fans. I hate to think what our season might have been like without him. Hart and Sagna have also been excellent, whilst De Bruyne\u2019s integration has been seamless. He\u2019s my tip for the Player of the Year next season, under Guardiola\u2019s tutelage.</p> <p><strong>The flops </strong>There have been a few but Wilfried Bony has been particularly bad.</p> <p><strong>Summer targets </strong>We need central midfielders. It looks like Ilkay G\u00fcndogan is still a target despite his knee injury. Toni Kroos would be perfect, and Paul Pogba remains the dream. I\u2019d also been keen on John Stones, who has been hung out to dry by both his manager and the media. He could be a revelation under Pep.</p> <p><strong>Best and worst away fans </strong>Hull in the League Cup were the best.

We\u2019ve scored just 46 goals and created fewer chances than any United team I can remember. LVG wants his team to dominate possession: for that we need quality and confidence, and we lack both. One of the biggest issues is how easily the team falls apart when pressed, and how vulnerable and careless we are defending set pieces. At least we have Wembley to look forward to \u2013 but I can\u2019t see a cup win saving big Louis. Hopefully his legacy will be Martial, Rashford, Fosu-Mensah and Borthwick-Jackson becoming regulars.</p> <p><strong>The stars </strong>Apart from the youngsters, De Gea has been outstanding again. Hopefully he will stay.</p> <p><strong>The flops </strong>Depay would deliver in a decent team but we are far from that. Herrera is overrated and Darmian has really lacked quality.</p> <p><strong>Summer targets </strong>We need a ball-playing centre-half and a leader \u2013 Juve\u2019s Leonardo Bonucci? I\u2019d also test Leicester\u2019s resolve to keep Kant\u00e9 and Mahrez.</p> <p><strong>Best and worst away fans </strong>Arsenal are fun: they always sell out and are usually quite giddy until they go behind, at which point they leave in droves. City were worst.</p> <p><strong>2016-17 title winners </strong>United. Shaw will be back, hopefully we\u2019ll have the new defensive rock we need, and Rashford and Martial will be the most lethal combination in the country \u2013 if they get enough ammunition.

      "body": "<p>Considering the historic apathy of the British public when it comes to switching their bank accounts, it seems apt that those tasked with writing a competition report on the topic don\u2019t seem in a terrible hurry to conclude.</p> <p>But on Tuesday the delayed investigation by the Competition and Markets Authority into retail banking reaches a critical phase with the publication of provisional remedies.</p> <p>High street banks will learn of a suite of recommendations aimed at making it easier for customers to move their current accounts \u2013to be followed by another month\u2019s consultation.</p> <p>The investigation, which was originally due to be concluded this month, was announced in July 2014, at a time of heightened political debate about the banking sector. Then Labour leader Ed Miliband was pushing for a break-up of the big four of Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays.</p> <p>While these banks still control 77% of current accounts, such drastic moves rarely seem to happen in the banking industry \u2013 and almost certainly won\u2019t this week. For instance, despite it being a condition of its \u00a345bn taxpayer bailout in 2008, and numerous aborted efforts, RBS has still to offload its 300 Williams &amp; Glyn branches.</p> <p>Like switching accounts, that is something somebody might some day get around to.</p> <h2>Standard Life chief in line for a pay battle<br /></h2> <p>And in this week\u2019s \u201cchief executive who irritated his shareholders to the point of revolt\u201d slot, we give you Keith Skeoch, the new boss of Standard Life.</p> <p>He belatedly twigged that he might be in line for a bit of a kicking at Tuesday\u2019s annual meeting, and last week attempted to head off an investor protest over his pay by cutting \u00a3700,000 off his potential \u00a33.5m bonus.</p> <p>A clash with investors would be particularly embarrassing given that Skeoch used to run the fund management arm, Standard Life Investments, which holds stakes in listed companies and often speaks out about boardroom excess.</p> <p>Still, the Edinburgh-based insurer announced after the stock market had closed on Wednesday that Skeoch would reduce his potential bonus to \u00a32.8m \u2013 400% of his \u00a3700,000-a-year salary \u2013 from the 500% that he had previously been awarded. The revision was announced a little over 24 hours before the deadline for shareholders to cast their votes ahead of the AGM.</p> <p>So, will it be enough?</p> <p>Investors are in an aggressive mood, having already voted against <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/15/more-companies-risk-shareholder-anger-excessive-pay-deals\" title=\"\">pay deals at BP and Smith &amp; Nephew</a> during this AGM season.</p> <h2>An offer they can refuse at Foxtons<br /></h2> <p>Elsewhere on the list of potential shareholder revolts this week comes Foxtons \u2013 the estate agent chain with such a cuddly image that it was once accused of giving its much-disliked sector a bad name.</p> <p>The firm is facing a possible rebellion over a 19% increase, to \u00a3550,000 a year, in the basic pay of chief executive Nic Budden, who seems immune to the embarrassment of having presided over a year in which the group\u2019s share price has fallen by more than 40%.</p> <p>Foxtons has argued that Budden had previously been paid at below the market rate, although the sales patter hasn\u2019t quite worked with an audience that seems to be sticking with the well-worn method of assessing estate agent behaviour: you can tell they are trying to shaft you when you see their lips move.</p> <p>Anyway, Institutional Shareholder Services \u2013 a shareholder adviser that represents 20% of UK stock market investors \u2013 and its rival Glass Lewis are both recommending votes against the remuneration report at the annual general meeting on Wednesday.</p> <p>So shareholders who invested in a company with a reputation for overpricing properties are set to get cross when the company does the same thing with the chief exec.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-15T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>There is a quiet crisis in British business. The number of quoted British public companies has halved over the past 15 years. Too many famous names among those that are left \u2013 from oil to retailing \u2013 have been embroiled in scandals or have profound problems with their business model. There are only two hi-tech companies \u2013 ARM and Sage \u2013 represented in the FTSE 100. Fifty years ago there were\u00a0dozens.</p> <p>Yet great companies are precious economic and social organisations. At their best, they are agencies for human betterment. If Britain is going to improve its economic and social performance, it needs more such companies, especially in the knowhow-driven economy of today. Their lack is an important reason for the decline in productivity growth.</p> <p>The chief explanation is that it has become too hard for British companies to pursue purposed, rounded business strategies. That is the proposition at the core of tomorrow\u2019s Big Innovation Centre Purposeful Company interim report, supported by more than a dozen companies (such as Kingfisher, GlaxoSmithKline, EY, Barclays, the Guardian Media Group and Infosys) as well as by other organisations including the Bank of England and Innovate UK.</p> <p>Successful companies are defined by their capacity to deliver and pursue clearly defined visionary corporate purposes \u2013 to be the best, to do business that is sustainable, to serve humanity, to stretch every muscle to innovate. Those purposes are not just rhetoric: they are binding commitments on the whole of an enterprise, from the board of directors to the shop floor, that generate trust. It is trust on which so much good business depends.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The industry that manages Britain\u2019s long-term savings is hardly structured to make good deficiencies</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>No company attempting to be purposed pulls it off completely; the key is to try, and build the systems to make it happen \u2013 and it is this commitment that contributes to improved performance. Thus Ikea, Kingfisher and Uniqlo declare that their purpose is to make sure everyone can have what only a few can have \u2013 from improving their home to cheap clothes that are nonetheless high-fashion. As their purpose, Apple and the BBC strive for perfection in what they do; GlaxoSmithKline and Unilever declare their purpose is to do business that is sustainable and ethical. Unilever creates a \u201cmateriality\u201d map to ensure it is focused on what materially will deliver its declared purpose.</p> <p>Innovation is another compelling clarion call; the company\u2019s purpose is to go where no company has gone before \u2013 as ARM or Tesla declare. Other purposes range from treating stakeholders, including one\u2019s workforce and customers with integrity \u2013 John Lewis and more recently Barclays \u2013 or taking on the big boys and challenging the complacency of incumbents, like Uber or Ovo Energy.</p> <p>The evidence marshalled in the report suggests that purposed companies measurably \u2013 and here the report breaks new ground \u2013 innovate, invest and are more customer-centric than their non-purposed peers. Put another way, being non-purposed is costing the British economy up to \u00a3130bn a year of lost value generation. The precondition for rebalancing the economy or launching the march of the makers \u2013 preoccupations that stretch across the political spectrum \u2013 is to have a large and growing population of purposed firms.</p> <p>Yet too much in the British ownership, financial and innovation ecosystem militates against the delivery of purpose. The evidence is that British public companies have the most fragmented, diversified shareholder base \u2013 and fewer so-called external independent block shareholders \u2013 of any advanced industrial economy, including the US. There is thus a paucity of engaged owners.</p> <p>All advanced economies over the last 20 years, including China and Germany, have enlarged the rights of shareholders. But they have done so within financial frameworks that give company managements an array of devices to cement shareholder commitment \u2013 from making takeovers difficult to privileging founder shareholders with more voting rights, or allowing directors to have responsibilities to a wider range of stakeholders. They also have more sizeable block shareholders, which can act as engaged owners. Britain neither encourages block shareholding nor gives companies the freedom to protect purposed behaviour if they choose. Visionary purpose gets marginalised.</p> <p>The industry that manages Britain\u2019s long-term savings is hardly structured to make good the deficiencies. Long-term insurance companies and pension funds hardly invest in British companies any more; there are too many small pension funds, and too few have the incentive or resource to be in the business of stewarding companies. Stewardship, for all the warm words, codes and exhortation, is too often honoured in the breach rather than the observance.</p> <p>To make matters worse, the stock market is not very good at valuing investment in intangible \u201cknowhow\u201d assets like R&amp;D, patents, copyrights, or just straight investment in employees\u2019 skills. Yet intangibles, with their long-term returns, are already the bedrock of the 21st century economy, with investment running at twice the level of \u201ctangibles\u201d in factories and machines.</p> <p>British business investment in R&amp;D, even allowing for the shrunken size of manufacturing, is running below the international average and shrinking. Small wonder so many companies are retreating from the public markets \u2013 and that matters not only because, if public markets work well, they provide money at scale, but because they are the principal way in which the average person can share in wealth generation.</p> <p>What to do? There is no magic bullet, just a range of ideas \u2013 some big, some small \u2013 that cumulatively could make a difference. The interim report groups 20 policy options for change on which the Purposeful Company taskforce will be consulting over the next seven weeks.</p> <p>The first ideas cluster is to encourage companies, via their constitutions, practice and reporting, to take purpose more seriously. Executive pay should be geared to the results that engaged owners want over time, rather than just rewarding this year\u2019s profits. Secondly, Britain should consider introducing the tools that other countries permit to encourage shareholders to commit to companies \u2013 such as shares with differential voting rights. Thirdly, we need more blockholding and long-term shareholders.</p> <p>Next, the asset management industry needs a makeover itself; there are too many small pension funds and the stewardship code could be made tougher. Lastly, the decline in UK equity ownership needs to be reversed: the tax system favours debt, not equity, and there is a case for a British sovereign wealth fund to make good the equity shortfall.</p> <p>Too many of these propositions for too long have been regarded as the preserve of corporate governance nerds. Wrong. These issues are central not just to reviving the legitimacy of business by putting purpose at its heart \u2013 they are the key to creating long-term value for business and society. There is now a critical mass of companies and opinion emerging that could make real change happen. The task is to ensure that it does.</p> <p><em>The Big Innovation Centre Purposeful Company taskforce\u2019s interim report is released on Monday on </em><a href=\"http://www.biginnovationcentre.com/\" title=\"\"><em>www.biginnovationcentre.com</em></a></p>",

Adverts for the Three network play before the show starts.</p> <p>The last time will.i.am launched a product \u2013 the <a href=\"http://mashable.com/2015/02/03/will-i-am-puls-review/#t64lILg9Iqqc\" title=\"\">Puls</a> smartcuff in 2014 \u2013 it didn\u2019t go so well. But AneedA turns out to be one of the better things about the entire night. The disembodied robot wisecracks between songs (\u201cI thought you were going to play It\u2019s My Birthday first,\u201d she intones; later, she chastises will.i.am for not burning enough calories). If any sharp-eared fans were wondering where they had heard her coo before, it becomes apparent near the end. AneedA\u2019s soothing British tones recall Britney Spears\u2019s heavily Auto-Tuned parts on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYtGl1dX5qI\" title=\"\">Scream &amp; Shout</a>.\u00a0(Of course, you realise, a digital\u00a0assistant invented by will.i.am had to be an Auto-Tuned female.)</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRuoR--LdqQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VRuoR--LdqQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch the video for Feelin\u2019 Myself.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Tonight\u2019s 360-degree celebration of will.i.am-ness has a soupcon, too, of Kanye West\u2019s <em>The Life of Pablo</em> fashion show-cum-party. There is DJing, best skirted over, as it degenerates into wedding crowd-pleasing (Oasis, Eurythmics). Will.i.am later rings his mum up via his dial device. Famous friends and colleagues lend their time \u2013 Ricky Wilson reprises his Kaiser Chiefs hit I Predict a Riot, plus breakout crew WSTRN sing their 2015 hit, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-hy92f00EE\" title=\"\">In2</a>, while Tinie Tempah does his forgettable Girls Like song. We are sitting in the round, and it\u2019s like some fresh circle of hell reserved for Royal Variety light entertainment performances, not tech\u2019s cutting edge.</p> <p>Marking a reunion of sorts, apl.de.ap and Taboo of the Black Eyed Peas appear on stage in the final section for a run-through of some Peas hits \u2013 minus Fergie, whose role in the band seems unclear as they head into recording a new album. Instead, there\u2019s Lydia Lucy, will.i.am\u2019s latest <em>Voice</em> protege, wearing the sort of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/11/receptionist-sent-home-pwc-not-wearing-high-heels-pwc-nicola-thorp\" title=\"\">stupidly high heels that suggest a successful temp work role</a> cannot be far off . She sings the Fergie parts on Where Is the Love? (still moving)\u00a0and\u00a0I Gotta Feeling (less so). The highlight is Taboo\u2019s anecdote about swearing in front of Prince. Prince makes them pray together, only to be told afterwards: \u201cPrince, you are the fucking shit.\u201d</p> <p>Occasionally a spark of wit, or a decent tune, gatecrashes this cybernetic Radio 1 roadshow. Now best understood as a gonzoid TV personality, will.i.am can still flow old school, recalling a time when hip-hop was a flurry of quick-witted syllables internal rhymes. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRuoR--LdqQ\" title=\"\">Feelin\u2019 Myself</a>, meanwhile, is a tune where you almost forgive all the inane aural clickbait he has been responsible for since the 00s (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEe_eraFWWs\" title=\"\">My Humps</a>, say). The roll here on Feelin\u2019 Myself is relentless.</p> <p>There is, of course, an underlying message you can get behind \u2013 will.i.am exhorts parents in the audience to get their kids writing code. And one more potentially salient detail about dial that reports have not, thus far, focused on: will.i.am promises free streaming access to the entire music industry, bundled into the cost of his device.</p>",

      "body": "<p>In one of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2010/feb/17/fantastic-authenticity-calvin-and-hobbes\" title=\"\">Bill Watterson</a>\u2019s wonderful cartoons, six-year-old Calvin and his tiger companion, Hobbes, stand outside and contemplate the starry night. \u201cWe hurl through an incomprehensible darkness. In cosmic terms, we are subatomic particles in a grain of sand on an infinite beach,\u201d observes Calvin, before pausing for a moment and adding: \u201cI wonder what\u2019s on TV now.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a shrewd point. Musing on what we will perhaps never comprehend is a discombobulating experience that sends most of us scampering off to the familiar, intelligible corners of our daily lives. Not so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/marcus-du-sautoy\" title=\"\">Marcus du Sautoy</a> . With <em>What We Cannot Know</em>, the prominent mathematician, writer and broadcaster boldly squares up to what he calls the seven \u201cedges\u201d of human knowledge, topics that range from the nature of time to the mysteries of human consciousness.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/29/people-hate-maths-my-plan-make-it-work-for-them\">So people hate maths? Here\u2019s my plan to make it work for them | Marcus du Sautoy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Du Sautoy is no stranger to adopting the academic\u2019s avuncular manner to explain \u201cwhat science has taught us\u201d. But his take here is refreshing, not least because along his journey he exposes with humility his own confusions, apprehensions and concerns. And there is certainly plenty to be both baffled and enlightened about. Does a multiverse exist? Are leptons and quarks where the subatomic buck stops? And is an infinite set of even numbers bigger than an infinite set that also includes odd ones?</p> <p>Happily, Du Sautoy\u2019s desk is covered in a panoply of knick-knacks that invite us to probe each question, from a red dice picked up at a Las Vegas casino to a homemade cut-and stick model of the celestial realm. To get things rolling, he explores whether it is ever possible to know in advance which side up his dice will land. Surely, if the details of the dice and its throw are known, a prediction should be possible? But, like next month\u2019s weather, the outcome of this simple act is remarkably difficult to forecast \u2013 particularly if the dice is cast on to a rigid surface. As Du Sautoy reveals, tiny but unavoidable inaccuracies in measuring the factors that affect the movement of the dice make it impossible to predict which side will end up on top: minuscule variations would predict very different outcomes. That, it seems, is how chaos theory rolls.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Not everything sinks into a quagmire of uncertainly, and he peppers his journey with some \u201cknowns\u201d we can cling to</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Intriguingly, as Du Sautoy explores such murky realms, he gently scrutinises each for a hiding place for God, revealing in the process why, although some of the scientists he meets have faith, he chose to reject the idea of a supernatural intelligence intervening in the universe. Ultimately, he reveals, when it comes to unknowns, sitting on the fence is not always the best option. \u201cA belief in an answer one way or the other will have an impact on how we lead our lives,\u201d he explains.</p> <p>Not everything sinks into a quagmire of uncertainty, and du Sautoy peppers his journey with some sturdy \u201cknowns\u201d we can cling to, from the understanding that quantum fluctuations really do allow something to arise from nothing to the realisation that the stars are not fixed in their positions \u2013 in 100,000 years it turns out, the constellation of the plough will look less like a saucepan and more like a wheelbarrow with a broken handle. But while Du Sautoy\u2019s approach is novel, it turns out the question upon which his book is based is in itself troublesome. \u201cThe possibility that we cannot know because we are stuck within the system is a common theme among many of the problems I have tried to tackle,\u201d he admits, adding that our language, brains and even thinking hampers our quest for knowledge. As he somewhat limply concludes: \u201cI wonder if the safest bet is to say that we can never truly know for sure what it is we cannot know.\u201d Even when musing that it is likely we\u2019ll never pin down whether the universe is infinite, he cannot quite reject the idea that mathematics might one day crack the problem.</p> <p>It seems like a long shot. But if he\u2019s right, even the mysteries of that incomprehensible darkness could be ushered into the light.</p> <p><em>What We Cannot Know is published by 4th Estate (\u00a320). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/391690/\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a316</em></a></p>",

      "body": "<p>\u2018My mum is always pestering me to do various charitable events,\u201d says Jo Brand, hunkering down into a deep armchair. \u201cSo recently I did a talk at her library to raise money, and there was a Q&amp;A afterwards. And the first question was: \u2018What\u2019s it like to be hated?\u2019\u201d Her expression is impassive; an unflappability perhaps developed in her first career as a psychiatric nurse dealing with highly unstable inmates in an emergency ward. Brand continues, her voice unchanged: \u201cSo that was a nice one to start on.\u201d</p> <p>We are in the <em>Observer\u2019s </em>office in King\u2019s Cross for Brand to negotiate our occasional feature You Ask the Questions \u2013 \u201cyou\u201d being you, the readers, and a smattering of celebrities whose paths the 58-year-old comedian has crossed in three decades of standup and television appearances. Good news, I say: no one has asked that. \u201cI don\u2019t mind even if they have,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m ready for anything.\u201d</p> <p>Brand, as that tactful person in her mum\u2019s library noted, has been a divisive figure. The first time she performed live, according to legend, a male heckler shouted \u201cFuck off, you fat cow\u201d for most of her set. In the 1980s and 1990s especially, there was a strongly feminist tone to her comedy, which was enough to see her labelled anti-men or, in extreme cases, a lesbian. (For the record, Brand is married to Bernie, a psychiatric nurse, and they have two children.)</p> <p>\u201cWhen people insulted me in the press, they always picked on the very obvious thing: weight, how you look, how you dress; you don\u2019t wear dresses very often <em>ergo </em>you are a lesbian \u2013 like that\u2019s a big insult anyway,\u201d says Brand. \u201cHave they not heard of pretty lesbians that wear dresses? They obviously hadn\u2019t in those days. It obviously meant that you looked like a plumber.\u201d</p> <p>These days, though, Brand is clearly regarded more fondly. More than one question submitted for this feature referred to her as \u201ca national treasure\u201d. There are maybe two main reasons for the change in the perception. One was the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/mar/18/jo-brands-hell-of-a-walk-review-lovely-inspiring\"><em>Hell of a Walk</em></a><em> </em>that she completed in January for Sport Relief. She stomped from one side of the country to the other \u2013 135 miles from the mouth of the Humber to Liverpool \u2013 in seven days and raised more than \u00a31m.</p> <p>It was clearly a gruelling effort that took a lot out of Brand and she \u2013 unlike some celebrity challengers \u2013 did not hide this fact from the cameras. \u201cI realise I was quite bad tempered,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I do think it\u2019s fairly reasonable to demonstrate that you have the same moods as other people would have if they were in the same position. There was this teacher who walked along with me at about 6pm and she said, \u2018Do you mind if I walk with you?\u2019 And I said, \u2018No, I don\u2019t mind but I\u2019m in a really bad mood and I might be quite rude to you.\u2019 And she said, \u2018No, that\u2019s perfectly all right.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cThen she said to me, \u2018Can I tell my pupils I haven\u2019t marked their homework because I\u2019m walking with you?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Do what you want!\u2019 And she went, \u2018How dare you!\u2019 and got in a real tizz and walked off. That was the desired result but I thought, \u2018Well, I did tell you I was grumpy\u2026\u2019 So I did try to warn people.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itQypXk910Y\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/itQypXk910Y?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=itQypXk910Y\">The trailer for Jo Brand\u2019s new sitcom Going Forward.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Another reason for the surge in affection for Brand was the BBC4 comedy <em>Getting On</em>, in which she played a nurse called Kim Wilde who worked in a female geriatric ward. The show, which she created with Vicki Pepperdine and Joanna Scanlan, ran for three series from 2009 to 2012 and won Brand a Bafta in 2010 for her performance. It was a warm, naturalistic turn and she will be reprising the role of Kim \u2013 minus Pepperdine and Scanlan \u2013 in a new spin-off, <em>Going Forward</em>, which will be shown in three instalments on BBC4 later this month.</p> <p>In <em>Going Forward</em>, Kim has left the NHS and now works as a care assistant in the community, dashing between appointments with her elderly patients and juggling a chaotic home life. Her husband Dave, played by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/omid-djalili\">Omid Djalili</a>, is a private-hire car driver and similarly embattled. The series has a few serious points to make \u2013 notably about private companies taking over health provision, and zero-hours contracts \u2013 but Brand was determined that it should be a comedy above all else. \u201cOh yes, if you\u2019re doing comedy, you must be funny first and preach second,\u201d she says. \u201cBecause if you do it the other way around then it\u2019s just irritating for people. We\u2019d just be doing a party political broadcast.\u201d</p> <p>After three series of <em>Getting On</em>, a split developed between its creators. \u201cThere were substantial differences between the ways which we worked, because Jo and Vicky were actors and I\u2019m a standup,\u201d Brand says. \u201cWe tried to improvise most of it and, they may say that I\u2019m wrong over this, but I think they felt more comfortable not doing that. So I suppose by the end of three series, we were separating out a bit and looking at going different ways. And they were keen to go to the States\u201d \u2013 where the show has been reimagined by HBO, and Pepperdine and Scanlan have both taken cameos \u2013 \u201cand I wasn\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>With Djalili especially, Brand felt more relaxed drifting off script. \u201cOh, the whole thing is improvised,\u201d she says. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously a narrative, because we couldn\u2019t improvise the plot as we went along. We knew that in this episode Dave is going to find out that his pay has been substantially cut because of all the extras, paying for renting this, that and the other from the car firm. But yeah, there was no script as such.\u201d</p> <p>Such light-footedness should be perfect preparation for doing You Ask the Questions then \u2013 and so it turns out.</p> <h2>You ask the questions</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"bc6720f505b6be0adc99f00a9b96ea34e93e84d3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bc6720f505b6be0adc99f00a9b96ea34e93e84d3/1683_412_1459_1823/800.jpg\" alt=\"Stewart Lee\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Do you wish you were starting now, when female comedians are just allowed to be comedians, or did you enjoy being a trailblazer?</strong><br /><strong>Stewart Lee, comedian</strong><br />Ooh, well thank you Stewart for calling me a trailblazer. No, I\u2019m happy with the time I did start out. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say that I was a trailblazer, but it was a much more exciting time really. What we called \u201calternative comedy\u201d was in its infancy and the atmosphere at clubs was fantastic. You used to have the weirdest people on the circuit. There was a guy who melted a block of ice with a blowtorch and that was his act. He was called the Iceman, unsurprisingly. There was a woman who used to make very rude noises through her vagina, who would go down very well at the Tunnel Club [the notorious 1980s venue in east London] because they like that sort of thing down there.</p> <p>Standup has all become a bit more commercial and a bit slicker. And I certainly wasn\u2019t slick. Women performers like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/sarah-millican\">Sarah Millican</a> and Bridget Christie are very polished and not nearly as badly organised as I am. They work much harder. I felt like I just winged it quite a lot and it was easier in those days to do that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"ba2e79385060fc37be479d11be7964b0f7c68f20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba2e79385060fc37be479d11be7964b0f7c68f20/1552_1314_1173_1466/800.jpg\" alt=\"Aisling Bea\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>You used to go on stage for years as the \u201cSea Monster\u201d instead of your own name, which I\u2019ve always loved. Do you still remember some of your first standup sets and has your style changed much from when you started?<br /></strong><strong>Aisling Bea, comedian and actor</strong></p> <p>Yeah, I remember those days very well. The Sea Monster was merely to cover up my true identity in case people from work came to see me. Because I was a psychiatric nurse and I didn\u2019t really want anyone to know I was doing it. So I just wanted a few months without anyone there. That went on for about six months to a year.</p> <p>Two things I remember about starting were, one, I was very nervous and I didn\u2019t know how to deliver a comedy line, so I did it in a monotone way. The first review I ever got at the Edinburgh festival said I sounded like I was reading the football results. And it was perfectly fair. The other thing was that I had a lot of hit-and-miss jokes. My favourite was where I\u2019d hold a blood capsule in my mouth just before I came on and I\u2019d wear a big white T-shirt. The compere would say: \u201cPlease welcome the Sea Monster\u2026\u201d and I\u2019d go on, cough all over this shirt and then say, \u201cMust give up smoking.\u201d No one ever really laughed at it except me.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"aa82ee8ec216b453ea8426db03b9bdb2a541a470\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa82ee8ec216b453ea8426db03b9bdb2a541a470/2887_169_804_1005/800.jpg\" alt=\"Isy Suttie\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>What\u2019s the latest you\u2019ve ever turned up to a gig (your own) and why?</strong><br /><strong>Isy Suttie, comedian</strong><br />Well, it\u2019s such a long time ago, I feel I can say this now. Mark Thomas and I were doing a gig in Aberdeen and we were flying up from Heathrow on a Friday night and neither of us wanted to go. So we deliberately missed the flight and then we phoned Off the Kerb, [the talent agency] whose gig it was, and said to Joe Norris: \u201cWe\u2019ve missed the flight and we can\u2019t do the gig.\u201d And he went, \u201cJust hang on there.\u201d And he rang back 10 minutes later and said, \u201cI\u2019ve got you on the next one.\u201d</p> <p>So we arrived at the gig two hours late and the audience was in such a bad mood that we both died on our arses. It served us right \u2013 I never did that again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4da5ac8ca07decf4169903b1cce8bd2cad034055\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4da5ac8ca07decf4169903b1cce8bd2cad034055/1885_2634_1028_1285/800.jpg\" alt=\"Shazia Mirza\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>When sectors of the press launched a sustained and personal attack on you, and invented lies to push their own tabloid agenda of generating hatred, how did you manage to remain funny, and keep creating great work?</strong><br /><strong>Shazia Mirza, comedian</strong><br />Occasionally I\u2019ll read about a celebrity complaining about the way they\u2019ve been treated by the press and however realistic and valid that complaint is, they always look like an arse. So that teaches you that you can\u2019t complain about things, because there are people that don\u2019t have enough to eat and you\u2019re saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t like Gary Bushell calling me fat\u201d or whatever it is. What helped with me was, having been a psychiatric nurse for a long time, having been in charge of the psychiatric A&amp;E where I worked, some very difficult, challenging, potentially very violent people would come in and they would want something, either to be admitted or some methadone and, because I was in charge, I was always wheeled out to tell them that they couldn\u2019t. So I really got used to getting a mouthful of quite horrendous abuse on a regular basis. So there we are: you just have to deal with it really.</p> <p><strong>Where in the world do you find peace from the noise of life?</strong><br /><strong>Davina McCall, TV presenter</strong><br />When I\u2019m asleep, I suppose, or watching someone being horribly murdered on TV. That\u2019s a bit odd. I find peace when someone\u2019s having a plastic bag put over their head.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"121fa6314467d549162cb1d83b821ad518eb1756\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/121fa6314467d549162cb1d83b821ad518eb1756/1419_1260_876_1095/800.jpg\" alt=\"Shappi Khorsandi\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>If you were an absolute ruler of Britain for the day, what new law would you bring in immediately and which current law would you abolish?</strong><br /><strong>Shappi Khorsandi, comedian</strong><br />I would abolish public schools. And what would I bring in? I\u2019d bring back Sure Start, because that was a fantastic initiative and the fact it\u2019s gone has really left a massive hole. When children are at that very vulnerable age before five, that\u2019s when anything that\u2019s going to be negative in their later life starts to formulate. If you can catch them early and put them on a more positive road then that\u2019s the time to do it.</p> <p>Also \u2013 people that say they are going to leave the country if the Labour party get in, I\u2019d make it law that they actually had to. Loads of them do that and it\u2019s really annoying.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e11af714264fdffd68a7abec82095074a97f588b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e11af714264fdffd68a7abec82095074a97f588b/1296_415_1204_1504/801.jpg\" alt=\"Bridget Christie\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>You\u2019ve been a huge inspiration to me professionally, but you\u2019ve also always struck me as fundamentally a fair and reasonable, level-headed person who cares deeply about humanity. You work tirelessly for mental health charities \u2013 raising awareness and funds \u2013 and also give your time generously to many other causes. You\u2019re never cruel and, to me at least, seem to have perfect judgment on all manner of things, especially politicians. With that in mind, if you were having dinner with Jeremy Hunt and Donald Trump, in a deserted restaurant with no one else around for miles, and they both started choking at the same time, who would you choose to give the Heimlich manoeuvre to, and why?</strong><br /><strong>Bridget Christie, comedian</strong><br />I\u2019d give it to Jeremy Hunt, because globally he\u2019s much less of a threat than Donald Trump. Because given that Donald Trump now has the Republican nomination in the bag, that means that it\u2019s actually a possibility that he could be\u2026 Can you even believe it? But Americans are a totally different kettle of fish voting-wise and a vast majority of them, just because he says he\u2019s going to build a wall between America and Mexico, might go for him. Jeremy Hunt, well, he\u2019s just a problem in England really, so I\u2019d have to Heimlich manoeuvre him.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"15bb2a1db8936aa250207374c11791053c0378f8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15bb2a1db8936aa250207374c11791053c0378f8/473_566_988_1234/801.jpg\" alt=\"Mark Steel\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>What\u2019s the most hilariously crazy act you remember from the 1980s?</strong><br /><strong>Mark Steel, comedian</strong><br />We\u2019ve already talked about vagina woman, she was very crazy. And of course Chris Lynam, who used to put a firework up his arse at the end of his act and on occasion burned himself quite badly. But it looked amazing because he\u2019s got such a demonic elfin face, with his big hair and loads of eyeliner.

It used to be fags. I used to so love smoking. So much. More than anything. It looks visually like it\u2019s food I really love but actually it was always smoking.

One of my mum\u2019s favourite sayings is: \u201cNo good deed ever goes unpunished.\u201d And it\u2019s so true in a way. I once borrowed a friend\u2019s car and took a load of comics up to Nottingham University for a gig. On the way back, we all decided to stop for breakfast at 3am at Scratchwood services and I went in the wrong car park and a French juggernaut reversed into the car. He broke both of the headlights and punctured the radiator and then when he heard the crunch, we all had to do O-level French: there was Bob Mills, Mandy Knight and Johnny Immaterial all going: \u201cBon soir.\u201d</p> <p>That did put me off giving people lifts for a bit, but I never asked people for petrol money and so he doesn\u2019t owe me a thing.

So lots of reasons.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"39d3f71561ac6eea09b789db5223f559b74b692f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/39d3f71561ac6eea09b789db5223f559b74b692f/706_452_2336_2920/800.jpg\" alt=\"Kerry Hudson\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>After a hard day I favour cake and swearing, but what\u2019s your recipe for days when life kicks you in the arse?</strong><br /><strong>Kerry Hudson, author</strong><br />After a hard day, what really sorts me out is watching some sort of hideous Scandinavian thriller with subtitles, people murdering each other in a really horrible way. <em>The Killing</em>, <em>The Bridge</em>, I love all those.</p> <p><strong>Is being married better than being single?</strong><br /><strong>Shermaine Williams, by email</strong><br />Oh, I don\u2019t think you can possibly say that. For me personally or for everyone? Being in an awful marriage is so much worse than being single, so it\u2019s very dependent on who you are married to really. And, just to be annoying, research shows that being married is better for the man and worse for the woman \u2013 surprise surprise. But personally I like being married because it takes the effort out of life. You don\u2019t have to look any more, and you don\u2019t have to bother any more. That\u2019s my motto: don\u2019t look any more and don\u2019t bother!</p> <p><strong>How different is your on-stage persona from how you would be at a dinner party, say?</strong><br /><strong>Bo Palle Hansen, by email</strong><br />It\u2019s very different. Along with a lot of other people, my on-stage persona is quite contrived in a way. I say outrageous things to get a reaction from people. When I started, because I had a very heavily uncompromising feminist set, it was really designed to wind people up \u2013 not just men, women as well. And to shock people, because I think in those days women [comedians] were few and far between and in a way, in order to get your voice heard, you had to say something outrageous. But no, I\u2019m totally different from how I am on stage. I don\u2019t really go to dinner parties, but when I\u2019m socialising, thankfully I socialise with people who don\u2019t expect me to do jokes all the time. That would be so wearing \u2013 for them as well as me.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/mar/18/jo-brands-hell-of-a-walk-review-lovely-inspiring\">Jo Brand\u2019s Hell of a Walk review \u2013 oddly lovely and a little bit inspiring</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>How horrible was the Hell of a Walk when you were doing it and how good did you feel afterwards? Mad respect by the way.</strong><br /><strong>Veryumble, posted online</strong><br />Thank you very much. I\u2019d say the first two hours of each day were great and then it started to very gradually all dribble away positivity-wise after that. By the time it got dark, we\u2019d have been walking for about eight or nine hours, so it started to hurt a bit and also Greg my trainer, he\u2019s a terrible liar, because he always used to say it was much nearer than it actually was. I think that\u2019s some sort of psychological ploy to make you keep going, but it really got on my nerves.</p> <p>When I\u2019d actually finished it, you\u2019re taken up so much with what\u2019s going on around you, a bit of your brain just shuts off. So I didn\u2019t even think about it for a couple of days. Then a week later, I thought it was all some horrible nightmare that hadn\u2019t really happened.</p> <p><strong>Cake \u2013 Greggs, Patisserie Valerie, homemade, baked-off, or Mary Berried?</strong><br /><strong>onalongsabbatical, posted online</strong><br />Crikey, I think homemade actually \u2013 not me, my daughters are quite good at cooking. But I don\u2019t actually like cakes very much. I prefer savoury stuff. I know I started the cake thing, but the reason I started that was because, do you remember that Naughty But Nice cake campaign on telly? That was always people that looked like they\u2019d never been near a cake in their life. And I kind of felt it\u2019s time for people to say that the realistic end of eating a lot of cakes is that you look like me. But you\u2019re not really allowed to say that, because it\u2019s a shameful thing. Anyway, I\u2019d rather have something savoury to be honest.</p> <p><strong>What do you miss most from your time as a psychiatric nurse? And what did you learn from it?</strong><br /><strong>buxtond, posted online</strong><br />What I miss most is working with a group of people in a very close way. It was an emergency clinic and there were a lot of situations that were quite dangerous unless they were managed properly. So having a group of us who all knew what we were doing and being able to manage quite hair-raising situations is very satisfying really. We wouldn\u2019t always sort things out, but the vast majority of the time we could at least do something. So from that point of view, you can\u2019t follow every audience member home and go, \u201cDid you have a laugh? Do you feel better?\u201d</p> <p>What I learned from it is that in many ways I was very naive. We are encouraged by the tabloid side of the press to think people with mental-health issues are nothing like us. And I learned that\u2019s simply isn\u2019t the way things are when I found out my dad had a quite a serious depression, and that wasn\u2019t until after I\u2019d actually become a nurse really. So you think, \u201cWell, that\u2019s in my family and it\u2019s in everyone\u2019s family in some way or another. Everyone is affected by it.\u201d</p> <p><strong>God forbid that the grim reaper should get his hands on you this year, but what sketch or comedic creation would you most like to be remembered for?</strong><br /><strong>Angela Young, posted online</strong><br />I\u2019d quite like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABTYH5RIjWU\">my Britney Spears</a> on <em>Let\u2019s Dance for Comic Relief</em> to be remembered. Not really. Although the headmistress of my daughter\u2019s school did say to me: \u201cCan you come to school dressed up as Britney Spears?\u201d My reply had the word \u201cfuck\u201d in it.</p> <p>Well, I suppose it would be Kim Wilde, but also years ago, when I did the two series of <em>Through the Cakehole</em> for Channel 4, we did a police spoof called Drudge Squad. It was about two policewomen who were dealing with families and annoying husbands, so you\u2019d have lots of going to the scene of the crime with a baby and the babyseat is in the back. I liked that character, and would have liked to do more with her, but there\u2019s always time. Or not, if the grim reaper\u2019s coming. We\u2019ll just see if I\u2019m dead or not. If I\u2019m not dead I\u2019ll do it.</p> <p>But if I do die before the end of the year, I hope you caused that by asking me about it.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABTYH5RIjWU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ABTYH5RIjWU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ABTYH5RIjWU\">Jo Brand\u2019s appearance on Let\u2019s Dance for Comic Relief.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>Should junior doctors go on strike?</strong><br /><strong>Courage8591, posted online</strong><br />Yeah, I believe that anyone should go on strike, and I think they do have a very good case. I\u2019m not sure about the relationship between striking and emergency cover, I\u2019d like to see at least a skeletal emergency cover, that\u2019s quite important. But for them to go on strike they must be so desperate that to some extent it justifies that strike. And I\u2019ll tell Jeremy Hunt that while I\u2019m saving his life.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019ve been arguing for years that you should be the next Doctor in Doctor Who. Please say you\u2019re up for it.</strong><br /><strong>tonymcgowan, posted online</strong><br />Is that my mum? I\u2019d like to see a female Doctor but not me, there\u2019s lots of really great women that could do it. I always thought Miriam Margolyes would make a great Doctor, because she is so out of control and I love her for it. I know that I did get voted top choice for <em>Doctor Who</em> on Smooth FM about seven years ago and that made my week, that did. I was very flattered. But I did think, \u201cPeople listening to soft jazz want me to be Doctor Who, why would that be?\u201d It\u2019s so weird. But you couldn\u2019t turn it down, it would be brilliant.</p> <p><strong>OK, boring. What way, if any, will you vote in the EU referendum?</strong><br /><strong>simonsaint, posted online</strong><br />To stay in, definitely. I mean, even if you\u2019re like a really shallow person who doesn\u2019t know what all the issues are, just look at the ones who are voting to leave and the ones that are voting to stay in. Do it on that basis and you\u2019ll find a way to vote stay.</p> <p><strong>What was the last good book you read?</strong><br /><strong>MrFusiello, posted online</strong><br />It\u2019s called <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/john-mcpake-and-the-sea-beggars.html\"><em>John McPake and the Sea Beggars </em></a>by Stuart Campbell. It\u2019s a really odd book that moves between a hostel for people with mental-health problems in Edinburgh in the current day and the contents of a Breughel painting. The main character is schizophrenic and he has delusional ideas about this particular painting called <em>The Hunters in the Snow</em>. That makes me sound rather more intelligent than I am but it\u2019s written by an English teacher and it\u2019s very accurate historically. It\u2019s just a fantastic read and if anyone wants to know what it\u2019s like to be schizophrenic and to hear voices, it\u2019s a very readable and very funny book.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f7a9f3dfc2587fd40e3ccf7b109225179f2bef72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f7a9f3dfc2587fd40e3ccf7b109225179f2bef72/0_333_3952_2371/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brand with Omid Djalili in Going Forward.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brand with Omid Djalili in Going Forward.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brian Ritchie/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Who was the last new British comedian who really made you laugh?</strong><br /><strong>flangespaniel, posted online</strong><br />I think it was Tom Davis who is actually in <em>Going Forward</em>. I\u2019ve never seen him live, but I loved <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/may/06/murder-in-successville-filipa-jodelka\"><em>Murder in Successville</em></a>: I just thought he was such a naturally funny person and just a very endearing character and I really liked the bigness of him. He must be about 6ft 6in and he looks like a big comedy yeti. I also liked the disrespect really that he has for people. That\u2019s a very important element of modern life, which should be attended to as often as possible.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the best thing about getting older?</strong><br /><strong>Peachesandcreem, posted online</strong><br />Nothing. There isn\u2019t anything good about getting older. I should say something positive. Well, one thing \u2013 but it\u2019s not getting older, like 60, 70, it\u2019s like 30, 40 \u2013 is that actually you care less what people think of you. When you\u2019re a teenager, someone looking at you makes you blush and feel embarrassed, but as you get older you have the facility to be a bit more gobby without caring quite so much what the reaction is. And that\u2019s a good thing.</p> <p><strong>How can we improve the lives of people afflicted by mental illness?</strong><br /><strong>Judith Wright, via email</strong><br />Well, I think we already are, to be honest. There are very strong lobbies on Twitter and other social media that always spring up whenever someone makes a negative or insulting comment about mental health. And it\u2019s really great when people that we all see on telly who are suffering from some sort of mental health issue speak up about it.</p> <p>I did a Mind conference recently and there was a woman \u2013 Frankie Bridge, who was in the Saturdays \u2013 who\u2019d had postnatal depression. She\u2019s young, gorgeous and looks totally in control of her life and yet she had terrible postnatal depression, which she\u2019s talked about. People really listen when someone like her is prepared to admit it \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/paul-merton\">Paul Merton</a> speaking about his episode when he was in hospital; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/jun/05/stephen-fry-attempted-suicide-bipolar\">Stephen Fry</a> as well \u2013 because it defuses the whole mystery around it. And conversely it makes celebs seem like real people rather than the Greek gods that some people think they are.</p> <p><strong>You were a nurse and now a successful comedian. Is there another career path you would liked to have taken?</strong><br /><strong>Gerry Blake, via email</strong><br />I\u2019d have liked to be prime minister. It\u2019s too late now, thank God, so I can just say that and it doesn\u2019t mean anything any more. I did think about politics for a long time but what really put me off is that whole on-message thing: you can\u2019t actually be your own person any more; you have to say what you\u2019re told. It\u2019s sad when you lose the mavericks, the Tony Benns, the Mo Mowlams, all those sorts of people are disappearing to be replaced by besuited men and women who are slightly interchangeable. Once you are all behaving yourself\u2026 Not behaving yourself is a vastly underrated thing to do, particularly if you\u2019re a politician.</p> <p><em>Going Forward is on BBC4 on 19 May at 10pm</em></p>",

Now, in this only marginally less stripped-down follow-up, Saulnier takes a box cutter to the conventions of the siege/slasher genre, creating a gruelling, gutsy suspense ride that swaps the marooned vistas of <em>Blue Ruin</em> for the claustrophobic confines of a rural roadhouse in which our punk rocker antiheroes are trapped.</p> <p>The set-up finds hardcore Arlington band the Ain\u2019t Rights losing their shirts on an end-of-road tour from which they can\u2019t even afford the petrol home. Tempted by a matinee payday playing to the backwater boots and braces crowd in a remote Oregon dive, the band head off to a woodland retreat with creepy overtones of <em>Friday the 13th</em>\u2019s leafy Camp Blood. Here, they antagonise the skinhead crowd with a rousing rendition of the Dead Kennedys\u2019 classic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJUuxouy1Fg\" title=\"\">Nazi Punks Fuck Off</a> before retreating to the backstage area where they stumble upon a crime scene. Before you can say <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091860/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\" title=\"\"><em>River\u2019s Edge</em></a> meets <em>Assault on Precinct 13</em> (via <em>Deliverance</em>), dressing room doors are locked, unregistered firearms are drawn, red-laced troops are assembled, and the management are on the scene in the shape of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/patrick-stewart\" title=\"\">Patrick Stewart</a>\u2019s sinisterly silver-tongued Darcy Banker.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Green Room uses its extremist tropes to unpick the more insidious mainstream rhetoric of the American right</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou\u2019re trapped \u2013 that\u2019s not a threat, just a fact,\u201d Darcy tells the terrified musicians, who have barricaded themselves into the titular enclosure, assured that this \u201cwon\u2019t end well\u201d. And it won\u2019t. In the desperate hours ahead, the air of carefully constructed tension will be sporadically broken by sudden, random acts of violence, the visceral quality of which is heightened by the almost accidental nature of its eruption. Saulnier may cite the analogue hues of 80s films such as <em>Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior</em> and <em>RoboCop</em> as \u201ctexturally\u201d influential (\u201cThey\u2019re so brutal and so blunt,\u201d he recently enthused to <em>Sight &amp; Sound</em> magazine), but there\u2019s also a debt to the early works of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/aug/31/wes-craven\" title=\"\">Wes Craven</a>, a film-maker who believed in the morality of explicitness when it came to depicting on-screen violence. One scene in particular (which nods directly to Craven\u2019s <em>The</em> <em>Last House on the Left</em>) drew gasps from the audience \u2013 myself included.</p> <p>I was reminded, too, of my <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/06/ben-wheatley-interview-high-rise-jg-ballard-mark-kermode\" title=\"\">recent conversation with <em>Kill List</em> director Ben Wheatley</a> in which he talked about becoming numb to the \u201cscale of destruction\u201d of modern cinema, and argued that the idea of \u201cbeing hit by rocks or banging your fingers on things\u201d provoked a far greater audience reaction. Saulnier understands this economy of scale well: just as <em>Blue Ruin</em> generated a palpable sense of alarm at the physical results of violence, so <em>Green Room</em>\u2019s gore cuts deep because it is so specific, so clinical, so <em>personal</em>. No wonder the screamed refrain of the Ain\u2019t Rights tearing through What Have I Become? carries such resonance.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpJeAw2PvRc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VpJeAw2PvRc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpJeAw2PvRc\">Watch the trailer for Green Room.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>There is a political dimension to the genre thrills too. While Kevin Smith\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/oct/02/red-state-kevin-smith-review\" title=\"\"><em>Red State</em></a> retooled the cliches of so-called \u201ctorture porn\u201d to take pointed pot shots at rabble-rousing fundamentalists, so <em>Green Room</em> uses its extremist tropes (supremacist symbols, Confederate flags and \u201cwhite pride worldwide\u201d stickers) to unpick the more insidious mainstream rhetoric of\u00a0the American right. From the outside, the battle lines between urban punks and backwoods neo-Nazis may seem clear enough, but Saulnier is more interested in the way that Stewart\u2019s Darcy provokes and manipulates his exploitable thugs for his own cynical ends, insisting that \u201cthis is a movement, not a party\u201d when it is nothing of the sort. Smartly cast, Stewart brings an almost Shakespearean edge to the drama, delivering lines such as \u201call is for nought\u201d in the manner of a theatrical king surveying the devastation of a five-act tragedy.</p> <p>As always with Saulnier, whose first feature, <em>Murder Party</em>, was dubbed \u201c<em>The Breakfast Club</em> with chainsaws\u201d, there is also a strong seam of black humour running throughout <em>Green Room</em>. \u201cWe can\u2019t take it so seriously,\u201d says Anton Yelchin\u2019s bloodied bassist Pat when the situation couldn\u2019t look any worse, suggesting, instead, that they treat it more \u201clike paintball\u201d. As for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/03/imogen-poots-filth-james-mcavoy-irvine-welsh\" title=\"\">Imogen Poots</a>\u2019s knife-wielding Amber, she reacts to a stupefying escalation of hostilities by declaring simply: \u201cI\u2019m hungry.\u201d A recurrent joke about everyone\u2019s desert island disc choices throws up some entertainingly\u00a0embarrassingly revelations amid the escalating chaos, neatly undercutting the earnest name-checking (\u201cEr, Misfits, Damned, Candlebox\u2026 \u201d) of an earlier band interview. The brilliant Macon Blair provides a much-needed touch of pathos as Darcy\u2019s conflicted underling Gabe, quietly stealing the show with his haunted gaze and oddly vulnerable air, while Brooke and Will Blair\u2019s pulsing electronic ambient soundscapes offer arresting counterpoint to the movie\u2019s thrashy wall-of-death mosh pit.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-15T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Many years ago, the political theorist Steven Lukes published a seminal book \u2013 <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/power-15.html\" title=\"\"><em>Power: A Radical View</em></a>. In it, he argued that power essentially comes in three varieties: the ability to compel people to do what they don\u2019t want to do; the capability to stop them doing what they want to do; and the power to shape the way they think. This last is the kind of power exercised by our mass media. They can shape the public (and therefore the political) agenda by choosing the news that people read, hear or watch; and they can shape the ways in which that news is presented. Lukes\u2019s \u201cthird dimension\u201d of power is what\u2019s wielded in this country by outlets like Radio 4\u2019s <em>Today</em> programme, the <em>Sun</em> and the <em>Daily Mail</em>. And this power is real: it\u2019s why all British governments in recent years have been so frightened of the <em>Mail</em>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Once the news content disappears into Facebook's algorithmic maw, it becomes mere fodder for its calculations</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But as our media ecosystem has changed under the impact of the internet, new power brokers have appeared. For a long time, Google was the 800lb gorilla in this domain, because its dominance of search determined what people could find in the unimaginable wastelands of cyberspace. And search could be \u2013 and was \u2013 personalised, because Google\u2019s algorithms could figure out what each user was most likely to be interested in, and therefore what kinds of information would be most relevant for her or him. So, imperceptibly, but inexorably over time, we have come to live in what Eli Pariser christened a \u201c<a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/filter-bubble.html\" title=\"\">filter bubble</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Before the internet, our problem with information was its scarcity. Now our problem is unmanageable abundance. So now the scarce resources are attention and time, over which a vicious war has broken out between traditional media and the internet-based upstarts. \u201cConsumption\u201d (horrible word, but widely used) of old media is going down, while online media are grabbing more and more of people\u2019s attention and time.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"839e395bf73f1c5a151ca2292c9bb8f21435523a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/839e395bf73f1c5a151ca2292c9bb8f21435523a/0_0_1326_1324/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by James Melaugh.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"998\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by James Melaugh.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The biggest thieves at the moment are YouTube and Facebook. YouTube has <a href=\"http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/21-amazingly-interesting-youtube-facts-2016/\" title=\"\">a billion users</a>, half of whom access it via mobile devices. The average time spent on the site is 40 minutes. Facebook now claims to have 1.65 billion monthly active users, who spend on average 50 minutes a day on its services. So if Google is an 800lb gorilla, Facebook is a megaton King\u00a0Kong.</p> <p>Competition for attention and time is a zero-sum game that traditional media are losing. In desperation, they are trying both to appease Facebook and to harness its hold on people\u2019s attention. Many publishers, for example, have signed up to the company\u2019s Instant Articles system, which enables their content to load quickly on users\u2019 mobile devices. But what this means \u2013 as Emily Bell pointed out in her recent <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LLTIAkJsCQ4\" title=\"\">Humanitas lecture at Cambridge</a> \u2013 is that newspapers have effectively out-sourced distribution of their content to the internet giant.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/11/facebook-censorship-news-feed-trending-topics\">Angry about Facebook censorship? Wait until you hear about the news feed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In doing so, they have entered into a truly Faustian bargain. Because while publishers can without difficulty ship their stuff to Instant Articles, they cannot control which ones Facebook users <em>actually get to see</em>. This is because users\u2019 news feeds are determined by Facebook\u2019s machine-learning algorithms that try to guess what each user would like to see (and what might dispose them to click on an advertisement). So once the content disappears into Facebook\u2019s algorithmic maw it becomes mere fodder for its\u00a0calculations.</p> <p>This means that Facebook now wields Lukes\u2019s third kind of power \u2013 the kind wielded by the <em>Daily Mail</em>\u2019s Paul Dacre and the editor of the <em>Today</em> programme. But when you ask \u2013 as <a href=\"http://georgebrock.net/andy-mitchell-and-facebooks-weird-state-of-denial-about-news/\" title=\"\">Professor George Brock</a> memorably did \u2013 whether Mark Zuckerberg and his satraps understand that they have acquired <em>editorial</em> responsibilities, they look blank. Facebook is not a publisher, they explain, merely a \u201cplatform\u201d. And, besides, no humans are involved in curating users\u2019 news feeds: it\u2019s all done by algorithms and is therefore neutral. In other words: nothing to see here; move on.</p> <p>This is baloney, at least in relation to the kinds of algorithms we\u2019re talking about here (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/31/google-alphago-deepmind-artificial-intelligence-intuititive\" title=\"\">neural networks are a different story</a>). Any algorithm that has to make choices has criteria that are specified by its designers. And those criteria are expressions of human values. Engineers may think they are \u201cneutral\u201d, but long experience has shown us they are babes in the woods of politics, economics and ideology. If Facebook wants to become a conduit for news, then it has to recognise that it has moved into a different sphere and has acquired new responsibilities. And the publishers who suck up to it should remember Churchill\u2019s definition of appeasement: it\u2019s the process of being nice to a crocodile in the hope that it will eat you last.</p>",

      "body": "<p>When it was published 20 years ago, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/junk.html\">Junk</a> was a long shot. Teenage fiction at the time was really aimed at 11 and 12-year-olds. Maybe the occasional 14-year-old might read down to it, but no one seriously thought that 15 or 16-year-olds would read it. I remember some librarians saying that they thought it was a great book, but that it\u2019s likely fate was to languish on the shelves.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0360cc71ec7d292edf1ddeaaff50beddf48b3060\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0360cc71ec7d292edf1ddeaaff50beddf48b3060/0_0_1539_2355/654.jpg\" alt=\"Junk\" width=\"654\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Why a book about drugs? I come from one of the first generations when recreational drugs were widely available, and of course, many of us at school were very curious. There was no useful information about that world \u2013 the authorities were all saying how awful and deadly drugs were, but the Beatles and Stones seemed to be having a fairly good time. By the time I was in my 20s, drugs culture was full blown, but ignorance, officially sanctioned in law, was still the order of the day. </p> <p>I was living in Bristol, in the middle of that heady, inner-city mix of sex, drugs, rock n\u2019 roll and politics. Such a seductive, exciting and dangerous world! \u2013 just the place for a story to be told. So when my publisher, Klaus Flugge of Andersen Press, suggested a book on drugs, it was to that period that my mind inevitably went. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/audio/2016/may/13/raziel-reid-when-everything-feels-like-the-movies\">Raziel Reid: I'm just naturally shocking  \u2013 children's books podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Far too old for 11-year-olds of course! But\u2026 what wouldn\u2019t I have given for a book set in that world when I was 15 or 16? A book not simply about the drugs themselves, but about the culture\u2026 the people, the ideas, the relationships, with all its highs and lows, all its excitements, glories and tragedies. </p> <p>Why not? Fiction for young people had been moving that way for years\u2026 getting older, getting more serious, testing the waters. I was already known for hard hitting, honest books. Klaus, bless him, was up for it\u2026</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It used to be Alice in Wonderland and Fluffy Bunny \u2013 now suddenly it\u2019s junkie whores rolling round in the gutter</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s what Junk was \u2013 the book I wished I\u2019d had when I was 15-years-old.</p> <p>It came as a surprise to me when it did so well. There was a huge amount of fuss when it won first the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/guardianchildrensfictionprize\">Guardian children\u2019s fiction award</a>, and then the Carnegie medal \u2013 both originally awards for younger children\u2019s fiction. People on the inside knew that change was going in teenage fiction, but the press was taken completely by surprise. This is fiction for children? Help! What\u2019s going on? Where had Ratty, Toad and Moley gone? It used to be Alice in Wonderland and Fluffy Bunny \u2013 now suddenly it\u2019s junkie whores rolling round in the gutter. What happened to innocence? Above all, why are we subjecting our children to this sort of thing?</p> <p>I had a busy time explaining that the book was not aimed at children, but <em>teenagers</em> \u2013 people in possession of all their hormones and probably having a full sex life by then, even if it was usually on their own. And already thinking about, or maybe even already experimenting with, intoxicants of one form or another. Surely it was better to arrive in that world forearmed with a little knowledge, than to step out as a total naive onto the streets, as I did, ready to swallow the first bunch of lies told, either by an unscrupulous black marketeer, or by an equally unscrupulous know-all in authority, ready to tell them any amount of tosh to keep them in line?<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/sep/08/teenage-drugs-books-katie-everson\">Why I've written a book for teenagers about taking drugs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These days, of course, Junk wouldn\u2019t attract anything like so much attention. Teenage fiction, or YA as it\u2019s now known, is big business. Looking back, it seems astonishing that there was no real publishing industry aimed at high school students at all in this country, or indeed most of Europe, and that a book aimed at that age group should attract so much outrage only twenty years ago, just for trying to engage with them on an authentic level.</p> <p>I\u2019m very proud of it. I\u2019ve lost count of the number of people who\u2019ve contacted me to tell them how important Junk has been to them \u2013 some because it helped them understand their own addiction, or the addiction of friends and family; some because it\u2019s helped them navigate their way through that perilous world; some because it struck notes deep inside; and others simply because they loved reading it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/dec/07/david-almond-a-song-for-ella-grey-censorship-childrens-books\">If the real world isn't censored \u2013 why should fiction be?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Junk is often called a game changer, but what difference did it really make in the long run? Well, who can tell? There are some modern European countries without much challenging YA literature \u2013 Italy is one, I\u2019m told \u2013 so it\u2019s never a forgone conclusion. But things were moving in that direction here, albeit slowly, and I suspect that the UK was always going to be a YA stronghold. It did perhaps kick-start the genre, though. Publishers had been trying for years to court the teenage market, but the general opinion was still that, \u201cThey don\u2019t read\u201d. Junk sold by the barrelful and showed that it wasn\u2019t that they didn\u2019t want to read \u2013 it was just that no one was publishing the right kind of material. The book attracted writers to the genre as well \u2013 any number of people have told me that they were attracted to writing YA because they loved Junk, and because it showed them just how far you could go. </p> <p>Most of all though, the book opened up a debate about teenage life and teenage literature, about whether young people had the right to read honest, authentic books; about what was suitable, what was not, and whether or not our young people should be protected from the harsh realities of life, or empowered to cope with them.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/sep/02/rape-culture-teen-book-louise-oneill\">Why I explore rape culture in my new book for teens</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I\u2019m very pleased that the empowerers won the day, hands down. </p> <p>It\u2019s a great thing to get in early. Junk marks not so much a line in the sand, but the rubbing out of a line. Since then, the rules have changed utterly, and I\u2019m just delighted to have been involved in helping kick down a few doors.</p> <p><strong>You can buy<a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/junk.html\"> Junk from the Guardian bookshop</a>.</strong></p> <h2>Live chat with authors including Louise O\u2019Neill and Melvin Burgess #Gdnteentaboo</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2016/may/10/teenagers-controversial-issues-fiction-chris-vick\">Why we shouldn't protect teenagers from controversial issues in fiction</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Discuss writing about sex, drugs and pushing boundaries (and they are still being pushed) in teen/Ya with a bunch of controversial authors including Melvin Burgess live on Twitter using<strong> #Gdnteentaboo</strong>!

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-15T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>They say that it pays to have friends in high places. As they battle to keep Britain in the EU, David Cameron and George Osborne have been spoilt for ammunition over recent days. Dire warnings on the consequences of Brexit came through thick and fast and, naturally, the Remain camp seized on every one.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/12/bank-of-england-keeps-interest-rates-on-hold-as-brexit-fears-bite\" title=\"\">The Bank of England raised the threat of recession</a> and soaring inflation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/13/imf-warns-stock-market-crash-house-price-fall-eu-referendum-brexit\" title=\"\">the International Monetary Fund warned of tumbling house prices</a> and Gordon Brown formed a rare alliance with Cameron over the prospect of the third world war.</p> <p>\u201cFor a thousand years, nations and tribes of Europe were fighting to the finish murdering and maiming each other. There is no century except this one where Europe has been at peace,\u201d Cameron\u2019s predecessor at No 10 said in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/11/gordon-brown-enters-eu-debate-appeal-to-labour-voters\" title=\"\">his Remain appeal to Labour voters</a>.</p> <p>It looks like Project Fear has peaked. But with more than a month to go until the EU referendum, the risk for Remain campaigners is that it has peaked too soon. It\u2019s hard to see how supporters of staying in the EU will fill the next five weeks.</p> <p>For the Leave camp, on the other hand, the week of Brexit doom and gloom was not necessarily as damaging as headlines might suggest.</p> <p>When Brexit campaigners say that people like IMF head Christine Lagarde and Bank of England governor Mark Carney should butt out of UK politics, they will doubtless strike a chord with many voters. Furthermore, there are plenty of weak spots to target in the Remain camp\u2019s Brexit warnings.</p> <p>Firstly, no one truly knows what a UK economy outside the EU would look like. The Bank of England made it clear that in the direct aftermath of a Leave vote it would expect to face opposing forces of slowing activity and rising inflation. The Bank was less clear about how pronounced those forces would be. Whether they prompted a rate cut or rise would depend on their magnitude.</p> <p>In other words, Threadneedle Street\u2019s policymakers have wisely stopped well short of promising a particular emergency plan because they, like the rest of us, cannot predict the post-Brexit economy with any real degree of certainty.</p> <p>As for longer-term estimates on how the UK would fare outside the EU, they rely on so many assumptions that they have quickly been dismissed as fantasy economics.</p> <p>Secondly, what the economists are predicting in the medium term is by no means bad news for everyone. Osborne would have voters believe that Brexit presents a \u201close-lose\u201d situation, but that will ring hollow for some businesses and individuals.</p> <p>If the IMF is right and Brexit hammers house prices, younger people desperate to get on the housing ladder may finally have their chance. If the pound tumbles, exporters who want to be more competitive could get a boost. Of course those businesses would face other challenges as the UK seeks new trade deals. There is also a risk investment into the country could slump. But looking further ahead, who knows what partnerships Britain might form.</p> <p>Finally, these doomsday scenarios have all failed answer one very important question. What if the UK votes to stay in the EU and the bloc disintegrates anyway? It is not so hard to picture. The spectre of economic crisis continues to hang over the continent. The euro was always a massively ambitious project and has courted collapse before. Now with renewed tensions in and around debt-stricken Greece, fears have returned of a eurozone break-up. With those fears come grave concerns for the whole EU.</p> <p>It\u2019s not just in austerity-hit Greece that people are angry. Across Europe, nationalism is gaining ground as disenchanted voters turn inwards. So Osborne and Cameron had better hope that no fresh eurozone tensions flare up as the UK\u2019s referendum day approaches.</p> <p>In the meantime it\u2019s hard to see what more they can pull out of the hat. But maybe they won\u2019t have to. The Remain camp knows Britons vote with their wallets. So from now on, expect a campaign stuck on repeat. Just as he did last week, Osborne and his allies will tell voters over and over: \u201cIf we vote to leave, British families will be poorer.\u201d</p> <h2>Banking crisis may have been due to the sin of pride, not crime</h2> <p>Hubris, according to Andrew Bailey, deputy governor of the Bank of England, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/09/city-regulation-over-confidence-risk-new-fca-chief-andrew-bailey-banking-culture\" title=\"\">needs to be added to the list of risks banks face</a>. He was referring to the overweening confidence that can afflict top bankers, driven by their pursuit of profits and bonuses. Bailey did not name a particular bank, but he could easily have been referring to RBS when he described management teams \u201cso convinced of their rightness that they hurtle for the cliff without questioning the direction of travel\u201d.</p> <p>That is not to say that Sir Fred Goodwin \u2013 he still had his knighthood at the time \u2013 did not face some resistance. One analyst accused Goodwin of being a megalomaniac for his penchant for doing deals \u2013 a turn of phrase that had been forgotten by the time he was chasing the ABN Amro takeover that eventually drove RBS off the cliff. The recriminations are continuing even now, almost eight years after \u00a345bn of taxpayer funds were used to buy RBS shares to cushion its fall.</p> <p>Last week, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/12/rbs-no-evidence-of-criminal-behaviour-rule-prosecutors\" title=\"\">said that after scouring 160,000 documents</a> it had not found any grounds to file criminal charges against RBS or its former management. The Scottish prosecution service had focused on the \u00a312bn cash call that Goodwin pulled off in June 2008, just four months before RBS collapsed.</p> <p>This leads to the conclusion that it was not criminal behaviour that lay at the root of RBS\u2019s demise but, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global/2011/dec/12/royal-bank-of-scotland-fsa-report\" title=\"\">the official report into its collapse in 2011</a> put it, poor decision-making. As painful and irritating as it may be for a public stuck with a 73% stake in a loss-making bank to accept, poor decision-making is not a crime.</p> <p>Attention will soon start to turn to HBOS. City regulators<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/jan/28/fca-orders-new-inquiry-into-hbos-chiefs\" title=\"\"> are looking at whether there are grounds to bar those who were at the helm when it collapsed</a> from working in the City. Many former HBOS directors have already defended themselves by saying the financial crisis could not be predicted. The clock is ticking on whether hubris \u2013 or something punishable \u2013 is to blame.</p> <h2>Now even Russia wants to build us a nuclear plant</h2> <p>The Russians are coming\u2026 to a nuclear power station near you. Well, they would be if the decision were up to them: state-owned operator Rosatom is keen to build reactors in Britain.</p> <p>You might have thought that with a Cold War of words raging between Vladimir Putin and the west over Ukraine, the very idea of a UK Russian reactors was fanciful. The Department of Energy and Climate Change was certainly keen to shoot down Russian hopes, just as it had been to quash speculation last week that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/12/china-may-take-over-hinkley-point-nuclear-project-claims-lord-howell\" title=\"\">Chinese have a \u201cPlan B\u201d to build Hinkley Point</a> if EDF is forced to bow out.</p> <p>But nothing seems fanciful these days, given that the only party without a Plan B if EDF goes into meltdown in Somerset is the British government.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Born in Sheffield to Sri Lankan Tamil parents in 1970, Indhu Rubasingham began her career as a director, assisting Mike Leigh at the Theatre Royal Stratford East. In 2012 she became the first non-white woman to run a major London theatre when she took over the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/tricycle-theatre\">Tricycle</a> in Kilburn. Successes during her tenure include Lolita Chakrabarti\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/oct/21/red-velvet-all-fall-desire-elms\"><em>Red Velvet</em></a>, Moira Buffini\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/08/moira-buffini-margaret-thatcher-tricycle-theatre\"><em>Handbagged</em></a> and Florian Zeller\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/oct/26/the-father-review-kenneth-cranham-florian-zeller-ustinov-theatre-royal-bath\"><em>The Father</em></a>. In 2014, the UK Jewish film festival quit the Tricycle in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/09/tricycle-theatre-uk-jewish-film-festival-debate\">a dispute</a> over funding from the Israeli embassy, for which Rubasingham and the theatre\u2019s board later apologised. This month she directs <a href=\"http://www.tricycle.co.uk/current-programme-pages/theatre/theatre-programme-main/the-invisible-hand/\">The Invisible Hand</a> by the Pulitzer prize-winning author <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/may/07/pulitzer-playwright-ayad-akhtar\">Ayad Akhtar</a>, prior to the Tricycle\u2019s closure for a <a href=\"http://www.tricycle.co.uk/21035/our-5-5-million-capital-development-project/\">\u00a35.5m capital development project</a>.</p> <p><strong>How would you sum up The Invisible Hand? </strong><br />It\u2019s a political thriller about a white American banker who is kidnapped in Pakistan and in order to raise a ransom has to play the markets. So it\u2019s a play that surprises \u2013 you think it\u2019s about religious extremism, terrorism, a captive play, but then it becomes about global markets. Part of the Tricycle mission statement is the unheard voice being part of the mainstream, and this shows the Muslim Pakistani world in a different light. And it\u2019s a good story.</p> <p><strong>What will the Tricycle\u2019s subsequent rebuilding programme achieve? </strong><br />The main focus is the auditorium. The building [a former <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foresters_Friendly_Society\">Foresters</a> hall] hasn\u2019t been touched since the mid-80s, so it\u2019s about making it more accessible, increasing the number of seats from 235 to 290, making it more flexible, with better sightlines. The red scaffolding [supporting the balcony seats] is going \u2013 the end of an era. We\u2019ll have better toilets, better circulation, and a cafe frontage on the high street in the former Foresters office.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksEXdi-9XjU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ksEXdi-9XjU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ksEXdi-9XjU\">Watch a trailer for The Invisible Hand.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>Do all theatres need a swanky cafe now? </strong><br />No, they don\u2019t. Here it\u2019s about sustainability, income generation and about being a much more holistic place where people can meet. On Kilburn High Road the other places that attract large groups of people are the churches. A space for locals \u2013 that\u2019s what theatres can be about.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If people are still talking about my gender and ethnicity rather than the work, I haven\u2019t done a good job</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>You\u2019ve been here for four years now. How\u2019s it going? </strong><br />Really good. We\u2019ve transferred three or four shows to the West End: <em>Handbagged</em>, <em>The Father</em>, and <em>Red Velvet</em> have just been part of the <a href=\"http://www.branaghtheatre.com/\">Ken Branagh season</a> at the Garrick. There is a future for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/may/31/the-mother-review-ustinov-studio-theatre-royal-bath-gina-mckee\"><em>The Mother</em></a> [Zeller\u2019s companion piece to <em>The Father</em>]. The work and the creative learning is going strong. What\u2019s really sad but brilliant is our programme <a href=\"http://www.tricycle.co.uk/home/about-the-tricycle-pages/youth-tab-menu/youth-activities/\">Minding the Gap</a>, where we work with recently arrived asylum seekers and immigrants aged between 12 and 18 \u2013 the number of young people we are working with has increased by 50% in one year. That scheme is the heart of the organisation \u2013 that these kids can feel safe and have access and feel part of the community.</p> <p><strong>Is there less focus on your gender and ethnicity now than when you took over? </strong><br />It\u2019s become less of a thing. It doesn\u2019t matter whether you are a woman, black, green or pink. Of course that is part of your identity, but four years on, if people are still talking about that rather than the work or what the building stands for, you haven\u2019t done a good job.</p> <p><strong>You had a big success in Rufus Norris\u2019s first season at the National with Stephen Adly Guirgis\u2019s </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jun/21/motherfucker-with-the-hat-review-brutally-funny\"><strong><em>The Motherfucker With the Hat</em></strong></a><strong>. Is it important to maintain a freelance strand to your career? </strong><br />It keeps you fresh. You are in a dialogue with your colleagues and it feels like you\u2019re part of a bigger community. I was very proud to be in Rufus\u2019s first season.</p> <p><strong>Has there been any progress in bringing the UK Jewish film festival back to the Tricycle?</strong> <br />We have invited them back.

Are you all sick of it?</strong> <br />Ah no. I don\u2019t think we can believe the journey of <em>Red Velvet</em>: we thought it would be over when we took it to New York, though the play itself would obviously go on and on, but it was fantastic doing it as part of Branagh\u2019s season, and it sat beautifully in the Garrick. We\u2019re not sick of it. But I\u2019ve commissioned Lolita to do another play that we\u2019re hoping to do here at the Tricycle, a contemporary play about mothers and daughters. Adrian won\u2019t be a part of that unless I get him into cross-dressing. He\u2019s done it before [in an all-male <em>As You Like It</em>] but I think actresses would get very upset with me if I did that.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.tricycle.co.uk/current-programme-pages/theatre/theatre-programme-main/the-invisible-hand/\">The Invisible Hand is at the Tricycle theatre, London until 2 July</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>It sounds such a terrible idea. A \u201ccomposed interpretation\u201d of <em>Winterreise</em>, Schubert\u2019s song cycle for voice and piano, in which the beloved masterpiece is crushed into millions of tesserae and stuck together again, for small orchestra, like a haphazard and misshapen mosaic. Add to that a multimedia staging, cool and mechanical yet bursting with eclectic imagery from Chaplin to Berlin cabaret to Samuel Beckett. Schubert\u2019s lonely winter traveller has left any hope of warm Viennese refuge far behind and journeyed into a yet more icy landscape of 20th-century expressionism. In the midst of all this is the tenor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/12/ian-bostridge-zender-schubert-winterreise\">Ian Bostridge</a>, who has been singing Schubert\u2019s music and writing about it for 30 years, from youth to middle age, but never before in this way. Dressed almost ironically in white tie and tails, he cuts a desolate figure, hair slicked down and severely parted, face deadpan pale under the unforgiving spotlight.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/12/ian-bostridge-zender-schubert-winterreise\">Ian Bostridge on Zender's Dark Mirror: Schubert's Winterreise</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/04/netia-jones-alice-in-wonderland-interview\">Netia Jones</a>\u2019s meticulous and fearless staging of Hans Zender\u2019s version of <strong>Winterreise </strong>(1993), in the Barbican theatre with the <a href=\"http://www.brittensinfonia.com/\">Britten Sinfonia</a> conducted by <a href=\"http://www.baldur.info/\">Baldur Br\u00f6nnimann</a>. It could not be done better. As with Zender\u2019s dislocated music, the watchword is restraint. Schubert\u2019s masterpiece can withstand this transformation. Wilhelm M\u00fcller\u2019s poems, which Schubert set, are entrenched in a world of objects: a lover, a linden tree, an inn. From the opening, snow-crunch tapping of bow wood on stringed instrument to the final hurdy-gurdy drone of Der Leiermann (who \u201cwith numb fingers, turns the handle as best he can\u201d), Zender\u2019s version grips and chills.</p> <p>Jones and Bostridge have collaborated on Britten\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/15/curlew-river-britten-review\"><em>Curlew River</em></a>. She pushes her singer to challenging new terrain, here literally forcing him to confront <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZInHZeY2wE\">his younger self</a> by intercutting (without sound) the <em>Winterreise</em> he sang in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DLsaSm5iG9o\">David Alden\u2019s 1997 film</a> for Channel 4. The older Bostridge sings, leaning and pulling on intonation with clear intention, with his boyish, soft-featured self as his shadow. The Britten Sinfonia, effectively all soloists and superbly led by Thomas Gould, played with impeccable delicacy and style, now mimicking a serene and melodic Schubert string quartet, now entering the world of Mahler or the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Viennese_School\">Second Viennese School</a>, accordion, muted trumpet and guitar colouring the sound. So strong is Schubert\u2019s music, so direct is M\u00fcller\u2019s verse and so finely intelligent is Bostridge\u2019s singing that all peril is overcome and art gains.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Had Rustioni banished the cast and enacted the plot from the podium, there would still have been much to enjoy</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Bellini wrote his first opera, <strong>Adelson e Salvini</strong>, when he was 23 years old. On a blind listening, with its wit and patter and ever-faster crescendos, you might think Rossini responsible for this impassioned melodrama-cum-comedy. <a href=\"http://www.opera-rara.com/\">Opera Rara</a>, busy since the 1970s unearthing forgotten operas, chose it for a second, fruitful collaboration this season with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/bbc-symphony-orchestra\">BBC Symphony Orchestra </a>and conductor <a href=\"http://www.danielerustioni.com/\">Daniele Rustioni</a>. Had Rustioni banished the cast and enacted the complicated plot (don\u2019t ask) from the podium, there would still have been much to enjoy. Energy exploded from his every limb, eliciting spry, lively playing from the BBCSO even in rumpty-tum longueurs. A protege of both Gianandrea Noseda and Antonio Pappano and sharing their energy, Rustioni jumps, bends, stretches, revelling in every moment. His enthusiasm made this forgotten work feel like a masterpiece.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68985551f4f231b1bd77440dafd70aaee00aa7ba\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68985551f4f231b1bd77440dafd70aaee00aa7ba/0_72_6722_4414/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simone Alberghini, left, and Enea Scala with the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by Daniele Rustioni at the Barbican.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"657\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Simone Alberghini, left, and Enea Scala with the BBC Symphony Orchestra conducted by the remarkable Daniele Rustioni at the Barbican.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Russell Duncan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to call it that, but the work rattles \u2013 and occasionally creaks \u2013 along with moments of Bellinian brilliance, including <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMvcYZKA3uU\">an aria</a> later used in his <em>I Capuleti e i Montecchi</em>. Let\u2019s try again with the plot: Salvini, an impassioned painter (when are they not?) \u2013 in this nimble semi-staging Enea Scala wears that badge of bohemian artistry, a scarf \u2013 falls in love with his master\u2019s fiancee, Nelly, while Fanny, a young servant, pines for him. Lost already? That\u2019s only scene one. Let Wikipedia take you to the impenetrable heart of the matter: \u201cNeither, however, is the name of the girl and, in a game of misunderstanding, thank you Salvini momentum with his friend, believing he has granted the hand of Nelly. [sic]\u201d</p> <p>Moving on, despite some weaknesses in the cast there were several star turns, notably mezzo <a href=\"http://www.guybarzilayartists.com/Daniela-Barcellona\">Daniela Barcellona</a> as Nelly, <a href=\"http://www.metopera.org/Discover/Artists/BaritonesandBasses/Maurizio-Muraro/\">Maurizio Muraro</a> in the buffo bass role of Bonifacio, with Leah-Marian Jones, David Soar and Kathryn Rudge strong in smaller roles. All handled the lengthy, heavily cut spoken dialogue with aplomb. Scala climbed up to the highest tenorial stratosphere with only momentary slips, and wove around the ornamentation skilfully. The stage director, Kenneth Richardson, made the sensible decision to keep the houselights down, in a stroke intensifying a drama full of event but in which not much happens. All good fun, and look out for the eventual CD. Last year\u2019s <em>Zaz\u00e0</em>, by Leoncavallo, is <a href=\"http://www.opera-rara.com/catalog/product/view/id/3790/s/leoncavallo-zaza/\">released next month</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"483e05598915fa28d9c3cc9097389366a0bcae76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/483e05598915fa28d9c3cc9097389366a0bcae76/0_286_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BBC Young Musician 2016 finalists (l-r): Jess Gillam, Sheku Kanneh-Mason and Ben Goldscheider: \u2018precociously talented but not precious\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">BBC Young Musician 2016 finalists (l-r): Jess Gillam, Sheku Kanneh-Mason and Ben Goldscheider: \u2018precociously talented but not precious\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Brian Tarr</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00bb3wt\"><strong>BBC Young Musician</strong></a> has always had a sharp nose for talent. The pianist <a href=\"http://www.stephenhough.com/\">Stephen Hough </a>and clarinettist <a href=\"http://www.michael-collins.co.uk/\">Michael Collins</a> made it to the finals of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/10/from-the-classical-archive-first-ever-bbc-young-musician-of-the-year-1978\">the first competition in 1978</a>. The title was won by a trombonist, <a href=\"http://www.mikehext.co.uk/\">Michael Hext</a>, inevitably less well known given the social rather than solo nature of his chosen instrument, but a fine player and on that night the best. It\u2019s all less cringe-making than it used to be. One thing has changed dramatically. Whereas TV used to be a closed world, cameras and lights as daunting as audience and jury, now teenagers are so used to seeing themselves on social media that they smile rather than squirm. Each young musician has talked, above all, about the pleasure of performing.</p> <p>The musical hinterland has been eclectic and impressive, family music-making playing a vital part: the brass players who come from the band tradition, the cellist who also plays folk fiddle, the trumpeter who learned jazz at his father\u2019s feet, the violinist equally at ease singing in a school staging of <em>Les Mis</em>. All are self-disciplined, precociously talented but not precious. Of the finalists, saxophonist <a href=\"http://www.jessgillamsax.co.uk/\">Jess Gillam</a> and horn player <a href=\"https://bengoldscheider.com/\">Ben Goldscheider</a> (who had to choose between football and music) are contemporary music advocates. Cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason, from a Nottingham comprehensive, has six musician siblings to keep him in check. He played in the Kanneh-Mason family trio, representing <a href=\"http://chineke.org/\">Chineke!</a>, at the <a href=\"http://rpsmusicawards.com/welcome\">RPS awards</a> last week with the music world\u2019s movers and shakers listening in. The finals are <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07blqjf\">on BBC4</a> and<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07b26qg\"> Radio 3</a> tonight. Whoever wins will make you happy. Whoever loses, you\u2019ll be sad. They all have big careers ahead.</p> <p><em>Star ratings (out of 5)<br /></em><em>Zender\u2019s Winterreise ****<br /></em><em>Adelson e Salvini ****</em></p>",

A cluster of marsh orchids push their way through the surface of a disused tennis court in the shadow of Newcastle United\u2019s football stadium. And the walls and gravestones of a rain-lashed Cornish churchyard are encrusted with layers of lichens.</p> <p>At first sight, these very different places do not seem to have all that much in common. Yet like roadside verges and railway lines, golf courses and military ranges, they were all originally designed for us, but have since become havens for wildlife.

Almost 40 years later, poets <a href=\"http://www.poetryarchive.org/poet/paul-farley?gclid=CJe7lY2m0swCFdW4GwodSmcBww\">Paul Farley</a> and <a href=\"http://www.symmonsroberts.com/\">Michael Symmons Roberts</a> chose <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/mar/06/edgelands-england-farley-roberts-review\"><em>Edgelands</em></a>, which neatly encapsulates their liminal nature.</p> <p>I prefer \u201cthe accidental countryside\u201d, as what all these diverse locations have in common is that they were rarely \u2013 if ever \u2013 created with wildlife in mind. Yet nature soon moved in, and now they have become a crucial refuge for many species of plants and animals.</p> <p>Wherever you live in the country, you\u2019ll be close to at least one of these sites. Some, like village churchyards, are in the heart of the countryside; others, such as canals, run through the centre of our cities. But most are, rather appropriately, neither rural nor urban. They are the spaces we pass through when travelling from one place to another; forgotten patches of land on the edge of towns, in the unloved, overlooked corners of suburbia. They are, as naturalist, author and broadcaster <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/nov/29/in-country-kenneth-allsop-review\">Kenneth Allsop</a> called them, \u201cthe messy limbo that is neither town nor country\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"09bd4462ae36f0d21d61a79dc353e9b860029734\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09bd4462ae36f0d21d61a79dc353e9b860029734/0_0_3467_4333/800.jpg\" alt=\"urban buttercups\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The spaces we pass through when travelling from one place to another\u2019: urban buttercups.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UniversalImagesGroup/UIG via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was brought up on the outskirts of west London, so I feel a special affinity with these peripheral places. From eight or nine years old, I spent most of my free time outdoors, exploring the disused gravel pits near my home. I was too young then to appreciate my good fortune, and that of the wildlife that lived there. There were breeding great crested grebes and wintering smews, bumblebees, butterflies and water voles. On one memorable occasion, an osprey stopped off to feed as it travelled back to Scotland from Africa.</p> <p>In those far-off days, manmade habitats such as this were considered second-rate compared with more traditional wildlife haunts such as farmland, woodland, mountain and moor. Sadly that misguided view still prevails today. The self-appointed pressure groups that claim to be the custodians of rural Britain take a very dim view of anything that can\u2019t be classified as \u201cproper\u201d countryside. \u201cBuild on brownfield sites\u201d is their plea, even though as conservationist Chris Baines once wryly noted, if you really want to improve the biodiversity of an arable field, the best way is to put a housing estate on it \u2013 gardens support a far greater range of species than do acres of wheat or barley.</p> <p>The very phrase \u201cbrownfield site\u201d conjures up a picture of post-industrial devastation \u2013 a far cry from the reality of places such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/may/03/ruralaffairs.science\">Canvey Wick in Essex</a>. Dubbed \u201cEngland\u2019s rainforest\u201d, Canvey Wick is one of the top three locations for invertebrates in the whole of Britain. The <a href=\"http://www.avalonmarshes.org/\">Avalon marshes</a>, that vast wetland near my Somerset home where otters, bitterns and great white egrets thrive, was created from former peat diggings. And <a href=\"http://www.fothcp.org/\">Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park</a> \u2013 the nearest fragment of ancient woodland to the City of London \u2013 started life as a Victorian burial ground.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/21/rain-four-walks-in-english-weather-melissa-harrison-review-wicken-fen-dartmoor-darent-valley-wrekin\">Rain: Four Walks in English Weather by Melissa Harrison \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These sites, especially those in the heart of our major cities, have a value far beyond their importance for wildlife. They also provide a haven for people, where we can escape the rat race for an hour or two, something more and more vital in this busy world. And they are ideal spaces where children can engage with nature, says author Melissa Harrison, whose novel <a href=\"http://\"><em>Clay</em></a> revolves around a young boy who finds sanctuary in a hidden wild corner of a city: \u201cA patch of park or verge, crowded with weeds and minibeasts, may not look like much to you or me \u2013 but to a child it can be a magical world.\u201d</p> <p>But for many, this escape into nature may soon be harder to find. Although some of these locations are now protected by organisations such as the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and the Wildlife Trusts, many are not. And at a time when any \u201cwaste land\u201d is considered ripe for development, we must be constantly on our guard against those who want to make a quick buck at the expense of local people and wildlife.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"971c3acfeba68c2455a889b4ae2cac4c177b1aed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/971c3acfeba68c2455a889b4ae2cac4c177b1aed/0_116_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children at Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children at Tower Hamlets Cemetery Park, London.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mathew Frith of the London Wildlife Trust feels that planning laws don\u2019t give the priority to wildlife that they claim to, especially now that a working knowledge of habitats and ecology is often not on the planners\u2019 radar. One important site for reptiles and invertebrates, Erith Quarry in south-east London, has lost much of its important wildlife after being developed for housing.</p> <p>One day, hopefully, we can restore wildlife to the food factory that makes up most of Britain\u2019s lowland countryside, so that our fields, woods and meadows are once again filled with birdsong, the buzzing of insects and the scent of wild flowers. In the meantime, the untidy little scraps of land that make up our accidental countryside are absolutely crucial, for wildlife, and for the people to whom wildlife matters.</p> <p><em>Stephen Moss\u2019s latest book, Wild Kingdom: Bringing Back Britain\u2019s Wildlife, is out now (Square Peg \u00a316.99). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/385179/s/wild-kingdom/\"><em>Click here to order it for \u00a311.89</em></a></p>",

Both here and in another G minor Credo, Lotti\u2019s music is strongly profiled, solidly baroque, with an especially expressive fugue at the end of the Gloria, then re-used in the Benedictus. There are a good number of first recordings here, driven well by <a href=\"http://www.benpalmer.net/\">Ben Palmer</a>, though the soloists are not all equal to Lotti\u2019s extravagant demands.</p>",

Looking at these powerful charcoal images, it is not immediately clear what is going on. Shaw appears leaning, staggering, bowed and stumbling beneath some invisible weight. At one point he falls to the ground.</p> <p>There are 14 drawings, so one realises that these may be the Stations of the Cross, but without the cross or the loincloth. And sure enough, the artist finally appears with arms outspread and head hanging down. But Shaw is not standing in for the Messiah. These are studies of paintings in the National Gallery, in which he has become his own naked life model, isolated and exposed, in order to imagine what such extreme suffering might look and feel like. The drawings are very potent yet also very humble, which could stand as a description of everything that follows.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d9a10116c49fdf27f3f6363a76d40d64369bd5da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d9a10116c49fdf27f3f6363a76d40d64369bd5da/36_41_1150_1547/743.jpg\" alt=\"Shaw\u2019s The Sadness of the Middle-Aged Life Model (12), 2015.\" width=\"743\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Shaw\u2019s The Sadness of the Middle-Aged Life Model (12), 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and Wilkinson Gallery, London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/nov/15/george-shaw-interview-every-second-every-ounce-of-time-has-to-be-accounted-for\">George Shaw</a>, born in Coventry in 1966, is famous for the defiant humility of his subject and methods. For decades he has worked entirely <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/oct/23/turner-2011-baltic-condo-review\">in Humbrol enamel</a> on lowly MDF, commemorating with fastidious realism the council estate of Tile Hill <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/feb/13/george-shaw-tile-hill-baltic-interview\">where he grew up</a>. No one who admires his lifelong loyalty to that unregarded landscape could imagine a radical breach with home. And so it seems: two years as <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/learning/associate-artist-scheme/george-shaw-1\">artist-in-residence</a> at the National Gallery, and Shaw is still painting Tile Hill in Trafalgar Square.</p> <p>Or rather, he paints the woods on the outskirts as a scene of intense human drama. The moment has just passed, is just about to happen, or is happening even now even, though there is never anyone there. A mark on the ground, a tramping of leaves, the torn page of an old magazine: the woods are full of human traces. A striped mattress lolls in a clearing \u2013 the painting is titled <em>The School of Love</em>, after <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/correggio-venus-with-mercury-and-cupid-the-school-of-love\">Correggio</a>, who painted forest love, after all. A tree trunk drips with red paint: someone\u2019s rage, someone\u2019s private message.</p> <p>The people have come and gone from this sylvan stage set, gods and goddesses falling in and out of love, rude mechanicals leaving crushed cans and old pin-ups behind. Shakespeare is somewhere in the wings. A painting of a dark cleft in a tree is called <em>The Old Country</em>, alluding to <em>Hamlet</em>, while in another part of the wood lies death.</p> <p>Woods are film sets, playgrounds, theatres. They have an irresistible pull in their beauty and wildness. We can\u2019t see the wood for the trees among which we are lost, even a few yards from home, getting away from it all. This is the atmosphere of Shaw\u2019s paintings, where anything may take place, from the first kiss to the spine-tingling crack of a twig somewhere nearby that says you are not alone.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0edb13c28fedf2b86e2a61404e5fbde2b7507f5a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0edb13c28fedf2b86e2a61404e5fbde2b7507f5a/32_34_1665_1391/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Foot of a Tree, 2015-2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"835\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Foot of a Tree, 2015-2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and Wilkinson Gallery, London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He has been inspired by <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/giovanni-bellini-the-assassination-of-saint-peter-martyr\">Bellini\u2019s <em>The Assassination of Saint Peter Martyr</em></a>, where the horror occurs in front of some perfectly ordinary trees, brown and scruffy as anything in Tile Hill, and by those corners of undergrowth in the foreground of paintings by Brueghel, Titian and Poussin. In Shaw, that corner may become the whole scene \u2013 a tangle of foliage, a leafy clearing, a trio of trunks, perhaps even a tree root. One of the most affecting works here is a knuckle of old root, dead but still here, the relic of some tall proud tree now lying on a carpet of leaves like one of G\u00e9ricault\u2019s severed limbs. <em>The Foot of a Tree</em>, it is beautifully titled.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Shaw has often been asked why he works with this intractable stuff that runs like new blood and has no lusciousness</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The show\u2019s punning title, My Back to Nature, implies a narrative and there is an unfolding story in these images, accumulating like scenes set in the same glade. Sometimes it is wintry and stark, sometimes misty and autumnal, the air still, the mulch of leaves a dirty brown smear. The sky is a glow of dawn or dusk glimmering through the branches, or a dim downward light, or nothing but a pervasive greyness. One avowedly romantic sequence shows the variety of moods in one particular avenue of trees as the seasons pass: the ever-changing performance of nature.</p> <p>But the actors in this drama are not always unseen. In an inversion of those self-portraits where the human body stands for the cross, as well as itself, here the tree becomes the human being. A felled tree lies on the ground, one end painfully charred, not by a proper bonfire but repeated attempts with matches, as if it has been tortured. The severed branches in <em>Study for Hanging Around </em>resemble pegs that might be ideal for a noose. The paint hurled at a trunk bleeds on the leaves beneath, as if there has been a murder.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc0ad14c80428065e8ab45c9426edc5779b8f342\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc0ad14c80428065e8ab45c9426edc5779b8f342/89_62_4686_3920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Turning a Tile Hill tarpaulin into something like silk\u2019: The Living and the Dead, 2015\u201316.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"837\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Turning a Tile Hill tarpaulin into something like silk\u2019: The Living and the Dead, 2015\u201316.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of the artist and Wilkinson Gallery, London</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Occasionally, the gallery lighting catches the glint of the Humbrol paint and the picture suddenly looks like an object as much as an image. Shaw has often been asked why he works with this intractable stuff that runs like new blood and has no lusciousness, traction or thickness, that is so difficult to move or manipulate. His answer is that enamel has no historic associations, can keep its distance from the grand tradition. But though he has remained faithful to this tough and <a href=\"http://www.humbrol.com/uk-en/shop/paints.html\">lowly medium</a>, despite the lure of the oil paint all around him, he takes it in new directions, achieving the blue of a Titian sky or a Madonna\u2019s cloak, turning a Tile Hill tarpaulin into something like silk.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/nov/15/george-shaw-interview-every-second-every-ounce-of-time-has-to-be-accounted-for\">George Shaw, 49: \u2018Every second, every ounce of time has to be accounted for\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The thinness is still there; these surfaces are hard-won. But the images have become deeper, more elegiac and literary. In one of his far-ranging catalogue essays \u2013 Shaw is an excellent writer \u2013 the artist refers to <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/piero-del-pollaiuolo-apollo-and-daphne\">Pollaiuolo\u2019s painting of Daphne</a> turning into a tree, her limbs simply turning to branches, her body rooting back into the earth to which we return. This is surely his vision of trees.</p> <p><em>You\u2019ve Changed</em> runs the witty title of a series of portraits \u2013 no other word will do \u2013 in which every tree has the expressive nuances of a face, as if some <a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/titian-diana-and-actaeon\">subsuming another Daphne</a>. The sequence also captures the peculiarly mercurial aspect of trees: that they sometimes appear to have changed overnight, or to have changed places, so that the woods are not quite as they seemed yesterday.</p> <p>Shaw once said that he haunted Tile Hill and now it haunts him. In its woods, as in the museum itself, he sees all of life and perhaps the afterlife too. Like an old master working away at study after study, he eventually produces the trio of large paintings that are exactly the size of the Titian <em>Metamorphoses</em> in the gallery. One shows a dark and erotic clearing, another the tree assaulted with red paint and the last that Titian-blue tarpaulin, dangling like a spectral ghost from the bough of a tree: life, death and resurrection.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/whats-on/exhibitions/george-shaw-my-back-to-nature-11-may-2016-1000\">\u2022 George Shaw: My Back to Nature is at the National Gallery, London until 30 October</a></p>",

On the face of it, <a href=\"http://www.detourfilm.com/#filmography\">Richard Linklater</a>\u2019s latest picture, which unfolds during a riotous three days before the college term starts, has more in common with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7vtWB4owdE\"><em>National Lampoon\u2019s Animal House</em></a> than it does with the gentle, observational style of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ys-mbHXyWX4\"><em>Boyhood</em></a>. But dig a little deeper, and this joyously hedonistic semi-autobiographical comedy, which has been described as a \u201cspiritual sequel\u201d to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8WHOiQZGok\"><em>Dazed and Confused</em></a>, is unmistakably a Linklater movie.</p> <p>It\u2019s a film that takes a seismic rite of passage \u2013 the journey from being a high-school big shot to a freshman little fish in a pool of immense, ravenous ego-driven sharks \u2013 and explores it without the framework of one large dramatic inciting incident to hang it on. Instead, like all of Linklater\u2019s best pictures and some of his worst, the film is driven by dialogue. And there are few writer-directors who have a better ear for authentic voices than Linklater.</p> <p>His ear for music is equally attuned \u2013 the soundtrack speaks of the malleable identities of boys who will pledge temporary allegiance to any social group if it gets them near the girls.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/may/12/richard-linklater-everybody-wants-some-video-interview\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4j4pm\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2503354\"            data-video-name=\"Richard Linklater on Everybody Wants Some!!: 'Directing is like being a coach' \u2013 video interview\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-573353a9e4b0a3721d605731\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/11/160511EWSJunket2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/11/160511EWSJunket2_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/11/160511EWSJunket2_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/11/160511EWSJunket2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/11/160511EWSJunket2_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/may/12/richard-linklater-everybody-wants-some-video-interview\">Richard Linklater on Everybody Wants Some!!: \u2018Directing is like being a coach\u2019</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The film follows Jake (Blake Jenner), a freshman pitcher who joins the fictional South Texas State University as a member of the baseball team. This buys him a place in one of the baseball houses, a dilapidated frat-like building that can barely contain all the alpha-male jock arrogance jostling for position within its creaking walls. Everything \u2013 even banter \u2013 becomes a competition. The picture works best if you reserve judgment \u2013 yes, some of the attitudes towards women are a little unreformed and some of the characters are puddle deep \u2013 and enjoy the show.</p> <p>What\u2019s most interesting, perhaps, is the way that Linklater rehabilitates the jock as a character. Traditionally viewed \u2013 by everyone from <a href=\"http://variety.com/2016/film/news/the-breakfast-club-best-and-worst-john-hughes-films-1201433537/\">John Hughes</a> onwards \u2013 as muscle-bound bullies each with an IQ barely above that of the boots they wear, here they are as diverse and (occasionally) complex as any other section of the college community.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-15T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Ahead of the 69th Cannes film festival, police staged what they described as a \u201cmulti-terror\u201d exercise. They ordered volunteers to play dead on the Croisette, detonated a series of car bombs outside the Palais and had a band of masked gunmen storm the dignitaries\u2019 carpet. Here was a real-world simulation complete with disaster-flick bunting. All that was missing was the presence of an A-list action star to repel the invaders before the end credits rolled.</p> <p>Ostensibly this bizarre charade was meant to test the authorities\u2019 mettle in the event of a worst case scenario, an Isis attack at some packed premiere. But the ensuing theatrics (naturally <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1cEDfxyCsms\">filmed for posterity</a>) were also of a piece with the festival itself, perfectly tuned to its upside-down logic. For better or worse, Cannes is a fantasy land. It\u2019s full of celebrities and chancers, performers and posers, and overlooked at all times by 500 mounted cameras. Everybody\u2019s on screen, everyone\u2019s being watched. Small wonder that nothing feels real unless it is first framed as fiction.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>These days Allen calls to mind one of those ageing tennis legends coaxed back on court for an exhibition match</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On the opening day, even Mother Nature seemed intent on grabbing a role in the drama, dousing the town with such a storm overnight that one half-expected to find stranded fish flapping on the steps of the Palais. The damp, dizzy delegates needed a movie to warm them and it\u2019s likely they found it in Woody Allen\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/cafe-society\"><em>Caf\u00e9 Society</em></a>, although personally I\u2019d have preferred something more galvanic. Instead we got Jesse Eisenberg and Steve Carell playing kvetching New York Jews, each chasing the American dream out in 30s Hollywood and vying for the affections of a beautiful secretary (Kristen Stewart, doing her utmost with a sketchy role).</p> <p><em>Caf\u00e9 Society</em> (given a constant honeyed glaze by cinematographer Vittorio Storaro) is not without its charms. It\u2019s an elegant, melancholic affair and I liked the way Eisenberg\u2019s hero \u2013 initially installed as a wide-eyed innocent \u2013 actually turns out to be more venal and less likable than Carell\u2019s wheeler-dealer. But the tale feels rote, secondhand and a little soft in the middle and, as such, offers further evidence of a director who\u2019s coasting. These days Allen calls to mind one of those ageing tennis legends coaxed back on court for an exhibition match. He still possesses the same easy swing, the same inimitable style. But there\u2019s no force to his delivery. He has nothing to play for; nothing truly at stake.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1bdf0ccd733c3f579669afd6ddbb470ead6aed38\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1bdf0ccd733c3f579669afd6ddbb470ead6aed38/0_301_4231_2539/1000.jpg\" alt=\"I, Daniel Blake\u2019s Rebecca O\u2019Brien, Dave Johns, director Ken Loach, Hayley Squires and writer Paul Laverty.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">I, Daniel Blake\u2019s Rebecca O\u2019Brien, Dave Johns, director Ken Loach, Hayley Squires and writer Paul Laverty.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Graham Whitby Boot/Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At least Ken Loach (only one year Allen\u2019s junior at 79) is still in the game, fighting the good fight. He\u2019s one of two British directors in the main competition (alongside Andrea Arnold), back for a record-breaking 13th occasion with his finest film of this century. <em>I, Daniel Blake</em> showcases a terrific, tragic performance from comic Dave Johns as a martyred Newcastle carpenter, felled by a heart attack yet ruled fit to work. First he\u2019s told that he can\u2019t appeal against the decision until the \u201cdecision maker\u201d calls to confirm what\u2019s already been said. Next he\u2019s ordered to familiarise himself with the internet by completing a form that can only be accessed online. Loach tackles these hurdles like a social-realist Franz Kafka, painting the department of work and pensions as the tale\u2019s hydra-headed villain and damning a deliberately obstructive system that leaves its victims no choice but to either lash out or give up. The director, I\u2019m guessing, would advocate the first option. He\u2019s tried retirement once and found that it didn\u2019t suit him. He returns to the fray with the urgency and passion of a man born anew.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4deba4c7540ba13e3c8e1d99dd3a671f0cd44a66\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4deba4c7540ba13e3c8e1d99dd3a671f0cd44a66/1539_0_3543_2126/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Damien Bonnard in Staying Vertical by Alain Guiraudie.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A wild, woolly beast of a movie\u2019: Damien Bonnard in Staying Vertical by Alain Guiraudie.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Elsewhere, early signs suggest this year\u2019s competition could be a rich and strange brew. Romanian director Cristi Puiu came to town with <em>Sieranevada</em>, an impressive piece of stage management, which shuts a bickering family inside a small flat and then turns up the heat over a three-hour running time. You won\u2019t see this many exits and entrances outside of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2007/mar/19/whereisthenewfeydeau\">Feydeau farce</a>. I was even more taken by Alain Guiraudie\u2019s <em>Staying Vertical</em>, although be warned \u2013 this wild, woolly beast of a movie appeared to exasperate as many viewers as it beguiled. How to process a tale that clears space for libidinous rustics, ravening wolves and a new-age witch before bowing out with an ominous hanging ending? </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4930ea392669cc5c4d586e67a2dd29ed459b6943\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4930ea392669cc5c4d586e67a2dd29ed459b6943/226_0_2401_3000/800.jpg\" alt=\"George Clooney and Julia Roberts, stars of Jodie Foster\u2019s Money Monster.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">George Clooney and Julia Roberts, stars of Jodie Foster\u2019s Money Monster.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Samir Hussein/WireImage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To confuse us still further, a cruel trick of the schedule meant the delegates staggered out of <em>Staying Vertical</em> and pitched straight into <em>Money Monster</em>, a glossy Hollywood hostage caper that was like the cheese to its chalk. Directed by Jodie Foster (and playing out of competition), <em>Money Monster</em> features George Clooney as a TV pundit in peril and Julia Roberts as his harried studio director, demanding a more flattering angle on the furious gunman. Foster\u2019s film is diverting enough and ensured some <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO7wPqz5xPE\">early celebrity wattage on the red carpet outside</a>. But it felt like thin, tacky fare after what had gone before. I sat in the back row still thinking of wolves.</p> <p>Press further on through the Palais and the place turns wilder by degrees. Here there be dragons \u2013 or at least B-movies about dragons, because down in the bowels lies the Cannes marketplace. The official selection is just the tip of the iceberg. Hundreds of other, less feted titles are screened in small rooms at the back, while the stalls come draped with fabulous gaudy posters. It is all too easy to get lost in this maze, stumbling from audacious knock-offs like the superhero romp <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x2vn098\"><em>God of Thunder</em></a> (not to be confused with the official <em>Thor</em> franchise), past <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YypoxunfX9s\"><em>Attack of the Lederhosen Zombies</em></a><em>,</em> through a rash of cheap and cheerful creature features. Amphibians seem to be big news this year but which film is better, <a href=\"http://www.filmfestivals.com/blog/cannes_market_dailies/attraction_presents_another_wonderful_family_film_mr_frog\"><em>Mr Frog</em></a> or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fef5o2vKyyo\"><em>Frog Kingdom</em></a>?</p> <p>Each market stall is staffed by a grinning, desperate sales agent who works the phone with one hand and the mouse with the other. By the end of the festival these agents \u2013 starved of sunlight, wired on coffee \u2013 rather start to resemble zombies themselves. But in these opening hours they are fresh-faced and perky, with everything to play for. Up ahead is a happy hunting ground of deals and discussions, masterpieces and schlock. So bolt the doors against the outside world. Seize the moment; embrace the dream. Or as Woody Allen puts it in <em>Caf\u00e9 Society</em>, \u201cLive every day like it\u2019s your last \u2013 and one day you\u2019ll be right.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>An Asda store in Manchester has been trying out a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/manchester-asda-quiet-hour-help-autistic-shoppers\">quiet hour</a> on Saturday mornings \u2013 the music will be turned down, tannoys turned off and escalators will stop, so that anyone \u201cwith autism and other conditions who struggle to deal with loud noises\u201d can shop in peace and not be overwhelmed by the usual cacophony and frenzy. Marvellous. This is the idea of one imaginative manager in one store. Already eight more shops in the same retail park are planning to do the same. I hope older people were included in the \u201cother conditions\u201d category, because there are a lot of us desperate for a bit more calm. <br /></p> <p> </p> <p>London, like most of the cities in the UK, has changed over the last few decades, for me and many of my peers, into a strange new hell. It\u2019s full of neighbourhoods described as edgy and buzzy, which means crowded, frenzied, noisy, confusing, with flashing lights, roaring traffic and general sensory overload. It\u2019s a worrisome environment, and doesn\u2019t always do your cardiac function much good, according to research by the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.newdynamics.group.shef.ac.uk/assets/files/NDA%20Findings_4.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">New Dynamics of Ageing</a> (pdf), on older people\u2019s use of unfamiliar space. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/29/shopping-hell-autistic-people-quiet-store-hours\">Shopping can be hell for autistic people. 'Quiet' store hours will change my life | Zack Budryk</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If town and retail planners and architects are really concerned about the welfare of older people, they should follow the example of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/apr/25/improving-with-age-how-city-design-is-adapting-to-older-populations\">Berlin</a> that is working to widen pavements, bring in tactile guidance at road crossings and easier access to trams and buses - all with disabled and elderly residents and visitors in mind.</p> <p>Out and about in my own city environment, I feel rather like a weedy, vulnerable little worm. There\u2019s no peace, no quiet, hardly anywhere to rest, bus stop seats upon which you can barely fit a quarter of your bum, and hardly any lavatories. </p> <p>The older we get the more we need to plan our outings around lavatories but public lavatories are not a statutory provision, and because of budget cuts, many councils do not even pay businesses to take part in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/19/uk-public-toilets-mapped-wheres-your-nearest\">community toilet schemes</a>. In London, toilet facilities in Marks &amp; Spencer, Tesco, John Lewis, Sainsbury\u2019s and Asda are available to use without the need to buy anything as part of the mayor\u2019s <a href=\"http://legacy.london.gov.uk/mayor/priorities/open-london\" rel=\"nofollow\">Open London</a> scheme. However, the companies are not all keen to display signs alerting us to their available lavatories, which is no help at all.</p> <p>Unfortunately some of our unpleasant journeys are getting longer, particularly to post-offices and banks. According to <a href=\"https://ageukblog.org.uk/2016/05/04/branch-closures-present-banks-with-age-friendly-design-challenge/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Age UK</a>, the UK bank branch network has shrunk by half over the last 25 years with another 2,000 closures expected in the next three to four years, meaning that the number of stranded customers is likely to continue increasing. </p> <p>Age UK suggests a single place in a small town that could provide banking services for customers from all banks, but the only human contact would be via video-link. Whether in small towns and villages, or large cities, the problems are the same: no one to talk to, compulsory use of machines in banks and supermarkets \u2013 all adds to the stress and misery of an outing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/nov/19/uk-public-toilets-mapped-wheres-your-nearest\">UK public toilets mapped: where's your nearest?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But let\u2019s say you do reach your venue, knackered from the journey, and you find live staff, the excessive noise may still ruin outings for older people. I have often begged cinemas to turn the sound down, but they insist that they can\u2019t. \u201cThe levels are set,\u201d they say. To cause pain rather than pleasure. Older people often find <a href=\"https://conversation.which.co.uk/shopping/annoying-background-music-shops-supermarkets/\" rel=\"nofollow\">background noise</a> in shops, restaurants and places of entertainment unpleasant, and, according to comments posted on the consumer watchdog site <a href=\"https://conversation.which.co.uk/shopping/background-piped-music-in-shops/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Which?</a>, they\u2019ll find it in Waterstones, Loch Fyne restaurants, Old English Inns, Ikea, B&amp;Q and a squillion other places. </p> <p>B&amp;Q for one has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2006/jan/19/workandcareers.changingjobs\">been praised</a> for its employment of older staff and also offers a discount day for the over 60s on Wednesdays. Yet, when contacted, could not provide an answer to why it couldn\u2019t cut the background music in their stores. Given there will be 19 million over 65s \u2013 1 in 4 of the population - in the UK <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/research/key-issues-for-the-new-parliament/value-for-money-in-public-services/the-ageing-population/\" rel=\"nofollow\">by 2050</a>, it\u2019s high time businesses started catering better for older people, as well as those with disabilities. </p> <p>A point echoed by Anna Dixon, chief executive of the Centre for Ageing Better. \u201cStaying connected is one of the key factors to a good later life, and planners, businesses and local councils need to create places and services that help people remain in control and able to carry out day-to-day activities so they can enjoy life to the full.\u201d</p> <p> </p>",

First of all, he said that lots of people around him had seen it, and liked it. Then he said: \u2018But you <em>will</em> be attacked.\u2019 And he explained why. After all, he knows: he\u2019s had plenty of violent criticism himself. \u2018Don\u2019t get depressed,\u2019 he told me. What he was saying was: keep going.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I loved his [Orhan Pamuk's] respsonse. He said, 'Don't get depressed' ... he was saying, keep going</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Erg\u00fcven is certainly doing that. <em>Mustang</em>, nominated for best foreign language film at the 2015 Oscars and the winner of four C\u00e9sar awards in France, has opened countless new doors for its director and, as a result, her appetite for work is more voracious than ever. Even so, she finds it hard to imagine working in Turkey again. Her second feature, which she is shortly to start shooting, is an English-language picture set in Los Angeles at the time of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/apr/26/la-riots-20-years-later\" title=\"\">1992 riots</a>. \u201cI detested the response [to <em>Mustang</em>] in Turkey, and so I withdrew from it.\u201d</p> <p>Not that such a turning away is a new experience for her: \u201cMy father was a diplomat in the 80s, at a time when there were many assassinations, when the country had problems with every one of its neighbours, when there was a permanent sense of conflict. Every once in a while, I do feel like taking a break and going to the other side of the world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e96f42699f31746e569845e2a39f4720a3a0150\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e96f42699f31746e569845e2a39f4720a3a0150/219_0_3285_1971/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ilyada Akdo\u011fan, centre, as Sonay in Mustang.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ilyada Akdo\u011fan, centre, as Sonay in Mustang.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Canal+</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The extraordinary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/19/mustang-review-the-virgin-suicides-in-istanbul-is-a-turkish-delight\" title=\"\"><em>Mustang</em></a> is set in rural Turkey. It tells the story of five orphaned sisters, who live with their grandmother in a large and remote house. The family is not poor, but it is conservative, and when the girls are seen by neighbours splashing around in the sea on the shoulders of a group of local boys \u2013 the gossip is that they have been \u201cpleasuring themselves\u201d on the boys \u2013 an uncle steps in, telling his mother (the girls\u2019 grandmother) that things must change. The family\u2019s respectability is at stake.</p> <p>The sisters, having first been beaten for their misdemeanour, are removed from school, and thereafter kept like prisoners at home, where they are taught to cook and to sew the frumpish \u201cshit-coloured\u201d clothes with which they must now cover their bodies. One by one, it seems, they are to be married off, whether they like it or not. The older girls can do little to resist. But Lale, the youngest, is rebellious and courageous and increasingly determined not to submit. Some critics have likened the film, with its dream-like intensity and mostly female cast, to Sophia Coppola\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkl56L9_RPg\" title=\"\"><em>The Virgin Suicides</em></a>. Its director, though, thinks it\u2019s more like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/gallery/2013/oct/05/the-10-best-jailbreak-films\" title=\"\"><em>Escape from Alcatraz</em></a> \u2013 with frocks.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Some have likened the film to The Virgin Suicides. Erg\u00fcven thinks it\u2019s more like Escape from Alcatraz \u2013 with frocks</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Where did it come from, this story? Erg\u00fcven, talking from her home in Paris, says she had long had an abstract desire to tackle the question of what it is to be a woman in Turkey. \u201cBut it only became concrete when one of my cousins married. Everything that happened around the wedding was beautiful, synergetic, especially the vividness of the young Turkish people who were present at the celebrations.\u201d</p> <p>Suddenly, the film\u2019s opening section came to her, an image of carefree, innocent girls perched laughingly on the shoulders of boys: a scene taken from life. \u201cI\u2019m the youngest in a family in which two generations are constituted of girls, so there are many little details that are true. There are no forced marriages in my family, but we always had conservative figures. There was one father-in-law who was very conservative: an unmarried couple could not enter his house, and I never, ever told him I had a boyfriend \u2013 or not until I was 56. [She laughs: she is 37.] The little scandal in the film did take place in my family, albeit not as violently. The girls being beaten in order of age: that was something that happened in my mother\u2019s generation.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU9JAN8LtIk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/rU9JAN8LtIk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU9JAN8LtIk\">Watch the trailer for Mustang</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>What, then, does her family make of her film? \u201cPeople\u2019s relationship with fiction and reality and the connection between the two is interesting, and surprising. In my generation, every girl knows what I am talking about. But in my mother\u2019s generation, they regard it as fiction. There are some things they just can\u2019t see, perhaps because they have no distance.\u201d</p> <p>Five of the keys to <em>Mustang</em>\u2019s success are G\u00fcne\u015f \u015eensoy, Do\u011fa Do\u011fu\u015flu, Elit I\u015fcan, Tu\u011fba Sun Guro\u011flu, and Ilayda Akdo\u011fan \u2013 the girls who play the sisters \u2013 only one of whom had ever acted before. \u201cIt took us nine months to cast. I saw Elit, the only one who\u2019d acted before, straight away. I found Tu\u011fba in an airport, and then the others auditioned. I was indifferent to training, and to experience. I was looking for certain qualities. They had to be great listeners, and I had to see both the scope of their imagination, and the limits of it. I needed to know the capacity of their ability to dive into a scene, and stay in it for a long time.</p> <p>\u201cAfter they were cast, we did two boot camps: one to give them acting tools, and the other to immerse them in the story. We spoke about the backstory, about what happened between scenes, and we played games and did other exercises. It was very playful. It was about group building. And it worked. The solidarity between them was amazing, the way they protected each other. They became one body with five heads: a single rebellious entity.\u201d</p> <p>Did she ever worry for them? She must have known the film would attract heat in Turkey. \u201cYes. The one time I was really unhappy, we\u2019d had threats that involved them. But they were proud of what they were doing, and I never had the impression we were stealing from them. On the contrary. There are directors who steal something from [young] actors, and it is problematic. What <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/22/harmony-korine-kids-20th-anniversary\" title=\"\">Larry Clark</a> [the director of the controversial <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9a5tZSKDOU\" title=\"\"><em>Kids</em></a>] does upsets me. But we always had their consent, and that of their parents.\u201d</p> <p><em>Mustang</em>\u2019s international success has brought with it some extraordinary experiences for its young stars. Erg\u00fcven wasn\u2019t able, in spite of her best efforts, to bag them tickets for the Oscars (they had to stay back at the hotel). But at least they managed to get themselves photographed with George Clooney at the Toronto film festival.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a89e0b98bd85f832d33948ec1589a1baaa78caa5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a89e0b98bd85f832d33948ec1589a1baaa78caa5/94_0_3285_1971/1000.jpg\" alt=\"G\u00fcne\u015f \u015eensoy, Do\u011fa Do\u011fu\u015flu, Tu\u011fba Sun Guro\u011flu, Elit I\u015fcan and Ilayda Akdo\u011fan in Mustang.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018It took us nine months to cast\u2019: G\u00fcne\u015f \u015eensoy, Do\u011fa Do\u011fu\u015flu, Tu\u011fba Sun Guro\u011flu, Elit I\u015fcan and Ilayda Akdo\u011fan in Mustang.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Canal+</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Erg\u00fcven was born in Ankara, but when she was six months old she moved to Paris with her father, a diplomat, where she remained for the next nine years. \u201cThen we went back to Turkey, after which there were a few years that were extremely important: me and my sister were out on the streets all the time, window-breaking creatures, hardened criminals.\u201d She grins. \u201cWe went back to live in France later, but we spent all our holidays and many weekends in Turkey. My family life was completely Turkish.\u201d</p> <p>She studied literature and African studies at university, after which she enrolled at film school in Paris, one of only two women in her class (the other was <em>Mustang</em>\u2019s co-writer, <a href=\"http://www.dazeddigital.com/artsandculture/article/30507/1/alice-winocour-disorder-mustang-film-war-trauma\" title=\"\">Alice Winocour</a>).</p> <p>Is it harder to get a movie made, even in France where the film industry is still subsidised, if you\u2019re a woman? \u201cI never feel like complaining about it but, yes, I think it is. There is something animal in the way we evaluate people. And I have a soft voice, and I wear clothes with flowers on, and heels, and I come across as fragile, even if that is not the case at all. If I had the body and the voice of an alpha male, it would be easier. It took nine years from leaving film school until <em>Mustang</em> was screened at Cannes, and those years were demoralising. It\u2019s difficult not to be affected. You work for the minimum, to have your roof and four walls, so you can write. It\u2019s not super fun. But it\u2019s more than demoralising. I think [she jabs at her forearm] I took my ego out, literally. It\u2019s gone. After a while, I was almost stammering, as if my voice had disappeared.\u201d</p> <p>What about the awards? Didn\u2019t her ego rampage straight back? \u201cNot really. My mother taught me good lessons. You have to keep your core intact, unmoved, regardless of whether you are praised or criticised.\u201d Still, she has the impression that she has \u201cpassed through the glass in the mirror\u201d at last. Things that were impossible for years are now possible: \u201cActors are actually coming to me.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>[Erdo\u011fan] is making people hate each other. We were always a heterogeneous country, but we lived together in peace</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Meanwhile, she worries for Turkey, increasingly autocratic under its present leader, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/08/recep-tayyip-erdogan-a-woman-is-above-all-else-a-mother-turkish-president\" title=\"\">Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan</a>. \u201cThe one good thing is that Turkey was a democracy \u2013 yes, you can say it in the past tense now. It remains [as a result] extremely vigorous. The population is youthful, and literally simmering. Its cross-currents are moving deeply. You can feel that it will go in one direction, or another. The current government doesn\u2019t tolerate any kind of criticism, not even the smallest joke. People come and go, and he [Erdo\u011fan] will go eventually, too. But the problem is what he\u2019s doing to the fabric of the country. He\u2019s polarising, making people hate each other. We were always a heterogeneous country, but we lived together in peace. Now he\u2019s attacking that. His corruption has been revealed, but he hits back harder and harder, repeating as a mantra absolute lies, and eventually people might start believing him. He\u2019s messing with people\u2019s minds.\u201d</p> <p>The situation for women in Turkey is, she believes, now very grave, for which reason she is happy for her film to be regarded as a contribution to the increasingly muscular and conflicted debate surrounding their rights, their freedom. \u201cThe way he [Erdo\u011fan] speaks: he makes them [women] fragile with his messages, whether subliminal or explicit. There is a certain way, he says, of being a woman: you have to be a mother and at home, and that\u2019s all. When you see a man, you should blush and look down. It\u2019s like something from the middle ages. The subtext is that women are only seen as sexual. That\u2019s why they must cover every inch of their skin. This is dangerous because it generates more violence against them, it makes it OK for men to act like assailants. Rapes happen everywhere, but in Turkey women come out on to the streets to protest because such attacks only seem to echo what the government is saying.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"00d7951dbad89a7f5973f5b756b7fae0080e2212\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/00d7951dbad89a7f5973f5b756b7fae0080e2212/0_83_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Women protest in Ankara February 2015 over the Turkish government\u2019s inadequate response to the murder and alleged rape of \u00d6zgecan Aslan.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Women protest in Ankara, February 2015, over the Turkish government\u2019s inadequate response to the murder and alleged rape of \u00d6zgecan Aslan.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Adem Altan/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This, she notes, is exactly what happened last year, after the murder of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/17/turkey-women-battle-oppression-protest\" title=\"\">\u00d6zgecan Aslan</a>, a university student who was murdered in Mersin after attempting to resist rape by a minibus driver, his father and his friend; protesters were furious at what they saw as the government\u2019s inadequate response to the crime, and to its supposed normalisation of rape, particularly with regard to non-conservative women. Astonishingly, Erdo\u011fan in turn attacked protesters for their behaviour; some of them, un-Islamically, had been seen dancing.</p> <p>Erg\u00fcven\u2019s voice as we discuss all this is light, but somehow it is steely, too, her smile a distraction. My guess is that she will one day make another film in Turkey. For all her watchfulness behind the camera, she is not, I think, one of life\u2019s bystanders. When her country calls \u2013 as it did during the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/may/29/gezi-park-year-after-protests-seeds-new-turkey\" title=\"\">Gezi Park</a> protests of 2013 \u2013 she tends to come running. \u201cFilm is my tool,\u201d she says, more firmly now. \u201cIt\u2019s how I switch people\u2019s minds on to something. It\u2019s how I participate.\u201d</p> <p><em>Mustang is in cinemas now</em></p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-15T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Joseph Fiennes is currently specialising in second acts. This weekend he is in Cannes to promote his film <em>The Last Race</em>, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/24/chariots-of-fire-sequel-greenlit-in-china-joseph-fiennes-eric-liddell\">unofficial Chinese-made sequel to <em>Chariots of Fire</em></a>. Fiennes plays Eric Liddell, the Flying Scotsman who in 1924 famously refused to run on an Olympic Sunday because of his religious beliefs. The film is concerned with the little-known years after that in which Liddell gave up on sporting fame to become a Christian missionary in China.</p> <p>To open that film, Fiennes is taking a couple of days away from rehearsing the comparable afterlife of that other Boy\u2019s Own legend, Lawrence of Arabia. Fiennes takes the lead in Adrian Noble\u2019s Chichester Festival revival of Terence Rattigan\u2019s play <em>Ross</em>, which finds Lawrence home from the desert after something of a breakdown and living under an alias as an officer in the RAF.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I seem to have worn a lot of tights in films, but those are just the films that  worked best</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When I met Fiennes on a sunny lunchtime break from rehearsals in a studio near Clapham Common last week, I put it to him that \u201cWhat happened next?\u201d is always a more interesting human story than the full spotlit glare of celebrity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3d2ba21a3d1062a86738e79454396d0d57c9fdfe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d2ba21a3d1062a86738e79454396d0d57c9fdfe/0_199_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flying Scotsman: as Eric Liddell in The Last Race, the unofficial sequel to Chariots of Fire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Flying Scotsman: as Eric Liddell in The Last Race, the unofficial sequel to Chariots of Fire.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s very true,\u201d he says. \u201cThese two men \u2013 Lawrence and Liddell \u2013 had been the iconic stars of their time. The romance and the achievement stays with us, but there is a cost to that. There is always a cost. Liddell and Lawrence were very dedicated human beings, and when you raise that bar you get challenged and there is fallout.\u201d And inevitable disappointment? \u201cYes. In both cases it is story of humanity versus the cause. It becomes about knowing yourself.\u201d</p> <p>You could make the argument that Fiennes himself is ideally placed for these roles. His own flare of international fame came 18 years ago now, when he illuminated a pair of British films \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/sep/08/shakespeare-in-love-reel-history\"><em>Shakespeare in Love</em></a> and <em>Elizabeth</em> \u2013 which came to dominate the awards season prior to the millennium. <em>Shakespeare in Love</em> won seven Oscars and opened many Hollywood doors to Fiennes, who had more straightforward matin\u00e9e-idol star quality than his edgier elder brother <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/23/ralph-fiennes-i-wish-id-been-more-of-a-punk-but-its-not-in-my-dna-to-be-truly-anarchic\">Ralph</a>. He was offered a five-film contract by Harvey Weinstein and Miramax, then at the height of their powers, having cornered the market in blockbuster literary adaptation and intelligent costume drama. Fiennes turned the offer down.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don\u2019t need any more than I\u00a0have. I don\u2019t have an entourage to pay for: well, I\u00a0do, but they are four and six years old</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He was, he says now, always dubious of the attractions of full-on stardom. He was once told (by the actor Brian Cox) that he was \u201ca character actor trapped in a leading man\u2019s body\u201d and he feels there has always been truth in that. He was anyhow minded to follow his role as Will Shakespeare, chasing Gwyneth Paltrow on the big screen, with a good deal of real Shakespeare onstage (he\u2019d had his first proper break in the mid-1990s in two seasons with the RSC). A couple of years after Weinstein had made his offer he was playing Iago in the West End and Berowne in the National Theatre\u2019s <em>Love\u2019s Labour\u2019s Lost</em>. The film roles he took on were either interestingly independent \u2013 <em>Enemy at the Gates</em>, or \u201crisky\u201d\u2013 <em>Running with Scissors</em> (in which he played a schizophrenic paedophile partly for laughs) or badly misjudged \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/jun/21/culture.peterbradshaw5\"><em>Killing Me Softly</em></a>, one of the few films to receive a 0% rating on the Rotten Tomatoes website.

Theatre was always where he felt most at home. \u201cThere is a versatility available. I may seem to have worn a lot of tights in films, but actually those are just the films that have been most visible or worked best,\u201d he says, with a half-smile. \u201cI have worn jeans a lot, too, but those ones haven\u2019t tended to work so well.\u201d</p> <p>He suggests that, at 46, he feels a bit liberated from those leading-man expectations. I wonder if he ever felt foolish not following the money. \u201cNot at all,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t need any more than I have. I don\u2019t have an entourage to pay for: well, I do, but they are four and six years old.\u201d</p> <p>Fiennes married Swiss model and actor Maria Dolores Dieguez in 2009. With two young children, he says he now chooses work that does not take him too far from home for long stretches of time. \u201cI want to be part of their growing-up,\u201d he says. \u201cI learned early on that the business that I love has no compassion. So my compassion is elsewhere, too\u2026\u201d</p> <p>No compassion in what sense?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e529f93322e7715bddce723dc15101f8946d71ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e529f93322e7715bddce723dc15101f8946d71ad/135_207_2198_1318/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Family man: with his wife, the Swiss model and actor Maria Dolores Dieguez, before they were married in 2009.

I\u2019m not going to go into it, but there was a time when there was something going on in my life that was profoundly important to me, but it was made clear that the show was all that mattered. I was in my 20s then and I thought: OK, that is how this world operates.\u201d</p> <p>After that, he says, he always vowed to keep himself at least one step removed from his working world. His sense of the importance of family is rooted in his own growing-up. He is one of seven children, one of whom was adopted, and a twin (his brother Jake became a notable conservationist after a childhood fascination with taxidermy). Fiennes\u2019s mother was the novelist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/dec/03/martha-fiennes-magnus-fiennes-nativity-covent-garden\">Jennifer Lash</a> who died in 1993 of cancer when he was 23. His father Mark was a farmer who became a photographer aged 40. They are distantly related to Ranulph Fiennes, and very distantly (eighth cousins) to the royal family. Money was tight. The family renovated and sold on the houses they lived in to pay the bills almost every year, moving among Suffolk, Wiltshire and the West of Ireland.</p> <p>Fiennes moved school 14 times. Did he inherit that restlessness? \u201cAs a father myself now looking back, I have no idea how they had the energy to do what they did,\u201d he says. \u201cMoving so many times. But we children just grew up in ignorance and bliss.\u201d He says that from the moment he was selected for a school play aged seven he knew he only ever wanted to be an actor.</p> <p>It surely helped though that Ralph, seven years his senior, was already blazing that trail? \u201cAt home our parents never compared us,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean, there were seven of us kids. Obviously I always looked up to my brother and his work and I have nothing but utter respect. But I never felt we were in competition.\u201d</p> <p>It was the kind of childhood that provided a good grounding for complicated British male role models such as TE Lawrence, who Fiennes is currently inhabiting. None of the seven children went to university, but they were encouraged to discuss books and art all the time. \u201cI remember my mother taking the family to [Lawrence\u2019s cottage] Clouds Hill when I was 12 or 13,\u201d he says, \u201cand there was literature around on Lawrence as I grew up, and maybe some discussion of him. But mostly I was too busy being a teenager.\u201d</p> <p>Now what he is finding as he researches the history through Rattigan\u2019s play is that Lawrence\u2019s struggles in Syria have never been resolved. \u201cIt\u2019s what we see when we switch on the news,\u201d he says. \u201cI am appalled to see how much of modern history was set in motion by two civil servants called Sykes and Picot.\u201d (It was the British colonel Sir Tatton Sykes who arbitrarily divided what is now Syria and Iraq with the French, betraying Lawrence\u2019s promises to the Arab rebel forces. The border was created 100 years ago this week. \u201cI should like to draw a line from the \u2018e\u2019 in Acre to the last \u2018k\u2019 in Kirkuk,\u201d Sykes infamously said of his reasoning). \u201cThe land grab was appalling,\u201d Fiennes says. \u201cBoy did they fuck up. Lawrence knew back then what they were creating. And you can <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2016/apr/08/lawrence-of-arabia-wouldnt-have-been-surprised-by-the-rise-of-isis\">draw a direct line from there to Isis</a>.\u201d</p> <p>As well as exploring this history he is, he says, enjoying the challenge of discovering a more intimate idea of Lawrence compared to Peter O\u2019Toole\u2019s Tehnicolor characterisation. He suggests doubt as the trait in which there is always most drama. \u201cDoubt is crucial, I think, in every character I have ever played. I discovered it first with Dennis Potter\u2019s play <em>Son of Man </em>which Mary Whitehouse tried to ban. To portray Christ with doubt was a pretty brave thing for Potter to do\u2026\u201d</p> <p>There must, I suggest, have been plenty of doubt for him in the other film for which he has recently made headlines \u2013 his role in a Sky Arts short in which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/28/joseph-fiennes-michael-jackson-race-problems-oscarssowhite\">he plays Michael Jackson</a>. At the time of the controversy around this year\u2019s all-white Oscar shortlists, he was widely and predictably criticised for having accepted the role. Why did he do it?</p> <p>\u201cWell,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a biopic of Michael Jackson or anything which, of course, I would never have done. It is part of a little series called <em>Urban Myths</em>, one of several films. Ours is a 20-minute satire sketch about a road trip taken by Marlon Brando, Michael and Liz Taylor near the end of Jackson\u2019s life. It is a satirical comedy which the press latched on to at the time of the Oscar storm.\u201d</p> <p>At the time, Fiennes talked about his belief in colour-blind casting \u2013 was that his reasoning? \u201cI am very much of the mind that casting should be as wide open as possible and that it should never be tokenism,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that is not the argument for doing this. He was a black man, and this then throws up the question of blackface. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/05/joseph-fiennes-michael-jackson-shocked-to-be-cast\">I did it because I liked the script</a>. It\u2019s a fantasy. But I guess I leave it to the audience to judge. I am very happy to be educated about it.\u201d</p> <p>Such choices make it tempting to view Fiennes as part of that current perceived clique of (brilliant but) privileged white male British actors (Benedict Cumberbatch talking lazily about \u201ccoloured\u201d colleagues springs to mind), but that seems too easy a prejudice. Fiennes\u2019s commitment to his craft seems robust and deeply held.</p> <p>I wonder if he acts in order to understand himself better. \u201cPossibly. But I don\u2019t think it works like that. I meet people in my business who have this extraordinary ability to understand human nature in their work, but in real life they don\u2019t seem to have the first clue.\u201d</p> <p>You wouldn\u2019t put Fiennes himself into that category. He has few illusions about what his career has taught him: that scene-stealing first acts don\u2019t go on for ever. \u201cI try to never do anything but my best,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you get to learn that 90% of the time that means utter and complete failure. And then you pick yourself up and you have another go.\u201d</p> <p>Ross<em> is on at the Chichester Festival Theatre, 3-25 June.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-15T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p><strong>My earliest memory is repugnance towards over-cooked sprouts,</strong> an essential part of our family\u2019s menu, boiled until blanched. The worst punishment possible was being told I had to stay at the table and finish eating them, instead of running back into the woods, where things were more interesting. I was scarred by sprouts.</p> <p><strong>I had a problem with eggs as a child</strong>, no end of grief. I could cope with dipping soldiers in soft yolks, but the whites would make me gag. Later I collected birds\u2019 eggs, but never saw them as food. To me they were beautifully made jewels, fascinating treasures. Each stone-curlew egg, for instance, has a dark brown squiggle pattern identifiable to its mother. I also collected chocolate Easter eggs \u2013 I\u2019d not eat them, just save them, for years, arranged on shelves in my wardrobe.<br /></p> <p><strong>I\u2019d sometimes try to trade species for food </strong>and couldn\u2019t understand why to, say, an ice cream man, a quintessentially perfect six-spotted beetle in a matchbox or 10 tadpoles in a jam jar weren\u2019t worth the price of a Sky Ray lolly.<br /></p> <p><strong>I gravitate towards considering how form influences function</strong>. The length of hummingbirds\u2019 beaks determines the precise species of flower that they can feed on. I have an extensive skull collection and one of the joys of having a skull in your hand is that you can see a part of an animal\u2019s anatomy which otherwise you wouldn\u2019t, unless it was yawning right in front of your face, which is rarely, and even then it would be covered in flesh. Finding a fox skull when I was a kid and looking at the dentition and contemplating why it had two canine teeth and other sharper little teeth and only a few molars at the back, got my mind working, thinking about not just what it would have eaten but its whole lifestyle.<br /></p> <p><strong>I rent a barn which is a repository of everything I\u2019ve saved from my life,</strong> including food packaging \u2013 lolly, sweet and chocolate wrappers, pertinent to different times, like the Double Decker given to me by my first girlfriend. All my positive early food memories are of sweet things. On the route home from secondary school (in Southampton) there were three corner shops devoted to selling sweets - parma violets, rice-paper flying saucers containing acrid sherbet, mojos, individually wrapped Trebors and those sherbet lemons which cut the roof of the mouth. I\u2019d also buy toy cigarettes and bubble-gums but only for the accompanying collectible cards. In my office, framed, is a waxy piece of paper from a childhood Bazooka Joe gum with the image of a kestrel on it.</p> <p><strong>As a teen, I kept a kestrel \u2013</strong> until the police turned up and said no. I\u2019d be home alone from school each lunchtime and I\u2019d sit with the kestrel, eating my cheese and pickled onion Mother\u2019s Pride sandwich, holding an air-rifle and peeping out of the back window, trying to shoot a sparrow to feed it. I started buying hatchery offal \u2013 day-old male chicks that aren\u2019t going to lay eggs \u2013 for \u00a35 a bag. I\u2019d keep them in the freezer and defrost them on the lid of the kettle. Me being asked to wash my hands before a meal is sort of a family joke.<br /></p> <p><strong>There\u2019s so many interesting ways species gain nutrition</strong>, from synthesising minerals in bacterial form, to cannibalism on their young or mate; from having food spat into their mouths because they don\u2019t have functioning mouth parts during their first two instils [development phases], to knowing instinctually from day one which non-essential organs to eat so that their prey is kept alive and fresh longest. But I\u2019ve never in my observations witnessed an enjoyment in killing, or a lack of purpose to killing, by any species, except humans. And the greater beauty of animals is the way they knit together into something collectively complex and functional, for themselves and for the future health and sustenance of the environment. That\u2019s why there are no bad animals.<br /></p> <p><strong>One Christmas, when home from university</strong>, every few hours I was testing the food decisions of common shrews in a Perspex choice chamber I\u2019d built, with nine compartments containing earthworms, crickets, mincemeat and so on. Common shrews have a high metabolic rate and must eat at intervals throughout the day and night. The problem was that our big family meal was running catastrophically late and I needed the dining table to do my tests and calorific calculations on and I was stressing, \u201cHurry, please. Eat up, eat up!\u201d So Christmas dinner was completely ruined by my optimum foraging experiments.<br /></p> <p><strong>I gave up meat 20, 25 years ago; </strong>crisps and soft drinks six years ago, bread four years ago. I\u2019ve purged my diet of many things over the years \u2013 fat, sugar, salt, alcohol \u2013 But the only thing that I felt any difference from \u2013 a reduction in lethargy \u2013 was giving up bread. Of all my purges, that\u2019s the only thing I noticed having a benefit.<br /></p> <p><strong>We were stay</strong><strong>ing with a relatively remote grou</strong><strong>p of Masai in Tanzania</strong>, examining mating structures, and they insisted on giving us a mug of blood for breakfast, bled from a cow\u2019s neck using a quaint little bow and arrow and a gourd. I\u2019d long given up meat, but accepted graciously. There were two types on the menu each morning for guests, the elderly and pregnant women \u2013 liquid blood and coagulated blood on a stick. Even if I drank a lot of water afterwards the metallic taste wouldn\u2019t subside until mid-morning. And in Indonesia, for 10 days, I was given dried freshwater eels to eat which had the texture of bacon rind dipped in diesel oil.<br /></p> <p><strong>I remember sitting with my stepdaughter in a park with my two dogs</strong> and all four of us were sharing an ice cream, taking turns licking it, and this woman came over and said, \u201cThat\u2019s the most disgusting thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d But if you\u2019re handling animals, dead animals, animal food or even animal excrement, it\u2019s wholly organic and the risk of infection very slim. Our mouths \u2013 which we put our hands to 250 times a day \u2013 are full of bacteria designed to protect us, and dogs\u2019 mouths are even better armed. And wolves even more so.<br /></p> <p><strong>Although I have a physiological need for Indian food </strong>\u2013 especially tandoori king prawn masala \u2013 I don\u2019t eat takeaway meals and all their monosodium glutamate any more. But I have a huge collection of takeaway containers, to hold invertebrates, under my kitchen sink and on top of cupboards. I\u2019ve never had a dinner party, but four years ago someone I know came round to my house [in the New Forest], then invited his friends and family for a meal there and it was the closest I\u2019ve come to a nervous breakdown. I don\u2019t like people moving anything in my kitchen and I\u2019m always trying to optimise food-making and dishwasher stacking processes in terms of energy I expend for energy I get out. My girlfriend lives and runs a zoo on the Isle of Wight, so I\u2019m usually cooking for myself and don\u2019t think twice about having the same meal for days in a row; I find it comforting.<br /></p> <p><strong>For years I took my stepdaughter around the world</strong>, making documentaries in remote places, and she\u2019d be constantly hungry, so I\u2019d stuff my pockets with treats.<em> </em>When she was seven, I offered her one of those dry Nutri-Grain biscuit bars with ghastly chocolate paste inside and she said, \u201cI\u2019m not having that.\u201d So, as a running joke, I kept it in my pocket, the wrapper now falling apart but taped up, and I\u2019ve offered it to her, straight-faced, on every journey we\u2019ve made in the 14 years since; most recently in Sri Lanka last week.<br /></p> <p><em>Fingers in the Sparkle Jar: a Memoir is out now (Ebury, \u00a320). <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/385272/s/fingers-in-the-sparkle-jar/\">Click here to buy a copy for \u00a316 from the Guardian Bookshop</a></em></p>",

Tucked inside the bag of one of the travellers, neuropsychologist Sonia Moreno, is the reason they are here: a wad of unfinished, hand-drawn charts of family trees.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/colombia-venezuela/giv-12515JccetoAD0pdO\" data-alt=\"Map Venezuela Colombia\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/colombia-venezuela/giv-12515JccetoAD0pdO\">Map Venezuela Colombia</a> </figure>  <p>The people whose names are circled on the charts have <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Huntingtons-disease/Pages/Introduction.aspx\">Huntington\u2019s disease</a>, an incurable genetic brain disorder that usually starts between the ages of 35 and 45 years. It begins with personality changes that can make them aggressive, violent, uninhibited, anxious and depressed. The disease progresses slowly, robbing them first of the control of their body, which jerks and twists seemingly of its own will, and then their ability to walk, talk and think until, about 20 years after the symptoms first begin, they die. Their children, each of whom has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease, watch and wait to see if it will happen to them. It is in this way that the disease strangles families.</p> <p>With Moreno is Ignacio Mu\u00f1oz-Sanjuan, vice president of translational biology at <a href=\"http://chdifoundation.org/\">CHDI Foundation</a>, a US nonprofit research organisation that aims to find ways to prevent or slow down the progression of the disease. The foundation spent $140m\u2013$150m (\u00a397m-\u00a3104m) on research last year, but Mu\u00f1oz-Sanjuan is not here on official business. He\u2019s here for Factor-H, an initiative he founded four years ago to help with the other end of the problem \u2013 poor families with Huntington\u2019s struggling in Latin America.</p> <p>With money from fundraisers and occasional small donations \u2013 a thousand dollars here and there from companies that want to remain nameless \u2013 he helps people such as Janeth Mosquera, the third traveller, who runs a one-woman patients\u2019 association to aid sufferers. This mainly takes the form of advice and support but also of gifts: food and bedsheets for the adults (incontinence is an issue in the later stages of the disease), cuddly toys for the young children, of which there are many. Mu\u00f1oz-Sanjuan also connects with people like Moreno, also here volunteering outside her full-time job at the University of Antioquia in Medellin, 90 miles to the east.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Such is the stigma associated with the disease that some live their lives locked up and out of sight</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cYou\u2019re the only ones to have come,\u201d says a fraught-looking woman as they arrive at their guest house. Several of her cousins have Huntington\u2019s disease and she helped to arrange the trip. \u201cIt\u2019s a forgotten place.\u201d The three dump their bags, spray on insect repellent, and make their way to the first house.</p> <p>We meet Diego (not his real name), a 40-year-old man in a dark breeze-block shack. Sitting in a wooden chair, which he was led to tenderly but with some difficulty by his elderly mother who cared for his father before him, his face contorts with pain and his eyes dart around the room uncontrollably; his body writhes and his limbs fling themselves about. These involuntary body movements gave the disease one of its early names, Huntington\u2019s Chorea, from the Greek word for dance. People with the disease look more like they\u2019re being controlled by a malicious and untiring puppeteer.</p> <p>Diego can no longer speak but his groans, the grinding of his teeth and the constant squeaking of his chair fill the room as his family, their faces sombre, listen to Mosquera. There\u2019s a drug called tetrabenazine that might help to control his movements, but at $400 a month it\u2019s way beyond their means. She can help them write to their local health system but applications are often not successful. She might be able to help with a special mattress to ease his bedsores. Getting it here won\u2019t be easy.</p> <p>His younger sister, in her late 20s, is standing quietly by the door doing her best to stay still. The symptoms have started in her, too. She will share Diego\u2019s and her father\u2019s fate, as might her young children who are tugging at her shorts.</p> <p>The story is depressingly similar at each house we visit. At each, plastic chairs are unfolded and the large families sit and listen. Afterwards, Moreno sits with the matriarchs and tries to complete her family trees \u2013 they sprawl, spreading over several pages and ending in question marks and phone numbers, lines scribbled out and redrawn as new information emerges.</p> <p>Huntington\u2019s disease, which is caused by a mutation in one gene, is present around the world. It is thought to affect one in 10,000 people, mostly of European descent \u2013 but is most prevalent in pockets in Latin American countries, Colombia and Venezuela particularly, where it is thought to have arrived with European sailors who settled during colonisation.</p> <p>\u201cIt was the perfect scenario for the gene to take hold,\u201d explains Michael Hayden, a Huntington\u2019s researcher and professor of genetics at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, of the gene\u2019s arrival in Latin America. \u201cPeople lived in clusters in isolated areas so there wasn\u2019t much migration in or out, cousins married cousins. And, especially early on, you had these large Catholic families.\u201d</p> <p>Because symptoms emerge after the age of sexual reproduction, the disease is able to flow down the generations \u2013 unlike genetic diseases that kill or disable people before child-rearing age. Ten children a generation soon add up to very large families. The disease put down roots.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f83e8a7e37afc3eec31d411fba03927538305a91\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f83e8a7e37afc3eec31d411fba03927538305a91/0_18_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jos\u00e9 Rafael (in the red top) supports his family, which has been devastated by Huntington\u2019s disease.

Together, these sequences of nucleotides make a recipe that cells use to make proteins. The Huntington\u2019s mutation is a repetition of three nucleotides: a stutter in the genetic recipe that means cells make a large, mutant version of the huntingtin protein that kills brain cells. More than 40 repeats of this three-nucleotide sequence and an individual will develop the disease. The more repeats they have, the earlier the disease kicks in. Sometimes it starts during childhood.</p> <p>Although there are no treatments to change the disease\u2019s course, says Bernhard Landwehrmeyer, a neurologist at the University of Ulm in Germany who advises the CHDI Foundation, there are drugs that can help to manage the symptoms. Antidepressants for mood and irritability, antipsychotics and tetrabenazine for the movement \u2013 although all drugs need to be given by professionals who can monitor for side-effects. This is especially so with tetrabenazine, which can slow people down to a point that they feel like they\u2019re moving through jelly. \u201cThese drugs aren\u2019t cure-alls,\u201d he says. \u201cThey won\u2019t magically change lives for people in developing countries, but for some a drug like tetrabenazine or an antidepressant can help.\u201d</p> <p>Tetrabenazine helped the family of Doris Echeverria Ripoll, who runs another patients\u2019 association in Juan de Acosta, a town in the north-east of Colombia, and whose father is in the later stages of the disease. \u201cIt meant he could hold our hands again for a while, which meant a lot for us,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Nobody knows how many people have Huntington\u2019s in Colombia. The country is emerging from 50 years of guerrilla wars \u2013 the river to Bellavista in the north-west is still patrolled by heavily armed military boats that we had to register with; only for the past decade have parts of the north-east of the country been safe to enter, so its health system is understandably weak. Mariela Oviedo, who runs a patients\u2019 association, knows of about 500 nuclear families with the disease in the north-east of the country, Ripoll knows of 33 in Juan de Acosta, and Mosquera knows of about 200 in Bogot\u00e1 and the north-west. Not counting the many people as yet unknown to these three volunteers, estimates that include more distant family members run into several thousands at risk.</p> <p>With Mu\u00f1oz-Sanjuan I travel onward to the Caribbean coast and Santa Marta, an emerging tourist spot where backpackers party on rooftop bars. A four-hour drive south, along dusty roads and past rickety fences and forlorn-looking cows, is a region called San Angel, which we visit before Juan de Acosta, where the concentration of people with Huntington\u2019s disease is the second-highest in the world.</p> <p>At each house we visit with Oviedo or Ripoll, the food and drinks they deliver are guzzled straight away. \u201cFood and water are a big issue here,\u201d says Mu\u00f1oz-Sanjuan of San Angel, where the poverty seems worst. Patients with the disease have an immense hunger. They have to eat around 5,000 calories a day. \u201cNobody knows exactly why but it\u2019s not just from the movement \u2013 marathon runners don\u2019t even eat that much.\u201d</p> <p>Intense poverty leads to desperate actions. In some instances, healthy relatives who can get work leave their loved ones tied up at home so they can\u2019t cause harm to themselves or to others. Indeed such is the stigma associated with the disease that some live their lives locked up and out of sight. Towards the end, most sufferers choke or starve to death in the rags they wear as clothes. There is no dignity in this death. \u201cAt the very least,\u201d says Mu\u00f1oz-Sanjuan, \u201cthere needs to be a proper census, so that if we find a treatment these people can get it.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>With no success, drug companies have moved away from these difficult neurodegenerative diseases</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The hunt for a treatment is on. In September last year researchers led by <a href=\"https://iris.ucl.ac.uk/iris/browse/profile?upi=SJTAB21\">Professor Sarah Tabrizi at UCL</a> in London began the human testing of a drug that, if successful, would be the first to slow down the progression of the disease. \u201cBecause the mutant protein is expressed so ubiquitously throughout the brain it\u2019s difficult to target with treatment,\u201d she says. \u201cInstead, it\u2019s more efficient to go right to the beginning \u2013 to the gene.\u201d</p> <p>New technology means scientists can now do that. The drug, <a href=\"http://huntingtonsdiseasenews.com/tag/ionis-httrx/\">Ionis-HTTRx</a>, developed by the California biotech firm Ionis Pharmaceuticals, is a gene-silencing drug, a molecule small enough to enter the cell and intercept the genetic instructions for the protein before it can be made \u2013 take out the messenger and you can stop the mutant protein from forming. Getting the drug to the brain is difficult. It has to be injected with a four-inch needle into the liquid that surrounds the spine. From there, it travels up to the brain and into the brain cells, most of which are tucked away in hard-to-reach places.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re targeting a 50% reduction in the huntingtin protein,\u201d says Tabrizi, who stresses that this first trial will test only for safety \u2013 a necessary step before testing for effectiveness in larger numbers of patients. This trial, involving only 36 patients in small groups, will be carried out in the UK, Canada and Germany at hi-tech treatment centres such as the <a href=\"https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lwenc\">Leonard Wolfson Experimental Neurology Centre in London</a>. The team hopes to finish the safety trial by the end of 2017.</p> <p>Managing expectations among patients is a necessary component of these early trials. Many drugs don\u2019t make the transition from tests in animals with small brains to human beings.</p> <p>A lot is riding on this trial. A cure or a treatment for such a terrible disease would change the lives of many people: an estimated 8,500 in the UK and 36,000 in the US, for instance. In 2013, the Swiss drugs firm Roche signed a deal with Ionis Pharmaceuticals for a deal worth up to $362m for the rights to take the drug through the necessarily large and expensive tests for effectiveness and then regulatory approval if it proves safe. Ionis will also get royalties on the future sales of the drug.</p> <p>Advanced therapeutics for rare, so-called orphan diseases will be expensive. An extreme example is the price of Glybera, developed by the Dutch company Uniqure to combat a rare disease that causes pancreatitis, which was set at $1m per patient. Ionis-HTTRx will not be as expensive as Glybera \u2013 nowhere near \u2013 but it will still be so expensive that only governments and insurance companies will be able to afford it. Glybera is administered only once, whereas Ionis-HTTRx would be taken many times, meaning the drug company could recoup costs and make profit over a patient\u2019s lifetime rather than in one lump sum.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/gene-silencing/giv-12515fNr28r5w4eiv/\" data-alt=\"Gene silencing graphic\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/gene-silencing/giv-12515fNr28r5w4eiv/\">Gene silencing graphic</a> </figure>  <p>There\u2019s another reasons this trial is important. \u201cThe pharmaceutical industry in particular became more interested in Huntington\u2019s because it\u2019s rare but not <em>too</em> rare,\u201d says Tabrizi. \u201cAnd because we absolutely know the cause \u2013 a mutation in one gene that makes one mutant protein \u2013 it is a good proof of the principle that other neurodegenerative diseases caused by mutant proteins are treatable.\u201d These other diseases include Alzheimer\u2019s, Parkinson\u2019s and motor neurone disease, the causes of which are as yet not fully known and definitely more complicated. \u201cIf we can slow down or reverse Huntington\u2019s it means we can theoretically do the same with the others.\u201d</p> <p>Such a signal would reinvigorate an industry that over the past few decades has ploughed tens of billions of dollars into finding a treatment. With no success, drug companies have moved away from these difficult neurodegenerative diseases.</p> <p>Other pharma giants will be watching with interest to see how other technologies being worked on for Huntington\u2019s are faring. They include things such as zinc finger proteins packaged into viruses, RNA interference compounds, and even gene-editing with new Crispr technology, all of which have technical and \u2013 in the case of gene-editing of embryos with Crispr \u2013 ethical hurdles yet to overcome.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a8103e6a37e27610ec65d990f20131608a675f7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a8103e6a37e27610ec65d990f20131608a675f7a/0_774_3712_4640/800.jpg\" alt=\"Ricardo, 39, lost his job at a coffee plantation.

Though unsteady on his feet, he now sells eggs by the side of the road to support himself and his family.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Garcia for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These two stories \u2013 one of multimillion-pound deals and exciting scientific potential and the other of abject poverty \u2013 aren\u2019t as separate as they first seem. The huntingtin gene, from which scientists have learned about the disease and on which all potential gene-targeted therapies hinge, was discovered thanks to studies done by US researchers between 1978 and 2002 in impoverished Latin American communities just over the border from Juan de Acosta and San Angel on the shores on Venezuela\u2019s Lake Maracaibo. The same circumstances that allowed the disease to take hold in Colombia had allowed it to do so to devastating effect in the small fishing villages of Barranquitas and San Luis where the concentration of the disease is the highest in the world.</p> <p>Scientists have tried to help, chiefly Nancy Wexler, a geneticist from Columbia University in New York, who led the pioneering studies. On the site of an old brothel in Maracaibo, Wexler (with help from the Danish drug company Lundbeck, which makes tetrabenazine) set up a hospice, Casa Hogar, which took in around 60 patients and gave them food and medical care. With Venezuela\u2019s economy in a tailspin and increasing violence, especially in impoverished areas, the hospice has for the past two years not been able to take patients in or provide them with care.</p> <p>\u201cNancy is devastated that she hasn\u2019t been able to return,\u201d says Sir Michael Rawlins, the former head of the UK\u2019s drug regulator, Nice, and a friend of Wexler\u2019s. He and Wexler have tried to arrange for scientists to provide more help to Casa Hogar through the British ambassador in Venezuela. \u201cLike all scientists, she felt that we owed something to the villagers and Casa Hogar was an attempt to try to give something back. She wanted to make sure that if we ever found a treatment they would have access to it.\u201d</p> <p>Despite still not having access to help, these villagers continue to contribute to science: cell lines taken from the samples they donated are sitting in a biorepository at the Coriell Institute for Medical Research in New Jersey, where they are available to academics, biotechs and drug companies, which can make them into stem cells and grow them into neurons to experiment on. It is unclear how much these families know about such use of their cells, given that the technology was not imaginable even to the scientists when the villagers agreed to participate in studies.</p> <p>Such vulnerability exists across the border in Colombia, too. As we travelled through San Angel a familiar story was heard. Several families spoke of \u201cdoctors with computers\u201d who had visited in October last year and taken blood from all family members, including from babies, for testing for the huntingtin gene. None of the families were sure where the doctors were from, but they were under the impression that the doctors would return the following November with the test results or some help. They have not yet come back.</p> <p>Later in Bogot\u00e1, the capital, we met Antonio Berm\u00fadez, coordinator of the genetic and chronic diseases group at Colombia\u2019s National Institute of Health, who confirmed that it was his team that took the samples, from 177 individuals, at the request of the local secretary of health for San Angel and the surrounding area, who wanted an idea of the size of the problem.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2694bafd9cfdb02ba1b9b042af8743f2def00a10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2694bafd9cfdb02ba1b9b042af8743f2def00a10/0_371_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Edson, 16 years into his disease, with his wife and daughter.

He knows of no such plans. He also confirmed that they took blood from babies and young children knowing that they would not be able to give them their results until they were adults.</p> <p>That the government is trying to get to grips with the problem is encouraging but that they did it so invasively \u2013 and that the fate of these people is locked away in government files \u2013 speaks to the vulnerability of sufferers and their families. The truth is that those \u201cdoctors with computers\u201d could have been anyone.</p> <p>Finding a solution is complicated. Ionis-HTTRx, if effective, will be prohibitively expensive to these communities. Even if it weren\u2019t, they don\u2019t have any local access to medical care, let alone the hi-tech centres and doctors needed to deliver the drug. That these communities have been used for research but are unlikely to benefit from any breakthrough troubles Tabrizi, as it does all Huntington\u2019s disease scientists.</p> <p>It\u2019s the reason that Mu\u00f1oz-Sanjuan started Factor-H. \u201cI\u2019m worried that drug companies haven\u2019t reached a sense of consciousness about the communities that live in developing countries,\u201d he says. \u201cThe people who contributed to what is the basis of all these gene therapies \u2013 does anyone have a plan in place to make these drugs available to them? How are people who don\u2019t even have food to eat going to get support from their government to access any of these new gene therapies if they work?\u201d</p> <p>Even before we find out if they work, he says, their current pressing needs should not be insurmountable: clean water, a means of providing their own food, community care to help ease the burden of care on family members, family-planning education, mobile neurology units to help local doctors to deliver and monitor currently available drugs that could make their lives more bearable.</p> <p>To place all the responsibility on the scientific world would be both unfair and unwise, says <a href=\"https://genetics.med.harvard.edu/faculty/gusella\">James Gusella, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School </a>in Massachusetts, who was part of the international collaboration that first identified the Huntington\u2019s gene and its defect. \u201cThe purpose of science is to gain knowledge,\u201d he says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2016/may/10/what-makes-tumours-tick-genomics-pave-the-way-for-tailored-treatments\">What makes tumours tick? Genomics pave the way for tailored treatments</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe clusters of patients in Venezuela were studied from that point of view and as yet, although these gene therapies are exciting, it hasn\u2019t provided a treatment.\u201d Unpicking the medical from the social causes of poverty, he says, is difficult.</p> <p>\u201cAs scientists we can use the knowledge that we gain to advise and help the powers that be [governments and international agencies] but ultimately it is they who must be involved in implementation.\u201d</p> <p>Hayden, who is also chief scientific officer at Teva Pharmaceuticals, an Israeli drug company working on Huntington\u2019s treatments, says that drug companies can and should play a big part. \u201cInnovation should be rewarded in developed countries,\u201d he says. \u201cThere needs to be a sense of corporate and social responsibility embedded in the company if we say that our primary goal is to improve health and make people feel better. It also needs passion, commitment and drive from individuals to hold companies accountable \u2013 it needs champions.\u201d</p> <p>There is a precedent. Expensive antiretrovirals are provided free to impoverished HIV sufferers in developing countries thanks to lobbying from a community of passionate activists that began in the 1980s. Huntington\u2019s, as a rare disease, will by its nature not prompt lobbying in such numbers. But if people are looking for ways to help, in Colombia at least, giving support to the work of the handful of volunteers and doctors who have built up the much-needed trust of families will be a good place to start, says Mu\u00f1oz-Sanjuan.</p> <p>Building a sense of consciousness among people who can help \u2013 not only drug companies but governments and research organisations \u2013 will be more tricky, but possible when the story is set out more widely. As with the people in one of Moreno\u2019s sprawling family trees, there are lines that connect them all.</p> <p><em>This article was produced with the help of the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting</em></p> <h2>Huntington\u2019s: the search for a cure</h2> <p><strong>1374</strong> Epidemic of \u201cdancing mania\u201d condition in Europe.</p> <p><strong>1500</strong> Swiss physician and polymath Paracelsus coins the term chorea Saint Vitus (after the patron saint of dancers), recognising several different forms and suggesting that the nervous system is involved.</p> <p><strong>1832</strong> British physician John Elliotson identifies an inherited form of chorea (other infectious causes of chorea had been described earlier).</p> <p><strong>1872</strong> American physician George Huntington writes the first thorough clinical description of the disease that will go on to bear his name.</p> <p><strong>1955</strong> The disease is found to be prevalent in the Lake Maracaibo region of Venezuela.</p> <p><strong>1967</strong> Woody Guthrie, the American singer-songwriter, dies from complications of Huntington\u2019s.</p> <p><strong>1983</strong> The approximate location of the gene that causes the disease is narrowed down to chromosome 4.</p> <p><strong>1993</strong> The gene that causes the disease is identified.</p> <p><strong>1996</strong> HD transgenic mice are developed.</p> <p><strong>2015</strong> First in-man safety testing of Ionis Pharmaceutical\u2019s gene-silencing therapy begins.</p>",

      "body": "<p>For America, 1968 was a convulsive year: riots, assassinations, Vietnam and the election in November of Richard Nixon. For <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/bobdylan\">Bob Dylan</a>, 1968 was a year of withdrawal and rural domesticity. After the gruelling world tour of 1966 and his motorcycle accident, the singer had gone to ground at Hi Lo Ha, the rambling home he had bought in 1965 in rural upstate New York. Between the release of <em>John Wesley Harding</em> in December 1967 and <em>Nashville Skyline</em> in 1969, there wasn\u2019t much in the way of writing or recording, and for one particularly good reason: Dylan and his wife Sara had three young children to bring up.</p> <p>But such simple explanations for his absence didn\u2019t satisfy his more ardent fans. The people of Woodstock did their best to prevent a steady stream of fans finding the Dylan house, but were not always successful. One young hippy couple had to be escorted, naked, from the main bedroom. Perhaps to scotch the rumours swirling around him, Dylan agreed to a photo feature at his home which ran in the <em>Saturday Evening Post</em>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/literary-mixtapes-by-electric-literature/2016/may/04/literary-mixtape-david-meanss-soundtrack-for-reflecting-on-the-vietnam-war\">Literary Mixtape: David Means's soundtrack for reflecting on the Vietnam War</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://www.landyvision.com\">Elliott Landy </a>had taken photographs for the Band\u2019s debut album that Dylan had liked. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/jul/19/features11\">His informal pictures of Dylan</a>, strumming a guitar by the trees or seated beside a pile of logs, clearly chimed with the mood Dylan wanted to project and he was invited back to Woodstock to take some family shots a few weeks later.</p> <p>Here, two-year-old Jesse, mouth full of sandwich, is looking more comfortable with the camera than his dad, who, with glasses off and cigarettes at the side of the table, is without two of the props that were in so many photographs of him two long years before. This is perhaps as close to the real Bob as you\u2019re going to get.</p> <p>Landy says: \u201cHe was very happy, in love with his lovely and gracious wife, Sara, and with his family. He was hiding from the world, savouring the magical experience of having young children. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t publish the pictures for many years. He cherished his privacy.\u201d</p> <p>Jesse is now a video director, activist and campaigner. Bob Dylan will be 75 this month and releases his 37th studio album, <em>Fallen Angels</em>, this weekend. Landy moved to Woodstock shortly after this photo session. He\u2019s still there. </p> <p><em>Elliott Landy: The Band Photographs 1968-69 is at Proud Camden, London from 9 June to 24 July; <a href=\"https://www.proudonline.co.uk/exhibitions\">proudonline.com</a>;<a href=\"http://www.landyvision.com\"> landyvision.com</a></em></p>",

The premise \u2013 a memoir in the form of a collection of hotel reviews that span 40-odd years in the reviewer\u2019s life \u2013 is both original and entertaining. The work of one <a href=\"http://rateyourlodging.com/post/121273269582/reginald-morse\" title=\"\">Reginald Edward Morse</a>, a motivational speaker by trade and top reviewer at <a href=\"http://rateyourlodging.com/\" title=\"\">RateYourLodging.com</a>, the collection constitutes the unexpected magnum opus of a middle-aged man whose life is marked by loneliness and disappointment \u2013 a broken marriage, an estranged daughter, affairs, money troubles.

The conceit is simple: four clown characters have decided to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the death of the bard. Toby Park, the intellectual, is determined to shatter the complacency of the well-fed bourgeois audience by confronting us with our own mortality. His companions \u2013 Stephan Kreiss, Aitor Basauri and Petra Massey \u2013 reluctantly go along with him. There follow 75 deaths from Shakespeare\u2019s 37 plays, which have been eviscerated for this production.</p> <p>The execution, however, is anything but simple: a flow, spurt, jab, battery, fusillade of comic set pieces involving sticks, swords, guns and a sausage machine (ingenious designs by Lucy Bradridge). Custom does not stale their infinite variety. There are no flies on these actors when it comes to inventing ways to die \u2013 any flies involved in the action are meant to be there and play their parts heroically, filmed in close-up and projected on to a back screen (did I miss the disclaimer that no animals were harmed in the making?).</p> <p>What lifts the show beyond the level of a gag-fest is the gradual revelation of the hopes and fears and interconnectedness of the four performers. Aitor\u2019s pretentious encounters with Shakespeare\u2019s talking head (videos by Sam Bailey), Stephan\u2019s unrequited love for Petra, who is desolate that Ophelia\u2019s off-stage death is not eligible for inclusion. Cleverly interwoven with Shakespeare\u2019s texts, these combine with them to bring just the right amount of emotion to make the humour poignant as well as hilarious.</p> <p>\u2022<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://www.atgtickets.com/shows/the-complete-deaths/theatre-royal-brighton/\">The Complete Deaths is at the Theatre Royal, Brighton</a>, then <a href=\"http://www.spymonkey.co.uk/the-complete-deaths.html\">tours until 30 November</a><br /></p>",

      "body": "<p>Marking comes with the territory of teaching but, as the weather gets better, most of us would rather avoid spending all evening with only a set of books for company.</p> <p>In fact, marking was identified as the single biggest contributor to teachers\u2019 unsustainable workload in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/415874/Government_Response_to_the_Workload_Challenge.pdf\">2014 Workload Challenge</a> (pdf). Since then, two new reports \u2013 a Department for Education (DfE) <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/511256/Eliminating-unnecessary-workload-around-marking.pdf\">independent workload review</a> (pdf) and an Oxford research review entitled <a href=\"https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/public/files/Publications/EEF_Marking_Review_April_2016.pdf\">\u201cA Marked Improvement\u201d</a> (pdf) \u2013 have highlighted ways to cut the marking mountain without affecting students\u2019 progress. So here are some of their key recommendations to buy you a bit more time in the sun.</p> <h2>1 Stop writing too much </h2> <p>There is little evidence to suggest that extensive written comments, often in different coloured pens, have a big impact on pupil progress. In fact, over-marking can take the responsibility away from students, reduce their motivation and make them less resilient. So it\u2019s reasonable to save your wrist.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/apr/09/secret-teacher-no-idea-mark-students-work\">Secret Teacher: I have no idea how to mark students\u2019 work</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>2 Careless mistakes don\u2019t need to be corrected</h2> <p>Teachers shouldn\u2019t correct a student\u2019s work where they have merely made a careless mistake, according to research \u2013 mark the error don\u2019t worry about correcting it. Instead, research advises teachers to focus on areas where students show an underlying misunderstanding. The latter is likely to be a chronic or habitual issue, while the former would be an occasional lapse, so a good old fashioned cross beside silly mistakes is as good as anything.</p> <h2>3 Don\u2019t grade every piece of work</h2> <p>Students tend to focus disproportionately on the grade and are less likely to take note of the formative advice. The research in this area is complex, but most studies agree that having a grade and a comment can lessen the impact of the comments. </p> <h2>4 Stop doing the tick and flick</h2> <p>There\u2019s pretty much no evidence to suggest that acknowledgement marking (the tick-and-flick approach) has any impact. The Oxford report concludes that this form of marking \u201ccould be reduced without any negative effect on student progress\u201d. Generic praise can also fall into this category. A quick \u201cwell done\u201d or \u201cgood effort\u201d might feel like it\u2019s not time consuming, but multiplied over several sets of books this endeavour can really clock up the minutes without adding much impact because students often aren\u2019t clear exactly which bit they have done well. The report suggests pupils can detect insincerity too, so better to save your red ink for something specific and genuine.</p> <h2>5 Be led by pupils\u2019 needs</h2> <p>The DfE report is clear that marking should be led by pupils\u2019 needs rather than a mechanistic timetable. (Easier said than done if your school imposes such a timetable, of course.) Schools can also obsess over consistency between teams and departments, but the guidance is equally clear that this can be as simple as having \u201cconsistently high standards\u201d. Variation in practice, where led by student need, is perfectly acceptable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/apr/03/wish-would-write-more-clearly-students-marking\">'I wish they would write more clearly': students speak out about marking</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>6 Don\u2019t believe misconceptions about Ofsted</h2> <p>Ofsted, like any perceived villain of the piece, tends to generate a lot of rumours and misunderstanding. The guidance, though, is clear: they have no specific expectations in terms of frequency, quantity, type or volume of marking. They do, however, expect to see teachers adhering to their school\u2019s assessment policy, so this is another one which relies on the leadership.</p> <h2>7 Change the culture</h2> <p>It\u2019s easy for a martyr mentality to creep into staffrooms. This holds that the more time you spend marking, the better a teacher you are. It\u2019s a truth worth stating \u2013 publically, if you\u2019re in leadership \u2013 that neither time, nor word count nor leaving work late equal effectiveness. </p> <h2>8 Realise that marking is not the be all and end all</h2> <p>In a hyper-accountable system, written marking has become the big beast of feedback, in part because it can be easily checked. But the pendulum is starting to swing the other way. The workload review group report states that its aim is to \u201cshrink the importance that marking has gained over other forms of feedback\u201d. It even says: \u201cIf the hours spent do not have the commensurate impact on student progress, stop [doing] it\u201d. You have been told.</p> <p><em>How do you approach your mountain of marking?

      "body": "<p>Deep in rural Anatolia, five teenage sisters start to test out their sexuality, like foals taking their tentative first steps on unsteady legs. And the conservative community around them responds with panic, in this terrific, Oscar-nominated first feature. Their collective beauty automatically makes them morally suspect. And in a culture in which a woman\u2019s worth is still measured by her marriageability, this is a serious blow to their prospects. The grandmother who has raised them since they were orphaned bows to pressure from the men in the family and locks down the girls\u2019 freedom. After subjecting the three oldest to medical inspections to check their purity, the windows are barred and the house turned into a \u201cwife factory\u201d. One by one, the sisters are brokered for marriage like stock animals; meanwhile, the youngest, Lale (G\u00fcne\u015f \u015eensoy), who narrates the film, dreams of taking charge of her own life and escaping to Istanbul.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_JXyi1EGJk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/r_JXyi1EGJk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_JXyi1EGJk\">Watch the trailer for Mustang</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>With its rooted sense of place and community, and rebellious spirit, this is an accomplished and engaging debut. Writer-director <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/opinion/deniz-gamze-erguven.html\" title=\"\">Deniz Gamze Erg\u00fcven</a> and her co-writer, <a href=\"http://www.filmcomment.com/blog/cannes-interview-alice-winocour/\" title=\"\">Alice Winocour</a>, approach the material with a light touch \u2013 the most shocking scenes always take place off-camera \u2013 and enough humour to deflate the anger that builds on the girls\u2019 behalf. The restless camera captures both the tactile intimacy of the sisters \u2013 they sprawl lazily, limbs entwined, as their fates are decided elsewhere \u2013 and the mounting tension as they start to chafe against the lives that have been ordained for them.</p>",

Her voice is rich without heaviness, capable of teasing lightness and flexibility, as the selection here demonstrates. She opens with a tender Si, mi chiamano Mimi from Puccini\u2019s <em>La boh\u00e8me</em> (Mimi is one of her signature roles) and travels via Hahn, Faur\u00e9 and Ravel back to Mozart, Gluck and, in an anguished Dido\u2019s Lament, Purcell. The African Cuban Punto de habanera shows her in playful mood. All texts are supplied. Enunciation is not Matshikiza\u2019s greatest strength. A detailed note places her in the great tradition of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFypui1xKlk\">Tebaldi </a>and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isoGu7utEBI\">Rosa Ponselle</a>: too early to say, but this album is enjoyable on its own terms.</p>",

      "body": "<p>What have we left of Shakespeare? A few accounts of productions and the words he wrote. It is his words that have made the plays live on in his native England and throughout the entire world. The words shape the plays, the characters, the scenes; and the choice of words was made by someone who understood how, on a bare stage, language shapes encounters and encounters shape actions to bring new worlds to life.</p> <p>In this new production of <a href=\"https://www.rsc.org.uk/cymbeline/about-the-play\"><em>Cymbeline</em></a>, one of Shakespeare\u2019s most complex and intriguing plays, directed by Melly Still, the words are chivvied about the stage, rattled out by actors hithering and thithering pointlessly but energetically; or they are lingered over, slack-paced, rhythmless, as performers pattern hand gestures to pantomime meanings (or thrust their groins, if there is a sexual allusion \u2013 movement direction by Emily Mytton).</p> <p>At times, Shakespeare\u2019s language is abandoned altogether: the actors deliver his lines in (for the most part, poorly spoken) French, or Italian, or Latin (with English surtitles projected on to a backing screen). While this offers temporary relief from the (for the most part) poorly spoken blank verse, it seems an unnecessarily condescending way to indicate the pan-European nature of the Roman Empire \u2013 and to suggest its contemporary resonances on the eve of a referendum.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"708b9fd123de7ad7266992f1bceeedec885c2df0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/708b9fd123de7ad7266992f1bceeedec885c2df0/0_275_3651_4560/801.jpg\" alt=\"Marcus Griffiths as Cloten and Bethan Cullinane as Innogen.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marcus Griffiths as Cloten with Bethan Cullinane as Innogen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most of the first half felt like an Edinburgh festival fringe production by a group of late-1970s students bursting with ideas. Cymbeline transgenders from King to Queen; her daughter, Innogen, separated from her banished lover, Posthumus, is beset by wicked stepfather and stepbrother (an excellent Marcus Griffiths uncovering layers in the doltish Cloten); the ancient Britons of Cymbeline\u2019s court wear ragged robes made of sacking or tweed suits, while the Romans are sharp-lapelled in dark glasses (Anna Fleischle designs)\u2026 There\u2019s a thrown-together enthusiasm about this; a cluttered, chaotic, two-dimensionality that would be promising in students \u2013 but the RSC has the time, money and expertise to think through ideas more thoroughly and hone them more sharply for performance.</p> <p>The second half develops a third dimension with the introduction of the disguised banished courtier, Belarius and \u201chis\u201d two children (actually stolen from Cymbeline 20 years earlier). In the wilds of Wales, actions and words match. Character, situation and relationships have an imaginative coherence that gives them emotional reality. This is powerfully developed by Graham Turner as an intense, focused, vigorous Belarius and by Natalie Simpson and James Cooney as his children. It is when she enters this world that Bethan Cullinane\u2019s Innogen comes affectingly to life \u2013 ironically, more womanly here, disguised as a boy, than when in torn tutu at court.</p> <p>Dave Price\u2019s music \u2013 combinations of strings, wind, percussion and keyboards \u2013 is magnificent (although occasionally melodramatically placed). It gives shape and depth and atmosphere and helps to make whole the bittiness of what we see before us.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.rsc.org.uk/cymbeline/about-the-play\">\u2022 Cymbeline is at the Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon until 15 Oct</a><br /></p>",

Laughter track or not? On one hand, such tracks risk patronising you, and few things are less chortlingly funny as being made to feel stupid. On the other, you might in their absence miss a pointer, and also feel stupid. My, but it\u2019s a dilemma.</p> <p>It depends \u2013 my considered opinion, after spending frankly too long worrying at this \u2013 on the audience. Very early on in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b07bp64b/upstart-crow-1-star-crossed-lovers\"><strong>Upstart Crow</strong></a>, a collaborative Ben Elton-William Shakespeare vehicle for the hopelessly thick and untalented <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidmitchell\">David Mitchell</a>, a member of the studio audience reacted to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/oct/14/life1.lifemagazine4\">Liza Tarbuck</a> <em>just saying something in an accent, with her titty-dumplings to the fore</em> with the kind of prolonged loud screeching fit that you or I could only hope to achieve while dousing our genitals in hydrochloric acid. My heart sank. But soon it actually began to get funny, sometimes very. The audience member had obviously been led out by an intern with the promise of a cup of tea and perhaps, actually it\u2019s to be hoped, a reassuring whisper of \u201cyou\u2019re not clever enough for this, dear\u201d. By the end, this mashup of Will\u2019s artistic frustrations in an England seething with stupidity, and as relevant to today as to 1584, had become a delight, to the extent the audience was anticipating the gags. Of a fiendishly cunning plot to frustrate young love, in which it had become necessary to procure a play-dead potion, Mitchell\u2019s brimming \u201cI can\u2019t see how it can <em>possibly</em> go wrong\u201d had much of the hubristic glee in seeing it coming of a <a href=\"http://www.dadsarmy.co.uk/maincharacters.html\">Mainwaring</a>, a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2011/aug/27/tony-hancock-screenplay-day-off\">Hancock</a>.</p> <p>Inevitable parallels \u2013 there was much <a href=\"http://shakespeare.sayit.mysociety.org/speech/529700\">God\u2019s bodikins!</a> and gut-porridge stuff \u2013 will be drawn with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NM-Y1ch4b5c\"><em>Blackadder</em></a>, although perhaps someone could tell me why that\u2019s in any conceivable way a bad thing. But Mr Elton has (almost) wholly redeemed himself for crimes against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/aug/04/king-lear-bath-titanic-review\">David Haig</a> in the relentlessly smile-free elf\u2019n\u2019safety trudge that was 2013\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2013/05/how-did-ben-eltons-wright-way-get-it-so-wrong\"><em>The Wright Way</em></a>, and it\u2019s nice to see he\u2019s got his brain back.

The fact that the glorious <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/aug/12/theatre\">Lesley Manville</a> hasn\u2019t played more comedy was the thing. An utter natural, she\u2019s so far been constrained by having to win seemingly endless awards in bittersweet <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/16/mike-leigh-family-conflict\">Mike Leigh</a> films, as if there\u2019s any other kind, but is now apparently freed up to slum it.

It\u2019s full of fast sentences such as \u201cOne of my grunts riding the Midas spotted a days-long buy spike\u201d (but then again so, pretty much, is <em>Thrones</em>; it could almost be Daenerys bemoaning another wayward dragon).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We\u2019re not, not quite, back in 1584, but still\u2026 so far it\u2019s a game for the boys</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Fortunately for the financially cretinous, among whom I am exceptionally proud to number myself, there\u2019s also a simply ripsnorting human drama being played out before us. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2011/may/22/paul-giamatti-win-win-interview\">Paul Giamatti</a> (<em>Sideways</em>) plays the DA, and plays it like a meaner keener <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXJbJ7vir8I\">Toby</a> from the <em>West Wing</em>; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zuwuq2Fd2o\">Damian Lewis</a>, last seen as <em>Wolf Hall</em>\u2019s Loin King, is the insanely charming, kind, dynamically corrupt greedbucket on whom the DA, under vaulting media pressure to jail most of Wall Street, has fastened his fangs. The trap has been baited, the bait taken, and the stage is now set for one humongous pissing contest. I use the gender-specific deliberately: for, so far, women don\u2019t get that much of a look-in. We\u2019re not, not quite, back in 1584, when Mitchell/Shakey could sternly remind a protege, \u201cBut Kate, it is <em>illegal</em> for girls to do anything interesting\u2026\u201d and <a href=\"http://www.sho.com/sho/billions/cast/30212/wendy-rhoades\">Maggie Siff</a> as the DA\u2019s wife Wendy Rhoades does get some decent lines, but still\u2026 so far it\u2019s a game for the boys, who would all seem to manage machiavellian venality so very much better. And I\u2019m tempted to also say, so far, that it doesn\u2019t really matter, so finely honed are both script and performances. If any show on earth is going to make you feel sorry for those poor dears who pull down a mere $7.2m a year, to the extent that you have to stay your happy hand from dashing off a cheque then and there, this is it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"929c2fbc75a019f0d22b3f70e784f1df3f706564\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/929c2fbc75a019f0d22b3f70e784f1df3f706564/1219_104_2346_1408/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Robert Peston in Peston on Sunday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Actually bearable when you see him\u2019: Robert Peston on Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ITV</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>ITV\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.itv.com/hub/peston-on-sunday/2a4458a0001\"><strong>Peston on Sunday</strong></a> was a pleasant surprise.

I\u2019m lonely. I think you might be too. I wonder if you would come and sleep in the night with me. And talk.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s May \u2013 \u201can evening in May just before full dark\u201d \u2013 and widow Addie Moore is visiting\u00a0her neighbour Louis Waters, a widower. They have known each other for\u00a0years, but they don\u2019t really know each other, until Louis agrees to Addie\u2019s request, and their lives expand with happiness.</p> <p>The late <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/02/kent-haruf-writer-dies-71-us-novelist\" title=\"\">Kent Haruf</a>\u2019s final novel <em>Our Souls at Night</em> is set, as were his previous books, in the \u201clittle dirt-blown\u201d Colorado town of Holt. It\u2019s short \u2013 less than 200 pages. The language is straightforward and stripped back, calm and unassuming. And it all combines to make a novel which, like Louis and Addie\u2019s relationship does for them, warms and expands the heart.</p> <p>At first, Louis is diffident about Addie\u2019s plan. \u201cI\u2019m not sure I can be equal to you\u2026 In courage, he said. Willingness to risk.\u201d He comes around the back of her house on Cedar Street to make sure the neighbours don\u2019t see, his pyjamas and toothbrush in a paper bag. But Addie, at 70,\u00a0isn\u2019t worried about what the town thinks, and soon Louis isn\u2019t either.</p> <p>\u201cI was feeling more interested in this than I\u2019d felt about anything for a long time,\u201d he says, and they spend their nights learning everything they can about each other. The affair Louis had, and how he came back to his family. The death of Addie\u2019s daughter. How their spouses died. Who their children are.</p> <p>Sharing their nights isn\u2019t about sex, although it does become so, a little. \u201cIt\u2019s some kind of decision to be free. Even at our ages,\u201d says Louis. \u201cIt\u2019s just two old people talking in the dark,\u201d says Addie.</p> <p>The town watches them, and approves or disapproves, depending. Addie\u2019s sad, lonely six-year-old grandson comes to stay, abandoned by his haphazardly unkind parents. She and Louis mend him \u2013 heal would be too affected a word for Haruf to\u00a0use \u2013 with a dog and\u00a0a baseball mitt and a camping trip.</p> <p>Unkindness pushes them apart, but the sentiment that lingers most, on finishing this beautiful, tranquil, tender novel, is contentment. \u201cMakes me think there might be hope for somebody else in this life,\u201d Addie and Louis are told by an old farmer. \u201cAddie patted his hand. Thank you. It is a hopeful thing, isn\u2019t it?\u201d</p> <p><em>Our Souls at Night is published by Picador (\u00a37.99). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/400480/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to order it for \u00a35.99</em></a><em> </em></p>",

In the Channel 4 series, inspired by my book Tiny Stations, the comedian roams the country in search of the stories and people behind these curious anomalies of the railway network.</p> <p>Existing in a state of almost perpetual slumber, a request stop is woken only occasionally, when a passenger asks a guard for the train to stop there or when someone stands on the platform and puts their hand out to stop it as the train approaches. So suddenly appearing on Sunday night television \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/paul-mertons-secret-stations\">tonight\u2019s episode wraps up the series</a> \u2013 is a real moment in the sun for these obscure stations.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"32fe148d9f01a75f48a66b09ca77b69aa85bf5b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/32fe148d9f01a75f48a66b09ca77b69aa85bf5b1/0_445_4000_2510/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dunrobin Castle station\" width=\"1000\" height=\"628\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dunrobin Castle station.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dixe Wills</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although Merton visits around 20 stations, he has by no means exhausted the nation\u2019s stock of fascinating request stops. Indeed, from the far north of Scotland to the tip of Cornwall, the nation is sprinkled with around 150 request stops.</p> <p>Take Dunrobin Castle station: it serves one of the oldest inhabited houses in Scotland, which also happens to be the seat of the Earls and Dukes of Sutherland. This is the sort of fairytale castle you might expect to find adorning a mountainside in Germany, yet it was designed by the Englishman Sir Charles Barry, the architect of the Houses of Parliament in London. The station began life as the personal halt of the Duke of Sutherland who, quite naturally, kept his own train there. Today, its platform hosts a rather astonishing black-and-white <a href=\"http://www.scotlandrailholiday.com/dunrobin/\">Arts and Crafts building</a> containing a bijou railway memorabilia museum.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"33a03235ee07a6fe52511199a11c526f64e2a29e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/33a03235ee07a6fe52511199a11c526f64e2a29e/0_0_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Conwy station.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Conwy station.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dixe Wills</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Conwy station, by contrast, is arguably right in the middle of a museum, for Unesco has declared the small north Wales town <a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/374\">a world heritage site</a>. For those unacquainted with Conwy, information boards in the town cite it as being \u201camongst the planet\u2019s greatest built structures, equal to Stonehenge and the Pyramids as an example of mankind\u2019s most inspired creativity\u201d. Given that, we should perhaps draw a veil over the fact that the engineer Robert Stephenson hacked a huge hole in its glorious medieval town wall to push a railway line through it.</p> <p>It\u2019s probably just as well that you don\u2019t need to ask the commander of an elite military training camp for permission to alight at every station, but that\u2019s just what I had to do when visiting Lympstone Commando in Devon (you will too if you want to go \u2013 and give at least a fortnight\u2019s notice). Perched prettily on the eastern shore of the Exe estuary, the station was created for the soldiers who train there. From the platform you can peer through the high fences at what looks like an impossibly difficult assault course. When I asked the guard to stop the train there, Iwas thrilled by her reply: \u201cI knew there\u2019d be one of you on here somewhere.\u201d Being mistaken for a commando when you look like I do (a bit urban and weedy) is a boost to the self-esteem that money simply can\u2019t buy.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bd22378862c50e9a27ad532e5e82766d8a4c7f44\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd22378862c50e9a27ad532e5e82766d8a4c7f44/0_221_4000_2646/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lympstone Commando station.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"662\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lympstone Commando station.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dixe Wills</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For a rather wilder, less regimented experience, head for Buckenham in Norfolk. This is the stop for <a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/seenature/reserves/guide/b/buckenham/\">Buckenham Marshes</a>, the scene of Mark Cocker\u2019s epic tale of corvid-obsession <a href=\"http://www.markcocker.com/crow-country/4577039857\">Crow Country</a>. In autumn and winter, tens of thousands of rooks and jackdaws flock here and turn the sky black. It\u2019s by no means just corvids on the wetlands though. When I dropped by I was treated to the spectacle of a heron with a headless rat in its mouth being repeatedly dive-bombed by a pair of lapwings. Nature is wonderful.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"793fa67538a7b4c96e06d22f5c4d5f54dc08a1f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/793fa67538a7b4c96e06d22f5c4d5f54dc08a1f3/3_529_3161_1896/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A train speeds through Buckenham station, just visible through trees.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A train speeds through Buckenham station, just visible through trees.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dixe Wills</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Once in a blue moon, you\u2019ll even find events overtaking a request stop, making it popular once more. Such is the case with Dolgarrog in north Wales, which once served a huge aluminium works. Last summer, the defunct site <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/aug/01/surfsnowdonia-surfing-lake-wales-snowdonia\">opened as Surf Snowdonia</a>, the world\u2019s first inland surf lagoon. The venue had 14,000 visitors in the first two weeks, so there\u2019s a good chance you won\u2019t need to to ask the guard to stop.</p> <p>And we\u2019ve not even started on the station created back in 1935 for a day-tripping attraction so popular it was known as the Scarborough of the Midlands (The Lakes, Warwickshire); the station where one of the bravest civilian acts of the second world war took place (Bootle, Cumbria); the station dedicated to a holiday camp where for two long summers a young Ringo Starr hit the skins (Penychain, Gwynedd); or, famously, the station with the longest name in Europe (Llanfair PG, Anglesey). So, I confess, I won\u2019t be <em>too</em> surprised if a second series beckons \u2026</p> <ul> <li><em>The final episode of Secret Stations is on Channel 4 on Sunday 15 May at 8pm</em></li> </ul> <p><strong>Dixe Wills is the author of Tiny Stations (</strong><a href=\"http://shop.theaa.com/store/home/tiny-stations\"><strong>AA Publishing</strong></a><strong>, \u00a312)</strong></p>",

The setting is minimalist, the costumes contemporary.</p> <p>Dawson is a choreographer of subtlety and ingenuity. Here, he gives us dance solidly grounded in classicism but surmounted by carving, cleaving arms, often with flexed wrists and splayed fingers. The men, in particular, take to this well. Scottish Ballet\u2019s male contingent are a stylish bunch, with beautifully extended legs and feet, and an easy musicality in grand allegro. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They\u2019re not real or believable women but stereotypes of availability</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The women are not quite so well served; Dawson gives us a more or less conventional female corps, and though he struggles to fill <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/pyotr-tchaikovsky\">Tchaikovsky</a>\u2019s symphonic score, there are memorable choreographic moments, particularly with multiple swan arms swaying and curvetting in unison. Designer Yumiko Takeshima has costumed Odette and her corps in what look like one-piece swimsuits, with delicately patterned bodices, stern white pants cut beneath the buttocks, and bare legs. The result is at once impressive and strange, like discovering the Bulgarian synchronised swimming team practising in your local pool.</p> <p>The ballet opens with a party for Benno (<a href=\"http://www.scottishballet.co.uk/the-company/victor-zarallo.html\">Victor Zarallo</a>), who is the best friend of Siegfried (<a href=\"http://www.scottishballet.co.uk/the-company/andrew-peasgood.html\">Andrew Peasgood</a>). Everyone\u2019s having a good time except Siegfried, who loiters palely on the fringes of the action, his mind clearly on Higher Things. And this is a problem. Detached from its original 19th-century context, Siegfried\u2019s posturing just looks petulant and selfish. In this <em>Swan Lake</em>, Dawson has updated the steps and costumes, but left in place the antique attitudes that underpin the ballet. In particular, the notion that women exist not as fully fleshed-out individuals but merely as catalysts to male introspection and self-regard.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHSXgrjevEU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/NHSXgrjevEU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHSXgrjevEU\">Scottish Ballet\u2019s Swan Lake trailer</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>When Siegfried encounters Odette (Constance Devernay), there is no sign of love between them. At the beginning of the grand pas de deux, he turns his back on her; it is she who initiates the action. But she barely looks at him; it\u2019s as if she realises that her function is not to engage with him at a human level, but to activate his gothically heightened sensitivities. In Act 2, Benno gives a party for Siegfried (a generous gesture, given Siegfried\u2019s predilection for antisocial moping) and has three voluptuous \u201cinamoratas\u201d wheeled on stage on a kind of pudding trolley for his friend\u2019s delectation. They\u2019re not real or believable women but stereotypes of availability, there simply to affirm Siegfried\u2019s discrimination in rejecting them.</p> <p>We tolerate these kinds of assumptions in traditional productions, but if the story is to be transposed to an era more or less parallel to our own then they should be interrogated, and rigorously. To be fair, Dawson does give Odette a degree of autonomy, in that she rejects Siegfried when he deceives her with Odile (prompting from Siegfried what can only be described as a fit of the vapours), but then there\u2019s no substantial difference between Dawson\u2019s Odette and Odile. We can\u2019t engage with either, as they exist only as archetypes, conjured into being to initiate Siegfried\u2019s psychic development. Our hero might wear a 21st-century T-shirt and skinny trousers, but his spirit is trapped in the mists of 19th-century romantic narcissism. On balance, not ideal boyfriend material.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.scottishballet.co.uk/swan-lake/swan-lake.html\">Swan Lake tours until 4 June</a></p>",

This arresting ninth album is bathed in it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u2018The damage is done,\u2019 Yorke sings, even more exhausted than usual</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Overshadowed by the break-up of singer Thom Yorke\u2019s relationship, announced last year, <em>A Moon Shaped Pool</em> finds the band mining their long and deep back catalogue, while pushing their compositional skills relentlessly forwards. Where 2011\u2019s more granular and underrated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/feb/20/radiohead-king-of-limbs-review\" title=\"\"><em>The King of Limbs</em></a> revelled in beats, <em>A Moon Shaped Pool </em>marks a frequent relaxation into more conventional songcraft \u2013 manna from heaven for a certain stripe of Radiohead fan. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/aug/16/on-my-radar-jonny-greenwood-radiohead\" title=\"\">Jonny Greenwood</a>\u2019s film score sideline pays dividends, too, in the string arrangements and modern classical introduction to Glass Eyes.</p> <p>The album starts and finishes on two older songs, material reworked in the light of new developments. Dating from as long ago as the <a href=\"http://citizeninsane.eu/burnthewitch.html\" title=\"\"><em>Hail to the Thief</em> sessions,</a> Burn the Witch is <em>A Moon Shaped Pool</em>\u2019s most forthright political statement, a warning against scapegoating outsiders that trailed the album\u2019s release with a startling <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI2oS2hoL0k\" title=\"\">stop-motion animation video</a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yI2oS2hoL0k\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yI2oS2hoL0k?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch the video to Burn the Witch.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>At the far end of the tracklisting is True Love Waits, a relic that has been around since <a href=\"http://citizeninsane.eu/truelovewaits.html\" title=\"\">circa 1995</a>. The title may tilt at the religion-inspired US celibacy movement, but the song \u2013 now made up of piano, vocals and percussion that sounds like a beetle using a typewriter \u2013 is about a fraught sense of love. (The \u201clollipops and crisps\u201d line refers to a mother who <a href=\"http://everything2.com/title/True+Love+Waits\" title=\"\">left her young child alone for days with junk food</a>). It climaxes with the words \u201cdon\u2019t leave\u201d.</p> <p>You would not want to be so crass as to call this Radiohead\u2019s break-up album; after all, there are four other band members. A song such as The Numbers (formerly known as Silent Spring) uses found sound, a little cosmic jazz, folk-rock acoustic guitar and accusatory strings to seethe specifically about ecocide. Ful Stop, meanwhile, is six minutes of encroaching electronic menace whose <a href=\"http://citizeninsane.eu/fulstop.html\" title=\"\">lyrics self-flagellate quite mercilessly</a>.</p> <p>But a few songs appear to conjoin macro with micro, with a sense of loss that encompasses disintegration on the home front and in the wider world. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTAU7lLDZYU\" title=\"\">Daydreaming</a> is one. \u201cThe damage is done,\u201d Yorke sings, even more exhausted than usual. Things have got \u201cbeyond the point of no return\u201d, and \u201cthis goes beyond me/Beyond you\u201d. The coda is back-masked and sinister: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzUrTE5-_OQ\" title=\"\">Half of my life,\u201d it goes</a>, according to people who have played it backwards. At a guess, it\u2019s the 23 years the 47-year-old Yorke spent with the mother of his children, crowning a piano-led ballad in which it is easy to read divorce as well as disaster.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Almost one in four people do not take out travel insurance for their holidays, according to new research, with young people less likely to pay for the safety net when they go abroad.</p> <p>The reluctance to take out insurance is more pronounced among those who travel within Europe, with more than one-third saying they do not bother.</p> <p>The figures have emerged from a study by York-based healthcare provider Benenden of 1,000 people, which shows that one in 10 have previously needed hospital treatment when abroad.</p> <p>Figures from the Association of British Insurers (ABI) reveal that travel insurers paid out \u00a3370m in 591,000 claims last year.</p> <p>Benenden\u2019s survey found 23% of people don\u2019t take out travel insurance when they go abroad, rising to 34% for trips in Europe. Among young people aged between 18 and 24, 28% do not take out insurance.</p> <p>The study also shows a lack of knowledge among some travellers about the European health insurance card, which gives people the right to access state healthcare during stays in other European Economic Area countries and Switzerland. One-third of those surveyed said they did not know the card was free.</p> <p>Meanwhile, most (82%) of those surveyed didn\u2019t know that the emergency number to ring in Europe was 112.</p> <p>Price comparison website Gocompare.com last week warned travellers that if they did decide to take out cover before they went abroad in the summer, they should ensure they had the right policy.</p> <p>\u201cIf something unexpected happens to spoil your trip \u2013 such as your flight being cancelled or you needing hospital treatment \u2013 the last thing you want is to have your insurance claim rejected,\u201d says Alex Edwards, of Gocompare.com.</p> <p>\u201cMake sure you read the policy wording so you understand what is and isn\u2019t covered. Be honest when applying for cover and when submitting a claim. Withholding information on your medical history, for example, may mean that you are not fully insured and could leave you picking up a hefty hospital bill. This way, you will have the best possible chance of success if you are unlucky enough to need to make a claim.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>Desert Island Discs</strong> (Radio 4) | <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b079m78n\">iPlayer</a><br /><strong>The Swedish Ambassador\u2019s Guide to Eurovision</strong> (World Service) | <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03t0m9g\">iPlayer</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b079m78n\"><strong>Desert Island Discs</strong></a> is the don of interview programmes. It\u2019s the don of all radio programmes, really. The more I listen to it, the more I admire everything about it. The format is so revealing and yet so simple; and it still stands, because of its simplicity. The arrival of the internet or mobile phones or Skype or iTunes has mattered not one jot, because one of the points of <em>Desert Island Discs</em> is the lack of communication.</p> <p>For many years, I thought the point of the show was the records. If you\u2019re any kind of a music fan, you will have tried to pick your eight tracks for the show, agonised over whether your choice of a particular Beatles or Smiths song was too trite, too obvious. And the music matters, of course \u2013 it took me a long while to get used to the podcast, because of the frustration of not being able to hear the tunes (because of publishing rights) \u2013 but not as much as I thought. The music isn\u2019t about taste. It\u2019s about truth. The music keeps the guests telling the truth, because they\u2019re pulled back to the real life moment when they heard the track for the first time. They feel that emotion once more.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Kirsty is extremely deft at getting to the heart of the matter, at opening a small door into her interviewee\u2019s true self</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The music is the part the guests concentrate on, when really they should be thinking about the interview. They forget about that bit. Caught up in their music choices, in the built-in \u201cfake world\u201d of the desert island, the lack of other permitted communication, the guests drop their guard. This isn\u2019t real, it\u2019s an imagined situation! We\u2019re just pretending we\u2019ve gone on holiday for a bit! There\u2019s no one else around, listen to the waves washing on the shore\u2026 and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/kirsty-young\">Kirsty Young</a> is such a good interviewer. It\u2019s very rare that you hear a <em>DID</em> and think, Ooh, she missed something there. Beautifully polite \u2013 she works the guest\u2019s achievements into her opening spiel and, indeed, almost all of her questions \u2013 she also gets straight to the point of who this person really is. She is astonishingly deft at getting to the heart of the matter, at opening a small door into her interviewee\u2019s true self. She\u2019d be a great surgeon.</p> <p>Last week her guest was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/tomhanks\">Tom Hanks</a>, who was just as lovely as you would imagine. Clever Kirsty referred to his loveliness with her very first question, wondering why nobody who Hanks has worked with has ever said a bad thing about him. She let him be his warm self, showcase his cover-the-cracks cheerfulness. \u201cWhatever was expected of you, that\u2019s how you would act\u2026 \u201d; \u201cyou were a coper\u2026 \u201d; \u201cwhat was rattling around in you?\u201d After playing the theme to <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3bY3P523TE\">Also sprach Zarathustra by Richard Strauss</a>), Hanks choked up. \u201cI\u2019ve put far too much thought into this list,\u201d he said, referring to the music. He forgot about what music will do. It means you can\u2019t lie, and Kirsty is listening. As are we.</p> <p>Another long-standing format, the Eurovision song contest, was on again yesterday. The years come around so quickly these days, it seems as though it\u2019s never off. Plus, the BBC goes so nuts for this silly show, loads up the schedules with previews and overviews and why-have-you-never-viewed shows. It\u2019s exhausting. Radio 2 alone has a vast selection of programmes, which it gathers under the title Radio 2 Loves Eurovision, and we\u2019ve not even got on to the TV\u2026</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1cfa5cf4c35061544e95a31edf5d9c9408f8729\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1cfa5cf4c35061544e95a31edf5d9c9408f8729/0_78_1984_1190/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abba winning the 1974 Eurovision song contest in Brighton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abba winning the 1974 Eurovision song contest in Brighton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anyway, on the World Service, under The Documentary strand, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03t0m9g\"><strong>The Swedish Ambassador\u2019s Guide to Eurovision </strong></a>(excellent) explained why the BBC loses its mind over this stupid singing competition. Not because of its high-level campness, as I assumed. Not because the competition is between different countries either. It\u2019s because the competition is actually between different national broadcasters. Every competing country gives the show to its equivalent of the BBC. Thus Eurovision is a jewel in every broadcasting corporation\u2019s crown. Presumably this means that \u2013 argh \u2013 Eurovision will never disappear\u2026</p>",

However, relatives in the US announced in April that they planned to visit that weekend, so I contacted Longleat immediately to ask if we could agree another date. </strong></p> <p><strong>I was told this was impossible, and it wouldn\u2019t even give me a refund despite it being 53 days in advance of the experience and paid for in full since September 2015.</strong></p> <p><strong>I phoned Longleat and was told that in its terms and conditions it made clear that any experience day could not be rescheduled and was non-refundable. Yet \u201cLongleat reserves the right to reschedule any of the booked dates for the experiences and will provide as much notice as possible\u201d; that \u201cLongleat reserves the right to change the itinerary\u201d; and \u201cLongleat reserves the right to alter dates, times and prices or facilities for any reason and without prior notice\u201d. </strong></p> <p><strong>In my view, the T&amp;Cs could be deemed to be unfair. I have emailed Longleat three times setting out my views and requesting a different day, but it has so far failed to reply. </strong><em>MJ, London</em></p> <p>We get numerous complaints about experience days from a range of companies when readers struggle to rearrange dates or get refunds. We agree that to require and encourage participants to book as far in advance as possible, while not giving any flexibility to re-book if required, seems bonkers \u2013 and frustrating.</p> <p>The T&amp;Cs are standard for these kinds of experience days, but clearly they have to take into account issues that could affect bookings such as the unpredictability of weather and, indeed, live animals!</p> <p>It took a huge amount of effort on your part to get Longleat to reply \u2013 via Facebook, Twitter and, finally, involving us. We can imagine less tenacious individuals would have given up and lost their money. Finally, the company offered you an alternative date in July, although it insisted this was a goodwill gesture.</p> <p>Longleat said: \u201cThe gorilla feeding experience runs twice-weekly from May to October,\u2013 with only four spaces available per experience. While we always strive to accommodate any change in our visitors\u2019 plans, re-scheduling booked tours at short notice is often simply impossible due to availability. We also have to take into account the effect on other people who have already booked. We strongly encourage our visitors to ensure they are able to attend their experience at the time of booking to avoid any issues.\u201d</p> <p><strong>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s 40 years since <em>Rocky</em> scrapped its way into cinemas \u2013 I\u2019d have added \u201cbelieve it or not\u201d, but when you see <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/sylvester-stallone\" title=\"\">Sylvester Stallone</a>\u2019s swollen, fallen, stray pug face in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/10/rocky-in-numbers--creed-sylvester-stallone\" title=\"\"><strong>Creed</strong></a><strong> </strong>(Warner, 12), you definitely believe it. Still, how many film franchises have lurched along with the same actor for that long? And how many of those can claim to have peaked in their fifth decade? Fine wine analogies don\u2019t apply here: the <em>Rocky</em> films have been corked since the 1980s. But Ryan Coogler\u2019s film \u2013 not so much an extension of a franchise as a fresh graft of its mythos \u2013 is a very robust red: it\u2019s a boxing film alive with bodily tension, social concern and, by its roaring climax, genuinely meaningful emotional rescue.</p> <p>Rocky Balboa isn\u2019t the fighter this time: even Stallone\u2019s bravado has its limits. Here, he\u2019s a grizzled, initially reluctant mentor to hard-headed and harder-bodied up-and-comer Adonis Johnson Creed (Michael B Jordan) \u2013 son of Apollo, Balboa\u2019s nemesis over the first four <em>Rocky</em> films. What might seem a corny, convenient torch-passing ploy instead yields a weighty, considered examination of legacy \u2013 professional, cultural, familial \u2013 and how it feels to carry it. Coogler and Jordan first worked together on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/fruitvale-station\" title=\"\"><em>Fruitvale Station</em></a>, a 2013 film that chimed with the rise of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/19/blacklivesmatter-birth-civil-rights-movement\" title=\"\">Black Lives\u00a0Matter</a> movement; <em>Creed</em> more tacitly follows suit, as its African American protagonist quite literally fights for his standing and status, as well as that of his father. It\u2019s a remarkable reorientation of the original film\u2019s socioeconomic politics and hero worship, given earthy ballast by Jordan and Stallone\u2019s honest, broken-skinned performances; all of a\u00a0sudden, an eighth Rocky film doesn\u2019t\u00a0sound like the worst idea.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f903d0e676bc29a1bb9636145860b81f3ac3edd8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f903d0e676bc29a1bb9636145860b81f3ac3edd8/264_0_1715_1029/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Decorous coyness\u2019: Alicia Vikander (Gerda Wegener), left, and Eddie Redmayne (Lili Elbe) in The Danish Girl.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Decorous coyness\u2019: Alicia Vikander (Gerda Wegener), left, and Eddie Redmayne (Lili Elbe) in The Danish Girl.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Universal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>The Danish Girl</strong> (Universal, 15), on the other hand, is as tidily hemmed in and fragrantly starched as <em>Creed</em> is swaggering and bloodily bruised: as film-making, it\u2019s never naked for a moment. That\u2019s a particular problem when the film is about transgender transitioning, a subject that isn\u2019t illuminated by decorous coyness, which is what director <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/tom-hooper\" title=\"\">Tom Hooper</a> has in sensibly sized spades.</p> <p>The story of Lili Elbe, a celebrated painter who became better known in 1930 as one of the first people to undergo sex reassignment surgery, the film charts her feminine evolution largely through her succession of richly brocaded gowns. Despite the elaborately mannered physical affections of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/eddie-redmayne\" title=\"\">Eddie Redmayne</a>\u2019s performance, the film never successfully evokes how it might feel to have another person, of a gender different from your biological assignment, emerging inside you. Instead, the film principally navigates the more familiar emotional territory of dewy-eyed marital decline, as Elbe\u2019s comparably free-spirited wife Gerda learns to let go. That she\u2019s played as thoughtfully and open-heartedly as she is by an Oscar-winning <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IdlzqmMDF3g\" title=\"\">Alicia Vikander</a> makes the film more moving than it might have been otherwise, but it remains a thoroughly cautious study of a very brave act.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vuW_58sAJ0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3vuW_58sAJ0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch the trailer for When Animals Dream.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>One yearns to see <em>The Danish Girl</em> directed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/davidcronenberg\" title=\"\">David Cronenberg</a>; I\u2019d even settle for Danish director Jonas Alexander Arnby, who brings a disquieting understanding of morphosis to<strong> When Animals Dream</strong> (Altitude, 18), a sleek, sensitive portrait of a teenage girl finding her inner (and eventual outer) werewolf. It aims for the ice and blood humanism of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/let-the-right-one-in\" title=\"\"><em>Let the Right One In</em></a>, and doesn\u2019t entirely get there, but it\u2019s a sustained, elegant shiver. Also falling short of lofty genre aspirations is <strong>Mojave </strong>(Signature, 15), a somewhat mapless thriller with an embittered undercurrent of Hollywood satire from <em>The Departed</em> writer William Monahan. Still, I enjoyed the dark bourbon tone and ambience of its ambling, as drifter Oscar Isaac and fizzled film-maker Garrett Hedlund circle each other in sexy, shifty style.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq9VYIrFy3M\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cq9VYIrFy3M?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch the trailer for In a Lonely Place.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>As smirking, smoking, showbiz noirs go, it\u2019s no <strong>In a Lonely Place</strong> (Criterion, 12), but what is? Starring <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/humphreybogart\" title=\"\">Humphrey Bogart</a> at his most craggily disillusioned, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/08/nicholas-ray-we-cant-go-home-again\" title=\"\">Nicholas Ray</a>\u2019s once underrated but gorgeously mordant masterwork gets the rerelease it deserves from the Criterion Collection, its Indian-ink blacks and shimmery silvers sharpened to killer effect. If you\u2019ve never seen it, this is the best possible introduction. Not to be outdone by the recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/17/star-wars-the-force-awakens-review-criterion-collection-the-survivalist\" title=\"\">Criterion hype</a>, meanwhile, the Masters of Cinema label continues to be a treasure trove. Josef von Sternberg\u2019s 1928 silent <strong>The Last Command</strong> (Eureka, PG) \u2013 while noted by triviastes for Emil Jannings\u2019s dignified performance, winner of the first ever best actor Oscar \u2013 is no mere footnote. Threaded with irony and compassion, this vast story of a tsarist Russian duke turned Hollywood extra deserves this polished revival.</p> <p>I\u2019m writing this week\u2019s column from Cannes, where Mexican director David Pablos\u2019s <strong>The Chosen Ones</strong>, a tough, bluntly powerful study of the sex slavery racket, left audiences gasping last year. Always a challenging candidate for distribution, it has instead been internationally released as a <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/gb/title/80059440\" title=\"\">Netflix exclusive</a>, and if you can handle its hope-deprived worldview, it\u2019s sternly impressive stuff. Taking the\u00a0perspective of a young male employee of a sex trafficking ring, and sketching his moral crisis when he falls for one of its kidnapped teenage victims, it\u2019s a film that suffuses unremittingly ugly subject matter with sensory clarity. Pablos is a name to watch; one wonders if Netflix has other plans for him.</p>",

Because \u2013 one reason among several \u2013 of pre-referendum uncertainty. The Bank of England expects sterling to tumble further if we leave. The chill won\u2019t warm up in a trice.</p> <p>What does that mean for property developers in the Barclay brothers category? Fewer hotels to be built, fewer office blocks, fewer plush apartments. For the <em>Daily Mail</em>? Watch Euromoney\u2019s fortunes (down 6% already) droop further. Watch business-to-business events decline when there\u2019s much less business.</p> <p>And for News Corp and News UK? The newspaper half of the Murdoch empire is finding it tough. It reported a $128m loss in the third quarter: a special-item hit, to be sure, but with overall revenues down $100m year on year. Print is a problem: ads are a problem: currency is a problem because money flows into the States, not out.</p> <p>That won\u2019t affect papers like the <em>Sun</em>, too totally tied in to switch. But many observers predict that the <em>Telegraph</em>, after giving the Leave camp an extended shout, will vote to stay. And as for Murdoch, Rupert himself has long held that the Anglo-American relationship is his bedrock of belief. But in the age of Trump, when isolationism, scorn and insurrection rule?

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-15T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Extraordinary, is it not? The political, financial and media worlds are obsessed by a referendum we could do without, called to sort out problems of Conservative party management that will almost certainly not be resolved, and masterminded by a prime minister who is desperately dependent on the support of the Labour party to avoid humiliation.</p> <p>On a typical day last week we had the menacingly mendacious Alexander (Boris) Johnson being taken far more seriously than he should \u2013 what do you make of a man who tells his close friends we must stay in the European Union and then, for nakedly ambitious reasons, goes back on his word?</p> <p>Many people I encountered were amazed at the way Johnson hardly allowed that seasoned <em>Today</em> interviewer, John Humphrys, to get a word in edgeways, but in my view Humphrys was cleverly allowing Johnson, who sounded increasingly preposterous, to hang himself.</p> <p>Far more welcome and enlightening was the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/11/gordon-brown-enters-eu-debate-appeal-to-labour-voters\">performance of Gordon Brown</a> at the London School of Economics later that morning.</p> <p>Well, not much later. Brown spoke and took questions between 9am and 10am in the new LSE building in Lincoln\u2019s Inn Fields \u2013 the building that the Queen famously opened in 2008 with a question about the financial crisis: \u201cWhy did no one see it coming?\u201d</p> <p>Our former chancellor and prime minister was back to his old self. Promoting his extremely good new book, <em>Britain: Leading, Not Leaving \u2013 The Patriotic Case For Remaining In Europe</em>, he strode up and down the stage as if he were a comedian live on stage at the Apollo. His message was serious, but there were plenty of jokes and he was much more relaxed than people remember him as prime minister.</p> <p>I gather that the full force of his virtuoso defence of the Remain position did not come across on television. That is a pity. For one thing, his mastery of detail (no visible notes) was such that one questioner could not resist asking whether he would be prepared to take on Johnson in debate. \u201cI\u2019m happy to take anyone on,\u201d was the swift rejoinder. And, in a world containing the egregious Johnson, and the even more egregious Donald Trump, you knew not only that he meant it but that he could wipe the floor with such charlatans.</p> <p>Talking of charlatans, I am not sure where Johnson stands on the health service, but it does grate that his Brexit colleagues produce bogus claims about how they would redirect the UK\u2019s contribution to the EU for spending on the NHS when they actually want to starve it of funds and privatise it.</p> <p>The great thing about Brown\u2019s lecture \u2013 to be repeated around the country, I hope \u2013 and his book is that he is reacting against the \u201cend of the world\u201d and \u201cthreat of another European war\u201d scare stories emanating from the some members of the Remain camp, and presenting a much more positive picture of the prospect for both the UK and the EU if we remain.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1cdb38a6a924f831fddd10e2a3e1135b336c84c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cdb38a6a924f831fddd10e2a3e1135b336c84c4/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Boris Johnson takes to the campaign trail.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Boris Johnson takes to the campaign trail.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For it seems to me that some of my fellow members in the Remain camp are manifesting signs of that traditional phenomenon known as \u201cpanic in the ranks\u201d. Although bookmakers William Hill make Remain firm odds-on favourites \u2013 as I write, if you put \u00a3100 on Remain, and that is the outcome, you win only \u00a330, whereas \u00a3100 on Brexit stands to win \u00a3300 \u2013 that is not what the opinion polls indicate.</p> <p>Opinion polls may have lost credibility during the last general election, but they are the best opinion polls we have. And I do not think I am alone in finding that the most surprising people are flirting with the idea of Brexit.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--thumbnail\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/may/15/mark-carney-defends-brexit-intervention-eu-bank-england-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4j89m\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2505838\"            data-video-name=\"Bank of England's Mark Carney defends his Brexit intervention \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC 1/ The Andrew Marr Show\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5738532ae4b0fd3b7bd1955b\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11508199&amp;format=video/mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11508199&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/15/160515MarrCarney_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11508199&amp;format=video/webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/15/160515MarrCarney_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/may/15/mark-carney-defends-brexit-intervention-eu-bank-england-video\">Bank of England\u2019s Mark Carney defends his Brexit intervention</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Which brings us to the Bank of England and Mark Carney, who are obviously taking the possibility of Brexit seriously. There is much speculation about what disasters may lie ahead, but there is plenty of damage already. Personally, I am of the view that it is difficult enough to forecast the past, let alone the future; quite how much of the present UK economic slowdown is due to what one might call \u201cnatural causes\u201d and how much to uncertainty about the possibility of Brexit is difficult to disentangle. But what is pretty clear is that the deflationary emphasis of macroeconomic policy has been so disastrous that we have been experiencing a ridiculously long period of below-trend growth. My friend Peter Jay asks whether this has been the longest period of below-trend growth \u2013 that is, below what a properly run economy should be capable of \u2013 since the Black Death.</p> <p>One aspect of the damage that Brexit might cause was brought up last week in a lecture to the King\u2019s College London Strand Group by the Irish ambassador, Dan Mulhall. Britain has a very close trading relationship with Ireland, not least through Northern Ireland. Quite apart from any security considerations, the economic damage to Northern Ireland from Brexit could be considerable.</p> <p>Oh, and by the way: when former cabinet secretary Lord Butler asked a parliamentary question recently about how many treaties to which the UK is party would have to be renegotiated if we were to leave the EU, after a lot of verbiage came the answer: \u201cThere are, for example, free-trade agreements covering 53 markets to which the EU is party, which would need to be considered.\u201d</p> <p>Easy, really\u2026</p>",

      "body": "<p>The temptation is to see the latest BBC charter melodramatics as merely St George (or maybe St Beeb) and the Dragon. Monstrous Whitto, a garrulous beast from the Whitehall jungle, threatens gallant worshippers of the great gods Truth and Independence. But lo! Here come thousands of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/12/bbc-john-whittingdale-white-paper-star-pay-board\" title=\"\">innocent licence-fee payers, outraged luvvies and defiant journalists</a> (including yours truly). Do King Dave and his chancellor, masters of dragons, want another steaming row on their doorsteps? They do not. So, at the last moment, Whitto gets a good hosing down and his fire-breathing plans turn to cold porridge. We may all rejoice. The BBC, in particular, issues a stream of joyful statements. Crisis over. The good guys won.</p> <p>Except that Broadcasting House life, like Downing Street life, is never that simple. Forget St George for a moment. Think, rather, of defunct BBC drama series <em>Hustle</em>, in which lovable conmen waged eternal war against the forces of lumpen malignity. Spin, with an added twist. By such lights, was Mr culture secretary Whittingdale ever going to top slice the corporation and tie it in a thousand regulatory knots, throttling the life out of <em>Strictly Come Dancing</em>? Perhaps not. In which case, was Thursday\u2019s supposed triumph for St Beeb quite what it seemed? Same answer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a36b0dd275c610d26d8663382ac50475b49c51a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a36b0dd275c610d26d8663382ac50475b49c51a1/0_31_2105_1263/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ash Morgan and Danny Blue from Hustle\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The charter drama is more like conmen series Hustle than a battle between St George and the Dragon</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Kudos</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are things to make Portland Place cheer: an 11-year charter, the five-year revival of an indexed and rising licence fee, some funding certainty. The show, in short, trundles on. Come back in 2027 and see whether any subscription replacement for the fee has begun to find favour. Keep repeating the ancient injunctions of Reith \u2013 educate, inform, entertain \u2013 as though David Attenborough, aged 101, was the man for all seasons.</p> <p>But real life isn\u2019t so simple. Take the rancorous issue that has dogged negotiations between BBC and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport: who will sit on the new unitary board that supplants the trust regime, and how they will be appointed.</p> <p>It\u2019s a dodgy time to raise the problem of \u201cindependent\u201d Whitehall appointments because the current commissioner for great and good job-filling, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/17/bbc-board-jobs-conservatives-whittingdale\" title=\"\">Sir David Normington, is heading for retirement </a>\u2013 and manifestly unhappy about the Cameron government\u2019s wily ways. He thinks covert patronage is seeping back. Once upon a recent time, when politicians needed a job filling, you advertised it, held interviews and selected a favourite and second favourite to send upstairs. Either candidate is qualified, minister: you choose.</p> <p>Such ways and means weren\u2019t exactly pristine. They still depended on job descriptions, remuneration, taps on shoulders and words in ears. Difficult, but not impossible. Now it\u2019s not difficult at all. Ministers will be able to choose between a preferred candidate and a whole basket of \u201cqualified\u201d ones. The person No 10 wants is bound to be there somewhere. Which is why the Whittingdale board solution is so lethal \u2013 and so divisive.</p> <p>Currently, HMG appoints the doomed trust, just as it appointed the doomed governors before it. But at least the trust had a primary regulatory role to give it common purpose. The new single board is responsible for many things: finance, governance, complaints, promotions and \u201cstrategy\u201d. It won\u2019t make programmes \u2013 or kill them. It\u2019s not editorial in that sense. But it\u2019s bound to have an editorial influence as it charts the dynamic ways of a BBC future. It needs to be expert, balanced and dynamic as well as wise and reflective. It needs to be led.</p> <p>Can a non-executive chairman imposed by Cameron and Whittingdale do that? Can a deputy chair, chosen by the same system? Or four more non-execs from the nations and regions beyond Watford Gap? Will they find common cause with the four or so non-execs allegedly chosen by the BBC board itself, though \u2013 more killer detail \u2013 with the government\u2019s designated chairman as master of selection revels?</p> <p>How do Tony Hall and one or two actual executives drive the corporation through this non-executive mud? The new board is supposed to bring new purpose and new horizons. But, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/10/bbc-trust-rona-fairhead-new-governing-body\" title=\"\">Rona Fairhead, the current trust chairman and chief regulator, dropped into place already,</a> the signals are all about regulation, not innovation. Fairhead is a lively, sympathetic operator. She offers reassuring continuity. But this is a unitary board, not a trust. This is long-term change, not short-term continuity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1f4de01323564150ebe408249d33e95352c3fe8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1f4de01323564150ebe408249d33e95352c3fe8d/1502_439_4081_2448/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rona Fairhead\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rona Fairhead: a lively, sympathetic operator.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Hartley/REx</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Meanwhile, belt and braces, Ofcom becomes the supreme regulator of last resort. In the snug little world of media regulation that means a community of experts shifting from chair to chair. It also means an Ofcom board, appointed by Whittingdale, will regulate every aspect of BBC life through a secondary board with its own appointed chairman and members. That\u2019s double the appointment opportunities: on the BBC board, on the Ofcom board, on the BBC Ofcom outfit board, replacing a single appointed trust. With the full National Audit Office works thrown in for bad luck.</p> <p>So instead of the opportunity for fresh thinking and fast reaction that Hall wanted to make continuing reality out of all the adulatory adjectives about BBC performance that clog the white paper, we\u2019re being sold governance by regulator with the DCMS pulling strings \u2013 and adding enough new hurdles to turn Brussels bureaucrats green with envy. Not fewer sticky fingers feeling collars, but more. Not more investment in new technologies, but much less. Not more true independence, but less. Plus a distinctive Whitehall impartiality that keeps the men from the ministry in charge.</p> <p>The clamour at charter-renewal time is always about politicians of every persuasion trying to get the spirit of BBC independence under control. It is about the surface independence of he says/she says that never makes a secretary of state screech in fury. It is public service that often tries to leave the public out. And it utterly forgets the creative and imaginative urge that doesn\u2019t just make good drama or good news, but responds to technological and social change.</p> <p>Yet remember that in 11 years\u2019 time, on present trends, TV audiences will be down by some 30%. Television has contracted the newspaper disease and, on Reuters Institute estimates, in a still more crippling form. You can\u2019t freeze-frame the next 11 years. Nor, within the now bubbling pot of interests, can you leave Ofcom to mastermind revolution.</p> <p>There are reasons to welcome Whittingdale\u2019s alleged conversion. Ten months of thrashing threats and anxious obeisances are over. But yet more regulation is only part of a BBC future, and by no means the most important part. Can governments, fiddling at second hand, run a broadcasting company? Can an artificially balanced board, some beholden to politicians, some more truly independent, do it? Hustle, bustle, toil and trouble.</p>",

Over the past 50 years, more than 300 infectious pathogens have either newly developed or reemerged in places where they had never been seen before.</p> <p>These trends raise questions: Why are infectious diseases occurring with such frequency? Why are pandemics the new normal? The increased rate of outbreak is typically framed as a failure of the health system. Indeed, that is a critical component. But the conditions that allow for outbreak in the first place are rooted in environmental change.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Infectious disease is a systems problem \u2013 and systems problems require systems solutions</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The environmental degradation of natural ecosystems has resulted in many negative outcomes, one of which is the outbreak of infectious disease. The vast majority of human infectious diseases, such as malaria, Zika, and HIV/Aids, originate in animals. When we disrupt the natural environment and habitat of animals, we are poking the beast, so to speak. </p> <p>Take deforestation. Destroying the delicate balance of ecological conditions in forests increases contact between humans and potential reservoirs of disease in the animal population.

The environment plays a critical role in serving as a buffer against infectious disease. A failure to recognise the value of this service that forests provide means that deforestation and infectious disease outbreaks are likely to continue at alarming rates.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"2df4cfdbfbf8a44b951640c72ce63226776c18b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2df4cfdbfbf8a44b951640c72ce63226776c18b8/0_88_4000_2402/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jambi province, Sumatra.

Treating only one part of the overall problem \u2013 whether by vaccination, quarantine or awareness campaigns \u2013 merely scratches the surface. Effective solutions must address the system as a whole, including changes to underlying ecosystems. The field of <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/infographics/planetary-health\">planetary health</a> has emerged to better understand and solve the integrated relationship between human health and the environment. It aims to shed light on health problems induced by large-scale changes to the environment, and to highlight new ways of working to address these often intractable issues.</p> <p>The connection between environmental change and human health is increasingly clear, but this big-picture view is not how we currently orient ourselves. Take existing public health solutions to Ebola, for example, which are to treat the disease, contain its spread, and prevent it by developing a vaccine.

      "headline": "The Long Weekend: Life in the English Country House 1918-1939 by Adrian Tinniswood \u2013 review",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-15T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>John Buchan, author of <em>The Thirty-Nine Steps</em>, did not see active service in the first world war, spending it instead as a correspondent, an intelligence officer and, finally, as director of information under Lord Beaverbrook. Nevertheless, its \u201calien immensities\u201d left him painfully adrift, a disorientation for which, demobbed, he sought a cure in the British countryside. Wandering its lanes helped him to reclaim the past, and thus to have hope in the future.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is as if Tinniswood is at the biggest, wildest, most luxuriantly decadent party ever thrown, and he knows everyone</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>During the war, he\u2019d found himself unable to respond to nature without remembering how the scent of hawthorn had vied with the stench of gas, the sound of birdsong had signalled a lull in the artillery barrage. Now, though, it was alive for him again. In 1919, he and his wife sold their London house, swapping it for an 18th-century manor in Elsfield, Oxfordshire. Henceforth, he would style himself a \u201cminor country gentleman with a taste for letters\u201d.</p> <p>Adrian Tinniswood tells this story early on in <em>The Long Weekend</em>, his fantastically readable and endlessly fascinating book about life in the English country house between the wars, offering it as an alternative narrative both to the \u201csternly just and justly stern judgment on the idyllisers\u201d provided by the posthumous publication of the poems of Wilfred Owen, and to the fragmented realities of TS Eliot\u2019s <em>The Waste Land</em>. In the mansions and manor houses of postwar England, it was, he writes, \u201cBuchan\u2019s view which triumphed, not Owen\u2019s bitter sacrifice or Eliot\u2019s message of despair and redemption\u201d. The peers of the realm \u2013 there were 746 of them at the armistice \u2013 buried their sons, and carried on as before, cleaving to the past as if to a beloved body. Meanwhile, a new generation bought or (more often) rented their own grand houses, many of them facilitated in this not too long afterwards by the depression, when the market was flooded with such properties.</p> <p>It\u2019s true that with the 1930s came destruction. Plenty of piles were razed to the ground, their Adam fittings and Zoffany portraits already having been sold off. Among the casualties were such beauties as Sutton Scarsdale in Derbyshire, one of whose chimney pieces was flogged to the American press baron William Randolph Hearst, and Nuthall Temple in Nottinghamshire, whose denuded Palladian-inspired carcass was burned by demolition contractors in 1929. But as Tinniswood asserts, the majority survived. It\u2019s this group \u2013 plus several daring new ones, designed during these years \u2013 in which his interest lies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/23/rachel-cooke-shelf-life-wentworth-woodhouse-catherine-bailey-black-diamond-fitzilliam-family-coal\">Black Diamonds and how the other half lived</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Faced with so many astonishing buildings \u2013 not to mention the glamorous and frequently eccentric types who lived in them \u2013 his approach is to devote each chapter to a different aspect of their life or creation. One is given over to the houses inhabited by the children of George V, another to those designed by Lutyens, yet others to interior design, field sports and gay life. Some characters and places, however, will keep reappearing, among them the premier architect of big houses in this period, Philip Tilden, and his client Sir Philip Sassoon, the fabulously wealthy Conservative MP for whom, in 1918, he designed the outrageous Port Lympne on a site overlooking Romney Marsh. Tilden believed that Port Lympne, with its murals by Rex Whistler, its garden by Norah Lindsay, and its dramatic bathing pool that seemed to float above the marsh, was Sassoon\u2019s response to the war, a declaration that \u201ca new culture had risen up from the sickbed of the old, with new aspirations\u2026 [a] mind tuned to a new burst of imagination\u201d. Was this so? Or did he magic it up simply because he could? Either way, it would doubtless have made Buchan gag, just as it did several sneering others. On its dining room walls was a frieze of white bullocks and naked black Egyptians by Glyn Philpot. Legend has it that in 1937 Philpot was recalled at short notice to add loincloths to these figures ahead of a visit by Queen Mary.</p> <p><em>The Long Weekend</em> bulges with stories like these: delicious, occasionally fantastical, revealing in ways that <em>Downton Abbey</em> never was. It is as if Tinniswood is at the biggest, wildest, most luxuriantly decadent party ever thrown, and he knows <em>everyone</em>. Here is the society decorator Sibyl Colefax, burning rosemary on saucers so that her Chelsea villa might smell enticing to guests she hoped to bag as clients; here is the future Edward VIII doing his needlepoint on a low modern sofa at the newly remodelled Fort Belvedere in Windsor Great Park; and here is Edwin Lutyens worrying about Castle Drogo in Devon, the modern yet timelessly solid place he is building for the tea importer Julius Drewe. Among Tinniswood\u2019s virtues as a writer are his ability to animate buildings in a way that makes the pulse race even when the text is not accompanied by an image; his refusal to succumb to what he calls the \u201cdangers of periodisation\u201d (those who inhabited the world of England between the wars had not necessarily been formed by it); and, above all, his boundless taste for gossip.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You may not mourn this privileged world, its nepotism or its bigotry. But you can\u2019t fail to be entertained by it</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Divorce being on the rise, he loiters outside several key bedrooms, merrily noting the corridor creepers as they tiptoe by. One of his stories concerns Christabel Hulme Hart, a Mayfair couturier who married the heir to the Ampthill barony, the Hon John Russell. Having told her new husband that they wouldn\u2019t be sleeping together, he was somewhat surprised to discover three years after their chaste marriage that she was expecting a baby. Another, much sadder one involves Madresfield Court, the house that inspired <em>Brideshead Revisited</em>, whose owner William Lygon, 7th Earl Beauchamp was forced into foreign exile for being homosexual. (\u201cI thought men like that shot themselves,\u201d said George V on being informed of what he was up to.)</p> <p>Tinniswood is good on the fashions of the day, among them \u201cthe between-wars cult of the tub\u201d, a trend that reached its apotheosis in the form of an onyx-walled bathroom at Middleton Park near Bicester, a wondrous bit of English deco commissioned by the Earl of Jersey\u2019s movie-star wife, Virginia Cherrill. And he gives proper and sensitive attention to the serving classes without whose hard labour this gilded world could never have functioned. But perhaps he is at his best when it comes to the house party or Saturday-to-Monday (it was non-U to use the word \u201cweekend\u201d), with its relays of cars, its exhausting dress codes, its picnics of plover eggs. Oh, the sheer extravagant claustrophobia of it all. You may not mourn this privileged world, its nepotism, its entitlement and its bigotry. But, as he tells it, you can\u2019t fail to be entertained by it. Like a guest at one of Cecil Beaton\u2019s crazy parties, it kept me up all night.</p> <p><em>The Long Weekend is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a325). </em><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/385182/\"><em>Click here to order it for \u00a320</em></a><em> </em></p>",

      "body": "<p>In Holland, a country that knows a thing or two about cycling, they now sell more electric bikes than traditional city bikes. The lurking snobbery that an eBike is \u2018cheating\u2019 has gone and in the coming years many more of us will be powering up for a sweat-free pedal. One of the brands ready to take advantage of this is Electra \u2013 it\u2019s already on to its second generation pedal-assist bike. The Townie Go! 8i has a frame-mounted Bosch mid-drive system, rather than a hub engine, which has four levels of support: Eco, Tour, Sport and Turbo with a top speed of 15mph (25kmh). (It\u2019s worth noting that in the UK, cycles with motor assist are only treated legally as bicycles if the motor assist cuts out at 25 kmh. Faster than that and they are legally mopeds, requiring registration, tax, insurance and the rider to wear a motorcycle helmet and use only roads open to motorbikes, ie no cycle paths, tracks etc.) The Townie takes 3.5 hours to charge and for that you have a range of 20-100 miles. It\u2019s comfortable and relaxed and those \u2018Fat Frank\u2019 tyres really soak up the bumps. It is pricey, but maybe it\u2019s time to turn down easy street (<a href=\"http://www.electrabike.com/bikes/townie-go\"><em>electrabike.com</em></a>).</p> <p><strong>Price: \u00a31,999<br /></strong><strong>Engine: Bosch 250w<br /></strong><strong>Gears: Shimano Nexus 8-speed</strong></p> <h2><strong>Gripping stuff</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4192739df237a8aa7769072d6fa743fe3885d79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4192739df237a8aa7769072d6fa743fe3885d79/0_183_500_300/500.jpg\" alt=\"Adidas trail trainer with Continental mountain-bike soles\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bike know-how: the Adidas trail trainer with Continental mountain-bike soles</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s only when you slip that you really start to think about the contact points you have with the ground beneath you. In a car, each tyre will cover as little as a postcard at any one time. On a bike, especially when fitted with skinny road tyres, it\u2019s a fraction of that. This explains why tyre manufacturers spend a fortune in R&amp;D ensuring that the meeting point between technical rubber and the earth is as beneficial as possible to you. Now <a href=\"http://www.continental-tyres.co.uk/\">Continental</a>, a byword for adhesion among cyclists for generations, has teamed up with Adidas to create off-road running shoes with super sticky soles. Using tread inspired by mountain bike tyres, the latest Terrex X-King trail shoes have been designed specifically for running on gravel and on wet and loose paths. They\u2019re light (weighing just 300g), protective and highly durable. They have tough moulded toe and heel caps, and an ingenious quick-lace system so you never need to worry about them coming untied halfway across some boggy moor. Think of them as \u201ctyres for your feet\u201d. <em><strong>Terrex X-King</strong> \u00a3110, <a href=\"http://TERREX X-KING SHOES/terrex-x-king-shoes/AF5996.html\">adidas.co.uk</a></em></p> <p><em>Email Martin at </em><a href=\"mailto:martin.love@observer.co.uk\"><em>martin.love@observer.co.uk</em></a><em> or follow him on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/MartinLove166\"><em>@MartinLove166</em></a></p>",

      "body": "<p>For Laura Watts, the best thing about her parents\u2019 house, with its striking early 70s design, was always the woodland which surrounds it. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like a treehouse, with enormous windows,\u201d she says. \u201cCrows used to peck on the windows and wake us up in the mornings. You\u2019d see deer walking by, and rabbits. There were lots of tiny frogs at the pond. It was a wildlife house, really.\u201d</p> <p>While Watts and her siblings were climbing trees and fighting imaginary bears outside, their parents <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2010/apr/17/election-liberal-democrat-goodhart\">Celia and William Goodhart</a> might have been preparing to hobnob with politicians and academics in their \u201cwacky country house\u201d three miles southwest of Oxford.</p> <p>The sloping modern home was designed by Celia\u2019s brother-in-law, architect <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2005/dec/10/gardens\">Hal Moggridge</a>. A steep staircase, decorated with plaster fashioned to look like exposed cement, joins a diagonal hallway to connect the house\u2019s six bedrooms and deliberately designed large spaces for entertaining.</p> <p>William Goodhart \u2013 a human rights lawyer and Liberal Democrat politician \u2013 and his family are well connected. \u201cThere were plenty of debates,\u201d says Watts, \u201cespecially with my uncle, a Conservative MP, who lived down the hill. But they usually avoided talking politics with him. They had different views and that was that.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"88aa013957a7a8e6c0e455afe19eb620c4460d86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/88aa013957a7a8e6c0e455afe19eb620c4460d86/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018You\u2019d see deer walking by, and rabbits\u2019: a view of the house from the garden.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018You\u2019d see deer walking by, and rabbits\u2019: a view of the house from the garden.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gavin Kingcome</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Moggridge was influenced in his design by the work of <a href=\"http://www.franklloydwright.org/\">Frank Lloyd Wright</a>, who believed that buildings should exist in harmony with their natural environments, as well as Finnish architect <a href=\"http://www.alvaraalto.fi/index_en.htm\">Alvar Aalto</a> and famous structures of the era such as the Royal Festival Hall.</p> <p>\u201cAt first the whole of the front of the house was going to be glass,\u201d says Moggridge. \u201cIt was very fashionable at that time. But my parents were worried, completely rightly, about the brightness and overexposure. So the form of the house changed and the windows became holes punched into the wooden walls.\u201d</p> <p>The family didn\u2019t just stumble on the secluded plot of land: it was once the site of a crumbling Victorian mansion that belonged to archaeologist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Evans\">Arthur Evans</a>, which Watts\u2019s grandfather, who lived next door, bought in an auction in the 1940s. \u201cNo one bid for it, apparently,\u201d says Moggridge. \u201cThey had to demolish the big old house that Evans lived in; he wanted to give it to Oxford University, but they didn\u2019t want it. It was rather derelict.\u201d</p> <p>The ambitious project remains one of only three houses created by Moggridge, who is now a landscape architect. \u201cIt was the biggest real project I\u2019d done,\u201d he says. \u201cThe place was totally overgrown. When we first were surveying it, it was a matter of crawling through the undergrowth. My wife helped me, as I was a one-man band at the time.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ee742de05360b20be40bbdd8aa9adee68e22a4ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee742de05360b20be40bbdd8aa9adee68e22a4ed/0_315_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The built-in storage made fantastic hiding places\u2019: looking into the dining room from the kitchen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The built-in storage made fantastic hiding places\u2019: looking into the dining room from the kitchen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gavin Kingcome</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A lot of care was taken when it came to selecting the materials for the interiors, he adds. The exceptionally high wooden ceiling in the first-floor drawing room is made from Parana pine, while the concrete columns and beams were made by the same company which provided the materials to build St Catherine\u2019s College in Oxford.</p> <p>The elderly Goodharts lived in their home, known as Youlbury House, for years after they retired, and succeeded in having it grade II listed in 2009. Now they are moving out and the house is back on the market.</p> <p>Watts still remembers the house fondly. \u201cThe built-in storage made fantastic hiding places and spaces to play in. We did spend a lot of our time playing in the airing cupboard.\u201d</p> <p>And while Moggridge says he is proud that his design has \u201cweathered quite well\u201d, it\u2019s the long evenings spent putting the world to rights which stand out in his memory. \u201cThey had a lot of good parties which we were often invited to,\u201d he recalls. \u201cEven when there were just a few people we\u2019d have a drink. They had some very interesting friends.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<h2>Louis Theroux: A Different Brain</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC2<br /></strong>Following on from his recent look at alcoholism, the UK\u2019s premier documentarian returns with another sensitive film, this time on living with a brain injury. Earl\u2019s personality and interests have radically altered since he was involved in a car crash, while Dan \u2013 who sustained his injury in the late 90s \u2013 is desperate to live independently again. Elsewhere, Amanda is struggling to readjust to family life, and Natalie\u2019s carers share her especially affecting story. <em>Hannah J Davies</em></p> <h2>BBC Young Musician 2016 Grand Final</h2> <p><strong>7pm, BBC4<br /></strong>The three remaining contenders make their cases for the big prize at the Barbican, each undertaking a complete concerto with the BBC Symphony Orchestra. Saxophonist Jess Gillam will perform Michael Nyman\u2019s Where The Bee Dances, French horn player Ben Goldscheider will tackle Richard Strauss\u2019s Horn Concerto No 2, and cellist Sheku Kanneh-Mason will attempt Shostakovich\u2019s Cello Concerto No 1. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2>Let\u2019s Do It: A Tribute To Victoria Wood</h2> <p><strong>7.30pm, ITV<br /></strong>Nearly 30 years ago, Victoria Wood invited celebrities such as Judi Dench, Dave Allen and Joan Bakewell (\u201cI suppose Mensa was shut, was it?\u201d) to an ITV studio for An Audience With Victoria Wood, a tour de force of comic songs and sharp wit. The gathering here is a sadder occasion, to celebrate her life after her passing several weeks ago. Clips abound, while tributes come from co-stars and famous faces such as Peter Kay, Celia Imrie and David Threlfall. <em>John Robinson</em></p> <h2>Undercover</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC1<br /></strong>Like much of writer Peter Moffat\u2019s best work, Undercover has eschewed predictable TV drama beats, instead offering revelations at unexpected moments. The result is a final episode where, for all that things are eventually tied up relatively neatly, you\u2019re never quite sure what\u2019s going to happen next. This gives such scenes as Maya\u2019s appearance before the Supreme Court real power. Meantime, while his wife acts as advocate for Rudy, Nick hunts for a way to make amends. <em>Jonathan Wright</em></p> <h2>Indian Summers</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Channel 4<br /></strong>Final episode of the sultry expat drama. Cynthia\u2019s coffers are dwindling as she prepares to take on the Soods in a bidding war for her beloved Chotipool. She can\u2019t possibly hope to win and things look bleak. Meanwhile, Charlie and Alice are clearing out for good as the empire sinks beneath the waves. Another quietly sweltering series featuring beauteous cinematography, fine performances and Julie Walters moving pleasingly into the next phase of her career. <em>Julia Raeside</em></p> <h2>Lion Queens</h2> <p><strong>8pm, Nat Geo Wild<br /></strong>The Ruaha river in Tanzania isn\u2019t the multi-species sanctuary it used to be: climate change is affecting the water level and, consequently, the power dynamic between predators and prey, making it harder for a local pride of lions to hunt buffalo. Can the lionesses overcome the heat and feed their babies? That life-and-death story is entirely uninvolving in this film, which adorns bog-standard footage with cursory muzak and a half-hearted script. Grrr. <em>Jack Seale</em></p> <h2>Nasa\u2019s Unexplained Files</h2> <p><strong>8pm, Discovery<br /></strong>A new series of Nasa\u2019s Unexplained Files begins with the Apollo 10 tapes, which were classified in 1969 and unearthed in 2008. Astronauts, having lost contact with mission control on the dark side of the moon, say they heard unidentified transmissions, like \u201cweird space music\u201d. Whether it was the sound of an alien transmission or a clash of radio signals has long been debated. Also explored is an anomaly on Mars discovered by an amateur astronomer. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"937505d099308cf18eb45f4c72c8fc437faabb79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/937505d099308cf18eb45f4c72c8fc437faabb79/0_915_1754_1052/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jon Voight in Runaway Train\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jon Voight in Runaway Train</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/MGM/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Film Choice</h2> <p><strong>Runaway Train<br />(Andrei Konchalovsky, 1985) Sunday, 9pm, Movies4Men</strong><br />After his majestic Russian epic Siberiade, Konchalovsky\u2019s early US films were disappointing \u2013 apart from this. Based on a Kurosawa script, it tells of two escaped cons (Jon Voight, Eric Roberts) hitching a ride on a locomotive hurtling driverless across frozen Alaskan wasteland, pursued by furies in helicopters led by John P Ryan\u2019s pitbull-like warden. A crunchingly brutal tale, with the liberal softy Voight triumphantly reborn as the hardest of cons. It makes the train in Tony Scott\u2019s Unstoppable look like a fairground ride. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <p><strong>Rescue Dawn<br />(Werner Herzog, 2006), 11.30pm, BBC2</strong><br />With Aguirre, Wrath Of God and Fitzcarraldo to his name, Herzog has plenty of experience of crashing about in the jungle, and here he is again with the real-life story of US bomber pilot Dieter Dengler, who was shot down in the Vietnam war, then captured and tortured before organising a breakout into the depths of the forest. Christian Bale brings unbelievable physical commitment to a weird, very watchable drama. <em>PH</em></p> <p><strong>The Graduate<br />(Mike Nichols, 1967), 11.40pm, Gold</strong><br />Dustin Hoffman\u2019s newly graduated Benjamin arrives home, majoring in angsty disgust as he falls into a cynical affair with his parents\u2019 friend, Mrs Robinson (Anne Bancroft) \u2013 until true love turns up in the shape of her daughter Elaine (Katharine Ross). Ironic, sexy, full of slick 60s camera trickery and sporting classic Simon And Garfunkel songs, The Graduate captured the mood of the decade. <em>PH</em></p> <p><strong>127 Hours<br />(Danny Boyle, 2010), 1.30am, Film4</strong><br />The grisly true story of Aron Ralston, the young hiker whose arm became trapped between a boulder and the rocky face of a crevice in the wilderness of south-eastern Utah, and the horrifying choice he had to make to free himself, seems all but unfilmable. Yet Boyle skilfully illuminates Ralston\u2019s inner mental struggle, while James Franco plays the part with utter conviction. An extraordinary tale of survival against the odds. <em>PH</em></p> <h2>Today\u2019s live sport</h2> <p><strong>IPL Cricket: Mumbai Indians v Delhi Daredevils, 11am, Sky Sports 5</strong><br />From the Wankhede in Mumbai.</p> <p><strong>Formula 1: Spanish Grand Prix 12noon, Channel 4<br /></strong>From the Circuit de Catalunya in Barcelona.</p> <p>Cycling: Giro D\u2019Italia 1.30pm, Eurosport 1<br />The Chianti Classico time trial.</p> <p>Premier League Football: The Final Day 2pm, Sky Sports 1</p> <p>A pleasingly barmy Premier League season ends, probably with a scrap for fourth place.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 16 May 2016. An earlier version of the preview of BBC Young Musician 2016 grand final referred to the contestants undertaking a complete symphony, rather than a concerto.<br /></p>",

      "headline": "What makes revenge porn such a sinister crime?",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-15T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>It is a year since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/feb/08/revenge-porn-victims-helpline-launched\">revenge porn became a crime</a>. Last week a father was arrested after posting pictures of women online (including one who was pregnant, and doctored photos of a 15-year-old girl), commenting underneath one that he would \u201cpay \u00a3100 to rape her\u201d. Despite <a href=\"https://www.womensaid.org.uk/8530-2/\">Women\u2019s Aid\u2019s research</a> revealing that, for a third of women surveyed, threats made online were later carried out in real life, he was let off with a caution. Which leads one to ask, if one is the curious type, if the law is working.</p> <p>While only around 9% of online hate crimes are investigated nationwide, a Freedom of Information Act request by the BBC showed there had been <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-36054273\">1,160 reported incidents of revenge porn in the first year</a> of the new law coming into effect, including three involving children. Of these, 11% resulted in a charge.</p> <p>The law was imposed in order to recognise the impact revenge porn has on its victims, positioning it as an example of domestic violence, and as a crime that is gendered \u2013 90% of victims are women. But as we see the problems with fighting <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/10/police-revenge-porn-cautions-sexual-predators\">revenge porn</a> (a name that feels less satisfactory the more I write it, a drop-down option for a Wednesday night alone rather than a life ruiner, a crime) it\u2019s worth stepping away from the legalities, and returning to the women. It\u2019s worth, I think, exploring just why revenge porn is such a sinister crime.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You walk through the world as one person, then, unclothed you are someone else</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>One of my favourite moments in the Alan Partridge oeuvre is when he denies his body exists. \u201cUnderneath our clothes we\u2019re, all of us, naked. Even you, Alan,\u201d remarks a fashion designer he is interviewing on air. \u201cNo I\u2019m not,\u201d he replies. A small pause. \u201cAll we are saying,\u201d his co-host adds, \u201cis that underneath your clothes you are naked.\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d says Alan, moving to the next link. \u201cNo I\u2019m not.\u201d Without wanting to dilute the magic of Partridge by breaking apart a joke into its constituent parts, the humour lies in his insistence that, as Alan Partridge, TV host, broadcaster, maverick, he is above such things as nudity; while he is working his nakedness does not exist. Since this was first aired I have grown to feel as if Alan had a point. In this cold country it is a choice to be naked. To be naked is to be vulnerable, to be seen as something other than professional, than proper. In Alan\u2019s case it is to be seen as unmanly. In the case of a woman, though, it is to be seen as sexual. You walk through the world as one person, then, unclothed, you are someone else. There\u2019s a reason that arriving at school naked is a recurring nightmare for so many.</p> <p>Revenge porn victims say they\u2019ve suffered \u201csignificant emotional distress\u201d after an ex posted their nude photos online. When we all carry broadcast-quality cameras in our pockets, they inevitably feature in many relationships, but in moments of trust, when candles are lit in your head and you feel good, in control. When you feel as if the person kneeling in front of you is your friend. Later, when you enter a job interview and wonder whether the interviewers were there, too, that control is lost. When you have lunch with your mother, or order a coffee, or teach algebra to your GCSE class and wonder whether they have seen you in the bra he bought you, in those shoes. Once seen like this, can they ever see you clothed?</p> <p>Revenge porn is so insidious and so pernicious because even as we creep towards equality, this is one of the places where men still maintain power. Women\u2019s bodies have currency. It\u2019s this commodification that leads to the most crushing detail of revenge porn: that so <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/08/they-didnt-know-they-were-victims-revenge-porn-helpline-sees-alarming-rise\">many women don\u2019t realise that they are victims</a> \u2013 either they are unaware that the pictures are public or they don\u2019t know that this is a crime. Already so many women feel their bodies are objects, seen through a lens; to have to fight for your photo to be removed from porn sites when, because it\u2019s from your husband\u2019s phone, you don\u2019t own the copyright, leaves a person feeling powerless.</p> <p>Online abuse is threatening to overwhelm the police, and it\u2019s taking too long for the law to creak up to date. While new legislation should help in time, a more effective way of eliminating revenge porn is to work to prevent it \u2013 to educate children about how to value intimacy, to respect a person\u2019s privacy and, crucially, that a woman\u2019s body is her own.</p> <p><em>Email Eva at <a href=\"mailto:e.wiseman@observer.co.uk\">e.wiseman@observer.co.uk</a> or follow her on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EvaWiseman?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@EvaWiseman</a></em></p>",

Probably not. Many psychological studies have found that \u2013 for both friendships and romantic relationships \u2013 we tend to choose people who have similar attitudes to ourselves. The study this quiz was based on found that we suss out other people within minutes of meeting them and don\u2019t pursue friendships with those whose attitudes are very different from ours.</p> <p>Researchers gave participants a wide range of questionnaires on their personality/attitudes/behaviour then paired them up, later returning to see which pairs pursued a friendship beyond the study.</p> <p>Weirdly, a follow-up study found that covering people\u2019s torsos with a black bag (but not a clear bag) impaired participants\u2019 ability to pick out others with similar attitudes and personalities. No one\u2019s sure what people gleaned from each other\u2019s torsos \u2013 body size, waist-to-hip ratio, a subtle shimmy radiating confidence \u2013 but we seem to use this information subconsciously to identify others with a similar take on life.

It\u2019s ruined by the arrival of a swarm of jet skis. Looking like giant hornets, they carve across the bay, the whine of their engines broken only by the constant whump whump of their hulls crashing through the waves. You sit and pray for silence \u2013 and a hidden reef. Bloody jet skis!</p> <p>Like everyone else I thought jet skis were just a noisy and dangerous blight on the beach. And to find out just how antisocial they are I headed to the south coast to have a shot on the latest model from BRP \u2013 the giant Canadian company which makes everything from Ski-Doos to trains and three-wheel motorbikes.</p> <p>I arrived at <a href=\"http://www.jetbikes.com/\">Sussex Marine Water Sports</a>, a scruffy yard overlooking the commercial docks at Southwick\u2019s Half Tide Quay. Gary, the owner, has been into jet skis for 30 years. He used to be a car dealer \u2013 Vauxhalls mainly. But it\u2019s \u201cskiing\u201d he\u2019s into now. The sport has changed hugely over the years, he tells me. Lots of work has gone into safety and speed and respecting others. The craft now have water brakes, reverse gears and kill switches, and they\u2019re cleaner and quieter. \u201cThe ocean is massive,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s room for everyone.\u201d</p> <p>But let\u2019s not pretend we\u2019re here to potter about on a water scooter. Jet skis are faster and more agile than ever, some even have suspension for a more comfortable ride. The top of the list 300hp Sea-Doo will do 0-60mph in less than 3 seconds. \u201cThat\u2019s Ferrari quick,\u201d Gary says. I\u2019m here to try the entry-level <a href=\"http://uk.sea-doo.com/\">Sea-Doo Spark</a>. It weighs just 184kg and costs \u00a34,999. The 300hp ski costs \u00a317,000 (with a trailer). The Spark has either a 60 or a 90hp engine. It\u2019s built to be fun, to be thrown about by kids. Perfect for me.</p> <p>I pull on my wetsuit and Marcel, a toothless former football player from Toulon, shows me how it all works \u2013 bike-like bars and a very simple twist-and-go throttle. We gently motor out of the harbour, staying under 5mph, until we hit the open sea. When we are a good half mile from the shore, Marcel starts spinning his Sea-Doo, jumping it over the waves. His craft is black and white and as it surges out of the water, showering spray, it looks like a baby orca leaping for joy in the surf.</p> <p>The Spark is easy to use \u2013 it has been designed for beginners and kids. The power is instant and falling in is part of the fun. Later we pin our ears back and hurtle straight out to sea at 40mph, skipping across the ripples like two huge pebbles. Out here, miles from anyone, it\u2019s amazing. It feels like riding a dolphin.</p> <h2>Car heaven at Heveningham Hall in Suffolk</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1d455f805c4d53ae378ca7ee717e23deaffbc6be\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1d455f805c4d53ae378ca7ee717e23deaffbc6be/60_201_1135_681/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Red-letter day: a Ferrari 250GTO parked outside Heveningham Hall.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Red-letter day: a Ferrari 250GTO parked outside Heveningham Hall.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cameron Maynard/Aperto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> Heveningham Hall, a drop-dead stunner of a country estate which dates from 1778, has just announced plans to host an inaugural Concours d\u2019Elegance over the weekend of 2 and 3 July.

      "body": "<p>Long working hours and commutes can seriously eat into quality garden time for us planty types. But if you are often only home in time to see the sun dip over the horizon, a few design tricks can not only extend the amount of time you can enjoy your plot, but can also make it look its best in twilight.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>White and silver plants reflect the last rays, making them visible long after others have faded into the gloom</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As light levels drop in the evening our perception of colour changes. The hot reds and yellows that look so fiery in bright afternoon sun appear flat and dull, as our eyes are less able to detect the longwave light that these reflect. Our vision switches from using specialised structures at the back of our eyes, called cone cells, to a different group called rod cells, which are semi-colourblind. Under these conditions blues and greens are far easier to detect, explaining why everything looks cooler and fresher in the evening.</p> <p>Of course you can go one better and opt for whites and silvers, which reflect the last rays even better, making them visible long after others have faded into the gloom. This may help explain why spring flowers tend to be paler than the richer, redder flowers of high summer, with their comparative lack of red pigment helping them shine out in lower light. Fortunately, white mutations are fairly common in plants, meaning almost every popular garden plant is also available in an ivory-flowered form. The word <em>alba</em> (Latin for \u201cwhite\u201d) in a plant\u2019s scientific name is a dead giveaway.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e51b5feb53f27b83aa1d86e2b05173672bc1d090\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e51b5feb53f27b83aa1d86e2b05173672bc1d090/615_956_2330_3476/670.jpg\" alt=\"Colchicum flowers.\" width=\"670\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colchicum flowers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Starting with snowy white narcissi and tulips in spring, you can get a good succession throughout the summer with jasmines, lilies, roses and gardenias, rounding the season off with <a href=\"http://www.rhsplants.co.uk/plants/_/gladiolus-murielae/classid.2000015189/\">acidantheras</a>, <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/92234/Colchicum-speciosum-Album/Details?returnurl=%2Fplants%2Fsearch-results%3Fform-mode%3Dfalse%26query%3Dcolchicum%26aliaspath%3D%252fplants%252fsearch-results\">colchicums</a> and Japanese anemones in autumn.</p> <p>A curious bonus with many of these plants is that white-flowered species are often the most intensely fragrant, because the structures that create their aromatic oils replace those responsible for generating pigment in their petals. When do many of these emit most fragrance? Sunset.</p> <p>Variegated plants work a treat to add a cool glow to evening gardens, and despite common belief they don\u2019t have to be tacky. I particularly like some of the larger-leafed hostas and grasses which provide a lush, understated backdrop to the cream-coloured flowers. A flash of silver from the fuzzy leaves of astelias or stachys, which have evolved to reflect light, will help add an ephemeral texture and shimmer.</p> <p>Finally, add a light-coloured mulch to paths, or paint walls and decks in a fresh pastel. They will act like big reflectors, bouncing even more light in and allowing you to eke out every last minute from your garden.</p> <p><em>Email James at <a href=\"mailto:james.wong@observer.co.uk\">james.wong@observer.co.uk</a> or follow him on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Botanygeek?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@Botanygeek</a></em></p>",

      "body": "<h2>What does my throne say about me?</h2> <p><em>Victoria, a 36-year-old actor, made her \u201ciron throne\u201d from recycled materials two years ago, and has 28 signatures on it from </em>Game of Thrones <em>cast members, including </em><em>Kit Harington. </em>\u201cIt says I\u2019m obsessed with <em>Game of Thrones</em>, and that I have determination. I made it through trial and error \u2013 and boredom.\u201d</p> <h2>And what it really says</h2> <p>I don\u2019t watch <em>Game of Thrones</em>, but even a non-believer like me can see that this homemade throne \u2013 Victoria\u2019s version of the actual Iron Throne \u2013 is an amazing achievement. A mad thing to have looming from the corner of your sitting room, but amazing, nonetheless. Anything crafted with care and love, invention and attention is to be admired, and I admire it.</p> <p>I\u2019m not sure how well it works as a sofa, though. It\u2019s a bit upright. Not enough cushions. Nowhere convenient for snacks. I showed it to a couple of people who thought it would work as a commode, meaning you could plonk yourself in front of re-runs of <em>GoT </em>and never have to move. One of the swords would make an ideal toilet roll holder.</p> <p><em>Game of Thrones </em>is filmed in Belfast and when our real Queen visited the set, she refused to sit on the Iron Throne. The rules of monarchy mean royalty can\u2019t take their seat upon a throne \u2013 even a pretend one \u2013 unless it\u2019s theirs. Which is the whole point of the programme. The throne is what everyone is fighting over: a physical representation of the power at stake.</p> <p>What this throne says about Victoria is that she takes her fantasy seriously. Dungeons &amp; Dragons enthusiasts were once thought of as odd-bods who disappeared into magical tales because they couldn\u2019t cope with real life. But with the success of <em>Game of Thrones</em>, they are part of the mainstream alongside <em>Twilight</em> vampire-lovers and <em>Harry Potter </em>spell-casters. Victoria isn\u2019t an outsider any more. Her throne doesn\u2019t invite ridicule, but applause.</p> <p><em>If you would like Miranda to cast an eye over your favourite possession, email a photograph to </em><em><a href=\"mailto:magazine@observer.co.uk\">magazine@observer.co.uk</a></em></p>",

      "body": "<p>In my continued effort to experiment with green living, I\u2019m trying naked cosmetics. I\u2019ve traded in over-engineered pump-action pots for slices of soap wrapped in paper, and chunks of \u201csolid\u201d shampoo in reusable tins.</p> <p>I\u2019d have liked to have spread my experiment around various brands, but when it comes to solid beauty there\u2019s only one serious player on the high street: <a href=\"https://uk.lush.com/\">Lush</a>. What it lacks in sophistication the brand makes up for in non-conformism \u2013 35% of the product range is deemed \u201cnaked\u201d, devoid of both synthetic preservatives and packaging. Lush says that last year it displaced more than 15m plastic bottles through global sales of its shampoo bar.</p> <p>This will seem like lunacy to the mainstream beauty industry, which uses packaging not so much for function but for marketing. As Bob Lilienfeld, author of the <a href=\"http://www.use-less-stuff.com/\"><em>Use Less Stuff Report</em></a>, puts it: \u201cThe cosmetic industry is in the perception business. The environmental industry is in the reality business. It\u2019s perception versus reality.\u201d</p> <p>The reality is a dependency on plastics \u2013 280m tonnes of plastic are produced globally each year and 8m tonnes of plastic waste finds its way into oceans. Then there are greenhouse gas emissions from producing plastic feedstock. According to Stanford University, one tonne of recycled plastic saves 16.3 barrels of oil.</p> <p>Great, but in terms of recycling I\u2019m constantly outwitted by personal care products in complex plastic containers. My tins and wrapping paper represent a reprieve. There are some negatives. My hair is crying out for a more nuanced conditioner. On the plus side, Lush\u2019s famously pungent perfumes make my gym bag smell great. And the ingredients in these simple products are more straightforward, meaning fewer chemicals in my life.</p> <h2>The big picture: migrating with swans<br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"642a09c5bc77032de740b4c16213dc314de5c42e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/642a09c5bc77032de740b4c16213dc314de5c42e/137_0_2248_1350/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sky\u2019s the limit: Sacha Dench in training over Sweden, before she sets off to follow the migrating swans.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sky\u2019s the limit: Sacha Dench in training over Sweden, before she sets off to follow the migrating swans.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Is it a bird, is it a plane? No, it\u2019s Sacha Dench of the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust. From September she will follow a flock of endangered Bewick\u2019s swans on their 4,660-mile migration from Siberia to the Severn Estuary using a paramotor.

Now it is adding social justice to the mix. Last summer, Camper cordwainers and leather specialists began working with Ethiopian artisans in partnership with the Ethical Fashion Initiative, set up to utilise the skills of marginalised artisans in sub-Saharan Africa and Haiti. The Camaleon collection represents the fruits of their labours. Camaleon was actually one of the brand\u2019s original designs, based on a traditional Mallorcan peasant shoe typically made from scraps of leather, canvas and tyres. This time the shoe gets a material upgrade: it\u2019s manufactured from bati goat leather in Ethiopia using historic tie-dye techniques to get the distinctive patterns. The Camaleon range is available in selected CamperLab stores, or at <a href=\"http://www.camper.com/en_GB\">camper.com</a></p> <p><em>Email Lucy at <a href=\"mailto:lucy.siegle@observer.co.uk\">lucy.siegle@observer.co.uk</a> or follow her on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/lucysiegle?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@lucysiegle</a></em></p>",

      "body": "<p>\u201cThis life,\u201d wrote the French poet <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/dec/07/my-hero-charles-baudelaire-roberto-calasso\">Charles Baudelaire </a>more than a century ago, \u201cis a hospital where each patient is possessed with the desire to change his bed.\u201d No \u201cHow to Change Your Bed in Seven Days!\u201d poem followed, alas. Today we still yearn for better bodies or relationships, jobs or houses. We crave money, security, health, fulfilment, peace of mind, success, adventure or that most slippery commodity, happiness.</p> <p>The hunger for change is nothing new, but nowadays we consider these not idle longings but a prerogative. Modern secular culture is one in which, more than ever before, we feel entitled to make the changes that fit our dreams and aspirations. That right to change, to be the author of one\u2019s own life, matters. It\u2019s about freedom, autonomy, choice.</p> <p>But here\u2019s the rub: we\u2019re often so flummoxed as to how to go about changing that we doubt we\u2019re up to it or whether it\u2019s even possible. Quite how doubtful was revealed in <a href=\"http://www.danielgilbert.com/Quoidbach%20et%20al%202013.pdf\">recent research from Harvard</a>. The study identified what psychologists named the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jan/19/change-your-life-end-history\">\u201cend-of-history illusion\u201d</a>. Drawing data from more than 19,000 people aged between 18 and 68, it showed that the large majority, regardless of age, believed they\u2019d changed substantially in the past but anticipated little personal change in the future. This extraordinary blind spot, so the study argued, may be down to the fact that the cognitive processes involved in reconstructing an old story are simply less taxing on the mind than those required to build a new one. This implication \u2013 that we\u2019re better at changing than we are at imagining it \u2013 led the Harvard team to warn of the practical fallout: how overestimating the stability of today can hamper the decisions we make about tomorrow.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The hunger for change is nothing new, but nowadays we consider choice a prerogative</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Of course the flip side to all this \u2013 and the irony \u2013 is that everything and everyone changes all the time. Our rivers, as the Greek philosopher <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/56af2f4ee4b0c42dd192fbae/1908065\">Heraclitus</a> observed two and a half millennia ago, they flow. In my own research I\u2019ve met men and women who\u2019ve pursued or experienced great transformations: a genocide survivor who rebuilt his life through education, a morbidly obese recluse who lost 18st in 18 months, a radical Islamist who turned his back on holy war. We are who we are, as these people demonstrated, not in spite of change but because we change.</p> <p>The point is that we\u2019re better at changing than we think. Indeed, it\u2019s hardwired into our very biology. What neuroscience dubs plasticity \u2013 the changes that occur in our brains as our experiences unfold \u2013 is central to who we are, from the neural, through the individual, right up to societal level. The lingering childhood exclusive to the human animal is key to the development of our prefrontal cortex, one of the last parts of the brain to reach maturity and critical to our unique evolutionary advantage. Here our thoughts and actions, our plans and decisions, even our personalities, are mediated and adapted; here what we hope for meets what we do. And the inherent plasticity of this region and the wider neural networks to which it\u2019s connected is what underpins that virtuoso ability to change.</p> <p>So remember: change \u2013 as an unfolding process rather than a sovereign remedy \u2013 is who we are. Holding on to that may be the best chance we have of taking on our endemic doubts about change, our end-of-history illusions and the many other imaginative obstacles we put between ourselves and the lives we want to lead.</p> <p>Metamorphosis: How and Why We Change<em> by Polly Morland is published by Profile Books at \u00a314.99.

The doctor who treated Mary Ann Franco called it a \u2018miracle\u2019 and thinks the knock may have caused blood flow to return to a crucial part of the brain.</p> <p>Although this was probably not the case for Franco, it is possible to see without knowing you can see. Different neural pathways in the brain are responsible for our perception of what something is, and our sense of where something is.</p> <p>Sometimes if only one of these pathways is damaged, a rare phenomenon known as blindsight can occur. If you give\u00a0someone with blindsight a letter and ask them to post\u00a0it,\u00a0they won\u2019t be able to see the\u00a0postbox or describe it in any\u00a0way. But if they try anyway,\u00a0they can do it - even\u00a0if\u00a0the postbox slot is at an unusual\u00a0angle.</p> <p>This is because while the conscious sensation of seeing has been cut off, the pathway that controls interaction with what we see is still in use. Franco\u2019s case shows us how much we still don\u2019t know about the visual system, even in our own heads.</p> <p><em>Dr Daniel Glaser is director of Science Gallery at King\u2019s College London</em></p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-15T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>I didn\u2019t expect to get high with Jerry Garcia. Tina Brown, my editor at the <em>New Yorker</em>, craved celebrity profiles and I chose Garcia because he was the least noxious celeb I\u2019d ever met. He lived close by in California\u2019s Marin County, so I arranged a chat at the bungalow in San Rafael where the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/grateful-dead\">Grateful Dead</a> conducted business.</p> <p>The band\u2019s PR guy warned me not to mention drugs. Jerry had recently been busted for possession, so the issue was a sore point. But he arrived in a jolly mood and looked as ever like an unmade bed. Without any prompting, while the PR guy gnashed his teeth, he described his greatest acid trip, the one where he turned into a field of wheat.</p> <p>That was Garcia in a nutshell. He was bright, warm, witty and never met a rule he wanted to obey. He loved to talk, but also loved to listen. Our meeting, scheduled for an hour, lasted three and became a conversation, so he invited me to dinner at his condo in Tiburon the next night.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Jerry was in a jolly mood and started to describe his greatest acid trip, the one where he turned into a field of wheat</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Having folks to dinner was new for Garcia. He lived out of suitcases. But his girlfriend, Barbara, hoped to create a home life for him. The idea was to keep him healthy. That meant exercise and no more junk food, all firsts for Jerry who, at times, weighed almost 300lb.</p> <p>Domesticity wasn\u2019t his thing. All he cared about was music, but he tried for Barbara\u2019s sake. He ordered Chinese and opened some wine, then rolled a joint. I worried I\u2019d be smoking mind-blowing skunk or a spliff laced with LSD, but the grass was a mild sativa strain like the Acapulco Gold of hippie days.</p> <p>Within minutes, the food tasted absolutely terrific, and our stoned talk ranged freely. Garcia recounted how he\u2019d once bumped into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2010/sep/03/charles-mingus-black-saint\">Charlie Mingus</a> in a New York park and shared the martinis Mingus drank from a flask. He described how carefully crafted the Dead\u2019s lyrics were, a point most critics missed. He couldn\u2019t sing a song he didn\u2019t believe in.</p> <p>I met with him one last time a month later. He\u2019d broken up with Barbara and resumed an old affair with a former lover. As usual, he was optimistic about the future, but he\u2019d started using heroin again, landed in rehab and sadly never made it out.</p> <p><em>Rolling Stone</em> asked me to write an obituary, and I nearly keeled over when I saw the photo that ran with it: a shot of Garcia playing guitar in a field of wheat.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>Moraitis Estate Sillogi White, Paros, Greece 2015 (from \u00a311.69, </strong><a href=\"http://thegeneralwine.co.uk\"><strong>The General Wine Company</strong></a><strong>; </strong><a href=\"http://jeroboams.co.uk\"><strong>Jeroboams</strong></a><strong>) </strong>Founded in the early 2000s as a labour of love by self-described \u201cmiddle-aged mummy\u201d Mary Pateras, London-based Greek wine specialist Eclectic Wines has done more than most to raise the profile of the country\u2019s wonderfully quirky, individualistic wines in the UK. Pateras has always understood that what makes Greek wine special is its stock of indigenous grape varieties \u2013 such exotic-sounding delights as the dark-berried xinomavro (as mastered by the consistently brilliant Thymiopoulos winery), the perfumed white moschofilero (look out for Semeli\u2019s Feast White 2015), or my current favourites, assyrtiko and malagouzia, the complementary ying-yang white ingredients of the graceful citrus-and-herb-scented Sillogi from the Moraitis Estate on Paros in the Cyclades.</p> <p><strong>Gaia Wild Ferment Assyrtiko, Santorini, Greece 2015 (\u00a318.95, </strong><a href=\"http://slurp.co.uk\"><strong>Slurp</strong></a><strong>) </strong>If you were thinking in French terms, assyrtiko would be Greece\u2019s answer to chardonnay. While having a powerful personality of its own, it shares the Burgundian variety\u2019s chameleon ability, producing both the light, easy and lemon zesty and the more structured, textured and ageworthy. Eclectic Wines has the variety\u2019s acknowledged modern master on its books \u2013 Santorini\u2019s Haridimos Hatzidakis, whose various different cuvees range from the brisk Assyrtiko 2015 (\u00a314.90, <a href=\"http://theatreofwine.com\">Theatre of Wine</a>) to the fabulous mutli-layered Louros 2013 (\u00a350, <a href=\"http://theatreofwine.com\">Theatre of Wine</a>), but always have a kind of nervy energy and mineral quality. There\u2019s something of those characteristics, too, in a wine not in the Ecclectic range, Gaia\u2019s Wild Ferment, where the flinty, subtly smoky notes meet a salty preserved lemon zinginess in an incisive, savoury white that reminds me a little of top-flight Chablis.</p> <p><strong>Papagiannakos Kalogeri Malagouzia, Attica, Greece 2015 (\u00a312.39, </strong><a href=\"http://nywines.co.uk\"><strong>Noel Young Wines</strong></a><strong>) </strong>What assyrtiko is to chardonnay, malagouzia is to viognier: like the fleshy French variety, originally from the northern Rh\u00f4ne, the examples I\u2019ve tried always tend to offer stone fruit fleshiness and sweet blossomy floral aromas. The winery most closely associated with a variety that was thought to have been lost to the world until it was rediscovered in the 1980s, is Domaine Gerovassiliou in Epanomi on the Halkidiki peninsula: their 2015 example (\u00a316.95, <a href=\"http://nywines.co.uk\">Noel Young Wines</a>) matches its succulent peach and apricot with fresh grapefruity acidity (their equally succulent take on viognier, a rarity in Greece, is also worth looking out for; \u00a317.49, <a href=\"http://nywines.co.uk\">Noel Young Wines</a>). In recent years other wineries have got in the malagouzia act, with Papagiannakos offering a particularly juicy, floral, good value example from Attica, not far from Athens.</p> <p><em>Follow David on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daveydaibach\">@Daveydaibach</a></em></p>",

Despite the many miseries that plague our world, humanity as a whole has never climbed so high, so fast.

Or take incomes. For the first time in history, poverty is declining amid rapid population growth. When the Berlin Wall fell, two-fifths of humanity lived in extreme poverty. Now it\u2019s one-eighth.</p> <p>Or take education. In just over a generation, 3 billion more literate brains have joined the human race. And thanks largely to the rapid expansion of higher learning in China and India, the number of people alive now with an advanced degree exceeds the total number of degrees ever awarded prior to 1980.</p> <p>With a few tragic exceptions, a child born almost anywhere today can expect to grow up healthier, wealthier and smarter than at any other time in history. And more connected, thanks principally to a quartet of big events: the end of the cold war; waves of democratisation across Latin America, much of Asia and sub-Saharan Africa; China\u2019s emergence from autarky; and, of central significance, the advent of the internet.</p> <p>These conditions create an ideal habitat for ideas and genius to flourish, and that flourishing is well under way. The final reason why, if you could choose to be reborn at any moment in history, you should choose now, is that science and technology \u2013 jolted by humanity\u2019s sharp jump in cognitive resources \u2013 has never been closer to flipping our basic condition from scarcity to abundance.</p> <p>Existing computing technologies already flood us with abundant data; quantum computing holds the promise of abundant information processing. Autonomous machines supply abundant routine work; one day, artificial intelligence may supply abundant cognition. Genetic medicine may offer pathways to abundant health. Materials science, synthetic biology and nanotechnology may soon yield abundant clean energy.</p> <p>Our dense connectedness is helping to realise all these promises faster. In every field, from astronomy to zoology, discovery is now a 24/7 global effort. Meanwhile, outside the lab, millions more volunteers tackle thousands of giant-scale \u201ccitizen science\u201d projects that would not otherwise be feasible: helping to map the 86bn neurons in the human brain, cataloguing Africa\u2019s fauna from millions of hours of camera footage, or sifting through petabytes of data from the Large Hadron Collider.</p> <p>We live in a moment packed with new possibilities, and we\u2019ve never been better equipped to seize them. The problem is that many of us don\u2019t feel it. If this is the best time to be alive, it certainly hasn\u2019t been the easiest.</p> <p>The political map of the world has been redrawn. Market economics has circumnavigated the globe. Populations, capital and production systems have shifted, massively and rapidly. And we as individuals have become not simply connected but ensnared in a transnational tangle of choices and burdens, enablers and obstacles, interdependencies and conflicts. Other people\u2019s choices \u2013 about what energy they use, what products they consume, what medicines they take or how they secure their data \u2013 affect us, and vice versa. Our great gains have been accompanied by shocking upheaval and new vulnerabilities.</p> <p>This upheaval has created winners: among owners of capital; among entrepreneurs who have grown into new markets; and among individuals whose skills, acumen or luck helps them to navigate this tangle.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Savonarola seized control of Florence and launched a terrifying campaign of moral purification</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But it has also created losers: among pensioners and homeowners whose savings were destroyed by unforeseen financial risks; among workers whose jobs are now being done overseas by people escaping from poverty; among those whose jobs stayed onshore but are being replaced by machines; among farmers whose crops are failing because of climate change; among citizens in countries where a small elite are siphoning the benefits of global integration into offshore bank accounts.</p> <p>Humanity\u2019s gains in this age, while great, have been and will be greatly uneven. When these differences enter into our lives via painful, personal experience, macro proof of our aggregate flourishing is cold comfort. Far easier than holding out hope that society might eventually share more widely the benefits of global progress is to become bitter and disillusioned by its failure to do so.</p> <p>This disillusionment is spreading rapidly, and it is rotting away the social bargain upon which humanity\u2019s overall flourishing depends. In election after election, reasoned arguments about the benefits of living and acting together are being overwhelmed by angry cries of nationalism, protectionism and xenophobia.</p> <p>These should shock us all into remembering that our new openness and connectedness cannot be taken for granted. They are social phenomena. We made them. And some are trying their best to end them.</p> <p>It is the defining contest of our time. If we cannot stop this rot, we risk falling far short of the abundance that sudden global welfare gains and entanglement make possible. Worse, we risk stumbling backwards \u2013 falling victim to systemic health, climate, conflict and other dangers whose mitigation can only be collective. We could lose the health, wealth, education and human rights advances we have already made globally. In that event, poor people in poor countries will, as always, suffer most, especially now that the doors for migration are being slammed shut.</p> <p>To restore our social bargain, we need fresh wisdom, and wisdom is hard to find when the circumstances seem unprecedented. Except they\u2019re not. We have been through all this before, in a prior age of mass flourishing and mass upheaval.</p> <p>It\u2019s called the Renaissance.</p> <p>In popular imagination today, the Renaissance connotes a moment of blossoming art, genius and above all discovery. And indeed, from roughly 1450 to 1550, such a moment existed on the European continent. It shaped the early modern world. Genius flourished, as evidenced by the roll call of luminaries who left a permanent mark on civilisation: Copernicus, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and many others.</p> <p>But that was only half of their story. Renaissance Europe \u2013 like our world today \u2013 discovered that an age of flourishing is also an age of chaos. Terrifying new diseases spread like wildfire on both sides of the newly connected Atlantic. The Ottoman Turks \u2013 backed by a new technology: gunpowder \u2013 conquered the eastern Mediterranean for Islam in a stunning series of land and naval victories that cast a threatening gloom over all of Europe. Martin Luther leveraged the new power of print to ignite religious violence continent-wide. The church (Europe\u2019s ultimate establishment power) split permanently under the strain, and breakthrough ideas were suppressed during Rome\u2019s subsequent Inquisition.</p> <p>For many who lived in that time, the losses seemed more tangible than the gains. Anger and disillusionment with society\u2019s rulers spread widely, and charismatic outsiders channelled anxieties to seize power for themselves. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girolamo_Savonarola\" title=\"\">Girolamo Savonarola</a> (1452-1498), an obscure friar from Ferrara, made his way to Florence (the centre of the Renaissance) and within a single year had enthralled the population with sermons that laid blame for people\u2019s injuries and fears squarely on the broken promises of their leaders. He seized control of the city, swept away a 60-year Medici regime and launched a terrifying campaign of moral purification that ended with his historic Bonfire of the Vanities.</p> <p>Savonarola\u2019s bonfire was just one localised manifestation of a wider anger. Italy\u2019s authorities eventually purged him, but that did little to purge popular discontent. Likewise today: stopping Donald Trump from becoming US president, or stopping Britain from exiting the EU, or bombing Isis won\u2019t end the contest between those who want to raise new walls and those who still believe we\u2019re better off with them gone. Other flashpoints in this wider war will appear soon.</p> <p>But we can take hope from our own history. Amid unrelenting upheaval and popular anger, the Renaissance left a legacy that we still celebrate as one of humanity\u2019s brightest. It also left wisdom, in both its triumphs and disasters, to help us steer through similar storms. Looking through a Renaissance lens, what to do now becomes startlingly clear. We need to welcome genius. To understand that disruptive change and technological revolutions can spread both immense good and harm. To celebrate diversity and overcome prejudice. To raise public and private patronage. To embrace change, and strengthen public safety nets in ways that embolden us all. To build new crossroads and welcome migrants. To tear up the (mental) maps that unhelpfully divide people. To stoke virtues \u2013 especially honesty, audacity and dignity. To champion collective endeavours as well as individual freedoms.</p> <p>The Renaissance offers lessons on how to magnify the flourishing under way. It also offers warnings about what happens when we fail, in a time of great change, to renew our social bargain with one another.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"45b9d3076bfa738286a11d14ca6383604d16609e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/45b9d3076bfa738286a11d14ca6383604d16609e/225_100_1530_1911/801.jpg\" alt=\"Ian Goldin\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ian Goldin. who is director of the Oxford Martin School.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"2c10fc9c6afc4404853ca599b6f02dcf3f7a615a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c10fc9c6afc4404853ca599b6f02dcf3f7a615a/114_194_1690_2112/800.jpg\" alt=\"Chris Kutarna\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Kutarna is a fellow at the Oxford Martin School.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is our age of discovery.

      "headline": "They wanted to gag Nigel Farage. Now Tory Outers sound like him",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-15T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>We knew from the off that the Outers didn\u2019t like the European Union. The referendum campaign has exposed just how much they can\u2019t stand each other either.</p> <p>The In team yesterday laid <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/may/14/eu-referendum-cameron-corbyn-and-johnson-hit-campaign-trail-live\" title=\"\">on a big show of cross-party unity</a> to demonstrate the breadth of support for their cause. There were speeches and campaign appearances by the leaders of the Tory, Labour, Lib Dem and Green parties, along with a lot of activity on the street by their supporters. This couldn\u2019t have been better timed to strike a contrast with the furious rows consuming the Out gang. While Britain prepares to make a profound choice about its place in the world, the feuding factions among the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/12/vote-leave-lambasts-itv-over-eu-debate-between-cameron-and-farage\" title=\"\">Outers have been squabbling</a> about which of them should appear on a TV programme.</p> <p>Let us dwell on that spat for a moment because, while it seems terribly trivial in the wider scheme of things, it is symptomatic of the fundamental structural split that divides the Leavers. ITV has booked David Cameron and Nigel Farage to appear on the same live debate show in June. They won\u2019t actually go head to head: they will appear separately to field questions from a studio audience. The broadcaster is nevertheless pleased to have booked the prime minister. David Cameron is happy because he\u2019d rather be up against the Ukip leader than take part in a blue-on-blue event against another Tory such as, to pick a name at random, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/feb/21/cameron-marr-boris-johnson-eu-referendum-camerons-interview-on-the-marr-show-as-boris-johnson-prepares-to-declare-his-hand-politics-live\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson</a>. Nigel Farage is delighted because he has secured a role in the debate programmes with a profile that is commensurate with his ego.</p> <p>Are other Outers celebrating that the prime minister has agreed to appear on the same programme as one of their most famous advocates? No, the official Leave campaign is beside itself with rage. It launched an incandescent complaint, vein-bulging in its apoplexy, which accused ITV of \u201ca secret stitch-up\u201d with Number 10 and darkly warned the company that \u201cthere will be consequences for its future\u201d. Both sides know that for many swing voters this decision will come down to a choice between which advocate they find most credible. This is why many of the Tory Outers have always wanted to minimise the screen time given to the Ukip leader. One of the Brexiter cabinet ministers says: \u201cWe know that if the referendum is framed as a choice between what David Cameron prefers and what Nigel Farage prefers, it is a win for Remain.\u201d</p> <p>This notion that he should be marginalised makes Mr Farage furious \u2013 and understandably so. He started agitating for Brexit many years ago, long before the banner was picked up by opportunistic, Johnny-come-lately Tories such as, to pick a name at random, Boris Johnson. I\u2019ve said before, and I don\u2019t mind saying again, that this referendum would almost certainly not be happening were it not for the Ukip leader. He it was, more than anyone else, who panicked David Cameron into promising a plebiscite. This moment is Mr Farage\u2019s claim to history\u2019s attention.</p> <p>The Ukip leader believes that immigration is the strongest card in the hand of the Outers. Opinion polling suggests that he is right. Discontent with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/13/brexit-unlikely-fall-immigration-report\" title=\"\">levels of migration</a> is the greatest fuel of hostility to the EU. But the anti-Farage Outers feared that putting all their emphasis on migration risked repelling as many voters as it might attract. They also absorbed another message from the polling, which is that concerns about migration can be trumped by fear of what Brexit will do to the economy. The voters saying that the economy is the decisive question tend to outnumber those identifying immigration as the key issue by around two to one.</p> <p>A campaign with a Farageiste focus on immigration also looked awkward for some of the Tory Outers such as, to pick a name at random, Boris Johnson. As mayor of London, it was his boast that <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/immigration/10404421/Boris-I-am-the-only-British-politician-who-will-admit-to-being-pro-immigration.html\" title=\"\">he was \u201cpro-immigration\u201d.</a> He even once proposed an <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/10154389/Boris-Johnson-backs-call-for-one-off-amnesty-for-illegal-immigrants.html\" title=\"\">amnesty for illegal immigrants.</a> He and Michael Gove like to think of themselves as cosmopolitan liberals, not kipper nostalgics yearning to time travel back to the 1950s. So the campaign began with that faction of the Outers placing its emphasis on the economy and the alleged benefits to Britain once it had been liberated from the oppressive yoke of Brussels.</p> <p>The trouble for them is that they have always had a problem with engaging on this terrain of the economy. They have never been able to paint an agreed and plausible picture of how Britain would prosper once it had amputated itself from the EU. As the campaign has become more intense, that hole in their case has only grown larger.</p> <p>For a time, some Brexiters cited <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/oct/28/the-norway-option-what-is-it-and-what-does-it-mean-for-britain\" title=\"\">Norway</a> as an example of the benefits of being outside the EU. But there was a snag with Norway because it has to contribute to the EU budget and has to accept freedom of movement in order to enjoy the benefits of access to the single market. So the Outers quit Norway and travelled further afield in search of a model that they could recommend to the British people. This journey around the globe has taken them to destinations as diverse as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/11/boris-johnson-on-brexit-we-can-be-like-canada\" title=\"\">Canada</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/27/brexit-decade-economic-limbo-top-tory\" title=\"\">Peru</a> and Hong Kong. None of them have stood up to scrutiny as a model for a post-EU future for Britain. Some of the credit for the confusion and incoherence among the Outers must go to the In campaign. They have maintained a relentless pressure on their rivals on this question. It may have been boring at times, but it has been effective.</p> <p>As a result, the Outers have now wound up in Albania. In a recent speech, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/19/michael-gove-makes-case-eu-exit-bbc-today\" title=\"\">Mr Gove cited Albania\u2019s trading arrangements</a> as an example that a post-EU Britain could emulate. The justice secretary is the cleverest man on the Out side. They have no better brain and no more elegant debater. When the smartest guy on your team has to suggest a small and rather poor state in the Balkans as a model for Britain\u2019s future, you really are in trouble. Especially when the Albanian prime minister then says that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36204533\" title=\"\">he wouldn\u2019t recommend becoming Albania.</a></p> <p>The Outers have also floundered on the economy because another thing demonstrated by the campaign is the enormous imbalance of forces between the two sides of the argument.</p> <p>Hardly a day passes without a piece of heavy artillery firing off cautions that Brexit would cause extreme turbulence in the short-term and depress growth over the longer-term. Risk warnings about the threat to trade, investment and jobs have been issued by everyone from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/13/imf-warns-stock-market-crash-house-price-fall-eu-referendum-brexit\" title=\"\">International Monetary Fund</a> to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/mar/10/eu-referendum-brexit-no-vote-bad-uk-europe-world-oecd-catherine-mann\" title=\"\">the OECD</a>, from the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/may/20/eu-referendum-vote-cbi-uk-membership\" title=\"\">president of the CBI</a> to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/17/brexit-threatens-british-workers-rights-maternity-leave-holiday-frances-ogrady-tuc-trades-union-congress-eu\" title=\"\">general secretary of the TUC</a>, from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/mar/08/boris-johnson-abandons-city-hall-eu-referendum-gag-after-hypocrisy-claim-politics-live\" title=\"\">governor of the Bank of England </a>to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/22/barack-obama-brexit-uk-back-of-queue-for-trade-talks\" title=\"\">president of the United States </a>and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/05/japan-prime-minister-britain-eu-shinzo-abe\" title=\"\">prime minister of Japan</a>. They only differ over the degree to which it would be self-harming for Britain to self-eject from the EU. Pretty bad, say some. Very bad or exceedingly bad, say others.</p> <p>By contrast, the Leave camp has not a single international or domestic economic authority that it can cite in support of Brexit. In reply to all these heavyweight institutions and international voices, the Outers can put up, er, <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/eureferendum/12179973/EU-referendum-Former-Tory-chancellor-Lord-Lamont-backs-Brexit.html\" title=\"\">Norman Lamont</a>. Out do have a few economists making a case for Brexit, but for every one of them there are many more on the other side. The Out side has taken such a pummelling on the economy that, if this were a boxing match, the referee would be stepping in to stop the fight. When anyone dares to express an opinion about the hazards of Brexit, the Outers now routinely wail that it is somehow \u201cunfair\u201d or \u201cbullying\u201d or even a \u201cconspiracy\u201d. That suggests that some of them wish that there really was a referee who could intervene to spare them any more punches.</p> <p>So they have had to look for different ways to try to make their case. Some of the Outers have gone back to venturing their classical arguments about sovereignty, but these tend to be too abstract to have much impact on the sort of swing voter that they need to persuade. Then there\u2019s the debate about whether or not we are safer with the EU or outside it. The security argument is also running against them. In recent days, five former heads of Nato, retired intelligence chiefs, and foreign and defence chiefs from every White House administration of the past 40 years <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36243296\" title=\"\">have all added their voices in support</a> of the contention that Britain and the world are safer for our membership of the EU. In reply, the Out campaign has been able to muster, er, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/19/liam-fox-barack-obama-keep-out-eu-referendum-debate\" title=\"\">Liam Fox</a>.</p> <p>As a result, they have been defaulting back to talking about immigration. They are doubling down on Nigel Farage\u2019s favourite topic. Michael Gove recently put his name to an argument that public services would be overwhelmed by <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36126993\" title=\"\">an immigration \u201cfree for all\u201d </a>when (or if) Albania joins the European Union.</p> <p>The poor old Albanians must be thoroughly confused by the justice secretary. One week they are his favourite model for Britain\u2019s post-EU future; the next week the Albanians are a terrifying menace. The increasingly Farageiste tone of the Leave campaign prompted the intervention by Sir John Major, in which the former Conservative prime minister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/12/john-major-eu-leave-campaigners-risk-turning-into-ukip\" title=\"\">warned Tory Brexiters that they were \u201cmorphing into Ukip\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Which is the great and inglorious irony of the attempt by the Leave campaign to keep Nigel Farage off the TV screens. They don\u2019t want him to be seen and at the same time they are beginning to sound more and more like him.</p>",

That\u2019s not a climate policy.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve got a veneer of increasing the renewable energy target, nowhere near where it needs to be ... So the Labor party policy is a significant improvement on the Coalition\u2019s policy ... [but] the Labor party policy falls well short.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t for a moment think we can\u2019t get an improvement to refugee policy. There is a way through this. One of the things I commit to doing if there is the potential for power-sharing or a multiparty government is to improve what we\u2019re doing to people seeking refuge and asylum in this country.\u201d</p> <p>In July the opposition leader, Bill Shorten, won a major policy battle getting support from Labor national conference for a policy of towing back boats of asylum seekers and offshore detention.</p> <p>But, since the election was called on 8 May, Shorten has been forced to answer questions about numerous candidates who supported the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/feb/10/let-them-stay-australia-backlash-267-asylum-seekers-island-detention-camps\">Let Them Stay movement, which aimed to prevent 267 asylum seekers being returned to offshore detention</a>.</p> <p>Labor supports regional processing but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/apr/28/manus-island-detainees-are-australias-responsibility-png-says-live?page=with:block-57216c09e4b09a82af1485ab#block-57216c09e4b09a82af1485ab\">doesn\u2019t want it to degenerate into indefinite </a>detention. </p> <p>On Saturday, Shorten said: \u201cI don\u2019t understand why the government hasn\u2019t tried harder with nations in our region ... I promise that we will make sure that we process these people and get them into nations in our region but we will not reopen the seaways.\u201d</p> <p>It comes as Liberal candidate for Mackellar, Jason Falinski, <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/federal-election-2016/election-2016-liberal-candidate-argued-for-humane-approach-to-asylum-seekers-20160514-gov5eo.html\">repudiated a view he expressed in 2001</a> that asylum seekers who come by boat should be welcomed rather than shunned.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/15/durack-australias-largest-electorate-feels-like-its-being-ignored\">Durack: Australia's largest electorate feels like it's being ignored</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to the Fairfax report, Falinski said: \u201cThe Coalition committed to stopping the boats and that\u2019s exactly what has been done through a strong border protection policy, which I wholeheartedly support.\u201d</p> <p>Di Natale said Labor was wary of forming government with the Greens because it mistakenly believed the 2010 deal between Julia Gillard and the Greens had harmed Labor. In fact, it was \u201cthe chaos turmoil and internal division of the Rudd-Gillard governments\u201d that ended what he said was a \u201cvery effective period of government\u201d.</p> <p>He said he simply \u201cdid not buy\u201d Labor\u2019s talk it would not do a deal with the Greens, citing the former leader Bob Brown\u2019s assessment that \u201cthese parties exist to attain power \u2013 the idea that they would walk away is not real world politics\u201d.</p> <p>Di Natale said Labor would need to a deal with the Greens to form \u201cresponsible, stable government\u201d because otherwise it would worry about \u201cevery piece of legislation on floor of parliament where you don\u2019t know the outcome of that vote\u201d. </p> <p>He also rejected the prospect Labor would prefer a return to the polls, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/09/greens-may-push-voters-back-to-polls-in-event-of-a-hung-parliament-bandt-says\">a threat suggested by the Greens treasury spokesman, Adam Bandt</a>, to force Labor to the negotiating table.</p> <p>\u201cI think Australians want another election like they want a hole in the head,\u201d Di Natale said.</p> <p>He effectively ruled out forming government with the Coalition, noting it would take a \u201cDamascus road conversion\u201d by the Coalition on refugees and global warming.</p> <p>Responding to the comments on Sunday morning, Shorten again ruled out dealing with the Greens in the event of a hung parliament.</p> <p>\u201cThe issues and this nation are going to be determined only [by] the Labor government. What matters is not what the Greens think in the Senate, it is what Australian families and small businesses think,\u201d he said.</p>",
