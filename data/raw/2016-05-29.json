Is it in London\u2019s interests for the mayor of London to be at permanent war with the Conservative prime minister?</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re never going to be best friends, but what is important is that the mayor of London argues the case for London and for Londoners to remain in the European Union. This debate is far more important than David Cameron or me. It\u2019s about our city\u2019s future and country\u2019s future.\u201d</p> <p>Cameron and Khan will unveil a pledge card that will be be distributed around the country in the name of Britain Stronger in Europe, which lists five things that will be guaranteed in the event of Britain voting to remain in the EU.</p> <p>The five promises are: full access to the EU\u2019s single market; workers\u2019 rights protected; keeping the European arrest warrant; a special status for the UK in Europe; and economic stability.</p> <p>Cameron will say: \u201cThese guarantees \u2013 from safeguarding our economy to protecting our security \u2013 show the positive case for remaining inside the EU. Whenever Leave campaigners are asked what Britain will look like outside the EU, all they can say is: \u2018we just don\u2019t know\u2019. </p> <p>Cameron has already attended pro-EU campaign events with Harriet Harman, the former Labour deputy leader, and Tessa Jowell, the former Labour culture secretary, but a joint appearance with Khan \u2013 arguably the most powerful Labour politician in the UK \u2013 is an important coup. Labour supporters are much more inclined to vote to stay than Conservative supporters, and the remain campaign knows it has to mobilise the Labour vote if it wants to win on 23 June.<br /></p> <p>Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, and Alan Johnson, chair of Labour In for Britain, have ruled out sharing a platform with Cameron, mindful that Labour\u2019s decision to campaign alongside the Tories in the Scottish independence referendum was subsequently cited as one reason why its vote collapsed in the 2015 general election.</p> <p>But Khan, whose links with Corbyn were highlighted prominently in Tory election leaflets during the mayoral campaign, is anxious to differentiate himself from his party leader, and a joint appearance with Cameron will boost his standing as a pluralist willing to work with a range of people in London\u2019s interests.</p> <p>In his Peston interview, Khan was also surprisingly positive about George Osborne, the chancellor, whom he has met since the mayoral election.</p> <p>\u201c[Osborne] understands why it\u2019s in the country\u2019s interests for London to do well,\u201d Khan said. \u201cHe cares about devolving power away from Whitehall, and to give him credit he\u2019s given more power to SNP Scotland, more power to Labour Wales, more power to a Labour Greater Manchester, and I believe genuinely he\u2019ll give more power to London as well.\u201d</p> <p>In a separate development on Sunday, Vote Leave claimed that leaving the EU would enable a UK government to tackle the problem posed by wealthy foreign investors buying up London property and leaving it empty.</p> <p>Citing figures <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/26/revealed-9-rise-in-london-properties-owned-by-offshore-firms\">highlighted by the Guardian</a> showing that almost 100,000 properties in England and Wales are owned by offshore companies, a Vote Leave briefing said European court of justice rulings stop EU member states imposing residence requirements on property ownership on the grounds that this would amount to interference with the principle of free movement of capital.</p> <p>Michael Gove, the pro-Brexit justice secretary, said: \u201cAt the moment we are powerless to stop offshore companies buying property in the UK because of EU rules. This drives up the cost of housing, which is fast becoming unaffordable for all but the super-rich.</p> <p>\u201cIf we vote leave and take back control we would be able to introduce curbs that would help British families to get on the housing ladder.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>The rapid pace of growth in buy-to-let investments has been illustrated by new figures showing the number of landlords rising by 7% in 2013-14 to reach 1.75 million.</p> <p>Figures from estate agent ludlowthompson based on data from HM Revenue &amp; Customs showed 1.75 million people declared income from property during the year, up from 1.63 million in 2012-13, as they chased returns on their cash that outstripped other investments. </p> <p>Landlords banked a combined \u00a314.2bn in net income from their rental properties during the year, up from \u00a313.1bn the year before.</p> <p>The HMRC figures are the latest data on landlord numbers, which are likely to have increased significantly since. Buy-to-let lending has boomed as cheap mortgages and rising rents, combined with low savings rates, have made property attractive to investors. Ludlowthompson said that over the past year the price of property in London had risen by 13.9% \u2013 a period when the FTSE 100 fell by 8.8%.</p> <p><a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/apr/21/rush-to-beat-stamp-duty-changes-causes-surge-in-housing-market-activity\">Changes to stamp duty introduced on 1 April</a> increased the upfront cost of buying property, adding a 3% surcharge on second homes. From 2017, the ongoing cost will start to rise for landlords who pay the higher rate of tax as relief on mortgage repayments starts to be withdrawn.</p> <p>The firm said the surge in borrowing by landlords ahead of the stamp duty change suggested property remained popular: figures from mortgage lenders showed a 226.1% year-on-year rise in the number of purchase loans taken out by landlords in March. The chairman of ludlowthompson, Stephen Ludlow, said: \u201cInvestors continue to be drawn to the buy-to-let market as the returns routinely outperform those of other investments.</p> <p> \u201cBuy-to-let investments are a highly popular alternative to the volatility investors often risk when investing in the stock market.\u201d</p> <p>The National Landlords Association has suggested that investors will make some changes to mitigate the new rules. It said last week that the profits of six in 10 landlords would fall after the removal of some tax relief. In order to recover costs, one in five landlords could stop renting to higher-risk tenants, such as those on housing benefit.</p> <p>It said the removal of mortgage interest relief, combined with the government\u2019s benefits freeze and the fall in social housing, would \u201ccreate a perfect storm whereby some tenants will struggle to find any sort of housing at all\u201d.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The Queen has famously served it to Barack Obama and his Chinese counterpart, and it will now be the official drink of Downing Street receptions. </p> <p>As English sparkling wines gain increasing acclaim at home and abroad \u2013 picking up a number of international awards \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/dec/16/english-wine-industry-vineyards-sales-6m-bottles\">growing numbers of people are setting up as smaller scale producers</a> in the chalky soils of Hampshire, Sussex and Kent.</p> <p>Last year 37 new winemakers started in business in England, according to accountants UHY Hacker Young. Over the past five years 170 new producers have been licensed by HM Revenue &amp; Customs.</p> <p>Among the so called \u201cvineyard virgins\u201d are former insurance boss Douglas Jacobsohn and his wife, Susanna, who bought 40 hectares (100 acres) of land outside Tonbridge in Kent in 2014.</p> <p>They have just planted 5 hectares to make English sparkling wine called Blackdon, from the three classic champagne grape varieties \u2013 chardonnay, pinot noir and pinot meunier \u2013 and hope to fill the first bottles in 2018.<br /></p> <p>Jacobsohn, 62, who stepped down as chief executive of marine insurer Skuld, a Lloyd\u2019s of London syndicate, in February last year, said: \u201cWe are both Swedish and originally looked at agricultural premises when we moved here for my job at Lloyd\u2019s five years ago. After a while this opportunity came up.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps bearing in mind the old adage \u2013 \u201cHow do you make a small fortune from wine? Start with a larger one\u201d \u2013 the Jacobsohns are taking a cautious approach. \u201cWe want to figure out the quality of it before we decide to go further [and plant more],\u201d he said.</p> <p>In terms of quality they have much to live up to. Ridgeview from Sussex and Chapel Down from Kent were last week named official suppliers for Downing Street receptions. It was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/20/queens-banquet-xi-jinping-balmoral-venison-spy-who-loved-me\">Ridgeview\u2019s Grosvenor 2009 brut that was served as an aperitif for the state dinner for the Chinese president, Xi Jinping</a>, hosted by the Queen last October.</p> <p>The Jacobsohns plan to sell locally at first, from the farm shop and via the internet, but also want to export to their native Sweden. \u201cThe Swedish and Danes are very interested in wine,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the TV coverage, there have been some reports about English wines winning international awards. English sparkling wine goes very well with Swedish seafood.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3639993186993750a59b12eb186a948bda801a65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3639993186993750a59b12eb186a948bda801a65/0_26_399_239/399.jpg\" alt=\"Douglas and Susanna Jacobsohn.\" width=\"399\" height=\"239\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Douglas Jacobsohn and his wife, Susanna.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He described Blackdon as a medium-sized vineyard with the capacity to make 25,000 to 30,000 bottles a year. There are many others that are smaller \u2013 around 500 vineyards in total in England and Wales covering aabout 1,800 hectares and producing sparkling and still wines, according to <a href=\"http://www.englishwineproducers.co.uk/\">English Wine Producers</a>, the official website for the industry. Many of them are family businesses which, mirroring the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/13/craft-beer-revolution-hops-brewers-flavours\">craft beer revolution</a>, are tapping into the growing popularity of boutique and local produce.</p> <p>In large parts of southern England the climate and soil are similar to that of the Champagne region. A high number of sunshine hours and south-facing slopes with free-draining soils (to protect from frost) and protection from wind are key. </p> <p>Such geographical features attracted French champagne house Taittinger to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/champagne-taittinger-to-produce-english-sparkling-wine-in-kent\">buy a former Kent apple orchard</a> with 69 hectares of farmland near Chilham in December, where it will produce English sparkling wine.</p> <p>They may not carry the champagne label (only fizz produced in the Champagne region of France can carry the title), but English sparkling wines won 14 gold medals at the 2015 International Wine Challenge. English wines overall carried off 72 medals.</p> <p>One winner was former solicitor Simon Robinson, chairman of Hattingley Valley Wines in Hampshire, who started planting vines only in 2008 and had his first vintage in 2010. His sparkling Hattingley Valley Classic Cuv\u00e9e NV was awarded gold. </p> <p>He said: \u201cIn the mid- to late 90s it was recognised that the soil in the UK and the climate we have is particularly suitable to the production of sparkling wine. You could say why did it take so long to recognise? I don\u2019t have a real answer to that.\u201d</p> <p>UHY Hacker Young said the rise in new wine producers was driven by such high-quality \u201cEnglish wine\u201d \u2013 where the grapes are grown here \u2013 rather than what is considered to be the lower quality \u201cBritish wine\u201d, made from imported grapes.<br /></p> <p>James Simmonds, a partner at UHY Hacker Young, said: \u201cIn recent years the wine industry has gone from strength to strength, and customers are now opting for English wines over French or Italian products, which 20 years ago would have been seen as a joke.\u201d</p> <p>However, winemaking is a risky business that requires a big cash outlay upfront with no prospect of returns for several years as the vines mature. Charles Simpson, another English wine producer, said: \u201cWine businesses are known for being notoriously difficult to fund.\u201d</p> <p>Growers also face the fact that grape yields are low in England, typically 5-6 tonnes a hectare, compared with 10 tonnes in France. </p> <p>Simpson and his wife, Ruth, \u201cgave up the rat race\u201d in 2002 and bought a 46-hectare estate and ch\u00e2teau in Languedoc.</p> <p>He had been commercial development director at the pharmaceuticals giant GlaxoSmithKline; she worked for the National Lottery. They had no experience of winemaking, but are now producing 400,000 bottles of sparkling wine a year at Domaine de Sainte Rose, near B\u00e9ziers. Their wines are stocked by Waitrose, Majestic and Naked Wines, priced at between \u00a322 and \u00a345 a bottle.</p> <p>The Simpsons are also applying their newfound expertise to the 30 hectares they acquired in Barham, Kent, two years ago, a third of which has been planted with vines. This year they will have their first harvest in the county, in late September or early October, following their Languedoc harvest in late July. \u201cYou get the first harvest from the third leaf [vine-growing season],\u201d he said.</p> <p>English wine producers have been starting from scratch, whereas the big French houses are being handed down from generation to generation and have been investing in equipment and perfecting their winemaking methods for over 200 years. This means English wines tend to be more expensive than French rivals. However, producers believe British consumers are willing to pay more for an artisanal homegrown product.</p> <p>Jacobsohn said: \u201cThere is a trend to be patriotic if you are into wine drinking. It seems to me that people prepared to pay a little bit extra if the quality holds up.\u201d</p> <p>The UK environment secretary, Elizabeth Truss, recently held the first wine roundtable with industry representatives and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-wine-industry-pledges-10-fold-increase-in-exports\">announced ambitious targets</a>, such as a tenfold increase in exports from 250,000 bottles to 2.5m bottles by 2020. By value, this would mean an increase from \u00a33.2m to more than \u00a330m.<br /></p> <p>Only a small quantity, less than 5%, is exported at the moment, primarily to Scandinavia and English-speaking countries such as the US, Canada and Ireland, according to Stephen Skelton, a veteran winemaker. After studying winemaking in Germany in the mid-1970s, he returned to the UK to establish the vineyards at Tenterden in Kent, now the home of Chapel Down Wines, one of the UK\u2019s biggest producers.</p> <p>The government is trying to help would-be producers by releasing new data on soil types, water resources and infrastructure networks to identify the best areas for growing vines.</p> <p>Said Simpson: \u201cSite selection is the single most important thing. If you choose the wrong site, you will be pushing water up the hill for years. Some people have done that.\u201d</p> <p><br /></p> <p><br /></p>",

Those uncharacteristic nerves are still there, possibly because of that anticipation, the buildup, and the 50 million quid, possibly because this kind of scripted stunt isn\u2019t suited to him \u2013 he\u2019s a chatterbox, not an actor. Sometimes it sounds like he\u2019s reading it.</p> <p>The stunt itself \u2013 pitting the Viper against speedy German Sabine Schmitz \u2013 in a Top Gun-style dogfight, again could have come straight from old Top Gear. Everything about it; the location, the muscle cars, the guns, the enemy (a German), the script. Quite fun though, if only to hear Fr\u00e4ulein Schmitz (mis)quote the movie, saying: \u201cYou can be any time my wing man.\u201d</p> <p>Very little has changed, format-wise.

Speaking to a crowd that spilled down the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, he was received as a conquering hero. </p> <p>Trump repeatedly claimed \u2013 falsely \u2013 that hundreds of thousands were trying to attend the event, at one point claiming there were \u201c600,000 people trying to get in\u201d.</p> <p>There were no visible lines or back-ups at any point in or around the mall. Furthermore, according to the United States Census Bureau, the total population of the District of Colombia <a href=\"http://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/SEX255214/11001\">is just 672,228</a>.</p> <p>Trump gave his standard stump speech, but the crowd had been primed by a one-term congressman from New York, <a href=\"http://leboutillier.blogspot.com/\">John LeBoutillier</a>, who insisted in his own speech that hundreds of American prisoners of war were still being held in Vietnam. </p> <p>Repeated congressional investigations have found no evidence that any living prisoners of wars are still held in south-east Asia. </p> <p>LeBoutillier also echoed Trump\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/18/donald-trump-john-mccain-vietnam-iowa-republicans\">infamous criticism</a> of one prisoner of war who was held in Vietnam, in terrible conditions, and then came home: John McCain. </p> <p>Last summer, speaking at a conservative conference, Trump suggested that the Arizona senator, who was awarded a Silver Star and Distinguished Flying Cross, was not a war hero. </p> <p>\u201cThe comments that Donald Trump made about John McCain were totally justified,\u201d said LeBoutillier, who accused the 2008 Republican nominee of deliberately hiding the truth about POWs remaining in Vietnam.</p> <p>Trump did not addresses the issue of POWs being left behind, but he did touch on veteran\u2019s issues.</p> <p>Regarding the long-running crisis affecting the <a href=\"http://www.va.gov/\">Department of Veterans Affairs</a>, he said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to give the right for those people to see a private doctor or even a public doctor and get themselves taken care of and we\u2019re going to pay the bill.\u201d</p> <p>However, the Republican nominee dwelled mostly on crowd size, sharing his disappointment that he was speaking facing the Lincoln Memorial and not with it behind him. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"96d45d64ed14f21f932ecd6a66d1b62dcaf1dbb1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/96d45d64ed14f21f932ecd6a66d1b62dcaf1dbb1/0_28_4672_2803/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Veterans and supporters listen to Trump speak\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supporters listen to Trump speak, by the Washington Monument.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mladen Antonov/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/27/barack-obama-first-us-president-to-visit-hiroshima-japan\">Barack Obama says memory of Hiroshima 'must never fade'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI thought this would be like Dr Martin Luther King,\u201d he said, in a reference to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/24/march-on-washington-martin-luther-king-50-years\">1963 March on Washington</a>, a key event in the civil rights movement. </p> <p>The nominee also shared his skepticism about American alliances abroad. </p> <p>\u201cI love Japan,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll continue to protect Japan hopefully.

      "body": "<p>For Malcolm Turnbull the election is all about jobs and growth and a belief that a company tax cut and reducing government spending is the way to achieve both. But in light of the failures of such standard economic thinking after the GFC to provide economic growth, new research is finding that policies that fail to consider other aspects such as inequality are actually undermining long-term economic performance.</p> <p>By pretty much any measure economic growth in Australia and around the world since the GFC has been sluggish.</p> <p>This Wednesday the latest GDP figures will be released and the early predictions are for annual growth of around 2.4% to 2.6%.</p> <p>In the past such a level would have been considered weak as it is well down on the average long-term growth. But now it would almost be seen as par for the course:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"1\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/fWEVY/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>From 2005 to 2015 the average annual GDP growth has been just 2.7% \u2013 a full percentage point below the 1995-2005 average of 3.7% and even worse than the 2.8% from 1975-1985 which included a horror recession.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/27/election-2016-scott-morrison-chris-bowen-treasurers-debate\">Morrison and Bowen produce a lively treasurers' debate, but costings are no clearer</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And while looking at arbitrary 10-year periods may be somewhat misleading, even just using a rolling 10-year average, the current position is worse than any time since 1984:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"2\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/QRr3p/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>And just in case you want to try to blame either the ALP or the Liberal party, just be comforted by the fact that Australia is not alone in this predicament \u2013 actually we\u2019re doing better than most. The 10-year average for GDP growth across the OECD is at historic lows.</p> <p>Prior to the GFC, the pervading view was that neoliberal polices of lower regulation, more competition, budget surpluses, increased trade and lower taxes had delivered the economic sweet spot.</p> <p>And then the world with low regulation, budget surpluses, open markets and low taxes was blown to hell:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"4\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Zvdv6/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>And yet the same thinking continues. The Liberal party pledges to cut company tax (to encourage foreign investment), crackdown on welfare spending (to reduce the budget deficit) and encourage more open markets (mostly through the talisman of free-trade agreements).</p> <p>Australia is certainly a much more open economy than we were at the end of the 1970s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"5\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/zJ533/1/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>And certainly such openness has led to benefits \u2013 cheaper products that lift overall standard of living and improved the efficiency of local producers. But the neoliberal strain of economic thought is one that would have us believe the GFC didn\u2019t happen (ALP inherited a surplus, and then they blew it), that pursuing austerity or more open markets has no downside and that the benefits should just be taken as a given.</p> <p>We saw this in the pre-election economic and fiscal outlook where the secretaries of the Treasury and the Department of Finance suggested that the medium term outlooks showed \u201cthe crucial importance of increasing productivity\u201d and that to achieve such improvement there needed to be \u201crenewed vigour in encouraging and delivering structural reform across all parts of the economy.\u201d</p> <p>Ahh. Reform. Never mind the ingredients, just pile it on our plate.</p> <p>It\u2019s the same thinking that underpins the Treasury\u2019s justification for the company tax cut: it will eventually improve productivity via increased foreign investment and thus real wages will go up (despite it having virtually no impact on employment growth).</p> <p>Productivity is a wonderful thing \u2013 increasing it improves all economic outlooks. The problem is over the past decade productivity growth has been falling and no one is really sure why.</p> <p>The OECD has just released its latest compendium of productivity indicators and it shows that across the world productivity growth was slower in the decade from 2004-2014 than it was from 1996-2004:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"6\">  <iframe src=\"//datawrapper.dwcdn.net/SMUQU/2/\" frameborder=\"0\" allowtransparency=\"true\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" webkitallowfullscreen=\"webkitallowfullscreen\" mozallowfullscreen=\"mozallowfullscreen\" oallowfullscreen=\"oallowfullscreen\" msallowfullscreen=\"msallowfullscreen\" width=\"640\" height=\"400\"></iframe>\u00a0 </figure>  <p>But as the OECD notes, the slowdown in productivity growth has come during a time of \u201crapid technological change\u201d and increasing participation of firms and countries in the global market \u2013 things which should see improved growth.</p> <p>It is a \u201cparadox\u201d which the authors of the paper rather unsettlingly attribute to among other things, difficulties of measurement.</p> <p>It\u2019s a bit of a worry (OK, a great worry) that no one is really sure that they are able to accurately measure what is basically the foundation of most economic \u201creform\u201d.</p> <p>Perhaps it is little wonder then that in light of the hits to economies from the GFC and the subsequent continued adherence by governments to pre-GFC thinking that the neoliberal path is being more and more questioned \u2013 whether it be by supporters of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/15/in-the-midwest-sanders-and-clinton-peddle-very-different-visions-of-america\">Bernie Sanders in the USA</a>, or more surprisingly by economists at the neoliberal heartland of the International Monetary Fund.</p> <p>An article in the IMF\u2019s latest issue of is journal <a href=\"http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2015/06/\">Finance and Development</a> notes that \u201cinstead of delivering growth, some neoliberal policies have increased inequality\u201d and jeopardised \u201cdurable\u201d growth.</p> <p>The authors note that there actually scant proof that the standard policies of encouraging foreign investment and reducing deficits and debt levels has improved economic growth.</p> <p>They found that it\u2019s tough to actually establish \u201cthe benefits in terms of increased growth\u201d from these polices but that the costs from \u201cincreased inequality are prominent\u201d. Even worse for those who desire economic growth above all else, they found that the \u201cincreased inequality in turn hurts the level and sustainability of growth.\u201d </p> <p>The authors note that their study of economies found that \u201causterity policies not only generate substantial welfare costs due to supply-side channels, they also hurt demand \u2013 and thus worsen employment and unemployment\u201d.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/grogonomics/2016/may/23/pre-election-2016-fiscal-and-economic-outlook-weakness-labor-coalition\">And as I have noted </a>(repeatedly) lack of demand is a massive issue for our economy. Right now Malcolm Turnbull would have you believe that it is an absolute given that more foreign investment and lower taxation and government spending will deliver economic growth. The reality is such belief is based on a model that struggles to deliver proof that is actually works and which crucially ignores factors such as inequality that can actually undermine their goal of economic growth.</p> <p>Nearly a decade on from the GFC it perhaps it time to acknowledge the neoliberal model might have a few cracks in it.</p>",

      "headline": "Champions League final: Ronaldo \u2018had feeling\u2019 he would score winner",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-30T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>The whistle blew but it was not over yet. Exhausted players lay on the San Siro turf, socks pulled down their calves and cramp climbing up, Gareth Bale speaking for most in admitting he could hardly feel his legs. More than 120 minutes played, a handful left: the 2016 European Cup final was heading to penalties, all or nothing from 12 yards, one last effort required, mentally and physically.</p> <p>Bale gets a massage, Diego Simeone and Zinedine Zidane talk to their players. A coin is tossed, a decision made: Atl\u00e9tico choose to take the second penalty, which pleases the Real players who know statistics suggest that suits them. So they go first; they also chose an end, their end. Cristiano Ronaldo sits a little apart, on a plastic drinks trolley, thinking. He has \u201ca feeling\u201d. He pulls his manager aside and tells him: \u201cGive me the fifth.\u201d He knows what awaits. One of the staff helps him to his feet; it is time.</p> <p>\u201cI saw Zidane before the penalties and told him to put me as the last taker because I feel I am going to score the winning goal,\u201d Ronaldo says afterwards. \u201cAnd that is what happened.\u201d</p> <p>So much happened, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/28/real-madrid-atletico-madrid-champions-league-final-match-report\">an epic night</a> starting with an opening goal from Sergio Ramos, the defender who says he has a \u201cstriker\u2019s soul\u201d \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/24/real-madrid-atletico-madrid-champions-league\">hero in Lisbon</a> and hero here, too. The clock showed 92.48 when he headed the goal in 2014; two years on it says 15.27, but that does not mean San Siro will lack the drama of Est\u00e1dio da Luz.</p> <p>There was Bale tearing into Atl\u00e9tico; Gabi Fern\u00e1ndez and Carlos Casemiro everywhere, impeccable; Yannick Carrasco\u2019s equaliser and his celebration, sprinting to the touchline and planting a kiss on his girlfriend\u2019s lips; there was his dash in the last minute too, cut down by Ramos. There was Antoine Griezmann\u2019s penalty thumping back off the bar and, at the end of it all, Juanfran Torres\u2019s penalty coming back off the post.</p> <p>In Lisbon Juanfran, relentlessly positive, provider of the equaliser, a footballer reinvented under Simeone, had promised Atl\u00e9tico would be back. He had also scored the decisive penalty against PSV Eindhoven. Now there\u2019s a lost look.</p> <p>All of which leaves only Ronaldo. \u201cMy performance may not have been my best one but who played unbelievable tonight? No one,\u201d he says. He admits that he is \u201cvery tired\u201d and his influence during 120 minutes has been limited but he is the competition\u2019s top scorer for the fourth year in a row and he\u2019s had a \u201cvision\u201d; his moment awaits. There are many images from this final but the last one, perhaps the lasting one too, is Ronaldo.</p> <p>Fernando Torres is due to take Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s fifth but it never gets to him. Ronaldo is there. Moscow, where he missed in the shootout, is not on his mind. \u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cI was confident.\u201d Like Lucas V\u00e1zquez, Marcelo, Bale and Ramos, Ronaldo hits his penalty to Jan Oblak\u2019s left; and like them, he scores. Ronaldo whips his shirt off and team-mates pile on. Real are European champions for the 11th time, Atl\u00e9tico have been defeated for a third time; 1974, 2014, and 2016, each final more cruel than the last.</p> <p>So cruel that Simeone, in black and broken, says it is a failure, insisting: \u201cNo one remembers who came second.\u201d He is wrong, but he drops his first hints that maybe his journey has come to an end. The message is different to Lisbon, when he vowed to return to the final. \u201cIt is time to think and reflect,\u201d he says, sadly. The man who is never beaten appears beaten.</p> <p>As he talks, long since having left the pitch, Real are still out there celebrating. \u201cI am so proud,\u201d Ronaldo says. The last time Bale left San Siro, he was carrying the match ball having scored a hat-trick against Internazionale. He took the ball from the 2014 final too, spiriting it away under his shirt. He has not got the ball from the 2016 final, even though that had been his intention. \u201cI was too tired,\u201d he says. But he is wearing a medal round his neck from a game in which he was outstanding. It is his second Champions League success since coming to Spain.</p> <p>\u201cHow do you feel?\u201d Bale is asked. \u201cVery cramped up,\u201d he says with a smile. \u201cIt was a difficult night but an amazing night in the end.\u201d In the stands are Alba Violet, three, and Nava Valentina, two months. \u201cMy oldest daughter was there last time and my new daughter was here tonight: a night I will always remember,\u201d he says. \u201cI came to the biggest club in the world to win Champions Leagues but to win it is very difficult and to do it twice in three years is an amazing feat.\u201d</p> <p>By the end, his muscles are knotting but he takes a penalty anyway. \u201cHonestly, I thought I was going to be nervous but I wasn\u2019t nervous at all. When I got back to the halfway line afterwards, that was when I was, like, \u2018Oh my God\u2019. I was just hoping they would miss and then we would score but stepping up to take the penalty I felt nothing; it was very strange.\u201d</p> <p>\u00c1lvaro Arbeloa said afterwards: \u201cThere are players in the dressing room who are dead, who can barely walk.\u201d It has been hard, they have suffered, but they have survived. Ronaldo says: \u201cI am so proud. Every time is special. I remember the first [European Cup] <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/may/22/championsleague.chelsea\">win with Manchester United</a> and two years ago against Atl\u00e9tico. To be top scorer again makes me feel proud.\u201d</p> <p>Ramos, who goes to Juanfran at the end, says: \u201cThis is written in history.\u201d Luka Modric seeks out Gabi. Real give Atl\u00e9tico a guard of honour, but there is no consolation. Torres called this the game of his life; now he stands in silence, eyes lost in his tears, seemingly reluctant to leave the field as if doing so would make this all real somehow, or like paralysis has taken him. Juanfran is on his knees in front of the fans and Koke later apologises to them as if this team has anything for which to say sorry.</p> <p>They have changed Atl\u00e9tico, winning the league and the cup, challenging the big two, but Simeone says that ultimately he could not defeat history, at least not in Europe. \u201cNone of us could,\u201d Koke says. \u201cWe do not deserve for this to happen to us twice,\u201d says Savic. \u201cIt was hard enough once.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/29/why-it-is-time-football-introduced-the-pepe-rule\">Time to introduce the Pepe Rule after his Champions League final antics | Sean Ingle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When Juanfran leaves the stadium, he does so without a word, a broken look on his face and that of his young son walking alongside him, hands over his ears.</p> <p>\u201cThe team is destroyed, but I am convinced we will be back,\u201d Gabi says. Savic insists: \u201cWe will fight until we win the Champions League and change history: this group of players has shown that it can lift itself.\u201d</p> <p>It will be harder this time, and it is Real Madrid who have made history in Milan. Their bus pulls out just before 3am, the trophy at the front, heading for the airport. \u201cWe\u2019re off to Cibeles to celebrate; it\u2019s a special night,\u201d Ronaldo says.</p> <p>It is light by the time the Real players get there, morning now, but the fans are waiting for them.</p>",

      "body": "<p>When Pete Sampras was quietly accumulating seven Wimbledon titles in eight years there were those who yearned for more variety. It is an occupational hazard when champions settle into an extended trophy-winning groove but the smooth operators of English rugby are not bothered by such irrelevancies. Having become the first club to complete a Premiership and European double since 2004, Saracens have no intention of easing off now.</p> <p>To listen to Owen Farrell, in particular, was to suspect that Saracens\u2019 hunger for silverware is far from sated and that the roster of all-time dominant sides is on the way to being extended.</p> <p>\u201cHopefully we\u2019ll never hit the crest,\u201d said Farrell, who already boasts three Premiership winners\u2019 medals at the age of 24. \u201cHopefully this is just the start and we carry on like this for a long time.\u201d</p> <p>As with Bath, Leicester and Wasps in their respective heydays, winning has become a habit no one wants to shake.</p> <p>With Farrell, the remarkable Maro Itoje, the brothers Vunipola, George Kruis, Will Fraser and Jamie George poised to ensure the backbone of the side stays strong for the forseeable future, it is certainly hard to see Sarries failing to challenge strongly for a third straight domestic crown next season. With the Springbok back-rower Schalk Burger and the talented Wasps fly\u2011half Alex Lozowski among those set to arrive this summer, the loss of estimable individuals such as the retiring Jacques Burger and Charlie Hodgson should not be overly disruptive either.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/28/saracens-mark-mccall-alex-goode-england-exeter-rob-baxter\">Saracens\u2019 Mark McCall says Alex Goode must start in England first Test</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Any squad capable of maintaining such high standards for 33 successive weekends, losing only four matches in all competitions, clearly possesses a steely core and, amid the latest spray of celebratory post-match champagne, it was hard not to recall England\u2019s failed World Cup campaign and marvel at the resilience of players such as Farrell, Brad Barritt and Alex Goode, all of whom have had to weather difficult moments this season.</p> <p>For Barritt to have led his beloved club side to the European Cup and now the Premiership in the space of a fortnight will go a long way towards easing the pain of last autumn while Goode, whose late try sealed this latest triumph, could not have done much more over the past six months to remind Eddie Jones of his abilities. \u201cFor me he\u2019s by a mile the best full-back in England,\u201d said Mark McCall, fully aware that Jones is not going to select his Test side to face Australia in Brisbane on Saturday week based on other people\u2019s recommendations. \u201cIf I say he should play, he probably won\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>If this season has revealed anything, though, it is that success is easier to sustain when players are desperate to win for each other as much as themselves.</p> <p>Farrell summed it up nicely when he reflected on another demanding year of juggling club and country commitment: \u201cWe don\u2019t care what people think about us because people can think what they want. It\u2019s about us. It\u2019s about what we believe in and what we do together. That\u2019s why we are where we are.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/may/28/saracens-experience-exeter-billy-vunipola-premiership-final\">Saracens make their experience count to expose young Chiefs of Exeter | Michael Aylwin</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It did not feel like a coincidence, either, that Exeter suffered a very similar fate to Bath in the Premiership final 12 months ago. This was yet another of Saracens\u2019s vampire weekends, sucking the life out of previously vibrant opponents, although the Chiefs\u2019 questionable strategy of trying to outdo Saracens at their own pin-point kicking game in the first half also played its part.</p> <p>For Exeter, 23-6 down at half-time, it amounted to yet another Twickenham disappointment to be added to four previous second-tier final losses and a Big Game defeat to Harlequins on this same pitch. Had Mitch Lees and Henry Slade not missed key tackles or Farrell\u2019s pass to Chris Wyles for Sarries\u2019 second try been ruled forward it might have helped but they were equally undone by their first-half inaccuracy in all areas. The unfortunate Henry Slade had one of those days when little went right, just when he wanted to show Jones what a midfield talent he is.</p> <p>On the plus side his fellow tourist Jack Nowell had an excellent match and the Chiefs fought back furiously to within three points of the champions with five minutes left, having previously been only a missed conversion away from reaching a European semi-final. They will come back stronger and increasingly have a base of enthusiastic fans far beyond the Exe Valley. When Northampton supporters arrive in head-dresses and kids from Bristol can be seen doing the \u201cTomahawk Chop\u201d, the Chiefs must be doing something right.</p> <p><strong>Saracens</strong> Goode; Ashton, Taylor (Bosch, 73), Barritt (capt), Wyles; Farrell (Hodgson, 68), Wigglesworth (De Kock, 68); M\u00a0Vunipola (Barrington, 66), Brits (George, 52), Du Plessis (Figallo, 52), Itoje, Kruis, Rhodes (Wray, 52), Fraser (Hamilton, 71), B Vunipola.</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Taylor, Wyles, Goode. <strong>Cons</strong> Farrell 2. <strong>Pens</strong> Farrell 3.</p> <p><strong>Exeter</strong> Dollman; Nowell, Slade, Whitten (Campagnaro, 68), Woodburn (Short, 55); Steenson (capt), Chudley (Lewis, 65); Moon (Hepburn, 47), Cowan-Dickie (Yeandle, 47), Williams (Francis, 47), Lees, Parling (Welch, 64), Ewers, Salvi (Horstmann,\u00a0 61), Armand (Salvi, 65).</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Yeandle, Nowell. <strong>Cons</strong> Steenson 2. <strong>Pens</strong> Steenson 2.</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> W Barnes (RFU). <strong>Att</strong> 76,109.</p>",

At the heart of the second battle of Indi is a tussle over the strengths and flaws of electing a committed local politician to fight for her voters in Canberra without the backing of a national party. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/28/election-2016-cathy-mcgowan-sophie-mirabella-will-indi-hold-on-to-the-power-of-one\">She writes</a>:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Elections in rural seats may be consumed with small-town politics, local problems and personalities, but this north-eastern Victorian electorate has earned its place in a national conversation. Indi was the sensational story of election night 2013, when McGowan, a 59-year-old farmer and rural consultant from the Indigo valley, harvested enough preferences from other candidates to win by just 439 votes and end Mirabella\u2019s 12 years as MP. The Coalition won the national election emphatically; only in Indi did a Liberal incumbent lose.<br /></p> <p>Almost three years on, McGowan, now 62, is no longer a fresh face. She has a record to defend and has inevitably let some people down. Her tribe of supporters say she shook up this electorate and embodies a reimagining of how politics can work.

      "headline": "England bowlers bat Yorkshire out of trouble against Lancashire",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-30T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>On a brilliantly topsy-turvy day it was fitting that two men whose bowling skills have earned them a fair number of Test appearances for England turned this Roses match on its head with a bat in their hands instead of a ball.</p> <p>Both Adil Rashid and Tim Bresnan will press their claims as genuine all-rounders and it was hard to disagree after the pair dragged Yorkshire back into a game they had lost all right to contest after a nightmare morning in which Lancashire reduced the hosts to 94 for five at lunch.</p> <p>If Rashid\u2019s and Bresnan\u2019s sixth-wicket partnership of 136 defined the middle part of the day, the early stages were dominated by the wicketkeepers.</p> <p>First came the news that the Lancashire captain, Steven Croft, would be donning the gloves following both an injury to the regular keeper Alex Davies and the visitors\u2019 decision to rest Jos Buttler after his Indian Premier League exploits. Then came the sight of Yorkshire\u2019s gloveman, Andrew Hodd, receiving his county cap from John Hampshire.</p> <p>Moments later it was Croft back in the spotlight as he opted to field and then claimed a catch off the fourth ball of the innings as Adam Lyth edged Tom Bailey after driving his previous ball for four. Bailey and Kyle Jarvis were soon proving unplayable with the latter producing a stunning spell in which Alex Lees was taken at third slip by Karl Brown without scoring before both Gary Ballance and Jack Leaning were snared by Tom Smith to leave Yorkshire 29 for four in front of a stunned Headingley.</p> <p>The Yorkshire captain, Andrew Gale, briefly threatened to lead a comeback with a quick-fire 36 off 41 balls with five boundaries before he was trapped lbw by Neil Wagner, whose aggressive bowling is proving a decent addition to the Lancashire attack this season.</p> <p>Gale\u2019s dismissal brought Bresnan and Rashid together and it was here that Yorkshire\u2019s day finally got going. Initially the pair rode their luck with a couple of edges flying over the slip cordon but gradually their willingness to counter-attack paid dividends with Bresnan, playing his first Championship game of the season following a calf injury, happy to play the supporting role to an increasingly fluent Rashid.</p> <p>As the afternoon progressed the sunny weather seemed to match the home crowd\u2019s disposition as Rashid brought up his half-century from 86 deliveries. Bresnan\u2019s 26th first-class half-century followed and with the partnership having reached 127 by tea, Lancashire\u2019s early promise was drifting away more quickly than the clouds.</p> <p>With talk turning to the possibility of Rashid\u2019s third Roses century, fate was well and truly tempted and it was not long after the break that he mistimed a drive off Simon Kerrigan to Luke Procter at cover for 88. Seven balls later Liam Plunkett became Jarvis\u2019 fourth victim when he scooped to the same fielder as the Zimbabwean bowler moved into pole position among the Championship\u2019s leading wicket takers with 28.</p> <p>When Bresnan departed for 69 following an inside edge off Wagner, the tumbling Croft\u2019s decision to wear the gloves and field looked a good one and continued that way until Hodd and Steven Patterson began to construct a ninth-wicket partnership which had reached 75 by the time the keeper clipped Wagner to leg-slip for a well-made 40 in the last over of the day. On a day when both multi-tasking and role playing became the bywords a wagging tail should have come as no surprise.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Steve Bruce said he would turn his mobile phone off for a week or two in an attempt to unwind at the conclusion of an arduous campaign and ready himself for next season. Yet the Hull City manager does not appear entirely sure that he will still be in charge to guide the club in the Premier League.</p> <p>Such is the uncertainty surrounding Hull, with persistent rumours about a takeover and the owner\u2019s deteriorating health, that a strange atmosphere lingered amid the celebrations.</p> <p>This should have been a weekend to toast their top-flight return. Instead Bruce ended up raising questions about the future and a couple of his players admitted to anxieties over new contracts, too.</p> <p>The Hull manager dedicated their triumph to the club\u2019s polarising owner, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/26/steve-bruce-hull-city-fans-protest-assem-allam\">Assem Allam,</a> who is \u201cfighting on\u201d with an unspecified illness.</p> <p>Allam was not at Wembley and wants to sell the club. A selection of Thai, Chinese and US investors are said to be interested now the club are back in the top flight, but a sale is some way off.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/28/hull-city-sheffield-wednesday-championship-play-off-final-match-report\">Mo Diam\u00e9</a>\u2019s wonderful goal near the end of a tight, nervous but enjoyable game sent Hull back to the Premier League for the third time since 2008 and gave Bruce an unprecedented fourth promotion from the second tier, while shattering Sheffield Wednesday\u2019s dream.</p> <p>However, it was easy to come away from Wembley, as far as the victors were concerned at least, with more queries than answers. \u201cHopefully over the next six weeks, I can look after myself and not just a team,\u201d Bruce said when asked about taking time to unwind after his most pressurised season yet. \u201cThere are all these rumours and of course it was a crossroads. If we hadn\u2019t won, I believe it would have been very difficult at the club.\u201d</p> <p>Promotion, however, does not equate to those issues instantly evaporating. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m staying myself yet,\u201d Bruce said. \u201cI\u2019ll have a conversation, like I said I would, at the end of the season.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/28/hull-city-sheffield-wednesday-championship-play-off-final-match-report\">Mohamed Diam\u00e9 guides Hull to Premier League past Sheffield Wednesday</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019ve got to make sure that we are equipped. We\u2019ll see. I still haven\u2019t 100% decided but I will think about it and chat with my family. I am wary. It\u2019s been long and difficult for many reasons.</p> <p>\u201cI will sit down with the powers that be and see where the club wants to go. If there are takeovers I need to know \u2013 because that means a new broom. I\u2019m not taking it for granted, there have been 60 managers sacked this season.\u201d</p> <p>It would still be a surprise to see Bruce elsewhere, mind, and the manager also spoke of his happiness to bolster the ranks of homemade managers in the top flight.</p> <p>Despite his unique achievement of winning promotion to the top flight four times, Bruce is often ignored in discussions about the best English managers, which leads to an inevitable question.</p> <p>Is he underappreciated? \u201cI\u2019m going to let other people judge that,\u201d he said. \u201cEverywhere I\u2019ve been, I\u2019d like to think I left them in a better position than when I took over.</p> <p>\u201cWe always dream of a big job but you\u2019re just classed as \u2018he\u2019s OK, he can get a team out of the Championship and have them scrap away in the Premier League\u2019. For all the British ones doing their coaching badges or whatever, I\u2019m pleased one of us is back in the Premier League. We all have a go but it\u2019s a shame the big jobs go to the foreign managers.\u201d</p> <p>So, there is a glass ceiling for British managers? \u201cOf course there is. Look at Sean Dyche at Burnley.\u201d</p> <p>If he does remain the first aim will be survival and then to follow the path of \u201cteams like Swansea and West Brom\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to try and emulate them and make it grow. It will always be difficult for us to attract players. We\u2019re never going to be the biggest payers and it is difficult to get people to come to us even if we have the money. There is a long road ahead but let\u2019s not talk about the negatives now. Let me enjoy and then do all the worrying.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t asked about money and what\u2019s available. I really don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>Questions linger over the players\u2019 futures, too. \u201cLots,\u201d Bruce said when asked about how much would need to be invested, but a couple of his key players this season remain in the dark about their own contract situations.</p> <p>Tom Huddlestone went on holiday on Sunday for 10 days with his partner and hopes to resolve his future quickly upon returning, admitting it was frustrating to see some of his team-mates agree extensions while he was left in the dark. Eldin Jakupovic, entrusted to keep goal with Allan McGregor injured, also spoke of his desire to agree new terms in the next couple of weeks.</p> <p>With Middlesbrough and Burnley, the other two promoted sides, some way down the line in their preparations for the Premier League, Hull already have catching up to do.</p> <p>In contrast, Sheffield Wednesday appear to have stronger foundations in place for the immediate future. This was a long-awaited taste of the grand stage and while they did not perform to their capable level, needing the goalkeeper Keiren Westwood to keep them in the tie, a sense remained at full-time that something special is within the grasp of Carlos Carvalhal and his team.</p> <p>One line of thought is that losing at Wembley may be a blessing. A couple of kinks need to be ironed out from a squad that was pieced together in precious little time when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/30/sheffield-wednesday-carlos-carvalhal-head-coach\">Carvalhal was appointed</a> in surprising circumstances. Another summer of fine-tuning before what should be an attack on automatic promotion materialises next season is desirable.</p> <p>Westwood and some of his team-mates were inconsolable at full time but the future is bright at Hillsborough and when the pain of failing to jump the final fence subsides there will be cause to be proud and, maybe most important of all for the blue side of Sheffield, optimism at what is to follow. Perversely, an unmistakable degree of pessimism looks set to pervade on Humberside.</p>",

On Sunday he said there was no contradiction between the two assertions.</p> <p>\u201cThe 2% of what Snowden revealed that had to do with privacy accelerated a necessary conversation. The other 98% was about how the US and foreign governments collected legitimate material \u2026 that was incredibly damaging.\u201d<br /></p> <p>The privacy revelations quickened a conversation which had \u201chit the beach\u201d in the US but it \u201chas not hit the beach here in Great Britain\u201d.</p> <p>Hayden was asked about how much information we give to social media companies and whether the public is naive in trusting Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook more than the NSA.</p> <p>\u201cI have my views on that,\u201d he joked. \u201cYour habits are all geared to protecting privacy against the government because that was always the traditional threat. That is no longer the pattern, it is the private sector \u2026 we are going through a cultural adjustment.</p> <p>\u201cWith regard to the 21st-century definition of reasonable privacy, Mark Zuckerberg is probably going to have a greater influence on that than your or my government because of the rules we will embed inside his Facebook applications.\u201d</p> <p>On \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d or torture \u2013 which could include waterboarding \u2013 Hayden said he personally authorised it only once and it did not, he admitted, work. <br /></p> <p>But he added the \u201csuite\u201d of usable techniques had been reduced from 13 to six and the interrogator believed he would have got information if that had not been the case. \u201cWas it doomed to failure or was it a failure because we did not do enough?\u201d</p> <p>Targeted killings were justified, Hayden said, because the US believed it was at war. The UK, he said, referring to the killing of \u201cJihadi John\u201d, has now \u201cjoined the queue\u201d.</p> <p>Hayden said he believed Islam was going through the crisis that Christianity went through in the 17th century as it was in an internal crisis. \u201cWe are not the target, we are collateral damage. What has happened in Paris, in Brussels \u2026 is spillage.\u201d</p> <p>Hayden also touched on Donald Trump, whose pronouncements, he said, had damaged US security. </p> <p>\u201cThe jihadist narrative is that there is undying enmity between Islam and the modern world so when Trump says they all hate us, he\u2019s using their narrative \u2026 he\u2019s feeding their recruitment video.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>One of the justifications for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/fracking\">fracking</a> is the use of natural gas as a bridging fuel between coal and a low-carbon future. However natural gas is mostly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/04/leaking-methane-gas-plume-us\">methane</a>, which has strong global warming impacts in its own right. Natural gas therefore only provides climate benefits over coal if the leakage is no more than 2-3%.</p> <p>We cannot measure leaks from every pipe joint. One alternative is to measure the sum of lots of leaks from a distance. Flights over US shale gas fields reveal large methane sources, but these areas also have cattle farms that produce methane and the two sources need to be separated. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/08/pollutionwatch-europes-problem-diesel-cars\">Europe's problem with diesel cars</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/reality-check/2014/jan/24/reality-check-shale-gas-greener\">Shale gas</a> also contains ethane, which does not come from farming. Looking at ethane and methane together, shale gas and oil extraction were found to be easily the dominant source giving <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2014JD022697/full\">leak rates</a> of 0.18-2.8% even before the gas was distributed to users. Some active drilling areas were notable super-emitters.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/15/411/2015/acp-15-411-2015.html\">Ethane from shale gas and oil extraction is bringing its own problems</a>. Ozone, synonymous with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/nov/15/filmnews.usa\">Los Angeles smog</a>, is a normally a summer pollutant, but in Utah, high levels have been measured in winter for the first time. Here leaked ethane built up in cold, still air and interacted with low-angle sunlight.</p> <p>Ethane can remain in the air for around two months, making it a global pollutant. <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022407315001090\">Ethane measured from the top of the Swiss Alps</a> has been rising since the start of large scale US shale gas extraction in 2009, indicating an increase in the global methane leakage from natural gas.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p> <p></p>",

This places it high in the midnight sky for observers in the southern hemisphere, but inconveniently low down in the S as viewed from Britain.</p> <p>This is a pity, for Saturn\u2019s stunning rings are wide open with their N face tipped 26\u00b0 to our view and spanning 42 arcsec around the planet\u2019s 18 arcsec disc.</p> <p>Saturn shines at mag 0.0 from a distance of 1,349m km at opposition and is creeping westwards in southern Ophiuchus 7\u00b0 NE (above-left) of Scorpius\u2019 leading star, the red supergiant Antares, a magnitude fainter.</p> <p>Mars lies to their west and easily outshines them both, though it dims from mag -2.0 to -1.5 as it tracks westwards in Libra and slows to a standstill on the 30th. The Red Planet is at its closest in 11 years on 30 May (75m km) and shrinks in apparent diameter from 18.6 to 16.3 arcsec as it recedes to 86m km.</p> <p>The star Capella in Auriga twinkles low in the N at our map times as the Plough sinks in the NW and the Summer Triangle climbs to prominence in the SE.</p> <p>Jupiter is still conspicuous in the SW at nightfall, though its altitude one hour after sunset halves from about 30\u00b0 to 15\u00b0 and it sets around one hour after our map times. Dimming slightly from mag -2.0 to -1.9 as it edges eastwards in S Leo, it is close to the Moon on the 11th before the latter goes on to stand above Spica in Virgo on the 14th, above-left of Mars on the 17th and close to Saturn on the 18th.</p> <p>After its solar transit, Mercury is now too low in the morning twilight to be seen from our latitudes during June while Venus passes directly behind the middle of the Sun on the 6th and also remains out of sight.</p> <p>As the Sun reaches its most northerly point at the solstice on the 20th, it traces only a shallow arc below our N horizon overnight so that twilight swamps the fainter stars and is particularly severe over Scotland. Where Scotland wins is on opportunities to spot noctilucent clouds, those cirrus-like ice-clouds that form at altitudes near 82km, high enough to shimmer electric-blue in the sunlight after run-of-the-mill lower-level clouds are in darkness. Look for them one or two hours after sunset in the NW and a similar time before sunrise in the NE. </p> <h2>June diary</h2> <p><strong>3rd 08h</strong> Saturn at opposition</p> <p><strong>5th 04h</strong> New moon; 10h Mercury furthest W of Sun (24\u00b0)</p> <p><strong>6th 23h</strong> Venus in superior conjunction</p> <p><strong>8th 23h</strong> Moon 5\u00b0 S of Praesepe</p> <p><strong>11th 21h</strong> Moon 1.5\u00b0 S of Jupiter</p> <p><strong>12th 09h</strong> First quarter</p> <p><strong>17th 11h</strong> Moon 7\u00b0 N of Mars</p> <p><strong>19th 01h</strong> Moon 3\u00b0 N of Saturn</p> <p><strong>20th 12h</strong> Full moon; 23:34 Summer solstice</p> <p><strong>27th 19h</strong> Last quarter</p> <p><strong>30th 09h</strong> Mars stationary</p> <p><strong>* Times are BST</strong></p>",

      "body": "<p>Late last season an exasperated Paul Roos spoke of a \u201cveil of negativity\u201d engulfing the Melbourne Football Club after every defeat, setting up his inbox for disaster by revealing he read emails from distraught fans. If he\u2019s still keen on the thoughts of people who send suggestions to senior coaches, Roos should set aside a few hours to get through the latest batch.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/28/hawks-hold-off-brave-lions-in-lewis-250th-power-punish-timid-demons\">Hawks hold off brave Lions in Lewis' 250th, Power punish timid Demons</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Melbourne\u2019s limp defeat against Port Adelaide in Alice Springs on Saturday shouldn\u2019t detract from what has been by their standards a fantastic start to the season. A Round 10 mark of five wins and five defeats puts them equal to or better than six entire seasons since they last played finals in 2006. </p> <p>The declaration by any footy analyst that the Dees are on the rise is usually your signal to dump stock at any price, and seasoned Demon watchers treated Cameron Mooney\u2019s suggestion they were \u201cbuilding a premiership list\u201d like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss2hULhXf04\">the voice of an adult in Peanuts</a>. Melbourne had just thumped Brisbane, but those with long memories recalled a similar declaration from Michael Voss about them becoming the competition\u2019s \u201cnext powerhouse\u201d shortly before the club embarked on the most terrifying ghost train ride of any AFL club this century.</p> <p>If it\u2019s been a season for clambering out from the fallen wreckage of failed rebuilds, wiping away tears and learning to live in society again much of the enjoyment has come from a new high-scoring gameplan which is delivering almost 34 more points per game than last year. Conversely much of the angst is derived from the defensive sacrifices made to boost their attack and the side concedes almost a goal a game more than 2015. Major concerns remain about their brittle key defender stocks and how easily opponents score in transition, but the last time any aspect of their game was declared \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/championdata/status/734340607385165824\">premiership standard</a>\u201d Champion Data probably hadn\u2019t invented the measurement.</p> <p>The attacking improvement comes from a swashbuckling style of play which works well when they dominate clearances and convert chances into goals, but breaks down after turnovers and when defending kick-ins. Even before this week they led the league in conceding goals from within 30 metres, and as Port continually banged them through from the goal square Melbourne\u2019s receptionist must have been thinking about calling in sick rather than taking an endless stream of calls from aggrieved fans yelling, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t they just do something different?\u201d Why indeed, Port\u2019s flinging of the ball from defence into attack as if shot from a catapult went unchallenged all day.</p> <p>Defeat removed any realistic chance of a surprise assault on the finals, but now that the days of hearing Nearer My God To Thee playing softly in the background during home games are over, fans who have suffered so much failure should be heartened by what they\u2019ve seen this year. Their best has been streets ahead of anything they\u2019ve served up for five years, but the veil hangs ready to drop like a giant net at any moment. Defeats like this, and those suffered earlier in the season against Essendon and St Kilda, cause fans to start nervously adjusting their collar and wonder if they\u2019re living through another false dawn.</p> <p>What puts this side ahead of previous editions is a crop of youngsters better suited to long-term success. As long as he doesn\u2019t bolt for the west, Jesse Hogan\u2019s impact is much greater than his goals, the powerful Christian Petracca has made a promising start to his senior career and once Angus Brayshaw stops suffering novelty injuries like concussion from having a footy kicked into his face he\u2019ll add a vital cog to their midfield. </p> <p> The man they really missed this week was Clayton Oliver. With Nathan Jones playing a lone hand in a midfield unable to take advantage of Max Gawn\u2019s dominance the youthful clearance machine would have had a field day. His ability to stand in traffic and dodge tacklers like Neo avoiding bullets in The Matrix until the right option appears would have added much needed calm to a side who responded to Port\u2019s pressure like they were evacuating a burning building.<br />For a side that spent years mastering the art of the ponderous slopfest thumping, wins over Gold Coast and Brisbane were good fun but Port represented the real test. In a battle between sides fighting for the right to be finals cannon fodder the Dees fluffed their chance to make a statement, leaving Port looking the far better value side for the rest of 2016. </p> <p>With Hawthorn, Collingwood, Sydney and Adelaide on the horizon Melbourne has several opportunities to prove that lessons have been learnt, but their fans will need to wait until 2017 to confirm that the light at the end of the tunnel is not the light of another oncoming train.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-30T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Players who fail a drug test and receive a provisional ban \u2013 such as Maria Sharapova in March \u2013 should be named, the International Tennis Federation president, David Haggerty, has told the Guardian.</p> <p>This would help eradicate suspicions about players who mysteriously disappear from the Tour while the suspension is played out before an official decision on their guilt or innocence is announced.</p> <p>Marin Cilic is a case in point from the past \u2013 when it was misleadingly claimed that he left Wimbledon because of injury, though the ITF accepted his account that he had ingested a stimulant inadvertently \u2013 and Sharapova exposed the fallacy of the policy when she held a televised press conference in Los Angeles in March to announce her own failed drug test at the Australian Open in January.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve discussed the possibility of announcing provisional suspensions, as a way to be transparent as to what\u2019s going on,\u201d Haggerty said. \u201cI think that you\u2019ll see after Wimbledon some announcements because each of seven bodies has to go back to their stakeholders and have formal approval of things. But we understand the importance of transparency. We\u2019re also doing that with the integrity unit; they\u2019ve begun to publish a quarterly report.\u201d</p> <p>So secretive has the federation had to be to comply with out-of-date protocols that Haggerty could not even confirm in our exclusive interview that Sharapova\u2019s hearing into the ban began in London two weeks ago, and a decision was expected shortly. He would only say: \u201cI really can\u2019t tell you what [the date of a decision] would be but what I can tell you is, generally, it\u2019s about a three-week process from when the hearing occurs until something is published.\u201d</p> <p>Further anomalies remain, however. Rafael Nadal recently met with little enthusiasm when he asked the ITF to publish the records of all his drug tests, to kill rumours he had been using performance-enhancing substances.</p> <p>Haggerty said: \u201cUnder the rules that we have today he made a statement and we were able to collaborate that statement. I think what will happen in the future with provisional suspensions is it would become known. In theory, then, anything you hear means there is a suspension; if you don\u2019t hear anything, there isn\u2019t a suspension. The challenge is, when you have a set of rules, you have to follow them.</p> <p>\u201cBut now we\u2019re saying, \u2018Let\u2019s look at the rules. Are they fit for purpose? Are there ways to adapt them, so that perhaps there is a more logical way for things to be done, could be done?\u201d</p> <p>In response to the gathering storm of criticism that administrators are not doing enough to fight drug-taking and match-fixing, Haggerty admits the ITF has had to move quickly to save the game\u2019s reputation after reheated allegations on the BBC and BuzzFeed during the Australian Open, three months after he took over the presidency from the Italian Francesco Ricci Bitti, who had been in the post for 16 years.</p> <p>\u201cThe seven stakeholders have gotten together here and understand that integrity is the most important part of our reputation. Zero tolerance is really what we believe in. No player, no administrator, no official is above the law.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got six regional associations and 211 member nations and we\u2019ve just got to make sure we do everything we can to keep tennis clean. We want the players to participate, we want fans to believe that what they see on the court is a key sport.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to continue to put rigour into the system, to do more biological passports, to do more out-of-competition testing. We want to protect the clean athletes, and the majority of them are. We will keep more samples for a longer period of time, so, as new testing comes, you may discover some things that you didn\u2019t discover early on. You see that with what the IOC are doing with the Beijing [and London] Olympics. You can always build a better mousetrap, but you have to be open to thinking what you need to do.\u201d</p> <p>Match-fixing remains the game\u2019s other irritant. Haggerty concedes: \u201cWe need to do more with officials, with the players at the pro circuit levels, as well as what we\u2019re doing at the Challengers and the grand slam events. We need to put more rigour into it. We maybe need to invest more funding. We\u2019ve added another investigator, we\u2019ve added another analyst, to try to make it more robust. There has been no request from the TIU [Tennis Integrity Unit] turned down, financial resources, whatever.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>The fallout from Rafael Nadal\u2019s departure from the French Open continues to resonate as Novak Djokovic\u2019s odds on winning his first Roland Garros title are tightening markedly at the start of the second week.</p> <p>When the world No1 played so frenetically in near total darkness on Saturday night to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/28/novak-djokovic-aljaz-bedene-french-open\" title=\"\">get past the British No2, Aljaz Bedene, in three sets</a>, he knew he would need Sunday as a day of rest, before his fourth-round match against the 14th seed, Roberto Bautista Agut, on Monday.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/29/andy-murray-french-open-john-isner-stan-wawrinka-milos-raonic\">Andy Murray eases past John Isner after rain hitch to reach last eight</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There was no way he wanted to spoil his schedule by returning to finish the match against Bedene and possibly run into a rejuvenated opponent who could make life difficult for him.</p> <p>As it transpires, Djokovic is in just about the perfect place in this tournament. He is in the sunlight now, though \u2013 what there is of it \u2013 and the forecast for disruptions stretch into midweek here. Before a ball was struck at Roland Garros, however, it was Andy Murray among the leading contenders who was considered to have the most straightforward passage to the final weekend.</p> <p>Admittedly he had the reigning champion, Stan Wawrinka, on his side of the draw but the Swiss brought little in the way of recent form with him and nobody could be sure if he would rediscover the zest that lifted him to the pinnacle of his career here 12 months ago when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/07/french-open-2015-stanislas-wawrinka-novak-djokovic-win\" title=\"\">he hit Djokovic off the court in the final</a> to win his second and most significant major.</p> <p>This time, after years of near misses and disappointments, Djokovic was initially set to cope with the sophisticated challenge of Roger Federer, as well as a resurgent drive by Nadal, winner of nine titles here and desperate for double figures after an encouraging lift in form during the past month or so. Who would know that Federer would not even make it to the first round, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/19/roger-federer-pulls-out-french-open\" title=\"\">withdrawing to protect his ailing body</a> before Wimbledon, and Nadal\u2019s left wrist would <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/27/rafael-nadal-pulls-out-french-open-wrist-injury\" title=\"\">end his involvement</a> after two splendid opening wins?</p> <p>If Djokovic beats Agut in the fourth round and either of David Ferrer or Tomas Berdych in the quarter-finals on Wednesday, the Serb, remarkably, will then have an even easier run to the final next Sunday.</p> <p>His prospective roadblocks in that part of the draw are not daunting: Marcel Granollers (56 in the world), Dominic Thiem (15), David Goffin (13) or Ernests Gulbis (80). Those are the sort of opponents who would make a first week tricky; after Djokovic has found his rhythm here, they might end up being little more than warm-up partners before the final.</p> <p>So who might be there to stop his run? On form and rankings, it should be Thiem, the 22-year-old Austrian who is growing in confidence by the day and who looked seriously impressive in accounting for his fellow prospect Alexander Zverev in the third round. Now he has to beat Granollers, who is still in the tournament because of the walkover Nadal gave him. That should set up Thiem for a quarter-final against Goffin, whose opponent on Monday is the unreliable but occasionally spectacular Gulbis.</p> <p>Thereafter Thiem and Goffin make for an intriguing quarter-final match-up. Goffin has returned to something like the form he first showed here when taking a set off Federer five years ago. He has come through injury and a dip in confidence to play with freedom and sharpness, a genuine threat to anyone in the top 10 on his day. He might have such a day against Thiem.</p> <p>Will he have the strength and consistency to wear down the most formidable opponent in the game, however? Highly unlikely. And that will put Djokovic safely in the final, well rested more than likely with his tennis retuned to its best after slightly worrying slippage in Rome, where <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/15/andy-murray-novak-djokovic-rome-claycourt\" title=\"\">Murray beat him stylishly and clearly in two sets</a> in the Italian Open final two weekends ago.</p> <p>It is next weekend that matters most, however \u2013 to both of them: Djokovic, who has the other three major titles in his portfolio of 14, and Murray, who is yet to play for the prize in Paris.</p> <p>There is a lot of tennis to play between now and then but, on this rainy first weekend, that is looking like the final, perhaps even in some sunshine.</p>",

Given my height, it can be a bit more uncomfortable.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if he could identify what has caused a lean summer to date, Finn replied: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to find something as a bowler that makes it click, when you are searching for it \u2013 maybe I\u2019ve been doing that this summer because I\u2019ve been desperate to be in form and rhythm.</p> <p>\u201cI still feel I\u2019m doing a job for the team but I haven\u2019t been 100% good 100% of the time, which I was in South Africa and against Australia last summer. If you are looking for rhythm you\u2019re best doing that, getting yourself in a fight at the other end of the pitch, rather than at your own. It helps take your thought process away from the pitch.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if he felt backed by the England management, given they may opt to take a look at the uncapped Jake Ball in what is expected to be a dead rubber third Test at Lord\u2019s next week, Finn replied: \u201cEveryone in the dressing room backs each other.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t feel as though it\u2019s a system that discards players if you have a couple of bad games, it rewards people who perform consistently over a period of time. It backs young people. [Head coach] Trevor Bayliss said he would rather a player gets one game too many than one too few.\u201d</p> <p>On the match situation, in which Sri Lanka are still 88 runs behind and England are hunting five wickets for a series win on the fourth day, he said: \u201cWe have a four-over old ball tomorrow and we have seen the new ball has done damage this series.</p> <p>\u201cAnd we have two of the best new ball bowlers in the world. It is a great opportunity to make early inroads. In an ideal world we would have wrapped it up today. But it was going to be tough to get 10 wickets in a day on that pitch: it\u2019s very slow and low.\u201d</p>",

The full scale of the risk may only be recognised either through disaster or damage, or when insurance premiums become unaffordable. Any of these events can in turn affect housing values.\u201d</p> <p>The economic costs are high and could ultimately represent a real risk to the financial sector itself, the report says. While insurers, regulators and governments have started to recognise this risk, banks who approve the mortgages for at-risk properties have not yet begun working towards a solution. </p> <p>For example, the report says, banks could integrate the impact of climate into their risk assessment processes, work with other stakeholders in the public, private and civil society sectors to research and develop ways to minimise climate impact risk to housing, and address losses that will occur in an equitable way.</p> <p>It also says that state, federal and local governments could do more to protect buyers, by including climate risk in planning, development and approval processes, mandating the disclosure of all available hazard mapping, and requiring that all dwellings be built or renovated as fit-for-purpose for the maximum projected impacts of climate change. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/15/climate-change-website-reveals-which-homes-will-be-swamped-by-rising-sea-levels\">Climate change: website reveals which homes will be swamped by rising sea levels</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Extreme weather and climate change risks associated with a property should also be disclosed at the point of sale.</p> <p>\u201cEven if these \u2018uninsurable\u2019 and \u2018unadaptable\u2019 properties are only a tiny minority of the total housing stock, the eventual devaluation could be financially devastating to individuals,\u201d the report says. </p> <p>\u201cIt could also be damaging to banks, other financial companies and public balance sheets at all levels of government.</p> <p>An author of the report and the manager of investment and governance at the Climate Institute,<strong> </strong>Kate Mackenzie, said the sector had to be proactive before houses became damaged, otherwise there could be a costly and messy battle over who bore responsibility. </p> <p>For example, she said, councils could be liable for not providing flood data and for permitting a vulnerable development to go ahead, the developer for building it, the home owners for not realising the risk, the building code authority, the banks for financing the development and the mortgages, or the insurers.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s definitely a big need for governments to show leadership on this,\u201d she said. </p> <p>\u201cThere have been a few very good recommendations made in the past by public policy reviews which really haven\u2019t been followed up at the federal level or at the state level or through Coag, which would provide a mechanism for a national adaptation strategy.\u201d</p> <p>These included the reports from an Australian Treasury taskforce, the natural disaster insurance review, and <a href=\"http://www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/completed/climate-change-adaptation/report\">two Productivity</a> Commission <a href=\"http://www.pc.gov.au/inquiries/completed/disaster-funding#report\">inquiries</a>, she said.</p> <p>Her report concludes: \u201cA sense of exasperation is evident among those who have spent any length of time seeking to address the economic and policy challenges posed by extreme weather.\u201d</p> <p>Some researchers are already taking the matter into their own hands and developing products to help buyers manage risk.

The water temperature stresses the coral and it expels the colourful algae it relies on to give it energy. If warm conditions persist, the coral dies and can get taken over by seaweed.</p> <p>But if the water returns quickly to temperatures that are no longer stressful, the coral can recover, regaining its symbiotic algae. That is what researchers expect to happen to most of the bleached coral south of Cairns.</p> <p>\u201cFortunately, on reefs south of Cairns, our underwater surveys are also revealing that more than 95% of the corals have survived, and we expect these more mildly bleached corals to regain their normal colour over the next few months,\u201d said Mia Hoogenboom from James Cook University.</p> <p>The conditions that led to the bleaching event <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/29/great-barrier-reef-bleaching-made-175-times-likelier-by-human-caused-climate-change-say-scientists\">were estimated to have been virtually impossible if it were not for the greenhouse gases humans have released into the atmosphere</a>.

Ranked No108 at the entry deadline six weeks before this year\u2019s French Open, she was the final name accepted on the list of direct entries until there was a withdrawal, and Canadian Aleksandra Wozniak, also at No108 with an injury-protected ranking, squeezed in.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/29/andy-murray-french-open-john-isner-stan-wawrinka-milos-raonic\">Andy Murray eases past John Isner after rain hitch to reach last eight</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wozniak was beaten in the first round; Rogers is in the final eight after backing up <a href=\"http://www.si.com/tennis/2016/05/27/french-open-roland-garros-petra-kvitova-shelby-rogers-upset\">an incongruous 6-0, 6-7, 6-0 victory</a> over two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova with a far more textbook 6-3, 6-4 victory over No25 seed Irina-Camelia Begu. The Romanian arguably in better form on the red clay than the mercurial Kvitova.</p> <p>After the victory came the tears, as they did after the win over Kvitova. But until that moment, as emotional as Rogers admits she is, she was the epitome of poise. But she struggled to compose herself during the post-match interview with former Wimbledon champion Marion Bartoli, who gave her a hug and kindly fetched a tissue for her.</p> <p>\u201c100% tears all the time. Sad. Happy. Hungry. Reading a book. Watching a movie. They flow very easily,\u201d Rogers said later.</p> <p>Of all the American women who have come along in the wake of the Williams sisters\u2019 dominance, talented players all, the unlikely Rogers is the first American with a different last name to make the final eight at the French Open in 11 years. The last was former No1 Lindsay Davenport, and that was no surprise.</p> <p>This was. Only years from now will it be determined whether this French Open run was one glorious fortnight, or the breakthrough that allowed Rogers to take it to the next level as the Williams\u2019 sisters careers wind down in the years to come.</p> <p>Given Rogers\u2019 ranking, it wasn\u2019t just the last two matches that were upsets; it was all four of her wins thus far. She was unseeded and could have drawn a Williams sister in the first round. No17 seed Karolina Pliskova wasn\u2019t exactly a great consolation prize. Rogers defeated her 3-6, 6-4, 6-3. Then came Russian veteran Elena Vesnina, who has been as high as No21 and is back in the top 50 after struggling for a few years. </p> <p>Then Kvitova. And now Begu.</p> <p>\u201cI think that\u2019s a very important point on backing up a big win. I guess I have done that pretty much this whole tournament, starting with the first round, because that was a huge upset for me and kind of set the tone for the last few matches I have played,\u201d Rogers played. \u201cI keep reminding myself to play one point at a time and that this is just another tennis match. But that\u2019s getting a little bit harder to do as the rounds get farther.\u201d</p> <p>Rogers\u2019 countrywoman Coco Vandeweghe might have lent her a helping hand. Begu needed three hours and 48 minutes to defeat Vandeweghe in the previous round and the scar tissue from that marathon \u2013 the longest match on the WTA this year \u2013 was difficult to shake off.</p> <p>As it happens, the South Carolina native is good friends with fellow southerner Melanie Oudin, who had a similar sort of run in 2009 at the US Open when she reached the quarter-finals at the tender age of 17.</p> <p>\u201cI remember it very well. It was a time we needed an American player to kind of grab on to. She was so awesome, so feisty, and just really confident. It was definitely inspirational and gave me motivation to work harder, because I see her doing it, and why not me, you know?\u201d Rogers said.</p> <p>The aftermath wasn\u2019t as happy a story for Oudin, just a year older than Rogers but now ranked No336 after a series of injuries and the life- and career-changing consequences of what she accomplished before she was old enough to grasp it.</p> <p>For Rogers, who lost in the first round of the French Open a year ago, it may well be a life-changer. At 23, having been through the grind of the minor-league circuit around the US, Rogers surely is better equipped than Oudin was at the time to roll with it all.</p> <p>Last year, her first with coach Marc Lucero, Rogers suffered 17 first-round losses. Despite the genteel exterior, there has to be a core of inner steel to be able to suffer that kind of systematic defeat week after week and keep coming back for more, confident on some level that things will turn around.</p> <p>She will take more than $325,000 for reaching the quarter-finals, more than five times the amount she had earned coming into Paris, and push her career earnings over the $1m mark. Rogers\u2019 best previous pay cheque this season was the $21,400 she earned for reaching the final of a small WTA Tour event in Colombia.</p> <p>If she can upset No4 seed Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza in the quarter-finals this week, there will surely be more tears. Rogers wears them as a badge of honour. What\u2019s more, she has earned every one. \u201cWho I am is what got me here, and I can\u2019t change it. It\u2019s who I am, so ... I hope everyone likes it,\u201d she said.</p>",

An ecstatic Hamilton, who cut Rosberg\u2019s lead in the championship from 43 points to 24, started third on the grid but went past his slower team-mate after the German was instructed to let him by.</p> <p>Hamilton said: \u201cI came here today thinking: \u2018I have just got to go and do it,\u2019 because no one is going to give it to me. I didn\u2019t know whether I could win, but knowing that it would rain opened up the window of opportunity. I thought Nico had a problem. I knew when I was behind him that I was much, much quicker than him. I was also conscious that none of us are going to win this race if I am stuck behind.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the team ask you to push and you are not able to and it is hindering the team\u2019s chance of winning we have that agreement. I said thanks for being a gentleman.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/29/lewis-hamilton-formula-one-victory-monaco-grand-prix\">Lewis Hamilton gets his first F1 victory of season at Monaco Grand Prix</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Rosberg, asked if it was a painful decision to give way to his only serious title rival, said: \u201cIt was more painful the feeling that I had in the car. That was the worst. Around Monaco, that\u2019s not a nice feeling to have. I had no confidence at all. The second thing [team order] was just a consequence of that.\u201d</p> <p>A relieved Toto Wolff, the Mercedes motorsport director, said: \u201cIf I wore a red cap like Niki Lauda I would take it off to Nico. He gave up his place and understood our global position, and that showed a great sense of team work.</p> <p>\u201cThese last couple of weeks have strengthened Lewis and our relationship. This is just what the doctor ordered. He needed that win, we needed that win. We told Nico to up the pace and if not let Lewis by. Then we gave him the call of letting him by and he did it immediately. Not one single question. For Nico it was a messy day. All his bad luck came in one race.\u201d</p> <p>A bitterly disappointed Daniel Ricciardo, who was robbed of a victory because of a bad Red Bull pit-stop after starting on pole, said: \u201cTwo weekends in a row now I\u2019ve been screwed. It sucks. It hurts. We had the speed in the wet. At the start we pulled away, pitted for inters, and we put ourselves in a race with Lewis which we didn\u2019t need to be in.</p> <p>\u201cI felt I was the quickest in all conditions, but again, second place doesn\u2019t show much for it. I don\u2019t like being up here being miserable \u2013 when it happens two races in a row, it\u2019s hard not to be.\u201d</p> <p>In the previous race, in Barcelona this month, Ricciardo was upset because in order to \u201ccover\u201d Ferrari\u2019s Sebastian Vettel he was placed on a three-stop strategy \u2013 his team-mate Max Verstappen won the race with a two-stopper.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-30T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Wales came to Twickenham to dust cobwebs only to discover a layer of mould. Never mind the reasons for a second defeat here in two months they whispered after the match. This was a tactically stale display against a side that is evolving rapidly. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/29/england-wales-international-match-report\" title=\"\">They played with little wit, less invention and almost no idea of how to create space</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/29/england-wales-international-match-report\">England hopefuls give Eddie Jones much to ponder in defeat of Wales</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Eddie Jones, the England head coach, understandably railed after the match at persistent questioning about the goal-kicking inaccuracy of George Ford, pointing out that an England team missing seven of the grand-slam side scored five tries to one against a side that was closer to full strength.</p> <p>The woes from the tee for a kicker who will not have the responsibility in Australia when Owen Farrell will be back mattered far less than a significant change England have made under Jones, who before the game said he wanted his players to be able to switch from the structured to the unstructured in the time it takes to throw a pass.</p> <p>Three of their tries came after Wales had conceded possession, twice through poor hands and once after Ford had foiled a breakout. It was England\u2019s ability to turn from defence to attack in an instant that contrasted most with Wales, who were ineffective throughout at exploiting turnover ball. One prime attacking opportunity in the opening half was wasted when the prop Rob Evans blocked a pass intended for Hallam Amos on the left wing and another foundered when they went the wrong way.</p> <p>Warren Gatland, the Wales head coach, talked in the build-up before the game about the need for his side to show more in attack if they were to make any impression in New Zealand next month on their three-match tour, but they made little impression on England\u2019s defence after Evans scored the opening try of the game after five minutes.</p> <p>Wales did not have England\u2019s pace or the passing ability and awareness of their opponents and a side that was the dominant force in Europe earlier this decade was desperately short of ideas, as well as, more surprisingly, adrift defensively. It was the first appearance of some players for a month: that may have explained a lack of cohesion at times, and even Taulupe Faletau\u2019s most ineffective performance for Wales, but the Wales players have spent more time with the national team than their regions or clubs in the last year.</p> <p>Even at their best Wales struggled against the southern hemisphere superpowers, with one win against South Africa and one against Australia in the Gatland years. Time and again their conditioning and physical power took them close to victory but they lacked the cutting edge to score in multiples of seven rather than three and cursed a series of narrow defeats, not least in Australia four years ago when they lost the series 3-0 having scored seven points fewer than the Wallabies.</p> <p>Wales threw the ball around from the start against England, prepared to run from their own 22. They struggled to achieve space, their passing wayward when it was not laboured, and they looked like a side operating in a discomfort zone. They did not have anything to fall back on with their scrum under pressure and their lineout unreliable. They were also imbalanced in the back row with Sam Warburton injured and Dan Lydiate suffering an injury after 20 minutes that will rule him out of the New Zealand tour.</p> <p>The defeat meant Wales had won three of their eight Tests since defeating England in the World Cup last September, all against teams below them in the world rankings. The euphoria of that evening has been replaced by foreboding and, while England under Jones have made so much progress that about the only thing they have in common with last year is the colour of their jersey, Wales are struggling in an era when to stand still is to career backwards.</p> <p>Wales cursed decisions that went against them against England: did Anthony Watson ground the ball just short of the line and did Dan Cole knock the ball on in the build-up to Jack Clifford\u2019s try. They were not the pertinent questions before the series against the World Cup holders.</p> <p>For all the rust that some of the Wales players were coated in and for all the evidence that the longer Gatland has with his charges, the better they perform, what was manifestly clear was that Wales are not equipped to take on the All Blacks at their own reactive game. They will have to hustle and harry, using their strength and conditioning to force errors and slow the game down, exposing a potential leadership vacuum in the New Zealand side. The future can wait.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Composer Rhys Chatham made his name by mixing minimalist classical music with the guitar-driven punk energy of New York\u2019s late-70s scene. Later, he helped forge the genre of large-ensemble guitar works: 1989\u2019s An Angel Moves Too Fast to See required 100 players, while the sound of 2009\u2019s A Crimson Grail was created by more than 200 strummers. (Full disclosure: I was one of the happy volunteers who played Chatham\u2019s \u201coutdoor\u201d version of the piece at Lincoln Center.)</p> <p>But for all his interest in galvanic, rock-influenced energy, Chatham has other modes, too. His latest record, out later this week, finds him in a more contemplative aesthetic zone. By layering loops of his own playing \u2013 on trumpet, guitar and flute \u2013 Chatham\u2019s Pythagorean Dream delivers a pair of captivating, hypnotic performances. </p> <p>The album\u2019s first side-length track introduces a drone note, and then a guitar chord (created with a Pythagorean tuning), while the second track shows off Chatham\u2019s wind instrument chops. </p> <p>Earlier this month, I called Chatham, amid his current run of North American concert dates, to ask about the influences behind this latest stylistic turn. In a bemused and charmingly gentle conversational voice, he told me about the influences behind the new record, and how he sees Pythagorean Dream fitting into his overall catalog.</p> <h2><strong>On the problem of staging large-ensemble guitar opuses</strong></h2> <p>When we first did A Crimson Grail, the idea of having so many guitars was I simply wanted to surround the audience with guitars. And the first time we did it [in Paris] I thought we\u2019d need 400 guitars to surround the audience. So I had a call for 400 electric guitarists. And everyone says this piece is for 400 guitars. But strictly between you and me \u2013 and you can tell anyone you want! \u2013 only 126 guitarists showed up for that performance. And it was fine! So actually the performance at Lincoln Center had more musicians. And they had that many because that\u2019s what we needed to surround the audience, for the sound to be right.</p> <p>What do you do after writing a piece for a such large ensemble? That was the question I was asking myself \u2026 Was I going to write for a thousand? I had considered it. We actually tried to do it once. This composer I like, David Lang, did a piece for a thousand voices. It was a really nice piece \u2026 except there were only 400 musicians. And I said: I know where that\u2019s coming from. It\u2019s a nice idea \u2013 but I really didn\u2019t think that the way was to go for more musicians. And I\u2019m a musician myself! </p> <p>Yes, I\u2019m a composer. But I like to play. And I thought: what should I do next that will get me playing? A solo seemed to me the idea.</p> <h2><strong>How solo playing is linked to larger-scale works</strong></h2> <p>The link between the 100-guitar or 200-guitar pieces and the solo I\u2019m doing now is I specifically approach the solo by asking this question: how can I get the sound of a lot of instruments in a solo? How can I do this by myself, without having to ask a hundred musicians to donate their services constantly?</p> <p>The model came out of Poppy Nogood, the Terry Riley piece. Because I\u2019d actually heard a live rendition of the piece, back in the 1960s. And I was amazed! You know, Terry was just playing soprano saxophone, all by himself. He had David Rosenboom on viola, providing a drone, and it sounded like hundreds of musicians. So I decided to model the solo piece on that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Pythagorean Dream\">  <iframe style=\"border: 0; width: 100%; height: 120px;\" src=\"https://bandcamp.com/EmbeddedPlayer/album=3676445445/size=large/bgcol=ffffff/linkcol=0687f5/tracklist=false/artwork=small/track=431664302/transparent=true/\" seamless><a href=\"http://foommusic.bandcamp.com/album/rhys-chatham-pythagorean-dream\">Rhys Chatham\u2014Pythagorean Dream by Rhys Chatham</a></iframe> </figure>  <h2><strong>On the tuning that anchors the new album</strong></h2> <p>In a tuning in \u201cjust intonation\u201d, everything relates to one note \u2013 you know, a fundamental note. In this case it\u2019s a low E string tuned down to a D on an electric guitar. And so when you hit that D string you\u2019re hearing all the overtones: you hear an A, you hear a D octave, and you hear a seventh overtone of a C, which is like a minor seventh. And so the guitar is tuned to D, A, E octave, another A octave and then the C \u2026 but instead of being a C that you hear in virtually all of rock and jazz, it\u2019s a very flat C and it\u2019s completely in tune with the C that\u2019s coming out of the D string. </p> <p>And the result is something very ethereal; you don\u2019t need to be technical to hear it. Everything just clicks. And the reason it clicks, quote unquote, is because all the intervals are perfect.</p> <h2><strong>On the influences behind the piece</strong></h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/19/an-evening-for-tony-conrad-memorial-concert-moma\">An Evening for Tony Conrad review \u2013 tribute to\u00a0experimental music legend</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pythagorean Dream really does have a heck of a lot of influences! Hopefully I\u2019m putting it through a personal filter. We can hear La Monte Young in it. We hear Terry [Riley]. We hear Bill Dixon, we hear Don Cherry. We hear all kinds of things. And we\u2019re hearing Rhys!</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/19/an-evening-for-tony-conrad-memorial-concert-moma\">Tony Conrad was a huge influence</a>. I had met Tony before I met La Monte. Tony was one of the first people that I asked to play at [New York venue] The Kitchen. I didn\u2019t know Tony \u2013 I had just seen his film The Flicker. I was really wowed by it. Also I\u2019d heard tapes of La Monte \u2026 and I heard Tony playing violin in that context.</p> <p>So I called him up \u2013 and he turned out to be this really nice guy. Not only did he agree to play at the Kitchen, he asked me to play in the piece. So he gave me a monochord to play, a Pythagorean monochord, and we formed a group with me on this monochord. And I asked my friend Laurie Spiegel to play in this group also. She played a guitar-like instrument \u2026 that Tony had also built. The three of us played a number of times together \u2013 and interacting with Tony was such a trip. Because Tony was the person who explained what a Pythagorean scale is and what just intonation was.</p> <p>The guitar playing [on Pythagorean Dream] was inspired by the great fingerpickers like Fahey. I kept running into William Tyler and Steve Gunn at various festivals, and hearing their music. I noticed a lot of people playing acoustic guitar again! I asked myself: I wonder if I can still do fingerpicking \u2013 because I hadn\u2019t done it since I was in my early 20s. And it\u2019s really hard! But I grew my fingernails and I practiced. </p> <p>The actual way I\u2019m doing it was inspired by La Monte\u2019s The Well-Tuned Piano \u2013 in the sense of La Monte isn\u2019t really a pianist, but he had certain facilities with his fingers through playing wind instruments. And I\u2019m not a fingerpicker the way William Tyler is or Steve Gunn. But I developed an idiosyncratic way of fingerpicking that came out of my way of playing. </p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-30T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Corey Thompson is making a habit out of scoring important tries for Widnes but, in the context of his side\u2019s rapidly declining season, his 38th-minute score during this dramatic contest will surely go down as the most crucial yet.</p> <p>Widnes, trailing 16-0 and seemingly heading for a ninth consecutive Super League defeat, were desperately in need of something before half-time to give them even the faintest of hope against Huddersfield. The pass from the Widnes captain, Kevin Brown, was arguably the more applaudable part of the play, but when Thompson dotted the ball down under pressure, the Vikings seemed to have fresh hope \u2013 and ultimately, fresh impetus for their season.</p> <p>This may not have felt like the most significant game of the weekend given the table-topping battles elsewhere, but in the bigger picture of the fight to avoid the bottom four and a potential relegation battle, this is arguably the most pivotal result of the season so far.</p> <p>Defeat for Widnes would have meant both Huddersfield and Salford closing the gap on the eighth-placed Vikings to just two points. But the 24 unanswered points which laid the platform for Widnes\u2019 first league win since mid-March means they remain four points clear of the chasing pack, and six ahead of a Huddersfield side who now have just seven games left to claw themselves out of the bottom four.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve only got ourselves to blame,\u201d Paul Anderson, the Huddersfield coach, said. \u201cIf we\u2019d put another score on them at 16-0 we may have put the game to bed, but we got what we deserved.\u201d</p> <p>Widnes had begun to look like a side who had forgotten how to win in the last eight weeks as they tumbled down the Super League, following a start which had seen them sitting top after a win against Wigan over two months ago \u2013 so this was a comeback that could only be described as season-defining.</p> <p>\u201cIt may not have been beautiful, but we\u2019ll take it,\u201d Denis Betts, the Widnes coach, said. \u201cIt was a struggle but the character and spirit of the lads from 16-0 down was superb \u2013 we felt we were the best side. We\u2019ve been speaking about just getting over the line and getting a win, and we\u2019ve turned a corner now.\u201d</p> <p>Widnes would have looked on enviously at Huddersfield\u2019s recent improvement, and after tries from Nathan Mason, Danny Brough and Joe Wardle put the Giants 16-0 up, the result looked to be going to form. The second of those tries epitomised Widnes\u2019 predicament; with Setaimata Sa looking for a quick play-the-ball, there was no Vikings man at dummy-half, allowing Brough to collect the loose ball and race home.</p> <p>\u201cWe made a mess of that try and people can start to look at each other there \u2013 but the word from behind the posts was we knew we were right in the game: we weren\u2019t panicking,\u201d Betts said. How right he was.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/23/widnes-vikings-super-league-rugby-leicester-city\">Widnes Vikings and another unlikely sporting fairytale | Aaron Bower</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Thompson\u2019s crucial score two minutes before the break cut the gap to 12 points and, by the time the game had reached the hour mark, Widnes were ahead courtesy of tries from Joe Mellor, Stefan Marsh and a second for Thompson. Revitalised, Mellor\u2019s second \u2013 a fine piece of individual skill as the young half-back stepped off his left foot and weaved over the line \u2013 pushed the gap out to eight, which always felt vital in a game of such importance.</p> <p>Jermaine McGillvary set up a thrilling finale with a try 10 minutes from time but Widnes held on. As Betts said, it was not pretty \u2013 but the cheers from the Widnes fans at full-time would have no doubt been matched by groans from fans of not only Huddersfield, but most likely fellow bottom-four sides Salford and Hull KR too after a result of huge significance for the remainder of the regular season.</p> <p><strong>Widnes</strong> Hanbury; Thompson, Bridge, Runciman, Marsh; Mellor, Brown; Dudson, White, Cahill, Dean, Houston, Leuluai. <strong>Interchange</strong> Sa, Buchanan, Manuokafoa, Whitley.</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Thompson 2, Mellor 2, Marsh. <strong>Goals</strong> Hanbury 2.</p> <p><strong>Huddersfield</strong> Grix; McGillvary, Cudjoe, Connor, Murphy; Brough, Ellis; Crabtree, Hinchcliffe, Mason, Wardle, Ta\u2019ai, Lawrence. <strong>Interchange</strong> Wood, Rapira, Roberts, Ikahihifo.</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Mason, Brough, Wardle, McGillvary. <strong>Goals</strong> Brough 2.</p>",

It came out of an independent study into these substances which I set up when drugs minister. A wide range of experts produced a unanimous report and that forms the basis of the law. I was clear that so-called legal highs presented, and present, more of a danger to users than many long-prohibited drugs, especially cannabis.</p> <p>The fact they were legally available led some people to believe they had been given the green light by the state, with often tragic consequences. The real problem, therefore, is not the status of legal highs, but as the Transform Drug Policy Foundation point out in your article, the illogical, unscientific and draconian approach taken by the government towards cannabis. It is right that there is not a problem with dangerous legal highs in Holland where cannabis is easily available. As minister, I published an international comparators study by civil servants into drug policy, the first proper assessment of our drug laws for 43 years. At last a window for drug reform was opened, especially in relation to cannabis. Sadly since the 2015 election, that window has been firmly closed by the Tories and that report buried, another example of the unwelcome difference between a government with the Lib Dems in it and one where the Tories govern alone.<br /><strong>Norman Baker</strong><br /><em>Drugs minister 2013-14, Lewes</em></p> <p>\u2022 The legal high ban will have an effect on new psychoactive substances being accessible to the public. However, it is yet to be seen if the ban will work. Legal highs are extremely difficult to control as the prohibition of one brand will see the arrival of several new products. There is also the risk that the criminalisation of legal highs will push more people towards dealers of illicit substances, including class A narcotics. The \u201cback alley\u201d market is difficult to regulate and it could lead to more people being intimidated and manipulated by such criminal activity. The law follows the traditional governmental reaction to drugs: criminalisation. This ignores the underlying, deeply entrenched social issues of drug use, instead focusing on a perceived quick fix. This approach does nothing to tackle the actual issue, instead simply populating the prison system. As it is, people will continue to die from using these substances.<br /><strong>Yasmin Batliwala</strong><br /><em>WDP, London</em></p>",

Astonishingly important issues relating to international affairs, defence, the economy and the welfare of our neediest have been delegated to a highly politicised referendum with many of the\u00a0key Conservatives embroiled in psychological tactics; a Labour party openly disagreeing with its MPs; and the recognition by senior members in all parties of the human cost of failing economic policies. We should be talking about a general election as soon as possible. The\u00a0price to vote remain should be an offer by the parties to abolish the fixed-term parliament act and a gerneral election in October, after the party conference season. If something of this magnitude is not offered I think the conference season will end with the replacement of three party leaders who are unable to address the ongoing muddle of national policies viewed as social and constitutional experiments with no obvious net benefit.<br /><strong>Professor Craig Richardson</strong><br /><em>Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire </em></p> <p>\u2022 Here is what really puzzles me: David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Michael Gove are all friends of long-standing. Cameron\u2019s wife and Gove\u2019s wife are besties. It is difficult to get my head around how all of them have suddenly fallen out with one another over the EU. So here\u2019s my theory: Cameron has purposely enlisted Gove and Johnson to spearhead the \u201cleave\u201d campaign to control the messaging of the leavers and prevent a wildcard from taking the reins of the campaign. Gove looks downright uncomfortable when shilling for the leave side. Johnson is all bluster and sheepdog hair. Whatever the outcome of this referendum, I\u2019ll bet all three of them and their spouses slide back into BF mode in no time. <br /><strong>Jane Braithwaite</strong><br /><em>Brixham, Devon</em></p>",

London\u2019s archeological heritage will also suffer serious harm. When I recently visited the Billingsgate Roman house and bath, wonderfully preserved in the basement of a low-rise 70s block in the City of London, I asked an archeologist present whether anything similar could have survived under the nearby new Walkie Talkie skyscraper. The answer was that the massively deep foundations needed for such a tall building would destroy everything \u2013 the only way to preserve archeological remains would be to excavate them first. We have been so lucky to have Roman roads, walls, pavements, mosaic floors preserved in situ and to have been able to see these wonders where they have survived for nearly 2,000 years. I dread the day when London\u2019s skyline blackens with a dense vulgarity of towers and when the earth beneath is robbed of its treasures and filled with concrete.<br /><strong>Leana Pooley</strong><br /><em>London</em></p> <p>\u2022 What is happening in London today, as families find themselves displaced by the developers, echoes what happened in the second half of the 19th century. Then the developers were the powerful railway companies. They used their political clout to acquire over 5% of the central area. It is estimated that between 76,000 and 120,000 people were displaced. As now, it was suggested that those displaced should find new homes in the suburbs and beyond. But many could not afford to ride to work in the centre and did not in any case wish to leave their communities. They endured the slums of the grossly overcrowded city centre \u2013 the equivalent of the confined living spaces that many, especially the young, have to experience today. Some mitigation came eventually through workmen\u2019s trains and concessionary fares, which contributed to the dispersal of people into healthier districts. But this did not solve the housing problem. An ideological shift was required \u2013 the acceptance, largely after the first world war, that local authorities had to intervene to offset the failures of the market system. Let\u2019s hope that London\u2019s new mayor is able to do the same.<br /><strong>Professor emeritus Geoffrey Channon</strong><br /><em>Frome, Somerset</em></p> <p>\u2022 How long before we see a \u201cwealth apartheid\u201d in London, with ordinary people only allowed into the centre to do essential work for the minimum wage. Councils, including Oxford\u2019s, are increasingly using the public space protection order as a way of gentrifying our public spaces.<br /><strong>Chaka Artwell </strong><br /><em>Oxford</em></p>",

Doing so, however, remains a prime motivator for many a sportsman, with Chris Woakes among them.</p> <p>The 27-year-old said as much <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/27/chris-woakes-england-sri-lanka\" title=\"\">on the morning of his call-up</a> for this second Test with Sri Lanka \u2013 the day of his career-best nine for 36 against Durham \u2013 when he conceded that \u201cuntil you deliver at international level, there are people who don\u2019t believe that you truly belong\u201d and how he now hoped to \u201cset a few people right along the way\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/29/england-sri-lanka-second-test-day-three-match-report\">Kaushal Silva and Angelo Mathews lead Sri Lanka fightback against England</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/26/chris-woakes-replace-ben-stokes-england-second-test\" title=\"\">Stepping in for the injured Ben Stokes</a> is a tall order, of course. Aside from the all-rounder\u2019s resurgent 12 months with bat and ball \u2013 one of inspirational interventions, rather than consistency \u2013 he is something of a poster boy for this England team, a hugely charismatic cricketer and one who almost guarantees that something exciting, be it good or bad, is just around the corner.</p> <p>Woakes, by his own admission, could not be more different. The right-armer is clean-cut to Stokes\u2019s rough and ready, steady to his explosive. And as such, following his previous six Test matches, a player whose selection ahead of the promising Jake Ball was met more by collective indifference than an avalanche of calls to the ticket office.</p> <p>It has made him something of easy target in the past, too, with Sky\u2019s Bob Willis leading the catcalls <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/22/joe-root-england-bowlers-south-africa-day-one\" title=\"\">during his underwhelming last showing in Centurion</a>, when his dismissal for five <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/26/england-south-africa-fourth-test-day-five-kagiso-rabada\" title=\"\">in England\u2019s fourth-innings collapse</a> was met with a brutal \u201cthere\u2019s my mate, off back to Birmingham for the rest of his career\u201d before returning an improbable score of zero on his tour report card.</p> <p>And yet despite that rather tasty send\u2011off back to their shared home ground of Edgbaston, here is Woakes, back in whites for his country and, it must be said, looking more like the cricketer with whom the selectors persist; doing so in the hope that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/23/chris-woakes-england-nine-durham-wickets-warwickshire\" title=\"\">his county figures for Warwickshire</a>, as impeccable as his haircut, can translate to Test cricket.</p> <p>Woakes, who had to reconstruct his bowling action to add the requisite pace for international cricket and in turn found himself relearning the skills that brought lateral movement, has looked sharp at the Riverside \u2013 the quickest bowler on show, in fact \u2013 with his first-innings three for nine gutting Sri Lanka\u2019s middle order on day two to break the match wide open.</p> <p>As with his haul against Durham, it was an exhibition in being relentlessly at the batsman, both cracking the splice and hunting the edge. On the third day, while remaining largely in the slipstream of Jimmy Anderson, his would be the breakthrough that got things moving before lunch, as a hint of seam found the outside of the left-hander Dimuth Karunaratne\u2019s bat to warm Joe Root\u2019s hands at second slip.</p> <p>The analysts at CricViz noted that Woakes has beaten Sri Lankan willow 18 times so far on a pitch less bowler-friendly than that seen at Headingley, a number bettered only by the vastly more experienced Anderson. Throw in his batting during England\u2019s first innings, where a controlled 39 brushed off an early drop and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/28/moeen-ali-chris-woakes-england-sri-lanka-second-test\" title=\"\">supported Moeen Ali\u2019s more thrilling 155</a> at the other end, and it should add up to at least a seven in Willis\u2019s strident scorebook.</p> <p>None of this is to say that Woakes has truly arrived yet \u2013 five-wicket hauls and centuries do that \u2013 and so those pesky doubters will only have been converted in their singles during what has been a second early-summer mismatch. The early signs from his latest opportunity at Test level, one that will continue through to Lord\u2019s at least, are promising nonetheless.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-30T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Is the modern Conservative party starting to fall apart under the pressure of the EU referendum? The idea touted three years ago by David Cameron that holding a vote on Britain\u2019s place in Europe could ultimately enable the party to come together on the issue always sounded like heroic wishful thinking \u2013 a case of mistaking a sticking plaster for a cure. Events have done nothing to challenge that judgment. Indeed the original doubts about the internal Tory party consequences of the referendum pledge are now beginning to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/29/cameron-tories-eu-referendum-war\" title=\"\">harden into certainties</a>.</p> <p>Very little that has happened within the party during the referendum campaign suggests there is any chance of its wounds healing quickly \u2013 or possibly at all. On the contrary. It is hard to imagine a return to business as usual after a remain vote, and even less so after a leave one. Whatever the result on 23 June, the divisive potency of the EU issue will not go away. And now, with three weeks to go before the vote, the split over Europe seems to be metastising into fresh conflicts about the whole direction of the party and about Mr Cameron\u2019s leadership.</p> <p>By any standards, this weekend showed a party that is arming for a war with itself. Two senior Brexiteers, the justice secretary Michael Gove and former mayor of London Boris Johnson, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/29/tory-rift-eu-widening-attacks-on-david-cameron-boris-johnson\" title=\"\">turned their guns squarely and very personally</a> on Mr Cameron over immigration policy. Another cabinet minister, Priti Patel, suggested Mr Cameron was too rich to care about ordinary people\u2019s concerns. One backbench Brexiteer, Andrew Bridgen, said a remain vote would leave the Tories as a zombie government with pressure for a no\u00a0confidence vote against the prime minister and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/29/andrew-brigden-conservatives-david-cameron-fractured-eu-debate-election\" title=\"\">possibility of an early general election</a>. Another, Nadine Dorries, accused Mr Cameron of being a liar and said he would be toast within days if remain wins by anything less than a conclusive margin.</p> <p>True, other Tory leavers, including some prominent ones \u2013 Graham Brady, Chris Grayling, Liam Fox \u2013 took a more consensual view on Sunday about the future. They may still be the majority, and it is worth reminding ourselves that Ms Dorries, in particular, has rarely been a mainstream voice about anything. Nevertheless, any pretence that the Conservatives are a broadly united party with a gentlemanly agreement to differ on the EU now feels <a href=\"http://www.conservativehome.com/platform/2016/05/andrew-mitchell-to-say-that-relations-are-strained-on-europe-among-conservative-mps-would-be-an-understatement.html\" title=\"\">increasingly threadbare</a>. A\u00a0leadership challenge, in particular, is catnip to ambitious potential successors, some backbenchers and all journalists. This is a party without a larger unifying project, and the referendum is intensifying that absence.</p> <p>There\u2019s a school of thought that says this is all a cunning plan. Having lost the economic and security argument over Europe, this theory argues, the leave campaign has to keep the headlines on migration. Last week\u2019s migration figures helpfully rolled the pitch for that. Treasury referendum purdah means George Osborne has fewer economic thunderbolts to release. So the Gove/Johnson letter ensures that the headlines of a half-term week for MPs in their constituencies can be dominated by fear of migrants rather than fear of economic uncertainty. If the price of that is a few cheap backbench shots at Mr Cameron, then the Brexit high command may think it\u2019s one that is worth paying to ensure that remain is on the defensive for longer.</p> <p>The trouble with this is that unsurprisingly the Conservative party has not got a lot of electoral credit in the bank. A combination of continuing cuts, macroeconomic uncertainty, migration and perhaps boredom with the Cameron-Osborne regime means that Tory ratings are flat. The party is not greatly loved by voters. Mr Cameron has been around a long time, has announced he won\u2019t lead the Tories in 2020 and, while quite well thought of by voters, he has always been intensely disliked by a significant section of his party.</p> <p>Voters also dislike divided parties, as Tories who remember the 1990s, when the Conservatives were last wrecked by European divisions, are aware. All of this means the Conservatives would be reckless to suppose that they would win an early election, even against a similarly stalled Labour. But they would be equally reckless to think a civil war, which would not just be a three-week affair anyway, would be forgiven by voters in 2020.</p> <p>The party has only itself to blame for this descent into infighting. It is a direct consequence of the party\u2019s \u2013 and particularly Mr Cameron\u2019s \u2013 longterm failure to deal with the anti-Europe obsession. The Tories\u2019 opponents can rub their hands. But in the current state of politics it\u2019s hard to see much wider good coming from the party\u2019s current self-absorption and brinkmanship.</p>",

      "headline": "The Guardian view on the centenary of Verdun: lessons for us all",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-30T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>A month from now, the centenary of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/jul/01/topstories3.military\" title=\"\">the battle of the Somme</a> will be upon us. Britain will be awash with commemorative reflections and <a href=\"http://somme2016.org/en/\" title=\"\">remembrance events</a>. And properly so. The Somme witnessed a million casualties in four months, with almost 20,000 British soldiers dead on day one, 1 July 1916. For Britain, the Somme is the natural emotional and memorial focus of the current <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2014/jul/23/a-global-guide-to-the-first-world-war-interactive-documentary\" title=\"\">first world war</a> centenary remembrance.</p> <p>Before that centenary is reached, however, it is worth remembering the wider European context of the sacrifice on the Somme. Militarily, the battle was part of an allied European campaign to launch simultaneous attacks upon Germany and Austria-Hungary in summer 1916. That coordinated strategy included the British and French attack on the Somme and the <a href=\"http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/world-war-one/battles-of-world-war-one/the-brusilov-offensive/\" title=\"\">Brusilov offensive</a> by Russia against the central powers in what is now western Ukraine. All these immense battles, however, were subordinate to the supreme strategic aim of breaking the German military pressure that had been building up against the French army around the town of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/zydwtyc\" title=\"\">Verdun</a> since the German advance early in 1916.</p> <p>If the Somme is always the focus of British memory in this centenary, for France \u2013 and to some extent also for Germany \u2013 that role is occupied by Verdun. Verdun is to the first world war as Stalingrad was to the second. Even in a war that set new standards for slaughter, it was a battle beyond compare. Shelled night and day, mined from below and continually rocked by artillery attack, Verdun\u2019s attritional intensity and importance were unequalled. On both sides, killing as many enemy as possible was central. When it was over, there were so many unidentifiable human remains that the bones of 130,000 unknown dead of both armies were entombed together in the vast <a href=\"http://www.tourisme-verdun.fr/en_ossuary-of-douaumont.php\" title=\"\">ossuary at Douaumont</a> that commemorates Verdun. The military and psychological significance for France of Verdun cannot be overstated, and had much to do with its victor Marshal P\u00e9tain\u2019s reemergence in 1940.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/ng-interactive/2014/jul/16/the-ruins-of-verdun-1916-and-now-interactive\" title=\"\">Verdun\u2019s importance</a> dictated that it was there, in 1984, that France\u2019s president and Germany\u2019s chancellor held hands in a symbolic gesture that embodied the two nation\u2019s reconciliation. On Sunday, in the same cemeteries at Verdun, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-36407564\" title=\"\">Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and Angela Merkel stood</a> where <a href=\"http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/sub_image.cfm?image_id=2472\" title=\"\">Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl stood</a> more than 30 years previously, and with the same message. As Mr Hollande put it, Verdun was where Europe lost itself 100 years ago and where it has now enabled Europe to come together for peace and friendship.</p> <p>By the time Britain marks the Somme centenary, the result of the EU referendum will be known. But with three and a half weeks to go before the vote, we should make the imaginative effort to understand the Verdun centenary too. Just as British soldiers died for France on the Somme, so French soldiers died for Britain at Verdun. In a similar vein, Sunday\u2019s reaffirmation of Franco-German reconciliation is an event that speaks for us, too. It is all too easy, after 70 years of European peace and 100 years after Europeans slaughtered one another on\u00a0the western front, to ignore what has been achieved by Europe\u2019s common institutions in providing a stability in Europe that did not exist there before. We in Britain have a responsibility to do our part to ensure that this stability and unity do not unravel. We\u00a0should all remember Verdun.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The Rio Olympic ambitions of Great Britain\u2019s top decathlete Ashley Bryant could be dashed because his pole vaults failed to arrive in G\u00f6tzis due to an airline cock-up.</p> <p>The 25-year-old finished the two days of competition in Austria with 8,056 points \u2013 an agonising 44 short of the 8,100 required to make it to Rio. The pole vault proved to be the difference as Bryant struggled to clear 4.40m, 30cm below his personal best, because he was using borrowed equipment in heavy rain.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/29/katarina-johnson-thompson-olympics-qualification\">Katarina Johnson-Thompson targets Olympic gold after shaky qualification</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The poles had been due to accompany Bryant and his fellow British athlete John Lane on an EasyJet flight on Thursday. However, when that flight was cancelled the pair took a Swiss Air flight instead, having been assured they could also bring their equipment with them. But despite three days of increasingly desperate phone calls, the poles never turned up in G\u00f6tzis.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know where the poles are at the moment,\u201d Bryant said, \u201cbut I think not having them was the decisive thing. I know if I had my set of poles the qualifying would be done so it is frustrating \u2013 I needed 4.60m to make it.\u201d</p> <p>Bryant did his utmost in the remaining events, the javelin and 1500m, but fell agonisingly short. \u201cI gave it my all in the 1500m but it was not enough,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is painful to be so close but it\u2019s my first decathlon for two years. I had shoulder surgery last year and I\u2019ve realised I\u2019m in really good shape.\u201d</p> <p>However, a British Athletics spokesman held out the possibility that Bryant could yet make it on to the plane to Rio because of the exceptional circumstances surrounding his case. \u201cWe are aware of the difficulties Ashley has faced and we will look at this as an individual case,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Lane, the other British competitor in G\u00f6tzis, withdrew after the first day having failed to borrow a pole vault of the same size he was used to. He will instead try to make it to Rio at an event in the Czech Republic in a fortnight\u2019s time.</p> <p>Lane\u2019s coach Toni Minichiello, who also looks after Jessica Ennis-Hill, said that bringing poles on planes was a perennial problem.</p> <p>\u201cSome airlines take them, some don\u2019t,\u201d he explained. \u201cWhen the flight was cancelled, John spoke to Swiss Air and before he paid anything wanted to make sure that these will get on. They said \u2018yes\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>The poles, however, never made it to Austria. \u201cI think Ashley borrowed a pole off a Swedish guy,\u201d Minichiello added. \u201cHe has a 15ft pole when most use 16ft. I spoke to the Germans about helping John and they said \u2019we don\u2019t use children\u2019s poles\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Poles differ by length and flex, so they are tailored to an individual\u2019s requirements. As Minichiello explained: \u201cUsually poles are freighted to big championships. But when you are an individual athlete you are on your own recognisance. Even though this is a trial, it\u2019s up to you to get yourself there and your equipment.\u201d</p> <p>That isn\u2019t as easy as it sounds. The Irish pole vaulter Kevin Atkinson once put his poles on a plane \u2013 yet when got to the other end they had been sawn in half.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-30T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>The skies were grey but the air around the Prince of Perversity, Andy Murray, was oddly blue for much of a rain-split win in straight sets against John Isner to reach the quarter-finals of the French Open for a record sixth time.</p> <p>It was Fred Perry \u2013 naturally \u2013 who held the previous British highwater mark here, way in the distant past, and Murray can make history again if he can win three more matches in a tournament decimated by injury and upsets, among them that of the eighth seed, Milos Raonic, earlier in the day before the rain arrived in the late afternoon.</p> <p>This is the only major final Murray has never reached. It will not be easy but it is not beyond him. Next up is Richard Gasquet, whom he has known since their junior days and who looked brilliant defeating Kei Nishikori 6-4, 6-2, 4-6, 6-2 in just over two and a half hours.</p> <p>Murray, seeded second, took a little longer to beat the 15th seed, Isner, 7-6, 6-4, 6-2 in style \u2013 yet anyone who walked in late on his serial rants would surely have thought he was enduring the worst afternoon of his career.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/28/jamie-delgado-andy-murray-french-open\">Jamie Delgado open to coaching Andy Murray on full-time basis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Time and again he chastised himself \u2013 and his box \u2013 for often forgivable slips. It is his preferred method of raising his level but it seemed unnecessary in this contest. For most of the exchanges he ruled his 6ft\u00a010in opponent with deft use of short balls, passing shots and a solid serve, finding aces or big first serves when it mattered. He did a similar job against the game\u2019s other giant, Ivo Karlovic, in the third round.</p> <p>\u201cI think his game is right where it needs to be. He will feel a lot more comfortable against Gasquet after playing two skyscrapers,\u201d the former French champion Jim Courier said on ITV. \u201cJamie Delgado [Murray\u2019s interim coach] told me Andy has dropped the tension in his racket a couple of pounds so he\u2019s getting a lot more pop on his shots.\u201d</p> <p>Isner dominated much of the first set but Murray prevailed in the tie-break, one passing backhand on the run to save set point a candidate for shot of the weekend. Murray\u2019s read of Isner\u2019s inside-out forehand \u2013 which slid wide on set point \u2013 showed again what an astute tactician he is.</p> <p>Murray let Isner off the hook twice on his serve in the first six games of the second set, wasted a further break then outfoxed the American at the net with a deft backhand chip that left the big man stranded again \u2013 and two sets down.</p> <p>Once Murray pulled away in the third, the enthusiasm drained from Isner\u2019s long legs.</p> <p>Murray got a second-serve ace \u2013 his sixth against 16 \u2013 and held to 15 for 4-1. He gave Isner a look in the seventh game and faltered in the final game \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re going to mess this up,\u201d he muttered when a first serve strayed wide at 15-30, then handed Isner break point with a sloppy backhand. He saved with an ace. Isner hit long and Murray converted match point with another one, after two lets. It was a strangely angst-driven but convincing performance, another one for the collection.</p> <p>If he plays like this in the quarter-finals, he should not have much to swear about. Murray was much calmer a couple hours after the match and said of the prospect of playing Gasquet, whom he beat here in four uneven sets in 2012: \u201cI\u2019m pumped to be in the quarters of a slam. Obviously the atmosphere will be tough but I don\u2019t mind that. I played a number of times against French players here in difficult atmospheres and I managed OK.\u201d</p> <p>Murray joined Novak Djokovic in his concern about the Zika virus before the Rio Olympics, both of them saying they needed to learn more about it. \u201cI wasn\u2019t [concerned] to be honest,\u201d Murray said, \u201cbut a lot of people have been talking about it in the last few days. I saw 100 scientists saying it would be unethical if it were to go on there. It is something I will speak to a couple of doctors about to get some advice. I plan to go, for sure, but I need to get a little bit more information before making a decision.\u201d</p> <p>Djokovic said earlier: \u201cPeople should consider Brazilians and what they go through. I don\u2019t have enough information about the Zika virus, and about what people are experiencing with Zika virus, what are the circumstances of people\u2019s health.</p> <p>\u201cI know that the Olympic Games is a big deal ... but also I think the international media should talk about what happens to people there, what are they really experiencing, so they can also make the right conclusion for the other international people coming in or not to Rio.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/27/rafael-nadal-pulls-out-french-open-wrist-injury\">Rafael Nadal pulls out of French Open with wrist problem before third round</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Before the rain returned to Paris like an unwanted guest, Stan Wawrinka put 19 aces and 67 clean winners past Viktor Troicki to send a message to the rest of the field \u2013 and Murray, potentially, in the semi-finals \u2013 that he is in the right mood to hold on to his French Open title. The Swiss beat the Serb 7-6, 6-7, 6-3, 6-2 to win in just under three hours.</p> <p>Rafael Nadal pulls out of French Open with wrist problem before third round</p> <p>Read more</p> <p>However the third seed will not be playing Raonic next, as expected, but the world No55 from Barcelona, Albert Ramos-Vi\u00f1olas, who upset the Canadian 6-2, 6-4, 6-4 in just two hours and 20 minutes in the first match on Lenglen.</p> <p>John McEnroe dropped a minor bombshell earlier in the week when he said he would be joining Carlos Moy\u00e1 and Riccardo Piatti in a crowded coaching team for Wimbledon. He was there to witness this setback. At least he will have an extra week to work with him.</p> <p>Ramos-Vi\u00f1olas is a 6ft 2in, 28-year-old Spanish clay-courter from central casting, who grew up under the influence of Murray\u2019s one-time coach, \u00c0lex Corretja, and trains still alongside, among others, Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza in Barcelona. After Muguruza beat the 2009 champion Svetlana Kuznetsova in straight sets to go through to the quarter-finals, she said of Ramos-Vi\u00f1olas, \u201cI see him in Barcelona training. He\u2019s just a very quiet nice, guy.\u201d</p> <p>And he\u2019s making a bit of noise at this tournament. Ramos-Vi\u00f1olas said later: \u201cI lost I think four times in a row first round, and this year, quarter-finals. So I\u2019m really, really happy. Although this is not Raonic\u2019s favourite surface, I feel quite humbled to have won against him.\u201d</p> <p>So, there is a polite Spanish left-hander in the quarters, after all \u2013 just not the one anybody had predicted.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Four horses are now expected to be added to the field for next Saturday\u2019s Derby at Monday\u2019s supplementary stage, boosting the prize fund by \u00a3300,000 and ensuring something close to a maximum field of 20 runners. As a result the crowd of 100,000-plus on Epsom Downs will be too busy trying to pick the winner from a long list of runners to worry that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/30/frankie-dettori-2000-guineas-galileo-gold-newmarket-aidan-obrien\" title=\"\">Galileo Gold, the 2,000 Guineas winner,</a> is not one of them.</p> <p>It is, after all, hardly unusual for the winner of the season\u2019s first colts\u2019 Classic to sidestep the second. The Triple Crown, unclaimed now since 1970, means nothing to most owners and breeders these days. Sea The Stars and Camelot have both completed the Guineas-Derby double since 2009 but after Dawn Approach\u2019s dismal failure to do the same in 2013, Night Of Thunder and Gleneagles both avoided Epsom.</p> <p>But it is not the fact of Galileo Gold\u2019s absence that is troubling, so much as the process that apparently led to it. His pedigree does not look promising in terms of the Derby trip. Despite his name, he is by the miler Paco Boy and has Galileo only as his dam sire. In this most open of years, however, many owners and trainers would have been tempted to spin the wheel at Epsom \u2013 had it not been for the results of a genetic test which suggested he should stick to a mile.</p> <p>The test, developed \u2013 and marketed \u2013 by a company called Equinome, produces one of three results: C:C, C:T or T:T. According to its website, \u201cless than 1% of C:C horses in Europe have demonstrated their optimum trip at a mile and a half. Horses with the C:T and T:T genotypes are best suited to the Derby distance.\u201d After Galileo Gold came back as a C:C, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/10/galileo-gold-derby-option-irish-2000-guineas\" title=\"\">the Derby was ruled out by Hugo Palmer,</a> his trainer, and the owners, Al Shaqab Racing.</p> <p>This is, clearly, clever stuff but the underlying principle, which is that muscle development and structure varies according to genotype and so affects a horse\u2019s ideal trip, is plausible.</p> <p>If it is really as simple as three different genotypes, however, it seems a little surprising that breeders did not work it out for themselves at some point over the last 250 years. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/punctuated-equilibrium/2011/nov/22/1\" title=\"\">Mendel,</a> after all, knew why some of his pea plants were a certain height or colour decades before it was explained at a molecular level.</p> <p>Yet even if the science behind the test is as rock solid as the company which developed (and marketed) it likes to claim, there would be worrying implications for the sport as a whole \u2013 and the Derby in particular \u2013 if it became routine to test a Guineas winner and take the result at face value.</p> <p>If a C:C result is taken as absolute confirmation that a horse\u2019s ideal trip is a mile or less, there is a clear chance that it will become a self-fulfilling prophecy regardless of whether it is a valid conclusion. It does not offer certainty, though, only the appearance of it. \u201cLess than 1%\u201d of C:Cs have an optimal trip of 12 furlongs. That is not the same as none at all nor is it the same as saying that they cannot win a Derby.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/28/derby-2016-deauville-stamina-epsom-ryan-moore-aidan-obrien-horse-racing\">Derby 2016: Deauville\u2019s stamina can spin wheel his way at Epsom casino</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whether a horse stays 12 furlongs and whether that is its optimum trip are very different questions. It could be argued that an ideal Derby contender is a colt that stays a mile and a half but only just.</p> <p>And that single C:C horse in every 150 or 200 that <em>does</em> get 12 furlongs really well might well be the rare champion who transcends not only his own generation but many more besides. In years to come how many will be allowed to take their chance at Epsom and what might that mean for the quality and status of our greatest Flat race?</p> <p>Thirteen horses went to post for the 2,000 Guineas but Massaat, the runner-up, seems likely to be the only one to represent the form at Epsom at 4.30pm on Saturday. In such an open year, that seems a surprising disconnection between the two Classics. If gene-testing for stamina becomes routine, it could soon be the norm.</p> <p>The entire, somewhat rickety, structure of the thoroughbred racing and breeding industries is founded on uncertainty. It contributes to the intense level of competition that has kept people watching and betting on racing for centuries.</p> <p>Reducing the uncertainty may seem an excellent idea to individual owners and trainers but it is rarely a good thing for the sport as a whole.</p>",

In regions outside of London, too, concerns about immigration have been told anecdotally in reports about the view of an older, more working-class generation of Irish voters.</p> <p>Prof Mary Hickman, an expert on the history of the Irish diaspora, told the Guardian that on the whole, however, second generation Irish voters in northern cities such as Liverpool were still more likely to be Labour voters.</p> <p>Nevertheless, the Irish community in Britain was now much more disparate, she added, and the younger, more highly educated arrivals who had personal stake in free movement would be more receptive to appeals by the Irish government.<br /></p> <p>\u201cPeople who have been here longer and are of a second generation are going to be as much, if not considerably more, influenced by what the vote means for Britain rather than just what it means for Ireland,\u201d Hickman said.</p> <p>Also at the game was Elaine Regain, the daughter of Irish immigrants from County Mayo, who said that while the demographic face of the Irish in Britain had changed dramatically, common bonds existed in the form of the Gaelic Athletic Association.</p> <p>She is planning to vote remain and suggested that her family would do the same, although she bemoaned what she described as a lack of objective information ahead of polling day.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>",

      "body": "<p>The financial services industry based in the City of London facilitates a system that makes the UK the most corrupt nation in the world, the anti-mafia journalist Roberto Saviano said at the Hay festival. </p> <p>Saviano, who has been living under armed police guard for more than 10 years after writing an expose of the Neapolitan Camorra, said London\u2019s banking institutions were key components of \u201ccriminal capitalism\u201d, which laundered drug money through the offshore networks.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIf I asked what is the most corrupt place on Earth, you might say it\u2019s Afghanistan, maybe Greece, Nigeria, the south of Italy. I would say it is the UK. It\u2019s not UK bureaucracy, police, or politics, but what is corrupt is the financial capital. Ninety per cent of the owners of capital in London have their headquarters offshore.</p> <p>\u201cJersey and the Caymans are the access gates to criminal capital in Europe and the UK is the country that allows it. That is why it is important, why it is so crucial for me to talk to you because I want to say: this is about you, this is about your life, this is about your government.\u201d</p> <p>As he spoke two bodyguards stood by silently scanning the crowd.</p> <p>In his interview <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/26/man-who-exposed-lie-war-on-drugs-roberto-saviano-ed-vulliamy\">on Saturday with Guardian and Observer journalist Ed Vulliamy</a>, Saviano said that there was a hidden danger of voting to leave the European Union that was little discussed. He said if the UK left the EU, it would undermine joint attempts to fight illegal economies.</p> <p>\u201cLeaving the EU means allowing the Qatari societies, the Mexican cartels, the Russia Mafia to gain even more power,\u201d he said, highlighting the fact HSBC had paid $1.9bn in fines to the US government for financial irregularities in dealing with money that had come from cartels. </p> <p>He added: \u201cWe have proof, we have evidence. Today, the criminal economy is bigger than the legal economy. Drug trafficking eclipses the revenue of oil firms. Cocaine is a \u00a3300bn-a-year business. Criminal capitalism is capitalism without rules. Mafia and organised crime does not abide by the rule of law \u2013 and most financial companies who reside offshore are exactly the same.\u201d</p> <p>Saviano also recalled how he had been moved to write the book that led to the Camorra telling him it would kill him.</p> <p>\u201cIn my lifetime, more than 4,000 people have been killed in Naples and the surrounding area by the Camorra,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when I was younger I did not have a clear perception of the criminal power that ruled that area.\u201d</p> <p>He said that the murder of a priest in his home town radically changed his view. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/14/-sp-roberto-saviano-my-life-under-armed-guard-gomorrah\">Roberto Saviano: My life under armed guard</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe priest was 30 years old and was shot in the face,\u201d he said. \u201cHe had spoken out about the Camorra. He had said \u2018for the love of my people I will not keep quiet in the face of a dictatorship run by the Mafia. He called it a totalitarian power within a democracy, and wrote an essay denouncing them. He said by doing so, he felt he could influence the power that was around me.\u201d</p> <p>Saviano explained how his life had changed dramatically, aged 26, when he wrote Gomorra, a book exposing the people in the Camorra and the way they acted.</p> <p>Saviano said: \u201cWhen I got myself into this situation and I could not imagine that it would end like this because many books have been written on the Mafia, but it was my book that made them so angry.</p> <p>\u201cMy life is unique. I am followed by two bulletproofed cars and by more than five officers and that brings about a feeling of guilt sometimes because you exposed yourself too much, you were not cautious enough. I live under police protection and have done so for 10 years. What got me into trouble wasn\u2019t so much that I wrote a book, but the way I wrote it. I named names and I stated facts. I took you to the crime scene.\u201d</p> <p>Vulliamy praised his bravery and Saviano replied by saying writers should cherish their ability to speak out.</p> <p>\u201cNever take for granted the freedom of expression,\u201d Saviano said. He cited the case of Malala Yousafzai, who was shot by the Taliban aged 15 for campaigning for the right for girls to education. \u201cThey are the world\u2019s biggest heroin traffickers, who make fortunes from the trade, and they were frightened of this 15-year-old who was brave enough to speak up for women and girls to go to school as a way to transform her society,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He added he had been influenced by fellow Italian writer Primo Levi, whose book If This Is a Man about life in Auschwitz laid bare the daily horrors of life in the Nazi death camp. </p> <p>\u201cHe brought the reader to Auschwitz,\u201d explained Saviano. \u201cI wanted to say to the reader, this story is about you \u2013 that way the reader becomes a problem for organised crime.\u201d</p>",

In the end, the passage of time sweeps them out of bondage, but another form of prejudice awaits. All they have to hold on to is their family, their name and their pride. The best we can hope for these people is that they don\u2019t allow the world to strip them of that pride.</p> <p>It\u2019s not really a story that causes viewers to rush into the streets in fits of unbridled joy, but it is without question the most popular piece of literature about slavery in America. The Alex Haley novel was a New York Times bestseller and the original ABC series boasts the all-time second-largest audience for a series finale. One hundred million people tuned in for the last episode of Roots, a number unheard of in today\u2019s TV landscape outside of a Super Bowl.</p> <p>This new version serves the same story of survival across generations in a slightly slicker package. The action scenes, such as they are, are rendered in a more visceral fashion. Even the cockfights of the brash Chicken George in episode three are thrilling, assuming you forget that this is a dramatic recreation of two animals forced to kill each other for sport. </p> <p>The makeup and physical effects are also superior. Every scar and cut is affecting. The infamous scene of Kunta Kinte\u2019s foot being severed is gruesome without drifting into exploitation. The new film\u2019s score was even supervised by Questlove of The Roots, upping the hipness factor by a few degrees.</p> <p>Apologies to LeVar Burton \u2013 the first Kunta Kinte and a co-executive producer \u2013 but the acting is also supremely improved. Anika Noni Rose plays Kizzy, Kunta\u2019s daughter, with ample amounts of life and vigor, even in the most horrific situation imaginable. Special praise goes to Reg\u00e9-Jean Page, who portrays the adult Chicken George. He channels the charming rogue but pivots nicely toward gravitas in the final episode. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/25/revisiting-roots-how-was-your-family-impacted-by-the-slave-trade\">Revisiting Roots: how was your family affected by the slave trade?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Befitting a slave narrative, the white characters are uniformly disreputable racists, though the original Roots series shoehorned Ed Asner to be a \u201ckinder, gentler\u201d slavemaster, out of a misguided sense of white guilt. In this Roots, the white characters are a never-ending parade of sadists and demons.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Jonathan Rhys-Meyers <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1KOFG7t6QI\">dusts off his Elvis accent</a> to play Chicken George\u2019s monstrous hillbilly rapist father. Matthew Goode plays another slavemaster like a darker (or maybe more realistic) version of his character from Downton Abbey. Anna Paquin pops up in episode four to sneer at people. I think it must be some sort of rite of passage for every British and Australian actor to play an American slaveowner at least once. </p> <p>Each episode hews closely to one protagonist: Kunta in episode one, Kizzy in episode two, Chicken George in episode three and Tom in episode four. This keeps the whole affair fresh and propulsive. This is, after all, a sprawling tale of one family\u2019s experience in America. </p> <p>It does get a bit fuzzy by the final episode. Hip-hop star TI appears in a small role and a civil war espionage subplot I don\u2019t remember from the original gets grafted on to what, up until that point, was a rather intimate story. The kids these days, they love their spy stories, don\u2019t they? That must be why AMC\u2019s Turn: Washington\u2019s Spies is so bloody popular.</p> <p>The modern slave narrative has changed thanks to Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Django Unchained, a film that took the basic framework of a tale of subjugation and rearranged it to be a story of a lone black man who fights his way out of subservience to reclaim his personhood through extreme violence. That is a clear fantasy story, something that exists only in the modern conception of racial politics. </p> <p>Django added blaxpotation and western tropes into the slave tales of films like the first Roots mini-series to create a completely new genre. Django is a revisionist history \u2013 a film that gives contemporary audiences the sort of happy ending we desire, befitting a nation that honestly, illogically believes that it has exorcised the demons of racism. It does it with the sort of cutting-edge special effects and film-making techniques that the new Roots hopes to take advantage of.</p> <p>But Roots hasn\u2019t endured because of high-concept action, wish fulfillment or fancy prosthetics. In fact, it has survived in the cultural consciousness in spite of the limitations inherent in the medium of television. It\u2019s also survived the failings of its author. </p> <p><a href=\"http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-03-10/news/9303190620_1_pulitzer-board-philip-nobile-roots\">Alex Haley was sued</a> and later admitted to plagiarizing an earlier work, plus the mislabeling of his work as more fact than fiction. Roots doesn\u2019t have to be a true story to be powerful. It\u2019s a fable \u2013 one with an origin in reality, but a fable nonetheless. It can stand for the millions of other stories just like it \u2013 stories of men and women in bondage, yearning to be unchained. </p> <p>Though this version of Roots ends with Laurence Fishburne, playing Alex Haley, stepping out of his office and into a vision of his noble ancestors, it\u2019s easy to project the struggle of Kunta, Kizzy, George and Tom as the same basic struggle African Americans are still fighting today. The chains are not literal anymore, but the need to retain one\u2019s identity in the face of systemic dehumanization remains. </p> <p>This new Roots works because it taps into the need for black people to embrace themselves, to know that they come from somewhere, and that they are not a simple \u201cother\u201d to be ignored or debased. Your name matters. You are free.</p>",

Hey, maybe I\u2019ll run for governor of New Mexico. I\u2019ll get this place going.\u201d</p> <p>By Sunday, Trump\u2019s top operatives were working to untangle the resultant mess. Campaign chairman Paul Manafort and campaign manager Corey Lewandowski \u2013 the subjects of reports this week about <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/28/us/politics/donald-trump-campaign.html?_r=1\">infighting and chaos within the Trump campaign</a> \u2013 both insisted that Trump\u2019s remarks would not further hinder his appeal to women and Latinos. </p> <p>\u201cThe Governor Martinez thing \u2013 the focus was on the wrong thing,\u201d Manafort said on ABC\u2019s This Week, blaming the media (once again) for overhyping the incident.</p> <p>\u201cHe was talking about the welfare system and how it was out of control in New Mexico,\u201d Manafort said. \u201cAnd just as he criticized issues in Washington, when he\u2019s in the states he talks about the things that need to be done to improve the situation for the voters \u2026</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that it was a Republican governor of New Mexico is not the point. The point is that the system was broken.\u201d</p> <p>On Fox News Sunday, Lewandowski similarly argued that Trump\u2019s attack was a nonpartisan indictment of a broken system that he intends to fix as president. </p> <p>\u201cThere was no attack on a Latino or woman governor,\u201d Lewandowski said, adding, wrongly, that: \u201cDonald Trump is winning with Latinos, if you look at the last poll, he\u2019s winning with Hispanics, if you look at the polls, he\u2019s doing very well with women.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2016/05/20/latinos-favor-clinton-over-trump-by-3-point-margin-fox-news-latino-poll-finds/\">A recent Fox Latino poll </a>showed Clinton leading Trump by an impressive 39 points, with 62% of Hispanic voters in favor of the former secretary of state compared with only 23% who favor the business man. And a <a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/news/cbsnyt-national-poll-hillary-clintons-lead-over-donald-trump-narrows/\">CBS-New York Times poll </a>found a large gender gap between the likely general election contenders, with Clinton leading Trump by 17 points among women. </p> <p>Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace noted that, in fact, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-latino-voters_us_573c62d2e4b0646cbeeb8c16\">polls</a> show the candidate is \u201chugely underwater with both\u201d <a href=\"http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2016/05/20/latinos-favor-clinton-over-trump-by-3-point-margin-fox-news-latino-poll-finds/\">constituencies</a>. </p> <p>\u201cYou guys want to make this a story about something that doesn\u2019t exist,\u201d Lewandowski said, shifting the blame to the media.</p> <p>Asked if Trump stood by his comments about Martinez, Lewandowski said: \u201cWe absolutely stand by our statement that the state of New Mexico could be doing better.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Martinez has been openly circumspect about Trump\u2019s candidacy since last summer, telling <a href=\"http://www.kob.com/politics-news/gov-martinez-wont-attend-trump-rally-in-albuquerque/4147195/#.V0sZlr4gvBI\">a local NBC affiliate</a> last week that she was simply \u201ctoo busy\u201d to meet the nominee while he campaigned in her state.</p> <p>Manafort said the Trump campaign had identified a list of potential running mates that included women and Latinos, but re-iterated that neither were selling points in a vice-presidential pick. </p> <p>\u201cHe wouldn\u2019t select someone only on the basis of gender or ethnicity, because that would be pandering, but the qualifications, if there\u2019s a female who\u2019s qualified that\u2019s a different story,\u201d Manafort said. </p> <p>He added that Trump was looking for someone with \u201cWashington experience\u201d who could work with the Congress. </p> <p>Lewandowski sidestepped questions about the rumored rift between himself and Manafort, telling Fox that such reports were, again, \u201cmedia hype\u201d. He also dismissed other reports that the Trump campaign was being massively outspent and out-organized by its likely opponent, Hillary Clinton.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6bb676709237ec2b73cff29fdd18f92f45709d95\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6bb676709237ec2b73cff29fdd18f92f45709d95/0_29_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"New Mexico Governor Susana Martinez\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Martinez has been circumspect about Trump\u2019s candidacy, saying last week that she was simply \u2018too busy\u2019 to meet the nominee.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Russell Contreras/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/28/donald-trump-protesters-supporters-san-diego-new-mexico\">'Racists!'

On Sunday morning Sri Lanka became the first side to record three consecutive sub-120 totals in Test cricket since the New Zealanders who toured England in 1958 \u2013 and John Reid\u2019s side has never been considered a frightfully good one.</p> <p>This resistance will surely not have an impact on the result of this match and the series; it may not even influence the outcome of the Super Series that you may have forgotten about.</p> <p>But at least the Sri Lankans can be cheered by their efforts in their second innings. After Mathews and Silva, Dinesh Chandimal and Milinda Siriwardana actually looked to be enjoying themselves in the evening sunshine.</p> <p>Not that Sri Lankan are the only ones searching for that elusive moment, which can signal the return of some form.</p> <p>Consider Steven Finn. He snatched three wickets at the end of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/21/england-sri-lanka-first-test\" title=\"\">Headingley Test</a> that may have neatly disguised the fact that the ball was not quite coming out as he would wish. He did not manage a wicket in the first innings here in his seven overs but greater Sri Lankan resolve plus a more benign surface meant that he would have more opportunities now.</p> <p>He bowled eight overs before tea. Ostensibly they were respectable enough; the ball was landing more or less in the right place. Thereafter it thudded rather too gently into the middle of the bat at the other end.</p> <p>His pace was modest \u2013 in the low 80s; he did not even seem to be delivering the ball from his optimum height and remember how that extra bit of bounce has always been one of his obvious assets. Sometimes he seemed to be straining as he ran up to the crease, but this never resulted in extra zip when he let the ball go. So far in this game he had been palpably outbowled by Chris Woakes.</p> <p>Forget the forgettable figures after eight overs \u2013 nought for 31; they told us nothing. Finn was struggling. There must have been a conversation at tea-time, which ended with a determination to run in and bowl the ball faster rather than aiming for face-saving respectability. Cook spread the field in such a way to allow or even encourage Finn to bowl some short deliveries. Which he duly did.</p> <p>There was a hint of venom but not much happened in almost three overs. In came Finn again and Silva attempted to whip a shortish ball on the leg side. A leading edge flew skywards and Jonny Bairstow caught the ball. Perhaps Silva had been duped by extra pace. However Finn\u2019s anxiety was not yet over. Umpire Dar knew that a large left boot was close to overstepping; Finn knew that too. It transpired that the ball was legal by virtue of the odd millimetre. Finn\u2019s reaction to this news was more relief than unfettered celebration as the decision to bend his back in an uncomplicated, old-fashioned way was vindicated.</p> <p>It would be neat if this moment had triggered a startling transformation. But that was not quite the case. Finn bowled three more overs in this spell as quickly as he could, offering a greater threat than earlier in the day. There were two overs more just before the close; no more wickets but he had made a contribution.</p> <p>However, it would be an exaggeration to say that he had suddenly rediscovered his form. It should not be taken for granted that he will be selected in the final XI at Lord\u2019s. This might prompt howls of protest from the bowlers\u2019 union.</p> <p>How is it that a bowler can be dispensed with in such a perfunctory manner while batsmen are often retained after what seems to be a longer sequence of failure in which their form has gone awol?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/29/england-sri-lanka-second-test-day-three-match-report\">Kaushal Silva and Angelo Mathews lead Sri Lanka fightback against England</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is, in fact, a logic here that is hard to bear for perspiring, frustrated bowlers. When a batsman fails the evidence is scanty; often he is not there long enough to provide it. And he is, almost inevitably, \u201chitting the ball beautifully in the nets\u201d.</p> <p>The unfortunate bowler rarely has that escape clause. Usually he has bowled enough overs to demonstrate that everything is not quite in perfect working order. Hence the selectors are more inclined towards change, a gloomy thought for bowlers on the first day of the series when the English ones have been defiantly blunted by the Sri Lankans.</p>",

      "body": "<p>As fans of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/11/david-bowie-dies-at-the-age-of-69\" title=\"\">David Bowie</a>, Prince and Lemmy can attest, death is not the end in contemporary culture. Those who achieve true fame are waved through the pearly gates of marketing heaven, immortalised as a product, a brand \u2013 and, on occasion, a spectral arbiter in the battles of the terrestrial plane.</p> <p>In 2016, the ultimate celebrity endorsement is posthumous. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/07/margaret-thatcher-would-have-voted-stay-in-eu-lord-powell\" title=\"\">remain</a> and the <a href=\"http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/2016/02/sorry-but-margaret-thatcher-would-not-have-voted-to-stay-in-the-eu/\" title=\"\">leave</a> campaigns have both claimed that Margaret Thatcher would have supported their respective arguments in the EU referendum. The same treatment has been meted out to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2016/may/09/churchill-would-have-voted-remain-eu-cameron-johnson\" title=\"\">Churchill</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/21/how-love-eu-count-william-shakespeare-remain-brexit\" title=\"\">even Shakespeare</a>.</p> <p>In this respect the trail was blazed by the world\u2019s great religions, which routinely claim recruits among the dying. Indeed, the faithful have form when it comes to falsifying deathbed conversions \u2013 notoriously so in the case of Darwin. In 1915 the evangelist Elizabeth Cotton, better known as <a href=\"http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/ladyhope.html\" title=\"\">Lady Hope of Carriden</a>, declared that the great scientist, readying himself for the end in April 1882, had repudiated his life\u2019s work (\u201cHow I wish I had not expressed my theory of evolution as I have done\u201d) and asked her to gather an audience so he could \u201cspeak to them of Christ Jesus and His salvation\u201d.</p> <p>This was preposterous, and quickly dismissed as such. Darwin\u2019s daughter, Henrietta Litchfield, was with her father at his deathbed and insisted that Lady Hope had not even visited him during his last illness. None of his family believed a word of her testimony.</p> <p>Almost as flimsy is the Catholic church\u2019s claim that Antonio Gramsci returned to the faith and died taking the sacraments. Though a former Vatican official maintained that the Marxist philosopher <a href=\"http://martininthemargins.blogspot.co.uk/2008/12/gramsci-secret-catholic-humanist.html\" title=\"\">embraced Catholicism</a> afresh shortly before his death in Rome in 1937, none of the official or personal documents relating to his last days support this extraordinary account.</p> <p>It is in this context that one should consider the meretricious new book by Larry Alex Taunton, <a href=\"http://larryalextaunton.com/books/the-faith-of-christopher-hitchens/\" title=\"\">The Faith of Christopher Hitchens: The Restless Soul of the World\u2019s Most Notorious Atheist</a>.</p> <p>The religious knew that it was worth claiming the spiritual scalps of the founding father of evolution theory and of Italy\u2019s pre-eminent Marxist. In our own era, a resourceful Alabamian evangelist is exploiting his friendship with Hitchens, who <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/16/christopher-hitchens-obituary\" title=\"\">died in 2011</a>, to allege that the author of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/jun/03/society\" title=\"\">God Is Not Great</a>: How Religion Poisons Everything was, in fact, on a secret spiritual journey and halfway to embracing Jesus.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hitchens knew the difference between an atheist and an ignoramus</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cA lifetime of rebellion against God,\u201d Taunton writes, \u201chad brought him to a moment where he was staring into the depths of eternity, teetering on the edge of belief\u201d. Before long, \u201cthere was a slow but steady warming trend toward the very Christianity that he had for so long excoriated as a noxious relic of humanity\u2019s infantile past\u201d. Hitchens \u201cwas wading into Christian waters, getting more than his feet wet\u201d.</p> <p>There is so much wrong with this book that one hardly knows where to start. But its fundamental error concerns the nature of intellectual inquiry itself. For Taunton, there is only one such pursuit, and it is unidirectional: if you are interested in morality, you are, axiomatically, interested in religion \u2013 which, for a southern evangelical, means the gospels. When Hitchens observes that a child and a piglet are morally different, Taunton says that \u201cthis was unambiguous theism, as he well knew\u201d.</p> <p>Of course, Hitchens knew no such thing. For him, as for any atheist, morality did not need the framework of religion. Philosophy did not depend upon the supernatural, and ethics did not require a godhead to be worth discussing \u2013 a discussion that can be traced back at least as far as Socrates in Plato\u2019s\u00a0Euthyphro.</p> <p>At the heart of the book is a series of conversations between Hitchens and the author, partly conducted on long car journeys across America. Hitchens, stricken with cancer, makes use of the time with Taunton to study the Gospel of John. Unfortunately, this entirely characteristic curiosity is misinterpreted by the author as the first stage of a glorious conversion. \u201cAt the end of his life,\u201d Taunton writes, \u201cChristopher\u2019s searches had brought him willingly, if secretly, to the altar. Precisely what he did there, no one knows.\u201d No one knows because\u00a0he\u00a0wasn\u2019t there.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/24/atheists-faith-religion-uk\">Atheists don\u2019t need faith, any more than we need religion | Julian Baggini</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Taunton has not the slightest grasp of dialectics, which remained important to Hitchens until the end, or of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symposium_(Plato)\" title=\"\">Platonic symposium</a>, which was his ideal for living and for learning. His \u201ccordial interactions with evangelicals\u201d connoted a belief in pluralism and freedom of opinion, not emotional surrender to the pastors. \u201cHe had become an unlikely defender of the faith\u201d: no, he hadn\u2019t. He was engaged in \u201csurreptitious investigation of hidden spiritual questions\u201d: no,\u00a0he wasn\u2019t.</p> <p>Precisely because he despised claims to spiritual monopoly and fundamentalism in every form, Hitchens was intellectually omnivorous, an avid pupil of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/video/2016/jan/12/possible-gravitational-wave-discovery-could-open-a-new-window-on-universe-audio\" title=\"\">Lawrence Krauss</a> on cosmology, and entranced visitor to the Smithsonian\u2019s <a href=\"http://humanorigins.si.edu/exhibit\" title=\"\">Hall of Human Origins</a>. Taunton alleges that his friend \u201cnever really studied the great books and the great questions in real depth\u201d \u2013 a claim that is risible to anyone who has read Hitchens\u2019s literary essays. His love of the King James version is to be understood under this rubric \u2013 not as a symptom of faith\u2019s first stirrings. Hitchens knew the difference between an atheist and an ignoramus.</p> <p>It is tempting to write off this book as no more than an outburst of epic self-deception. But its craven purpose \u2013 to claim Hitchens posthumously for evangelical Christianity \u2013 is to defame a man who was a champion of the Enlightenment and an enemy of all systems of thought that elevate one caste (priestly, or otherwise) above the rest. It is a shoddy tactic in the culture wars that began in America but are spreading in battles over theocracy, identity and social uniformity.</p> <p>Far from being the double agent of the author\u2019s addled imagination, Hitchens incarnated the pluralism in which\u00a0he believed so passionately, revelling in the contradictions that are the hallmark of the authentically modern\u00a0self.</p> <p>He had no religion, other than friendship. Laughable in itself, Taunton\u2019s Judas kiss serves notice yet again that\u00a0the literalists of all faiths respect absolutely no limits in pursuit of their\u00a0higher cause.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/dec/01/christopher-hitchens-richard-dawkins\">Richard Dawkins | Christopher Hitchens is my hero of 2010</a> </p> </aside>",

A huge majority raised their hands. When asked, do they still have a favourable impression of him, very few remained up.</p> <p>Nevertheless, some questioned Bower\u2019s objectivity. The author said he had interviewed more than 200 people including 120 civil servants. \u201cEach had a mosaic of the story and putting them together I came up with what was an enormous surprise \u2013 it was a government of chaos, it was a government of failed ambition.\u201d</p> <p>The book argues that Blair worked hard to gain power but had no idea what to do with it when he got it. It was a government without ideology, Bower argues, and by the second term it was too late to get one as he was being weakened by Gordon Brown and was on the \u201ctreadmill to Iraq\u201d.<br /></p> <p>The book takes five subjects: health, education, immigration, energy and wars, and Bower argues Blair failed on every count.</p> <p>A huge contributor to Blair\u2019s success was his press secretary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/alastaircampbell\">Alastair Campbell</a>, who Bower said had a controlling influence over the British press.</p> <p>Campbell is used as source throughout, even though Bower did not speak to him. \u201cHe wrote four extraordinary and thick diaries. I thought I can\u2019t improve on that.\u201d</p> <p>It meant Bower could include brilliant anecdotes such as Blair, wearing yellow and green underpants, greeting Campbell and asking how many prime ministers \u201chave a body like this?\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThat is from Campbell\u2019s diaries,\u201d Bower admitted. \u201cThat\u2019s the thing, nobody reads them. I got them for a penny off Amazon.\u201d</p>",

      "headline": "Media Monkey: Martin Sorrell, dead lesbians and Thatcher matchmaking",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-30T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>\u2022 A strange future is sketched by a <a href=\"http://www.standard.co.uk/business/secrets-of-my-success-johnny-hornby-founder-of-the-parternship-a3257696.html\" title=\"\">Secrets of My Success piece</a> in the London Evening Standard by Johnny Hornby \u2013 founder of The &amp; Partnership, a marketing group 49% owned by Martin Sorrell\u2019s WPP \u2013 who after bluntly setting out his domestic priorities (\u201cI have five children and five horses, and the horses are slightly more important than the children\u201d) addresses the crucial issue of his status as one of the leading contenders to succeed the spry but senior Sorrell: \u201cthat\u2019s a race that won\u2019t happen,\u201d the former Labour party election adman firmly insists, \u201cand if it does, it probably won\u2019t be for another 15 years\u201d. So he envisages Sorrell stepping down, if at all, in 2031 when he\u2019s 86, a year older than Rupert Murdoch is now; by which time, Monkey very roughly estimates (extrapolating from recent increases), the miniature marketing colossus\u2019s total annual pay package should be around \u00a3285m.</p> <p>\u2022 How many lesbians have been killed on screen in primetime shows this year? Monkey can tell you it\u2019s 12. Not many, you might think, but with only 35 lesbian characters on peaktime shows in the UK and US last year that\u2019s quite a high number. Monkey knows this because former Channel 4 commissioner Jacqui Lawrence reveals the statistic in her pitch <a href=\"https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/different-for-girls#/\" title=\"\">to crowdfund \u00a350,000</a> on Indiegogo to get a screen adaptation of her novel Different For Girls into production. A number of actors have confirmed or expressed interest in being in it including Rachel Shelley from Grantchester and The L Word, Blue Peter and Doctor Who star Janet Ellis, Death in Paradise\u2019s Nimmy March and Emmerdale\u2019s Charlie Hardwick. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to be glib about this but in reality the constant \u2018disposal\u2019 of lesbian characters has an acute impact on younger viewers who are struggling with their sexuality. Television is literally getting away with murder,\u201d says Lawrence. \u201cDifferent for Girls is here to save the fate of fictional lesbians. You can rest assured that no lesbian will be killed or harmed during its making.\u201d Not unless one of them dies due to different kinds of L Words, she says, namely, \u201ctoo much love, lust and laughter\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 Today\u2019s newspaper editors tend to do their utmost to keep their private lives private, so it was a turn up for the books last week when City AM supremo Christian May <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChristianJMay\" title=\"\"> informed his Twitter followers </a> that \u201cif you see a shiny ring on @ElizaFilby\u2019s hand on @SkyNews later, it\u2019s because she\u2019s agreed to marry me\u201d. Politics looks to be a key thing the couple have in common - indeed Maggie Thatcher could be seen as their spiritual matchmaker \u2013 as Dr Filby is an academic and the author of God and Mrs Thatcher, while the PR man-turned-editor is associated with Thatcher-ish anti-state, pro-business views.</p> <p>\u2022 How did a maths don come to wake up last week to find a vast picture of herself (\u201cthe queen of the anoraks\u201d) on the front page of the Daily Telegraph, a space normally reserved for female royals and celebrities? <a href=\"https://twitter.com/FryRsquared?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">Dr Hannah Fry</a>, who also does some broadcasting (but mostly on radio), ostensibly owed her splash status to her involvement in BBC4\u2019s Trainspotting: Live; but this was an unsatisfactory explanation because (a) she will only provide expert back-up to frontman Peter Snow, (b) the show is not imminent but scheduled for some unspecified point in the future, and (c) the Telegraph seemed sheepish itself about its flimsy pretext for the pin-up pic, with its caption referring readers on to a \u201cfull story\u201d that turned out to be some barely rejigged bumf tellingly lacking a byline (its<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/22/bbc-commissions-slow-tv-like-live-trainspotting-show/\" title=\"\"> online version</a> fessed up by featuring a photo of trains, not Fry, and reflecting Snow\u2019s primacy). So we\u2019re left with a mystery worthy of The Curious Cases of Fry and Rutherford, the Radio 4 science series she co-presents; Monkey\u2019s hunch is that a Telegraph decree requires picture editors to put Poldark\u2019s Eleanor Tomlinson (a fellow-redhead whom Fry resembles) on the front whenever she pops up on a red carpet \u2013 and, amidst the current turmoil at the paper, someone either desperately decided a lookalike would do, or mixed them up and only discovered the mistake too late.</p>",

The development raised further hopes the Port Talbot plant in Kinnock\u2019s Aberavon constituency in south Wales and 11,000 jobs across the country can be saved.</p> <p>Sources close to Tata Steel said its owners were assessing the performance of the UK operation and the package of financial support made available by the government. At the same time it was continuing to run the sales process and has reportedly whittled down a field of seven bidders to a four-strong shortlist.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/25/tata-steel-is-considering-retaining-uk-business\">Tata Steel is considering retaining UK business</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But amid hopes of a U-turn on the planned sale, Kinnock said steelworkers would treat the news with scepticism and anger. He <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-36404580\">told BBC Radio Wales\u2019s Sunday Supplement programme</a>: \u201cIf that is the case, fine. If they do want to stay we would welcome that in principle.</p> <p>\u201cBut I would also say in practice steelworkers in my constituency, their families and communities around them have been through hell in the last few years and certainly since March when the sale was announced.\u201d </p> <p>Her added: \u201cI think they\u2019ll be forgiven for treating any news that Tata is staying on board with a degree of scepticism and even anger. So I think we need a very clear set of guarantees from Tata that they will be in it for the long run, that there will be investment and they will be doing what\u2019s needed so we\u2019re not back at square one 12 months from now.\u201d</p> <p>European steelmakers are under huge pressure from cheap Chinese exports, which have sent global steel prices plunging. But Tata\u2019s financial position has improved. On Wednesday, it group net losses of 32.1bn rupees (\u00a3325m) in the three months to 31 March, down from 56.7bn rupees in same quarter last year.</p> <p>Tata is nevertheless expected to complete the sale of its European long products division, which employs 4,800 people, to Greybull Capital for a token \u00a31 this week. About 4,400 workers are in the UK, mostly in Scunthorpe, with another 400 in France. </p> <p>A sign bearing the words British Steel \u2013 the new name for the business harking back to its former incarnation as a publicly owned industrial giant \u2013 is expected to be unveiled at the Scunthorpe plant on Wednesday, when it is handed over to its new owner, a little known investment family office. </p>",

      "body": "<p>So is your glass half full or half empty? That was the question asked of Katarina Johnson-Thompson after she achieved Olympic qualification at the prestigious G\u00f6tzis Hypo-Meeting in Austria on Sunday. The 23-year-old smiled back and insisted she is always a glass-half-full person and had seen \u201cglimpses\u201d of form that had delighted and excited her.</p> <p>Yet her score of 6,304 \u2013 nearly 400 points below her personal best \u2013 and particularly two very scratchy performances in the shot and the long jump were a jolting reminder that she has plenty to work on, too.</p> <p>\u201cThis is why people do a heptathlon before the big one,\u201d she said after finishing sixth behind the Canadian Brianne Theisen-Eaton, who won with 6,765 points. \u201cYou need to put one together to see exactly what you need to work on and I know I\u2019ve got another two metres in my shot put, another height in my high jump, definitely another 70cm in the long jump and my javelin I need to work on as well.\u201d</p> <p>Yet there were enough snatches of Johnson-Thompson\u2019s almost limitless potential, in particular personal bests in the 100m hurdles and a brilliant 22.79sec 200m on Saturday, to suggest that she could leave Rio with a gold medal round her neck. Certainly she believes there is plenty more in the tank.</p> <p>\u201cMy goal is definitely a gold medal still in Rio,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot to work on between now and then but this is my first time back after surgery and I know exactly what I need to work on.\u201d</p> <p>With two months to go before the Olympics begin Johnson-Thompson is clearly fit and very focused. But while there is little wrong with her body, she confesses her mind is still a work in progress.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/06/jessica-ennis-hill-withdraws-gotzis\">Jessica Ennis-Hill withdraws from G\u00f6tzis heptathlon meeting</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Johnson-Thompson started day two knowing the 6,200 points needed for Olympic qualification would be almost a certainty if she could land a half-decent long jump. But she was carrying baggage. At the world championships in Beijing in August last year she had fouled three times while in contention for a gold and the memories were still vivid.</p> <p>Her first effort was understandably tentative and she took off long before the board. When the scoreboard flashed a distance of 6.13m, nearly 80cm below her best, she seemed to laugh in embarrassment when the crowd whooped in appreciation.</p> <p>However, her subsequent two jumps left her grimacing and suggested that those mental demons from Beijing have not yet been fully exorcised. She was red\u2011flagged on her second jump and stuttered again before her third leap, which was only 6.17m. No wonder she had her head in her hands afterwards.</p> <p>\u201cI was sick especially in the first jump,\u201d said Johnson-Thompson, who was also wearing strapping on her left thigh as a precaution. \u201cI just didn\u2019t want to push and injure myself. After what happened last year I just wanted to stay uninjured.</p> <p>\u201cThe feeling is one of relief more than anything else. But I\u2019m not going to lie. There will be mental worries with the long jump before Rio but I know I can get through it. It\u2019s just getting my confidence back. I know I have a big jump in me. But the shot put is more of a concern. It\u2019s just the mental pressure of competition.\u201d</p> <p>Johnson-Thompson took it steady in the javelin, producing a below-par throw of 36.66m for 603 points before jogging round the 800m in 2min 16.81sec for 867 points. That was understandable. What she does here will be forgotten when Rio rolls round.</p> <p>There was less cheery news for Morgan Lake, Britain\u2019s other competitor in G\u00f6tzis. She, too, had been hoping to qualify for Rio but withdrew from the competition after the first day following a disappointing performance.</p> <p>She is still young at 19 and has time to improve but it will worry her and others in British Athletics that she has appeared to have stood still since bursting on to the scene two years ago.</p> <p>\u201cIt was always a gamble coming to G\u00f6tzis after missing a block of training due to injuries,\u201d Lake said. \u201cThis is not a reflection of where I know my potential and form is and I\u2019m sorry to let so many people down.</p> <p>\u201cDisappointed doesn\u2019t even come close to how I feel right now but it has made me even more determined to get the qualifying score and fight for my place in Rio.\u201d</p>",

Anckorn, he explained, is also the longest-serving member of the Magic Circle. </p> <p>The contestant explained that Anckorn performed magic tricks \u2013 including the one Jones had chosen for the final \u2013 for the guards as a way of getting food. As he reached the climax of his performance, Jones unveiled his surprise guest: 97-year-old Anckorn.</p> <p>\u201cWhat a respectful, appropriate time to do something like that,\u201d said Simon Cowell. \u201cAmazing. I salute you Fergus, thank you for everything you\u2019ve done.\u201d On being announced as the winner, Jones said: \u201cI can\u2019t believe it, thank you so much \u2013 it\u2019s been an incredible experience, it means the world to me.\u201d</p> <p>Magicians have been overjoyed at the win, with the Magic Circle, Britain\u2019s world-famous club of professional magicians, tweeting to say it was proud to see a member finally taking the \u00a3250,000 prize. He will now have the chance to perform at the Royal Variety Performance. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K786WSkT0xU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/K786WSkT0xU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Richard Jones on Britain\u2019s Got Talent</figcaption> </figure>   <p>But there has also been criticism that the 25-year-old had lifted some of the tricks he used in his other appearances on the programme, and his victory has led to a debate over the ethics of performance magic. </p> <p>While much of the general public imagines stage magicians come up with the tricks they do themselves, many are in fact designed by and bought from magic shops or dealers, said Duncan Trillo, publisher of <a href=\"http://www.magicweek.co.uk/\">Magic Week</a> magazine and a former practising stage magician.<br /></p> <p>Even those that are invented by their performers tend to be compilations of tricks that are already on the market. However, it is in the performance that magicians make a trick their own, and that ought to be respected, said Trillo.</p> <p>\u201cYou can buy tricks from magic shops and magic dealers \u2013 and that\u2019s what we\u2019ve seen on Britain\u2019s Got Talent,\u201d he said. \u201cRichard\u2019s bought tricks from magic dealers, but he\u2019s doing them in the same way we have seen others do.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cIf Damien Hirst cuts a cow in half I would respect that as an artist and not cut a pig in half.\u201d</p> <p>In a post on the Magic Week website, Trillo has compared the tricks Jones performed in both his Britain\u2019s Got Talent audition and the and semi-final tricks performed in previous years on America\u2019s Got Talent. In both cases there are close similarities. </p> <p>In the first, Jones performed a trick which made it seem as though he read the minds of celebrities on the talent show panel. A similar trick was performed by Oz Pearlman, a professional mentalist, on America\u2019s Got Talent in 2015.</p> <p>Then, in the second, Jones performed the apparently miraculous feat of transporting a page picked at random from a book into a bottle that was sitting in a gift box on the table in front of Simon Cowell as he performed the trick. The illusion, Trillo\u2019s post points out, was similar to one performed by 16-year-old Collins Key on America\u2019s Got Talent in 2014. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q63BIf9Xo2c\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/q63BIf9Xo2c?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Collins Key on America\u2019s Got Talent</figcaption> </figure>   <p>\u201cAs a professional you are left a bit flat by it,\u201d Trillo said. \u201cBut to be fair to Richard, he\u2019s an amateur, he\u2019s not a professional magician.\u201d</p> <p>The problem came when such tricks are performed in front of a mass audience who are not versed in the ins and outs of stage magic, Trillo said. \u201cWhen the public watch a magic trick they often credit the performer with being a creator,\u201d he said.<br /></p> <p>\u201cWe see a lot of the material [on Britain\u2019s Got Talent] where they are being credited, because the judges are saying \u2018oh, wow, it\u2019s so original\u2019, and that\u2019s simply because the judges haven\u2019t seen it before, not because it has not been done before.\u201d</p> <p>Despite the criticism, Trillo was supportive of Jones\u2019s win and said that he hoped to see more from him in the future. He said: \u201cMagicians wish Richard well, but we are kind of a bit disappointed that he did some tricks he\u2019s seen on YouTube. But that\u2019s partly how it all moves forward.</p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s done very well. He\u2019s not a professional magician and he went along and did his audition. I\u2019m sure he will do better things in the future.\u201d</p> <p>As he was announced winner on Britain\u2019s Got Talent, Jones also thanked the Magic Circle for his win. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it, thank you so much to everyone who voted, I can\u2019t believe it,\u201d he said on stage.<br /></p> <p>Jones defended accusations of trick theft when he appeared on ITV\u2019s Lorraine the day before the final, saying the controversy surrounding his earlier performance was good for magic, and that the personal take of a magician was what mattered. </p> <p>\u201cThe roots of some of the tricks that I did on the semi-finals stem back hundreds of years and I have adapted them and made them more modern for our public,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like a singer singing her own version of a song or a dancer doing her own style of dance.\u201d<br /></p>",

Peston\u2019s show is also beaten by Nicky Campbell\u2019s Big Questions which follows Marr on BBC1.</p> <p>It was always going to be an uphill task for the BBC\u2019s former economics editor who was given his own show when he signed a reported \u00a3350,000 deal to become ITV\u2019s new political editor last year, memorably <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jan/17/robert-peston-bbc-itv-news\" title=\"\">saying he wanted to \u201chumiliate\u201d the BBC</a> (and later regretting it).</p> <p>Viewers are not used to watching politics on ITV on Sunday \u2013 it is 10 years since Jonathan Dimbleby\u2019s show was axed and its replacement, The Sunday Edition, proved short-lived \u2013 and nearly 30 years since its Sunday lunchtime programme Weekend World.</p> <p>More recently its Sunday morning schedule has been filled with Jeremy Kyle repeats and reruns of The X Factor. So Peston wasn\u2019t just coming from a standing start; he was having to court viewers who had previously tuned in to watch Angela Lansbury in Murder, She Wrote.</p> <p>Vicky Flind, series editor of Peston on Sunday, says: \u201cWe are realistic. I am not getting overly anxious too early on about the ratings. I am very aware that 10am on Sunday morning on ITV has not been a political space for a very long time.\u201d</p> <p>Flind, former editor of BBC1\u2019s This Week with Andrew Neil, says: \u201cWhat I focus on is trying to create a really good and entertaining politics show that is distinctive in quite a crowded market. We want it to feel fresh and a little bit different, and to build it around Robert\u2019s character and personality. Nothing has been said or done since we have been on air to doubt that we are there for the long term. If we are given the time to do it we will have a good shot.\u201d</p> <p>The rival shows\u2019 impact can also be measured not only in viewing figures but how many quotes are generated online and in the following day\u2019s newspapers. Flind, whose guests so far have included David Cameron, George Osborne and Jeremy Corbyn, says: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to be noticed and we have been noticed.\u201d</p> <p>Former ITN chief executive Stewart Purvis says the Peston show is \u201call about the ITV brand. They are probably never going to win the ratings battle \u2013 they might not even accept they are in one \u2013 but what it does do is enhance the ITV brand in terms of the channel\u2019s appeal to upmarket viewers. It is something they can be proud of.\u201d</p> <p>All the more important, he adds, after the \u201cNews at When?\u201d saga and the axing of the Dimbleby show and World in Action. \u201cThe only shows MPs watch are news and current affairs programmes, so if you want to connect with policy makers you have to connect with them in terms of something they actually watch.\u201d</p> <p>ITV has used high-profile signings such as Peston and its latest, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/18/itv-news-in-talks-with-noreena-hertz-over-economics-editor-role\" title=\"\">new economics editor</a> Noreena Hertz, to take the fight to the BBC, which it will never be able to match in terms of funding. Former political editor Tom Bradby\u2019s switch to News at Ten was another example (although BBC1\u2019s 10pm news bulletin remains pre-eminent).</p> <p>The Andrew Marr Show averages 1.5 million in the year to date, up from 2014 (1.3m) but marginally down on 2012, when it had 1.6 million. There is a similar pattern for Andrew Neil\u2019s Sunday Politics, which averages 814,000 in the year so far, up on 2014 (664,000) but down on four years ago (884,000).</p> <p>Marr show editor, Rob Burley, says: \u201cI used to work on ITV\u2019s political programmes and I am genuinely glad ITV have decided to return to something they should be doing. It\u2019s good to have someone else in the marketplace who might book the guests you want, and it makes you work extra hard. I don\u2019t think we are competing, we are on at different times. We are a long-established show which is evolving.\u201d</p> <p>Both Purvis (\u201cI think it\u2019s really good. He is very conversational in his interviews, it really works\u201d) and former BBC executive Roger Mosey are fans of the Peston show. \u201cBoth Marr and Peston are very good shows,\u201d says Mosey. \u201cMarr is an indispensable part of Sunday morning, like Today on weekdays. Peston has made a confident, watchable start. He\u2019s settling in and Allegra [Stratton, signed from BBC2\u2019s Newsnight] is a good booking.\u201d</p> <p>Mosey would like to see Peston tackle the \u201cbig strategic choices that politicians have to make\u201d rather than be tempted by the \u201crelentless bombardment of the short term. Not quite Weekend World \u2013 it should definitely be modernised \u2013 but using Peston\u2019s brain and intelligence, as we see all the time in his blogs, to get something that\u2019s at a different level to everyday cut and thrust\u201d.</p> <p>But Sky News presenter Adam Boulton thinks the Sunday morning rivalry \u201ca really rather tired debate. I did a Sunday morning programme for 17 years. Basically what they do is manufacture Sunday for Monday quotes for the written press.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not criticising Robert or comparing him unfavourably to Andrew, and I have great admiration for Vicky [Flind] \u2026 but I think this is a vanity exercise by ITV.</p> <p>\u201cThey are trying to get back to the glory days of News at Ten when it was regarded as prestige news. Hats off for trying, but ITV deserted that land for a long time.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>One veteran political pundit calls it a \u201ccomplete shambles\u201d, while another says it is \u201can utter mess\u201d. With just weeks left before the EU referendum, tensions are running high between broadcasters and the politicians they want to wrangle on to our television screens to make sense of it all.</p> <p>It already seems a tad farcical even before David Cameron appears on Sky next weekend for his first official live EU debate show. The Vote Leave campaign has threatened ITV with both legal action and \u201cconsequences\u201d after the broadcaster <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/12/vote-leave-lambasts-itv-over-eu-debate-between-cameron-and-farage\" title=\"\">dared to invite Ukip\u2019s Nigel Farage</a> on the same show as Cameron. Even then, the two men will not stand face to face.</p> <p>The prime minister\u2019s own reported reluctance to get into a so-called \u201cblue-on-blue\u201d row with one of his own ministers has also left the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/feb/23/bbc-three-eu-referendum-debates-wembley-arena\" title=\"\">BBC having to schedule</a> not one but two Question Time specials with pro-Remain Cameron and pro-Brexit Gove in June.</p> <p>After David Dimbleby hosts these from the middle ground of Nottingham and Milton Keynes, the veteran presenter is to face some 6,000 people half-filling Wembley arena for the final live debate on 21 June.</p> <p>At the time of writing the BBC has no confirmed participants for this flagship event. Although Boris Johnson is rumoured to be keen, both prime minister and chancellor are believed to have ruled it out. As one seasoned BBC watcher told me: \u201cWe\u2019ll be left with some businessman and Kate Hoey. On primetime BBC1!\u201d</p> <p>None of this would matter if the stakes were not quite so high. If the odd dinner party and even, last weekend, a passionate debate with strangers in a pet shop in Sussex is anything to go by, the EU referendum is unlike any other recent election in that much of the electorate appears genuinely keen to find out what\u2019s going on before deciding.</p> <p>The woman behind the pet shop counter said she thought leaving the EU would be bad for her small business; her customer said she hated the idea of Brussels taking over. Both admitted being unsure of their facts and didn\u2019t trust the media.</p> <p>Research backs up such anecdotes says John Downey, director of Loughborough University\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.lboro.ac.uk/departments/socialsciences/research/centres/crc/\" title=\"\">centre for research into communication and culture</a>. \u201cLots of people are generally pretty confused,\u201d he says. \u201cThere have been some pretty extreme views on both sides and people don\u2019t know who to believe.\u201d</p> <p>As is always the case with British elections, newspapers are far more likely to show bias towards one side than highly regulated broadcasters. Research from the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism last week showed most articles in nine national newspapers backed leave while 27% of all articles, mainly in the Financial Times, Mirror and Guardian, supported remaining in the EU. Most newspaper groups have attempted to show both sides but as with all difficult arguments, those who shout loudest tend to get heard most.</p> <p>The hysterical nature of the debate so far, more likely to invoke Isis, Hitler and the horsemen of the apocalypse than use rational argument, is not helping.</p> <p>At this stage it is too early to say what the entire coverage will be like, but it is clear that the pressures facing broadcasters are great.</p> <p>Cameron\u2019s irritation at the way the election debates were handled is understood to have led to briefings against the BBC and the renewal of its royal charter almost straight after he was was elected.</p> <p>Relations between No 10 and the all-broadcaster working group became so strained over the timing and line-up of the live debates in 2015 that this time the broadcasters decided to go it alone. So far this doesn\u2019t seem to have helped.</p> <p>Not least it has done nothing to broaden a debate held entirely between older white men. A Loughborough study last week found that women, who account for half of the population, and ethnic minorities have been marginalised. Not just in broadcast reports but in newspapers where women contribute just 9% of mentions. Three Conservative men \u2013 Johnson and Cameron with George Osborne in third \u2013 account for 25% of all news sources identified in referendum coverage in its study of two weeks in the media.</p> <p>The odds are better when it comes to TV journalists, whether with Sky\u2019s Kay Burley and Faisal Islam, or Julie Etchingham hosting both ITV debates. The BBC now has a series with Victoria Derbyshire talking to 18-29 year olds, also largely absent so far.</p> <p>With so much at stake for politicians and broadcasters it is little wonder they want to either throw their weight around or play it safe. It is still early days and David Dimbleby shouting \u201cI can\u2019t hear you Wembley\u201d could yet turn out to be the UK equivalent of Frost/Nixon.</p> <p>But if not, the UK needs to rethink its snotty attitude to having a broadcasting commission set out the parameters for all-important national debates. For the whole country, and not just a handful of ageing white men.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-30T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Zanny Minton Beddoes\u2019 office may have a worn and old-fashioned feel, indeed it wouldn\u2019t be surprising if it turned out it hasn\u2019t had a makeover since the Economist\u2019s arrival in 1964, but she couldn\u2019t be more focused on the shiny digital future.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want to be the grandpa at the disco,\u201d says Minton Beddoes, the first female editor in the business magazine\u2019s 173-year history. \u201cThe bedrock of this place is the weekly Economist but in the 21st century that is no longer enough.\u201d</p> <p>Building the Economist brand on social media, bearing in mind that nearly all content is behind a paywall, has been a major preoccupation since Beddoes took the reins last February. When she arrived there was just a single social media staffer, now there are nine; seven in the UK and one each in North America and Asia.</p> <p>\u201cIt became clear to us that we needed to have a real social media push,\u201d she says, citing more than 36 million social media \u201cfollowers\u201d, from Twitter and Facebook likes, to LinkedIn and Google+ circle members. \u201cMuch of that has happened in the last year. It\u2019s a gift horse really,\u201d she enthuses. \u201cIt is a way of telling people what you are doing, drawing in new subscribers. We have to be ourselves in social media. What does it mean to be the Economist on social media? I think a lot of what is characteristic of the Economist, its brevity and analysis, works very well actually. A very small number of articles, including the cover leader, are in front of the paywall [but] we tweet a huge number of articles.\u201d</p> <p>There has also been a bolstering of multimedia staff and output which includes Economist Radio, under Anne McElvoy, Economist TV and newly-minted Economist Film, which will produce 22 short documentary films this year, with titles including Drone Rangers and Drugs: War or Store?. \u201cWe are trying things editorially,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re not turning into a video company but I\u2019m a real believer that we need to try new stuff and measure how it works.\u201d</p> <p>The conversation seems incongruous given Minton Beddoes\u2019 spartan, dated office which includes an ancient screen, impossible to identify as either a computer or TV, on a window ledge gathering dust. Perhaps it was her predecessor John Micklethwait\u2019s, now at Bloomberg News, who also left behind a framed note from the 33 miners trapped for 69 days underground in Chile. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those buildings where the sartorial quality decreases the higher up you go,\u201d she quips, referring to the mix of corporations that occupy the floors below. \u201cIt\u2019s hedge fund, hedge fund, hedge fund, Fiat Chrysler [then] wonderfully scruffy journalists.\u201d</p> <p>She can look forward to an upgrade as the Economist is hunting for a new home after selling its London editorial office in St James\u2019s for around \u00a3130m in February (the commercial operation is in Canary Wharf).</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ll stay in central London. We won\u2019t go anywhere that editorial doesn\u2019t want to go,\u201d she says, adding that the building\u2019s 200 staff are \u201ccompletely squashed\u201d. \u201cWe need a new kind of space. This building is fantastic but it is not the perfect building for being a 21st-century media organisation.\u201d</p> <p>The decision to move formed part of the deal in which Pearson offloaded its 50% stake in the Economist Group to existing shareholders for \u00a3469m in cash last August. That change of ownership meant Exor, the investment company led by John Elkann, heir to the Fiat business a few floors below Minton Beddoes\u2019 office, become the biggest shareholder with a 43.4% stake. The deal included a 20% voting cap for any individual shareholder to safeguard the independence of the company.</p> <p>The biggest change in ownership in 58 years came months after she became editor, and only a year after her return to the UK, first as business affairs editor, after two decades in the US. \u201cFor me it was quite a time,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has turned out extraordinarily well. For a long time [Pearson selling] had been a big question \u2026 but it wasn\u2019t anything that I anticipated. It was not expected, at least by me.\u201d</p> <p>She adds that the Elkann family empire, which has interests including Juventus football club and the publishers of Corriere della Sera, a leading Italian daily newspaper, and Turin daily La Stampa, is a benign and committed shareholder. \u201c[They] are engaged but totally respectful of editorial independence,\u201d she says of Exor. \u201cThey are very committed to media and the future of premium media. There are not that many global media brands of quality. We are smaller than many but we are a pretty powerful global media brand.\u201d</p> <p>The 48-year old, who early in her career worked as an IMF economist alongside Jeffrey Sachs before joining the magazine in 1994, has also taken an \u201cevolution not revolution\u201d approach to updating the Economist\u2019s editorial.</p> <p>This has included introducing more \u201cbig ideas\u201d reporting, such as its exploration of assisted suicide and the right to die. About half the covers in the last year have been \u201cnon-news\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018viewspaper\u2019 idea,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m deeply liberal. I\u2019m passionate about pushing that agenda. Social liberalism ... as well as economic and financial liberalism.\u201d</p> <p>The most popular edition in years was the Economist\u2019s anti-Brexit edition, which she says was a newsstand sell-out. \u201cWe came out very early and clearly with where we stood on Brexit. By a long shot it was our best-performing cover. It wasn\u2019t a sell-out because of our position. It was a sell-out because people really want a detailed, fact-based analysis. And that is what it was.\u201d</p> <p>Despite this success, as at other publishers print sales at the Economist have fallen across the globe, although the circulation still stands at 1.25m copies a week. Digital edition sales have broken through the 300,000 mark, up by 50% or more year-on-year in most markets, including the UK but not North and South America. Minton Beddoes says the print decline is in part to do with a \u201cdrive to quality\u201d - getting rid of bulk copies and converting readers to paid subscribers.</p> <p>\u201cThe overall circulation is slightly down but the profitability of our circulation is rising and print is still holding up remarkably well,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m completely agnostic [about whether] people read print or digital, I really want them to have a premium subscription giving them access to both.\u201d The Economist is still willing to embrace the potential of print, as is shown by it launching 1843, a bi-monthly magazine (which replaced Intelligent Life) aimed at the \u201cglobally curious\u201d which aims to speak to them \u201cwhen they have their feet up, on a weekend break, on holiday\u201d.</p> <p>Minton Beddoes says the Economist is not feeling the same extreme pressure as advertising-reliant newspaper publishers. \u201cI\u2019m very simple about this. You make money out of things people pay for,\u201d she says. \u201cSubscriptions is the bulk of our business, ads are nice to have on top of that. We are in the midst of a massively changing disrupted industry and that is incredibly exciting but it is also challenging. There are going to be winners in that and losers. It is foolish for anyone to be complacent. I am confident and hopeful and paranoid at the same time.\u201d</p> <p>So, nearly 18 months in, how does she feel about breaking the glass ceiling of being the first female editor of the Economist? \u201cLots of people ask me about how I feel about being the first woman editor,\u201d she says. \u201cThe answer is that I\u2019m thrilled to be doing this job and my main priority is to do it as well as I can. I can\u2019t wait for the day when it is no longer newsworthy that a woman is appointed editor of a newspaper.\u201d</p> <h2>Curriculum vitae</h2> <p><strong>Age </strong>48</p> <p><strong>Education</strong> Moreton Hall school, St Hilda\u2019s College, Oxford (PPE) Harvard University (Kennedy scholar)</p> <p><strong>Career 1990</strong> adviser to minister of finance in Poland <strong>1992</strong> economist, International Monetary Fund <strong>1994</strong> emerging-markets correspondent, the Economist <strong>1996</strong> US economics correspondent <strong>2007</strong> economics editor <strong>2014</strong> business affairs editor <strong>2015</strong> editor-in-chief</p>",

To preach beauty and show beauty helps neutralise aggression,\u201d said the pope, sharing a table and laughing along with the video bloggers.</p> <p>The 50-minute meeting addressed a wide range of topics including extremism, identity and Diego Maradona \u2013 with the pope dodging a question about whether the footballer\u2019s \u201chand of God\u201d goal during the 1986 World Cup was truly an act of divine intervention.</p> <p>The pontiff instead advised the videomakers to help those of their followers who feel lost. \u201cYou can create a virtual identity; you belong to this circle at least virtually. From that you can start taking a path of optimism and hope,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The YouTube personalities were invited to the Vatican from six continents and included Hayla Ghazal, whose comedy clips from Dubai are aimed at changing attitudes to women in the Middle East, and Dulce Candy, a Mexican-American who crossed the US border illegally as a young child.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/immigration\">Migration</a> was a common theme of the audience, with the pope saying he would never forget the wire fence he saw dividing the US and Mexico during a visit to the border in September.<br /></p> <p>He also celebrated an Italian child who a day earlier had drawn a picture of children inviting a migrant to join their football game, while criticising European politicians for failing to create healthy policies that promote integration.</p> <p>Touching on extremism, Francis said such groups were not a symptom of one particular faith: \u201cIn all religions there is also a group of fundamentalists that believe they are the holders of the truth.\u201d</p> <p>The pope concluded the meeting by thanking the participants for \u201cgiving me some of your youth as a gift\u201d, marking the latest bid by the Vatican to reach out to young people online.</p> <p>In March the papal Instagram account was launched \u2013 under the Latin name \u201c<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/franciscus/\">franciscus</a>\u201d \u2013 garnering 2.5 million followers of images and videos of the pope. Opening up to Instagram followed a February meeting between Francis and the company\u2019s chief executive, Kevin Systrom, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BCP_SbOgBDr/\">who described the moment</a> as one of the most memorable experiences of his life.</p> <p>The Vatican\u2019s digital-first strategy was already evident at the start of 2016 when the pope welcomed the former chief executive of Google, Eric Schmidt, to the heart of the Catholic Church. </p> <p>Despite the Vatican\u2019s enthusiasm for social media, the current pope has described himself as a tech dinosaur and warned Catholics against putting their smartphones before real relationships. But he has also promoted the internet as a \u201cgift from God\u201d and a force for good; an approach he will likely take to the church\u2019s World Youth Day in Poland this July.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Concern is growing that the United Nations is backtracking on plans to use airdrops to send food and urgent medicine to besieged towns in Syria, amid indications that the organisation believes the tactic is too dangerous without the support of the Syrian government.<br /></p> <p>A meeting of the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/17/syria-vienna-meeting-agrees-aid-airdrops-but-fails-to-set-date-for-talks\"> International Syria Support Group (ISSG) on 17 April in Vienna said it would start airdrops</a> from 1 June if Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government continued to block World Food Programme aid and prevent land convoys reaching besieged areas. </p> <p>The decision was passed unanimously by the 20-plus countries in the ISSG, including the US and Russia, and was hailed as a breakthrough by the British foreign secretary, Phillip Hammond. </p> <p>The ISSG statement said that sieges of civilian populations in Syria were \u201ca violation of international humanitarian law\u201d, highlighting the UN\u2019s inability to provide any assistance to Arbeen, Darayya, Douma, East Harasta, Moadamiyah, Zabadin and Zamalka.</p> <p>But with the deadline only two days away, it now appears that the UN has decided the project is too risky without the active cooperation of the government in Damascus, which, along with Russia, controls Syrian airspace.</p> <p>There have been longstanding concerns, including among aid agencies, that airdrops released from a great height either miss their target, are seized by Syrian government forces or simply expose UN-contracted aircraft to the risk of an attack by the Syrian air force.</p> <p>Airdrops have been conducted mainly in Deir ez-Zor with the support of the Russians, and all sides accept that land convoys are preferable.</p> <p>The UN special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, appeared to backtrack on airdrops at a press conference last week, the day before he announced no further peace talks were possible for at least three weeks due to the breakdown in the cessation of hostilities.</p> <p>He said: \u201cIt is clear from the briefing that we got that in order for airdrops to become concrete either by delivery at high altitude or by helicopters, there is a need for the cooperation of the government of Syria.\u201d</p> <p>But critics say experience has shown the Syrian government will not provide authority for airdrops to cities that it has under siege. </p> <p>The apparent reversal was condemned by the former Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown, who said: \u201cThe deadline set by the ISSG poses a serious question. Are the words of the international community meant to mean anything? We would all much rather airdrops did not have to be contemplated \u2013 they are complex operations \u2013 but if the 1 June deadline passes without ground convoys getting in then the UK has to see that the international commitment to the people of Syria is fulfilled. Not only are lives on the line, so is the credibility of the ISSG.\u201d</p> <p>Jason McCartney, the Conservative MP for Colne Valley and a former RAF officer, said: \u201cWe are at the stage of last resort where airdrops \u2013 however imperfect \u2013 are the only way to save lives.\u201d</p> <p>Jo Cox, the Labour MP who has raised the issue of airdrops most consistently, said: \u201cIf the words of the foreign secretary and the international community don\u2019t turn to action, if we don\u2019t see aid getting in by road or by air, then we\u2019ve reached a new low making empty promises to starving children.\u201d </p>",

They snapped it up for \u00a39.50. </p> <p>But the true value of their purchase was yet to become clear. It was only after cleaning the machine at Bletchley Park, where the museum is based, that they found it was a genuine military issue teleprinter, complete with swastika detailing and even a special key for the runic Waffen-SS insignia. </p> <p>Together with the cipher machine from Norway, the teleprinter almost completes the museum\u2019s set of encryption, interception and decryption equipment, which will allow them to tell from beginning to end the tale of how the allies broke Germany\u2019s secret codes.</p> <p>Having heard the story of the teleprinter\u2019s discovery on the BBC on Sunday, two former pupils of a school in Finchley, north London, have raised hopes of finding the drive motor. One said he would never forget seeing one on a cabinet in the the headmaster\u2019s office while he was being caned.</p> <p>Another said there had been a Lorenz machine in the head\u2019s classroom. The NMC is chasing down the leads. </p> <p>More complex than the famous Enigma code, the Lorenz cipher could be broken only thanks to the mathematician Bill Tutte, who deduced the architecture of a Lorenz machine without ever having seen one. </p> <p>Solving the problem also led to the creation of Colossus, the world\u2019s first programmable computer, which Tommy Flowers, a Post Office engineer, invented to work out the wheel positions on the Lorenz encryption machine and reduce the time taken to decrypt messages from weeks to hours. </p> <p>The decoding of the top-secret Lorenz messages is credited with shortening the war and saving countless lives. \u201cIt was the highest possible level of security used by the German high command,\u201d Whetter said.</p> <p>It was thanks to the breakthroughs by Tutte and Flowers that allied commanders could be certain Hitler\u2019s high command had bought their bluff that the D-Day invasion force would be landing at Calais, rather than on the beaches of Normandy. </p> <p>The museum is hoping to recreate the encryption and decryption process at a special event on Friday. </p>",

But I think women need to look beautiful and feel confident.\u201d<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/07/muslim-lifestyle-expo-london-global-brands-spending-power\">Muslim Lifestyle Expo in London highlights largely untapped market</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sadeeq had come to the <a href=\"http://saverahwomenexpo.co.uk\">Saverah Women Expo</a>, at the Intercontinental hotel next to London\u2019s O2 Arena, along with about 5,000 others. The event was to showcase Muslim businesses aimed at women: modest fashion, halal cosmetics, jewellery, greetings cards and chocolates for Ramadan. Muslim charities, banks and solicitors were present, and motivational talks were on the schedule.<br /></p> <p>The expo was also about \u201cempowering Muslim women. We have a voice and a lifestyle, we start businesses, we don\u2019t fit the stereotype,\u201d said Shazia Ramzan, a spokeswoman for Saverah.<br /></p> <p>About 90 businesses were exhibiting at the event, including dozens of international and UK fashion designers. \u201cModest fashion has been a phenomenon elsewhere, especially in the Gulf, for a while, and now it\u2019s becoming more of a statement here,\u201d said Ramzan.<br /></p> <p>The global Muslim clothing market is forecast to be worth $327bn by 2020, according to the latest <a href=\"http://www.dinarstandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Fashion-SGIE-Report-2015.png\">Global Islamic Economy report</a>. International retailers such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/mar/31/if-i-want-to-buy-a-burkini-from-ms-i-bloody-well-will\">Marks and Spencer</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jul/01/uniqlo-hana-tajima-modest-wear-fashion-hijabs\">Uniqlo</a> have launched ranges aimed at Muslim women.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"79e1773c29747d661cb55d04e049a840e195b57d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/79e1773c29747d661cb55d04e049a840e195b57d/0_0_7360_4418/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The catwalk at Saverah Women 2016.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The catwalk at Saverah Women 2016.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Farheen Rahman, a designer based in Kolkata who trained at the London College of Fashion, had returned to the UK to show her range of modest clothing for the first time.<br /></p> <p>\u201cThis is my debut show. Only in the past year have I been thinking about Islamic clothing,\u201d she said. \u201cI see girls and young women wanting to be fashionable but also wanting to be modest. Until recently they had to compromise on one or the other.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Another factor in the growth of modest fashion was rising disposable incomes among young Muslims, Rahman added. \u201cYou see this very clearly in India, where spending power used to be the preserve of the elite, but now the middle class has risen up.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Twins Ranna and Rasha Ahmed, who launched their label Hijab Star less than a year ago, also pointed to a generational shift. \u201cYoung Muslim women of our generation are much more interested in fashion than our mothers,\u201d said Ranna.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a5229fda59bd535222fd28173a79fba60730793\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a5229fda59bd535222fd28173a79fba60730793/0_173_7002_4203/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Saverah Women Expo\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">90 businesses exhibited at the event.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christian Sinibaldi for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the catwalk, elegant models showed off outfits ranging from skinny trousers paired with close-fitting tunics and minimal hijabs to stunning all-encompassing black abayas with elaborate veils.<br /></p> <p>Watching the show, Nadia Amdanee said: \u201cI\u2019m French and I like to be fashionable, but I also know the limits my religion imposes. Now it\u2019s possible to be really distinctive and stylish while being true to your faith.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Not everyone at the expo was set on modesty. Zahra Pederson, who runs a personal training service called <a href=\"http://www.thehealthyhijab.com\">the Healthy Hijab</a>, was gathering signatures in support of a campaign, Faces of Muslimah, to be launched after Ramadan to celebrate diversity among Muslim women.<br /></p> <p>\u201cMy religion is in my heart, not how I look,\u201d she said, wearing an outfit considerably more revealing than most at the show. \u201cIf you look at me, you wouldn\u2019t know I\u2019m a Muslim. But I pray five times a day, and I\u2019ll fast over Ramadan. You can\u2019t judge my actions on what I look like.\u201d<br /></p>",

      "body": "<p>The UK\u2019s referendum on membership of the EU is first and foremost a matter for the citizens of the UK, but it also has a major impact on other communities in the country, in particular more than 600,000 citizens of the Irish Republic. The Irish live, work, run businesses and pay taxes in Britain. The Irish in the UK have the right and privilege to vote in the referendum and we encourage them to do so in the firm belief that both the UK and Ireland strongly benefit from their own and each other\u2019s membership of a prosperous, co-operating EU.</p> <p>The British and Irish economies are closely interlinked within the EU \u2013 Britain being Ireland\u2019s largest export market and Ireland the UK\u2019s fifth largest market \u2013 made easier by the fact that both adhere to common EU standards, a situation that could be challenged if the UK ceased to apply these. The fact that both the UK and Ireland are members of the EU was \u2013 and is \u2013 a hugely important factor in the continuing success of the peace process in Northern Ireland, which has abolished the once heavily policed border with the Republic.</p> <p>The Common Travel Area has since 1923 provided for passport-free travel between the two countries and allows the citizens of each country to live and work in the other. However, this is a bilateral agreement between Britain and Ireland and subject to alteration by either side. It could be threatened if the UK were to restrict the rights of EU citizens, including those from the continent who would continue to enjoy free movement to and within Ireland. Our common membership of the EU has helped the UK and Ireland to become friends and stay friends. We strongly believe that this is something worth voting for, and encourage Irish citizens in the UK to register to vote before 7 June and to vote for the UK to remain in Europe on 23 June.<br /><strong>Ronan Dunne</strong> <em>Chief executive officer, Telefonica UK (O2)</em><br /><strong>Peter Sutherland</strong> <em>Former European commissioner and founding director general of the WTO</em><br /><strong>Richard Corrigan</strong> <em>Chef/patron of Corrigan\u2019s Mayfair, Bentley\u2019s Oyster Bar and Grill and Bentley\u2019s Sea Grill in Harrods</em><br /><strong>Dermott Rowan</strong> <em>CEO, Kiely Rowan plc</em><br /><strong>Angela Brady</strong> <em>Architect and past president of Riba</em><br /><strong>Donagh O\u2019Sullivan</strong> <em>Managing director, Galliard Homes Limited</em><br /><strong>Paul Costelloe</strong> <em>Fashion designer</em><br /><strong>John Griffin</strong> <em>Founder of Addison Lee and chairman of Irish TV</em><br /><strong>John Purcell</strong> <em>MD, Purcell &amp; Co</em><br /><strong>Elgin Loane</strong> <em>Owner and publisher, the Irish Post</em><br /><strong>Liz Shanahan</strong> <em>Chair of Reconfiguration &amp; Engagement Partners and chair of Irish International Business Network, Irish4Europe</em><br /><strong>Grainne Mellon</strong> <em>Garden Court Chambers and chair of London Irish Lawyers Association, Irish4Europe</em><br /><strong>Brian O\u2019Connell</strong> <em>Former RTE London Editor, Irish4Europe</em><br /><strong>Frank O\u2019Hare</strong> <em>Director of Doveguard Construction Ltd, Irish4Europe </em><br /><strong>Rory Godson</strong> <em>Chief executive, Powerscourt, Irish4Europe</em><br /><strong>Claire Tighe</strong> <em>SDLP Westminster office manager, Irish4Europe</em><br /><strong>James Winston</strong> <em>Director of Champ, Irish4Europe</em><br /><strong>Peter Millar</strong> <em>Sunday Times correspondent, Irish4Europe</em><br /><strong>Michael Forde</strong> <em>Founder of Irish World Heritage Centre, Irish4Europe</em><br /><strong>Laura Sandys</strong> <em>Chair of European Movement, Irish4Europe</em><br /><strong>Matthew Fulton</strong> <em>Chief operating officer, European Movement, Irish4Europe</em><br /><strong>Michael Collins</strong> <em>Senior banking manager of British Irish trade, Allied Irish Bank</em><br /><strong>P\u00f3l \u00d3 M\u00f3r\u00e1in</strong> <em>Member of Irish government\u2019s Export Trade Council and board member of the Irish International Business Network</em><br /><strong>Ross Finegan</strong> <em>Partner, Lonsdale Capital Partners</em><br /><strong>Andy Rogers</strong> <em>Consultant, KSG KMCO PDSA, and principal, Rogers Associates Ltd</em><br /><strong>Gerry Collins</strong> <em>Partner, ECOVIC Wingrave Yeats</em><br /><strong>Mary McKenna</strong> <em>Northern Irish technology entrepreneur and angel investor</em><br /><strong>Kenneth King</strong> <em>CEO, Transformativ Project Consulting Limited</em><br /><strong>Pat Butler</strong> <em>Non-executive director at Bank of Ireland and Hikma Pharmaceuticals; chairman of Investment Committee at British Business Bank</em><br /><strong>Mary Daly</strong> <em>Senior relationship manager, Allied Irish Bank (GB)</em></p> <p>\u2022 Don\u2019t be fooled by the clamour to stay in Europe.

They deserve better.<br /><strong>Joe Brennan</strong><br /><em>Ballinspittle, County Cork, Ireland</em></p> <p>\u2022 Some of the most persistent myths surrounding Brexit concern the size and aims of the EU secretariat, which is, according to one of your correspondents (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/26/there-is-a-principled-leftwing-case-for-brexit\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 27 May), a \u201cvast bureaucratic machine peddling an American neoliberal agenda\u201d. The secretariat is actually tiny. The number of civil servants at the European commission is 33,000; at the European parliament, 6,000; and at the council of the European Union, 3,500. At a total of 42,500, it is about a tenth of the size of the UK civil service in 2015: 439,000 in total or 406,000 full-time equivalents. In fact the EU employs fewer people than many UK departments on their own; two thirds of HMRC (60,900 full-time equivalents) or the Ministry of Defence (56,800), and less than half the Department for Work and Pensions (81,200).</p> <p>Moreover, having worked there for a short while, I can confirm that European civil servants are not heartless American stooges promoting unrestrained capitalism. Yes, they do want to make the single market work better \u2013 something that I suspect most people in the UK would like to see, whether pro- or anti-EU. But they also spend a lot of time on developing workers\u2019 rights and environmental sustainability \u2013 neither prominent on the neoliberal agenda. More generally, as individuals coming from all the nations of Europe, they are committed to making the international experiment that is the European Union work. That noble experiment should not be derailed by nonsense concerning hordes of faceless bureaucrats serving a vast impersonal machine.<br /><strong>Professor Julian Le Grand</strong><br /><em>Marshall Institute, London School of Economics</em></p> <p>\u2022 Yanis Varoufakis (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/commentisfree/2016/may/28/brexit-empire-era-trick-radical-case-for-europe-lucas-mcdonnell-democracy-eu\" title=\"\">The radical reason for voting to stay in</a>, 28 May) has not understood the concern that thinking Brexiters have about uncontrolled immigration from the EU. It is not a temporary and manageable strain on public services. It is that if ONS and Eurostat projections are realised, even in part, England, which is already more densely populated than the Netherlands, would have to build the infrastructure to accommodate several million more people.<br /><strong>Stephen Plowden</strong><br /><em>London </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-30T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>During the Champions League final Gary Lineker posted a simple five-word tweet: \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/GaryLineker/status/736653609358766084\">Pepe is such a dick</a>!\u201d It did not so much strike a chord as create global symphonic harmony on social media. More than 50,000 retweets and likes later, and following yet more devious behaviour by the Real Madrid defender, Lineker clarified his position. \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/GaryLineker/status/736669166040682496\">Pepe is an enormous dick!</a>\u201d That tweet proved to be even more popular. How could it not be, given Pepe\u2019s outrageously hammy behaviour?</p> <p>One scene in particular should earn him a golden raspberry. What appeared to be harmless <em>mano a mano</em> coming together with the Atl\u00e9tico Madrid defender Filipe Lu\u00eds in the second half ended with Pepe rolling along the turf, howling in apparent agony. It was first-year stage school stuff and the referee Mark Clattenburg was having none of it.</p> <p>Pepe\u2019s great act was not finished there, though. When Filipe placed a palm on his left cheek, he then grabbed his face and thrashed around as if his eyes had been gouged. Clattenburg\u2019s disappointed-parent face quickly became an internet meme. But there was no yellow card despite the double simulation. So Pepe carried on being Pepe, kicking and niggling away.</p> <p>Soon afterwards he was play-acting again, this time after another tangle with the substitute Yannick Carrasco. Again Pepe clutched his face as if an arrow had split his nostrils. Yet still there was no sanction.</p> <p>It took until extra-time for the Real Madrid central defender to finally be booked. Remarkably this season he has picked up only seven yellow cards in 32 games. Some say he has cleaned up his act. More likely he has just got cleverer at covering it up.</p> <p>Later, after the trophy had been lifted, Pepe swanned around San Siro with a selfie stick and his tongue poked out in celebration. It was an act almost laser\u2011targeted to cause annoyance to anyone still watching. But Pepe did not care. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/28/real-madrid-atletico-madrid-champions-league-final-match-report\">Real had won</a>. And so had he.</p> <p>It is a familiar story. For years Pepe has been a neat symbiosis of Fagin and Bill Sikes, both cunning and with enough muscle to back it up. Famously he received a 10-match ban after raking his studs down the back of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/apr/23/pepe-real-madrid-getafe-video\">Getafe player Javier Casquero</a> while he was on the floor before treading on his ankle \u2013 and then, for good measure, smacking Casquero\u2019s team-mate Juan Alb\u00edn. As he left the field after being shown the red card Pepe shouted, \u201cYou\u2019re all sons of bitches.\u201d</p> <p>His subsequent rap sheet would make Grandmaster Flash blush and he is still usually at the epicentre of at least one <em>el cl\u00e1sico</em> rumpus a season, most famously when he appeared to stamp on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2012/jan/19/real-madrid-pepe-messi-hand-video\">Lionel Messi\u2019s hand in 2012</a>. But has there ever been a tough guy footballer who has turned out to be a bigger ham than Pepe? At least Vinnie Jones waited until his playing career was over to turn to acting.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2016/may/29/real-madrid-win-the-champions-league-against-atletico-in-pictures\">Real Madrid win the Champions League against Atl\u00e9tico - in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet such has been the outcry since Saturday night there might just be a renewed opportunity to tackle such nefarious behaviour. The current system, of awarding yellow cards for simulation, clearly isn\u2019t working. And while the most obvious alternative - retrospective punishments - has its merits, the Champions League final showed up a major flaw. Would Pepe really care if he missed Real\u2019s first game of the new season? Of course not.</p> <p>So what might work better? Start by making the punishment for the cheat match the intended crime. So, if Pepe tries to trick the referee into giving Filipe Lu\u00eds and Carrasco red cards, then he should receive that punishment. Not yellow. Next, give officials a push and a helping hand.</p> <p><br />Of course football often operates in shades of grey \u2013 look at the way Fernando Torres won a penalty early in the second half by cleverly getting his body ahead of his marker and earning the foul, which would not have been given by all officials. However Pepe\u2019s antics were as black as charcoal. He should have been sent off.</p> <p>So praise the referees who punish simulation. Push them constantly to do more. And, because we know they need so help when the game rushes past so quickly, give them some back up by allowing the fourth official to alert them when the video evidence so obviously show cases of diving, feigning injury or hidden fouls. After all, there is precedent. I was at the Olympic Stadium in Berlin when Zinedine Zidane butted Marco Materazzi in the 2006 World Cup final. No one knew why the referee had stopped the game; only later was it revealed that someone had alerted him via his earpiece.</p> <p>Clearly there is a balance to be struck between maintaining the flow of the game and making the right decision. But the threat would be enough. Tell the players that the fourth official might use video evidence and the risk\u2011v\u2011reward debate in their heads alters overnight: why pretend to have been punched when in 30 seconds\u2019 time you would be receiving red for play-acting?</p> <p>All this potential rule change needs now is a name. So why not the Pepe Rule \u2013 after the man whose behaviour on Saturday should lead to its introduction?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/28/real-madrid-atletico-european-cup\">Real Madrid twist the knife again to give Atl\u00e9tico the cruellest of nights | Sid Lowe</a> </p> </aside>",

      "body": "<p>In 1988, Eddy Grant brought the anti-apartheid campaign to the British charts with <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFcmNu4KdGI\">Gimme Hope Jo\u2019anna</a>, a classic political pop song that mixed an angry message with a gloriously upbeat melody. Now it has been revived and reworked to attack the Taliban by the Pakistani band Laal. Their UK debut alongside the British veterans Asian Dub Foundation included a memorable encore, as the two bands came together under pictures of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books-site/2015/nov/30/i-am-malala-malala-yousafzai-review\">Malala Yousafzai</a>, the teenage Nobel prize winner and education campaigner who survived a Taliban attack. \u201cThey\u2019ve got a system just like apartheid, they keep women in subjection,\u201d sang Mahvash Waqar, and the crowd joined her in the chorus, chanting \u201cyou give me hope Malala\u201d.</p> <p>It was a bravely emotional song from a Lahore band who specialise in mixing upbeat melodies with political courage. Laal is led by Taimur Rahman, an unlikely pop star in his mid-20s who is also an assistant professor at Lahore University of Management Sciences and the author of a book on class structure in Pakistan. With Laal, he started out attacking military dictatorship but now campaigns for human rights and against religious extremism. The Taliban hate him and the band, of course, and he never announces their tour dates around country villages on social media, for fear of reprisals.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1087191d8ebb3737376c9dcdbca1fce35e5bae72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1087191d8ebb3737376c9dcdbca1fce35e5bae72/0_79_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Asian Dub Foundation\u2019s MC Aktarvata and Steve Savale.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Asian Dub Foundation\u2019s MC Aktarvata and Steve Savale.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Sheppard/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rahman arrived dressed in denim, clutching an electric guitar and sharing vocals with Waqar, his wife. They were backed by his cousin Haider Rahman, providing impressive solos on bamboo flute, and by a second electric guitar, bass and drums. Their opening set was in Urdu, and had it not been for the film clips and translations on a screen behind the stage, any non\u2013Urdu speaker might have assumed that Laal were entertaining folk-rockers with a good line in dance tunes. They started with songs featuring lyrics by \u201cprogressive Urdu writers\u201d from the 1930s, before moving on to a bhangra song celebrating Sufi poetry, and an impressive, stomping anti-Taliban rock anthem Dehshatgardi Murdabad (Death to Terrorism). By the time they had reached Utho Meri Duniya (Arise My People) based on the poetry of Allama Iqbal, the front of the hall was packed with dancers.</p> <p>Asian Dub Foundation, who followed, have clearly been energised by their latest lineup, and by the songs on their latest album, More Signal More Noise. Their entertaining, attacking set mixed bhangra, hip-hop, guitar rock and reggae, and included an impressive flute and beat-boxing session from Nathan Lee as well as an inspired treatment of their new instrumental <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sAV3pBpwis\">Blade Ragga</a>. They were joined by Laal for the revival of <a href=\"www.google.co.uk/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&amp;ion=1&amp;espv=2&amp;ie=UTF-8#q=Dub+Foundation+Rebel+Warrior\">Rebel Warrior</a> and encores which included the Malala tribute and a reworking of Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan\u2019s Qawwali classic Mustt Mustt. Once remixed by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c42t4wOCPok\">Massive Attack</a>, the Sufi devotional song was now treated as an extended, pounding workout that included a duel between the two flautists. This adventurous Alchemy festival event had been billed as a \u201cpoignant peace concert\u201d, and was an exuberant attack on intolerance. The Taliban would have loathed it.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-30T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p> When councillors in North Yorkshire ignored widespread public opposition and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/23/north-yorkshire-council-backs-first-uk-fracking-tests-for-five-years\">granted planning permission</a> for the fracking company Third Energy to carry out test drilling, there were groans around the Nottinghamshire village of Misson.</p> <p>For the last two years, tenacious locals in this quiet fenland hamlet have been fighting attempts by another energy firm to set up a shale gas exploration site in a nearby field. </p> <p>iGas, which holds licences to apply to frack in 55 areas across the UK, has leased land once occupied by a Ministry of Defence cold war missile defence system. The site, two miles north of Misson, on Springs Road in Bassetlaw, was also used for 24 years as a testing ground for bomber pilots. Protesters fear the bombers have left behind various unexploded ordnance, which could go off should drilling begin.</p> <p>They complain, too, that the site is near two conservation areas known as sites of special scientific interest (SSSI), which contain great crested newts, bats, water voles and five species of owls that would be disturbed by fracking. Pollybell, a nearby organic farm producing white sprouting broccoli and rare breeds of cabbage, worries that any contamination of the local water table caused by fracking \u2013 in which chemical-filled liquid is pumped deep underground at high pressure to fracture rock and release gas \u2013 could jeopardise its organic designation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c115908076c0f0ec25f21a60d2c2d4b6348248bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c115908076c0f0ec25f21a60d2c2d4b6348248bc/0_138_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jayne Watson outside the proposed fracking site near Misson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jayne Watson outside the proposed fracking site near Misson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jayne Watson, a former physiotherapist turned parish councillor, had travelled to Kirby Misperton to see how the North Yorkshire decision would play out. \u201cIt was very disappointing, but I don\u2019t see that it amounted to all other fracking applications getting the green light across the country,\u201d she said, after councillors gave the go-ahead for the first fracking test in Britain since 2011, when tests on the Fylde coast were found to have been the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/jun/01/blackpool-earthquake-tremors-gas-drilling\">probable cause of minor earthquakes</a> in the area.</p> <p>\u201cWe just have to continue to fight the planners, point-by-point. We just don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s a fair fight. The fracking companies seem to have far more access to lobby councillors than we do.\u201d</p> <p>Watson\u2019s immaculate kitchen, complete with Delia cookbooks and a blackboard reminding her to buy mung beans on her next shop, has become the nerve centre of Misson\u2019s scrupulously polite fight against the frackers. There\u2019s a certain irony that her sparkling double range hob is not powered by mains gas but an LPG tank in her garden: Misson is not currently connected to the gas mains, and has recently become home to a solar farm.</p> <p>Along with another parish councillor, Julie Watkins, Watson will spend the next week writing a detailed response to iGas\u2019s latest application to build an \u201cexploratory hydrocarbon well site\u201d, which is due to be considered by Nottinghamshire council\u2019s planning committee on 19 July. Soon after, the same planners are due to consider a second iGas application, for test drilling at a site known as Tinkers Lane, 20 minutes\u2019 drive from Misson, off the A364 between the villages of Barmby Moor and Blyth.</p> <p>With even Third Energy accepting that it is not likely to start exploratory drilling in Kirby Misperton for many months, and an appeal by another firm, Cuadrilla, pending in Lancashire, Misson looks set to be the next focal point for the fight against fracking.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d4f947a92f38af1c8cbb96ba48ab95e91585466\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d4f947a92f38af1c8cbb96ba48ab95e91585466/0_6_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The bombing ground near Misson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The bombing ground near Misson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So far, the Misson Action Group has played nicely, said Heather Gledhill, one of the campaigners. \u201cUntil now we\u2019ve fought the application intellectually, by the book. I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s got us all that far,\u201d she mused, as other members of the group discussed whether they would be willing to take direct action to stop the fracking, even if that meant possible arrest.</p> <p>The group has yet to lobby the man who leased part of his land to iGas. Andrew Jackson, from L Jackson &amp; Co, which sells MoD hardware to foreign armies from the former missile defence site, said he had not had any complaints from local residents.</p> <p>Jackson, <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/south_yorkshire/8343267.stm\">who was jailed in 2009</a> for illegally selling former military personnel carriers to Sudan, said his contract with iGas contained a gagging clause and so he couldn\u2019t talk. \u201cBut obviously if I didn\u2019t think it was safe then I wouldn\u2019t be doing it, would I?\u201d he said, cheerfully.</p> <p>One of the Misson protesters is Michael Booth, a former agriculture worker who said he worked in fields around the fracking site in decades past, and would regularly discover unexploded bombs. \u201cOnce we accidentally ended up sending a 10lb live bomb to Nottingham sugar beet factory,\u201d he said. \u201cCan you imagine the risks of unexploded ordnance generated by drilling activities?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/archive-zip/giv-12515QqfKaXI0aTqU/\" data-alt=\"Fracking map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/archive-zip/giv-12515QqfKaXI0aTqU/\">Fracking map</a> </figure>  <p>Responding to a freedom of information request by the Misson group, the MoD confirmed that the potential fracking site was used as a military bombing range between 1934 and 1958. The MoD said it did not know how many bombs were dropped there, but that in a six-year period, approximately 100,000 25lb practice bombs were dropped on former RAF Lindholme, located about 10 miles from the former RAF Misson. A bomb-clearing operation by RAF bomb disposal from 1959 to 1979 discovered 4,537 bombs. </p> <p>But Paul Piddington, owner of the Vale of York polo club, which is just two fields away from the fracking site, insisted he was not at all concerned. Those who opposed the fracking site were mostly newcomers who had retired to the area and should \u201cpiss off back to their towns\u201d, he said.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve been mining around here for 200 years, we still have quarries. This isn\u2019t going to make a jot of difference. The protesters are behind the times. I like going into the local pub and driving them all nuts by telling them they should be drinking in the dark,\u201d he said, surrounded by thousands of empty champagne bottles in the polo clubhouse. \u201cThey say they\u2019ll be disturbed by the noise, but it\u2019s going to be nothing compared to the volume of planes landing and taking off at Robin Hood airport.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"99beb91b0639f7677f201313bbfc305c3f4a0899\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/99beb91b0639f7677f201313bbfc305c3f4a0899/0_285_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Piddington\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Piddington: \u2018The protesters are behind the times.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In North Yorkshire, <a href=\"http://www.yorkshireeveningpost.co.uk/news/politics/flamingo-land-expresses-concern-over-fracking-impact-on-animals-1-7890715\">zookeepers at Flamingo Land</a> objected to the fracking site at nearby Kirby Misperton because they said it would scare the animals. But Piddington has 40 polo ponies and says he has no worries about the horses. He even let geologists employed by iGas drill a bore hole in one of his fields to carry out a seismic survey.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe they will stitch us up. I\u2019m not a conspiracy theorist who thinks they are going to blow our taps off or poison me and my children. If it wasn\u2019t safe, I don\u2019t think they would do it,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Piddington believes the iGas well site will be far more discreet than a new solar farm on the outskirts of Misson, which he described as a \u201cbloody eyesore\u201d.</p> <p>A local farmer, who asked not to be named for fear of \u201chassle\u201d from the anti-fracking group, said he had no problem with fracking, despite the proposed site being nearer to him than to most of the protest group.</p> <p>Ann-Marie Wilkinson, a spokeswoman for iGas, stressed that the firm\u2019s two live applications in North Nottinghamshire related to shale gas are not for fracking but just \u201cexploration\u201d.</p> <p>But Watson and her fellow campaigners know that if exploration results in significant reserves of shale gas being discovered, they are in for a long fight.</p>",

      "body": "<p>In any other season, Barnsley\u2019s promotion from League One, achieved after they <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/may/29/barnsley-v-millwall-league-one-play-off-final-live\" title=\"\">defeated Millwall 3-1</a> in the play-off final at Wembley, might be considered the most implausible and remarkable story it is possible to imagine. They were bottom of the table in November, in February <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/06/bristol-city-appoint-lee-johnson-new-head-coach-championship\" title=\"\">lost the manager who started their revival</a> and now they are in the Championship. Our credulity has been recalibrated by Leicester City \u2013 but do not let that obscure what an extraordinary achievement this is.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/may/29/barnsley-v-millwall-league-one-play-off-final-live\">Barnsley v Millwall: League One play-off final \u2013 live!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSurvival,\u201d Paul Heckingbottom, the manager, said on what Barnsley\u2019s realistic aim was at the nadir of their campaign. \u201cWe were playing quite well in some games but we weren\u2019t getting the results. Then we tightened up and from that we built up little bits of confidence, and here we are now.\u201d</p> <p>Here they are indeed. An opener from Ashley Fletcher, a third by Lloyd Isgrove and a peach in between from the returning hero Adam Hammill, who re\u2011signed at Oakwell this season four years after leaving for theoretically bigger things, were enough to beat a Millwall side who were largely disappointing \u2013 but perhaps they were not allowed to be anything else.</p> <p>To say both teams raced out of the blocks would be slightly inaccurate because it was more like all 22 players were already sprinting at full pelt before kick-off. However, it was Barnsley whose pace was more intense, all part of Heckingbottom\u2019s gameplan that succeeded in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/19/walsall-barnsley-league-one-play-off-match-report\" title=\"\">the semi-final</a>. \u201cIt\u2019s something we tried earlier in the season and it didn\u2019t go that well,\u201d he said. \u201cBut against Walsall we found something that really worked, trying to start [at pace] in the first half and then again in the second.\u201d</p> <p>Barnsley took the lead in only the second minute: Adam Davies launched a goal-kick downfield and Sam Winnall flicked it on for the Manchester United loanee Fletcher, who created a yard of space and shot across Jordan Archer, and into the corner of the net. Fletcher uses the United gym on his days off to show his face at his parent club: hopefully Jos\u00e9 Mourinho took notice of this one. Heckingbottom said: \u201cWhen Ashley came here he\u2019d been playing under-21s football but now he\u2019s playing like a man. I don\u2019t know what the pecking order there was at the time but it could\u2019ve been him making his debut instead of Marcus Rashford. They must be impressed with him.\u201d</p> <p>Barnsley continued their ferocious pace, seemingly playing in some sort of dead-eyed, highly focused trance, hypnotised into the firm belief that anything other than victory for them was neither possible nor acceptable. It was two after 19 minutes, Hammill tiptoeing towards Carlos Edwards, who politely allowed the winger to cut in on his strong right foot, the Barnsley man then demonstrating exactly why that was a bad idea by curling a perfect effort into the top corner. Twenty-four hours earlier Mohamed Diam\u00e9 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/28/hull-city-sheffield-wednesday-championship-play-off-final-match-report\" title=\"\">won promotion for Hull City to the Premier League</a> with a strike cut from similar cloth: this was better.</p> <p>Millwall pulled one back before the break, when the centre-back Mark Beevers \u2013 a Barnsley fan as a boy \u2013 gathered a loose ball from a corner, used his body superbly to turn on the six-yard box and swept home \u2013 but after the break Barnsley came again. The pace remained relentless, both teams tearing into each other as if this was the last game either were ever going to play, an almost reckless disregard for nerves or much subtlety. It was like two motorcyclists having a high-speed race along a narrow cliff path, the difference being Barnsley had much greater control.</p> <p>They used that control to score a third and kill the game. Conor Hourihane, perhaps their outstanding player over the season and on the day, curled an inswinging corner from the right to the near post, where the winger Isgrove \u2013 listed perhaps a little optimistically at 5ft 10in \u2013 nipped in front of everybody to glance a header home. From there it was a case of hanging on, which in the end they did with relative ease to secure their second win at Wembley this season, having <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/03/barnsley-oxford-united-johnstone-paint-trophy-final-match-report\" title=\"\">already lifted the Johnstone\u2019s Paint Trophy</a>.</p> <p>For his part, the Millwall manager, Neil Harris, admitted the better team won. \u201cWe came full of hope and expectation, and leave with nothing but pride at a brilliant season,\u201d he said. Harris had to make a late change to his starting XI after Byron Webster was injured in the warm-up, replaced by the club captain, Tony Craig. Did that have an effect on his team? \u201cI think clearly it did,\u201d Harris said. \u201cNo excuses, Barnsley deserved to win the game but I think it probably did subconsciously affect us.\u201d</p> <p>For Heckingbottom, next on the to-do list is a chat with the chairman, Maurice Watkins. Remarkably, the Tykes fan \u2013 \u201cI\u2019d have been watching if I wasn\u2019t here,\u201d he said \u2013 is still only the caretaker manager, appointed on a temporary basis when Lee Johnson left for Bristol City, after which Heckingbottom promised not to discuss his future until the season was over. With the manager and chairman keen on a permanent deal, one imagines those negotiations will not take too long. What a season.</p>",

      "body": "<p>My uncle John Norton, who has died aged 85, was an aeronautical engineer whose achievements added greatly to the quality and safety of modern aircraft.</p> <p>John was born in Bristol, son of May (nee Rich) and John, an engineer, and after leaving St Brendan\u2019s grammar school began working for the British Aircraft Corporation in Bristol, where he became part of the company\u2019s mission to produce ever lighter, stronger components. John\u2019s early experiments involved the use of explosives to \u201cblow\u201d sheets of titanium into preformed moulds. Over time his thinking developed \u2013 and success finally came with the use of electrically heated moulds, into which the hot, malleable titanium was formed using high-pressure benign gas.</p> <p>The first production item of real significance was an Airbus under-wing access panel. When it went into successful production it was probably the lightest, strongest and most corrosion-resistant titanium structure ever produced. The process \u2013 now universally known as \u201csuperplastic forming\u201d \u2013 has since been adopted worldwide.</p> <p>Spin-offs of the technique led to improvements in medical implants, racing car parts, ship structures and locomotive components. John also collaborated with surgeons pioneering microsurgery to create fine surgical instruments. On retirement he was in demand as a consultant, helping others establish their superplastic forming capabilities.</p> <p>John embodied Iain Duncan Smith\u2019s injunction not to \u201cunderestimate the determination of a quiet man\u201d. He was very determined, and worked out of the limelight. He was a great listener \u2013 and unfailingly asked exactly the right questions, making just the right comments to help you to the correct conclusions. He was also enormous fun \u2013 as indicated by the wicked glint in his eye and a tiny tug at the corner of his mouth.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Teresa (nee James), whom he married in 1954, their children, Kevin and Mandy, and granddaughters Jade and Rubie.</p>",

      "body": "<p>I am confident that one day our six-year-old will sleep through the night. It may not be this week; it may take until secondary school. If we had sleep trained her, it might have been different, but I just couldn\u2019t bear the tears. This makes me eligible to join the latest guilt trip after research in pediatrics showed that delaying bedtime and letting infants cry for short periods until they settle may be an act of kindness. Rather than causing emotional harm, it can help both parent and child sleep better.</p> <p>It\u2019s a debate that gets incredibly heated. Nearly half of mothers with babies over six months say their child has sleeping problems. Dr Michael Gradisar, lead author of a recent Australian study, says opponents tried to get the ethics committee to shut it down. The researchers randomized 43 infants with sleep problems between the ages of six and 16 months to either a usual routine, graduated extinction (allowing babies to cry for short periods over several nights) or fading (where the baby is put to bed a quarter of an hour later).</p> <p>The study measured levels of cortisol, a stress hormone, to see how long it took babies to get to sleep, how often they woke and the effects on parents\u2019 stress and children\u2019s behaviour. A technique called the strange situation procedure tested infants\u2019 attachment to their parents. Everyone\u2019s sleep improved \u2013 even the control group\u2019s \u2013 because babies naturally mature and sleep better. And attachment stayed the same. But the other groups showed larger reductions in the time it took for babies to get to sleep and their frequency of waking. Neither technique allowed infants to howl for hours in the dark.</p> <p>Gradisar says his study supports earlier Australian research showing no long-term harmful effects to children. The earlier study, of 326 children, lost touch with a third during the follow-up. And the current study is small. Is this enough reassurance that sleep training will not be emotionally harmful?</p> <p>You should do what you feel is right. Wendy Hall, a researcher in sleep training, argues that helping your child learn to sleep better is an important investment. It teaches them self\u2013regulation, and sleep is essential for development. Crying, she points out, is their only form of communication, so you won\u2019t destroy their sense of attachment by leaving them to self-soothe.</p> <p>Graduated extinction has recently been rebranded as \u201ccontrolled comforting\u201d. Gradisar says more studies are needed to really answer questions about it\u2019s safety. But it\u2019s clear that using it or not is no marker of the quality of your parenting. But I haven\u2019t done it, so maybe I would say that.</p>",

Jones defended his fly-half afterwards, pointing out that Tiger Woods and Michael Jordan also had their occasional off-days, but the contrast with the currently dead-eyed Owen Farrell was inescapable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/28/saracens-exeter-premiership-play-off-final-match-report\">Saracens Premiership champions after Alex Goode ends Exeter fightback</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The good news for England is that, even without <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/28/saracens-exeter-premiership-play-off-final-match-report\" title=\"\">the all-conquering Saracens posse</a>, there are several young players doing their best to complicate Jones\u2019s selectorial plans. If Joe Launchbury was a deserving man of the match, there were notable tries from the Harlequins pair Jack Clifford and Marland Yarde and sufficient energy on his debut from Teimana Harrison to justify his promotion.</p> <p>Luther Burrell, Anthony Watson and Ben Youngs also contributed well-taken tries, even if some of Wales\u2019s defence left plenty to be desired. Warren Gatland put a brave face on the outcome, insisting the problems exposed in the second half were fixable, but Wales have not conspicuously kicked on since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/27/england-wales-rugby-world-cup-stuart-lancaster\" title=\"\">ambushing England on this ground</a> in the pool stages of last autumn\u2019s World Cup.</p> <p>Jones, for his part, took issue with those pointing fingers at Ford, suggesting that any fly-half whose side scores five tries against Wales cannot have had too disastrous a game. He was more concerned about the way in which a frustrated Dan Biggar remonstrated with the French referee Marius Mitrea following Clifford\u2019s try, which came after Dan Cole had knocked down an attempted pass from Biggar.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve got to be careful of that in rugby ... that shouldn\u2019t happen,\u201d insisted Jones, also disputing the Welsh view that Cole had knocked the ball forward. \u201cI didn\u2019t like how Biggar went on afterwards. When you look at the replays it\u2019s definitely a try. The ball went backwards and Coley tried to catch the ball. Tightheads should be rewarded for trying to catch the ball, don\u2019t you think?\u201d</p> <p>Gatland felt very differently, having watched Clifford outpace Scott Williams over 50 metres for the 47th-minute try that tilted the game England\u2019s way. \u201cThere\u2019s no attempt to catch the ball, it\u2019s been knocked down and not in any way controlled. Dan was adamant it was a knock-on. There wasn\u2019t any abuse, that would be unacceptable but there\u2019s nothing wrong with a player showing a bit of passion. It was a pretty important decision at a pretty vital time of the game.\u201d</p> <p>When any side lose the second half of a Test 17-0, however, it is impossible to argue too long and loud. Wales may have looked the sharper side initially, the lively Rob Evans crashing over to reward a sustained period of pressure, but their early 10-0 lead proved a mirage on a lovely sunny afternoon.</p> <p>The powerful Burrell, set to replace the injured Manu Tuilagi in the Australian tour party, struck back at the end of the first quarter, surging from deep to gather Youngs\u2019s short pass, but after Biggar had slotted a third penalty to extend his side\u2019s lead to 13-5 the visitors had only themselves to blame for not increasing it. A long breakout from Hallam Amos and Jamie Roberts should have yielded a score, only for Scott Baldwin to end up isolated on the left wing when moving the ball right was the obvious option. England needed some kind of response and a 33nd\u2011minute try by Watson provided it, even if some TV angles cast doubt over whether the winger reached the line before the ball was dislodged by a sliding Biggar. Ford, again, took aim only for the ball to fade past the right post for the third time in a row.</p> <p>Whatever Jones said at half-time clearly worked. Within three minutes Wales were caught out by Clifford switching to the scrum-half role, allowing Youngs to appear from slightly deeper and step past Baldwin to score. Clifford\u2019s long-distance gallop followed almost immediately and, at 22-13 down, Wales were toiling.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/may/29/england-v-wales-international-rugby-union-live\">England 27-13 Wales: international rugby union \u2013 as it happened!</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With no Welsh sides involved in the Pro12 play-offs their players have been short of recent rugby, while Lydiate\u2019s early departure with hamstring and shoulder joint injuries scarcely helped. It still did not wholly explain the visiting bench\u2019s lack of impact, nor the poor tackling that saw Yarde power over for a fifth try. England allowed a big lead to slip in their World Cup pool game but this time they eased home with a bit to spare.</p> <p>It has certainly buoyed Jones \u2013 \u201cI was surprised we won so easily; I thought it would be a lot tighter\u201d \u2013 as he prepares to return to his homeland.

Among several hundred peshmerga fighters awaiting orders to advance was a group of at least 15 American and Canadian soldiers loading armoured vehicles with anti-tank rocket launchers and cases of heavy gun cartridges. </p> <p>\u201cOur objective is to push Daesh away from these villages towards Mosul,\u201d said a peshmerga captain overlooking the battlefield while coalition aircraft launched multiple strikes. Islamic State is also known by its Arabic acronym, Daesh, or Isis or Isil. </p> <p>By mid-afternoon, five villages had been recaptured, according to ColDlshad Mawlood of the elite Zeravani forces. But the militants appeared to be putting up stiff resistance, deploying suicide car bombs to fend off the peshmerga advance and firing barrages of mortars.</p> <p>In an emailed statement, the Kurdistan region security council said: \u201cThis is one of the many shaping operations expected to increase pressure on Isil in and around Mosul in preparation for an eventual assault on the city.\u201d</p> <p>Coalition forces are also assisting Iraqi forces who launched a large-scale offensive a week ago to recapture Falluja, the first major urban centre to fall to Isis in early 2014. A spokesman said Iraq\u2019s special forces had completed a troop buildup around the city on Sunday.</p> <p>But Aymenn Jawad al-Tamimi, a fellow at the Middle East Forum, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/28/assault-falluja-bloodbath-islamic-state\">said efforts to oust Isis would be bloody and prolonged</a>. \u201cThe group has come under strain financially and militarily, but the fight is far from over,\u201d he said.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Fears are growing that there will be a sharp rise in tensions in the South China Sea in the next few weeks after an international tribunal delivers a ruling on disputed islands and reefs that Beijing has said it will reject.<br /></p> <p>Western officials say they fear China will react to the ruling of the international tribunal for the law of the sea, which is expected to side with the Philippines, by raising the stakes in the busy trade route, expanding its land reclamation and construction activities to reefs in the Scarborough Shoal, close to Manila.</p> <p>The White House is under pressure from the top US commander in the Pacific and some in Congress to take a tougher line with Beijing and carry out more military patrols close to China\u2019s fortified islands, where there have already been close encounters between ships and planes from the two rival powers. </p> <p>Beijing, which argues the tribunal has no jurisdiction on the matter, has warned the US against escalating the conflict, saying it will defend itself if necessary. </p> <p> \u201cOf course, when the ruling comes out our friends in Philippines and in the United States will preach that the tribunal has binding power, and that China must obey the result. But surely we will be firm in saying that the results are illegal, that the tribunal has no binding power and China will not accept the ruling,\u201d said Liu Zhenmin, the Chinese deputy foreign minister who has been a lead negotiator on the issue. </p> <p> \u201cThe US knows about its own history in south-east Asia. We will oppose the US if it stirs up any conflict in south-east Asia. But if scenarios of the Korean war or Vietnam war are replayed we will have to defend ourselves.\u201d</p> <p> Liu added that he did not think \u201cthings would go as badly as that\u201d, but warned that any US attempt to contain China\u2019s rising sea power was doomed to failure. \u201cWe have been saying to our American friends you cannot really circle China by having joint military exercises or building military bases \u2013 you were not able to do that 30 years ago, let alone now. China\u2019s rise and development will not be held back by anyone,\u201d he said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/disputed_islands_map/giv-12515BJGYni2kpbNj/\" data-alt=\"South China sea\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/disputed_islands_map/giv-12515BJGYni2kpbNj/\">South China sea</a> </figure>  <p> According to Chinese officials, there was a debate about the wisdom of the island construction programme when it began in earnest three years ago, a discussion that the hawks won. The volatility of the situation is heightened by the fact that China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has yet to consolidate his power base and has alienated powerful figures in the People\u2019s Liberation Army and in the Communist party with his anti-corruption drive. Diplomats in Beijing said Xi\u2019s hold on power would be in doubt at least until next year\u2019s party congress. </p> <p> Until then, he cannot ignore the increasingly nationalist mood in the country centred on the standoff in the South China Sea. Public anger has spiked each time US ships and planes have conducted \u201cfreedom of navigation\u201d patrols close to Chinese-claimed islands and reefs, sometimes leading to near misses between military forces from both countries. </p> <p> Concern is rising over the prospect of a repeat of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/apr/11/china.usa\">the collision in April 2001</a> between a US EP3 spy plane and a Chinese jet fighter. The US plane was forced to land on Chinese territory and its crew was soon released, but the Chinese pilot was killed in the collision. The incident was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/18/south-china-sea-fighter-jets-unsafe-intercept-us-spy-plane\">nearly repeated earlier this month</a> when Chinese jets almost collided with a US EP3 near the same spot, off Hainan island. </p> <p> The Chinese state-run <a href=\"http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/984099.shtml?utm_source=The+Sinocism+China+Newsletter&amp;utm_campaign=369655d0f2-Sinocism05_22_165_22_2016&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_171f237867-369655d0f2-29655069&amp;mc_cid=369655d0f2&amp;mc_eid=6c2e27f99c\">Global Times warned</a> that such a collision in the current climate could lead to a fallout that spiralled out of control.</p> <p> \u201cIf the Pentagon continues its closeup offshore surveillance operations against China, as our military prowess increases, more interceptions can be expected. As a result, the odds of another collision will go up. But if there is a recurrence, the calamity and sensation it causes will be much bigger than in 2001, when the Sino-US relationship was not as intense as it is now,\u201d an opinion piece argued. </p> <p>\u201cThe simmering distrust between China and the US will probably explode if there is another collision. It will be extremely difficult for both sides to control the risks and damage.\u201d<strong><br /></strong></p> <p>Fu Ying, a former ambassador to London and the chairwoman of the People\u2019s Congress foreign affairs committee, said: \u201cThe South China Sea is like<strong> </strong>a billiard ball situation. You hit one ball and you strike many others. And the US is very big billiard ball.\u201d<strong><br /></strong></p> <p> She criticised the US for being provocative in its use of spy planes.</p> <p> \u201cEP3 surveillance is so constant. You don\u2019t need to come back three times a day for something that only changes over months. The US military should know Chinese history. We have suffered invasions since 1840, mostly from the sea.\u201d</p> <p>Fu added: \u201cBoth sides are very tense with very strong positions. For the US, it is a geopolitical issue but for China it is territorial. There would be 1.3 billion people who would be angry if we cede territory.\u201d</p> <p> Another official portrayed Xi as the heir to China\u2019s historic emperors. \u201cNone of them lost territory, and Xi cannot be the first.\u201d</p> <p> China lays claims to islands <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/13/pentagon-report-china-reclaimed-3200-acres-south-china-sea\">covering 80% of the South China Sea</a>, inside a big territorial loop known as the \u201cnine-dash line\u201d. The area was occupied by Japan and then surrendered in 1945, without a stated beneficiary, but Beijing argues its sovereignty was accepted by the west until the 1970s. It insists on all published maps of the region having the nine-dash line clearly marked.</p> <p> The legitimacy of these claims is being challenged by Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines, which have all colonised the islands closest to their coasts, and Manila has taken its challenge to the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/25/david-cameron-china-ruling-south-china-sea-the-hague-philippines\"> international tribunal in The Hague</a>, disputing Chinese attempts to claim territorial waters around uninhabitable rocks. China refused to cooperate with the tribunal proceedings. </p> <p> Diplomats and military officials from the US and China held a \u201dstrategic security dialogue\u201d in Washington on 19 May, at which US officials said they had urged their Chinese counterparts to rein in their reaction to the tribunal ruling. </p> <p> However, there is pressure from the US military to take up a more aggressive position. <a href=\"http://www.navytimes.com/story/military/2016/04/06/4-star-admiral-wants-confront-china-white-house-says-not-so-fast/82472290/\">The Navy Times has reported</a> that the head of US Pacific Command, Admiral Harry Harris, was proposing \u201ca muscular US response to China\u2019s island-building that may include launching aircraft and conducting military operations within 12 miles of these man-made islands\u201d.</p> <p> Currently, the White House has to give its approval if a US warship navigates within a 12-mile limit around the disputed islands and rocks, and they do so under conditions of \u201cinnocent passage\u201d, under which they cannot fly aircraft, use anti-aircraft systems or carry out live fire exercises. </p> <p> Harris is reportedly pushing for those restrictions to be relaxed and a tougher line, as a deterrent to expanding the island-building campaign to the Scarborough Shoal. So far, the White House\u2019s more cautious line has won out and Harris and other military leaders were even ordered not to make public statements in the run-up to a meeting between Xi and Obama at the nuclear summit at the end of March.</p> <p> But there are also calls for a more assertive stance from Congress.</p> <p> \u201cThe White House\u2019s aversion to risk has resulted in an indecisive policy that has failed to deter China\u2019s pursuit of maritime hegemony while confusing and alarming our regional allies and partners,\u201d John McCain, the chairman of the Senate armed services committee, told the Navy Times. \u201cChina\u2019s increasingly coercive challenge to the rules-based international order must be met with a determined response that demonstrates America\u2019s resolve and reassures the region of our commitment.\u201d</p> <p> Chinese military officials say that while the chance of an accidental collision is rising, there are mechanisms in place in which the military leadership of both countries can communicate and defuse such an incident. </p> <p> \u201cUS warships and airplanes should be aware that the South China Sea is all about high seas, but it also contains territorial seas and airspace of many coastal countries,\u201d deputy minister Liu said. \u201cChinese needs peace and stability, and we do not want to have any military standoff or conflicts with the US. We hope the US warships and airplanes will not make provocations against us.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>My friend and neighbour Fred Calcott, who has died aged 81, was a postman and trade union official who acted as an advocate for those less able to speak for themselves.</p> <p>Fred was born in Holloway, north London, the youngest of seven children. When he was two, his father, also Frederick, walked out on the family, and his mother, Lydia (nee Rossi), supported the the whole family by working in a laundry.</p> <p>After school and national service, Fred worked as a postman, becoming active in the <a href=\"http://www.cwu.org/\" title=\"\">Communication Workers Union</a> at the Mount Pleasant sorting office in north London. Fred\u2019s sense of fairness and justice came to the fore when the parcel section was due to move to St Pancras Way in Camden. He insisted on a moving package for the sorters: \u201c\u00a31,000 each or no one\u2019s moving,\u201d he said. Management conceded, but excluded the cleaners, who were mostly women. Indignant at the injustice, Fred talked to the sorters, who all agreed to share their money with the cleaners so that everyone received the same amount. As a result of his negotiating skills as union branch secretary, Fred was offered a management position by the Post Office. He didn\u2019t think twice about turning it down.</p> <p>In later life Fred became a justice of the peace at Horseferry Road and Bow Street magistrate courts, where he would push for leniency for those less able to pay their fines. He also set up the first <a href=\"http://www.peabody.org.uk/home\" title=\"\">Peabody Trust</a> Housing Association tenants\u2019 association, and in 2003 was invited to become the first tenant-governor in the trust\u2019s long history, a task he willingly undertook for no remuneration. In 1998 he was appointed MBE for services to the Post Office and to the community.</p> <p>When he became my new neighbour, he introduced himself by saying: \u201cI see you read the Guardian too.\u201d He was a lifelong member of the <a href=\"http://www.labour.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Labour party</a>, and on election nights his flat in Archway was open house for the Islington North MP Jeremy Corbyn, local councillors and other party workers.</p> <p>Fred met his future wife, Margaret, at St Joseph\u2019s dance hall on Highgate Hill. They married in 1957 \u2013 their honeymoon was a cup of tea in the park. Margaret recalled that they couldn\u2019t afford a slice of cake as Fred had lent his last couple of pounds to his brother to travel to a job interview.</p> <p>Fred is survived by Margaret, by their sons Paul and John, and by two granddaughters.</p>",

Ever since the Mexicans took over the country and he was forced to speak Spanish at school, he had taken a keen interest in paramilitary survivalism, just like her brother Jarred who nobody ever mentioned. \u201cPut that gun down and go and queue for some foodstuffs that will probably have gone off by the time you get home,\u201d Florence said. She kind of missed the old days when the worst that seemed to happen was that a few bankers tried to fiddle the Libor rate.</p> <p>In Washington, Avery Mandible was anxious that all of her patients were cancelling their therapy sessions because tax rates had gone up to 88%, interest rates had hit a new high of minus 23% and the only people left in work were those making money off the influx of Chinese tourists. She decided to call her sister on her FleX watch.</p> <p>\u201cHi Florence,\u201d she said. \u201cI kinda just miss the stonage days of 2025 when the internet collapsed and no online financial transactions could be authorised. At least in those days a $50,000 bill still had some value.\u201d \u201cMe too, Avery,\u201d Florence replied. \u201cIt sure is tough when US government borrowing has reached 290% of GDP.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYou shouldn\u2019t worry too much,\u201d said Avery. \u201cMy husband Lowell, the respected Georgetown economist, has modelled projections saying that even 385% is perfectly sustainable. Besides, we still have the backup of Grandpa Douglas\u2019s millions.

It was an alert from the US Treasury saying that everyone\u2019s gold reserves were being nationalised and that even people\u2019s teeth would be requisitioned by the army. \u201cThat means I am now also officially broke and can no longer care for my second wife, Luella, who is suffering from dementia,\u201d said Grandpa Douglas. \u201cSo I will now have to go and live with my son Carter.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhy can\u2019t you go and live with my sister, Enola?\u201d Carter said. \u201cAt least she has some money in the alternative currency of bancors.\u201d \u201cIn case you had forgotten,\u201d Grandpa Douglas responded, anxious to use a word different to replied, \u201cbancors are a proscribed currency, and Enola lives in France.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWell, you can\u2019t live with me because now that the official annualised rate of inflation is now 215% I too am broke.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-30T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>If challenged on his unconventional buildings, Oscar Niemeyer, architect of the Mac Niter\u00f3i art gallery which hovers above Rio de Janeiro like a spaceship, would quote Charles Baudelaire: \u201cStrangeness is a necessary ingredient of beauty.\u201d As an aesthetic philosophy, this sums up the Louis Vuitton catwalk collection staged on the snaking ramps of the gallery at sunset on Saturday.</p> <p>Out of the UFO curves of the building came models wearing parachute-silk cape-backed dresses with wetsuit zippers, or silk blouses inspired by Brazilian artist Aldemir Martins\u2019 paintings of Pel\u00e9. The famous Louis Vuitton box trunks were reincarnated as Copacabana beach ghettoblasters, complete with gold hardware and the LV monogram. In the front row, Catherine Deneuve watched imperious, while Brazilian supermodel Alessandra Ambrosio captured the moment for posterity with selfies.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>There is a strangeness to a fashion extravaganza on this scale being staged in a country which is in the grip of recession, with an impeached president, endemic corruption, a major health crisis looming over the Zika virus, and with the small matter of an Olympic Games to host in two months\u2019 time. Unsurprisingly, designer Nicolas Ghesqui\u00e8re took ample artistic licence in the image of Brazil he riffed on for this collection, focusing on a nostalgic Ipaneman glamour and Brazil\u2019s sporting heritage. </p> <p>The new phenomenon of \u201ccruise\u201d season, of which this show is part, is taking fashion to another dimension. Four megabrands \u2013 Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Christian Dior and Gucci \u2013 have created an elite class of standalone fashion shows, which take place out of the cheek-by-jowl hustle of ready-to-wear fashion weeks. Each brand vies for the most exotic locations and the most prestigious venues. Three weeks ago, Chanel staged its cruise show in Cuba; in the next few days, cruise-fever will arrive in the UK with Dior\u2019s show at Blenheim Palace on Tuesday, closely followed by Gucci\u2019s at Westminster Abbey on Thursday.</p> <p>Where regular fashion weeks are rooted in a trade-show tradition, the cruise shows promote the more abstract modern art of branding. Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s Chanel is cruise\u2019s answer to pop art, all cartoon Cocos and Warholian colours. Ghesqui\u00e8re\u2019s Louis Vuitton, meanwhile, is something more oblique. He is by instinct an avant-garde designer, and he brings an arthouse aesthetic to his blockbuster brand. If a Louis Vuitton cruise show was an art installation, it would be a Carsten H\u00f6ller slide, or a room of Martin Creed\u2019s white balloons.</p> <p>The heritage of Louis Vuitton is in travel, not clothes, and Ghesqui\u00e8re has made the venues for his cruise collections an integral part of their image, taking LV on a world tour of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/may/07/louis-vuitton-turns-catwalk-into-a-spaceship-as-fashion-goes-intergalactic\">elliptically curved space age architecture</a>. UFO-like buildings have become as much a part of Louis Vuitton\u2019s visual brand as those boxy brown-and-gold trunks were fifty years ago. The venue for last year\u2019s cruise show was Bob Hope\u2019s landmark 1970s-meets-the-future Palm Springs home. By commandeering the world\u2019s chicest spaceships as catwalks, Ghesqui\u00e8re keeps the fantasy element of the Vuitton lifestyle alive in an era where air travel has lost its glamour. </p> <p>This was a sexier, more body-conscious Louis Vuitton. With their low-cut necklines and side cut-outs, the opening dresses had the look of very dressed-up swimwear. Where skirts were long they were cut to ribbons, for plenty of leg. The timelessly ethereal desert-sand shades of last year\u2019s Palm Springs collection were replaced by bold, attention-grabbing colours.</p> <p>Backstage after the show, Ghesqui\u00e8re said it was the integration of sportswear into urban style that he loved in Rio de Janeiro. \u201cI have always loved the clothes that women wear on city streets, and I am obsessed with sport and with movement. Here in Rio, beach life is urban life.\u201d The influence of Brazil\u2019s sporting heritage \u2013 and of a city about to host the Olympics \u2013 could be felt in the Pel\u00e9-print jerseys, in lightweight football shorts, and in scuba-fabric high-top shoes.</p> <p> New LV muse Jaden Smith, teenage son of Hollywood actors Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith, lavished praise on those scuba high-tops backstage after the show, saying he was hoping to wear them himself. The 17-year-old, whose appearance in a skirt in a Vuitton womenswear campaign caused a stir earlier this year, drew by far the loudest screams of the evening when he turned from talking to Ghesqui\u00e8re to wave to the Brazilian teenagers gathered outside the gallery. \u201cI loved that show,\u201d he said. \u201cTo me, it just looks like the future.\u201d</p>",

      "headline": "Peggy Spencer obituary",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-30T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Although Peggy Spencer\u2019s life revolved around the ballroom, she never thought of herself as a dancer or choreographer; she was a natural teacher who worked for more than 70 years in service of her belief in \u201cdance for all\u201d. For 50 of them, she was the ultimate authority, stately but friendly, for the BBC\u2019s Come Dancing, and the senior judiciary of global ballroom and Latin dance contests.</p> <p>Spencer, who has died aged 95, never intended to reign supreme at the palais de dance. Born Margaret Ann Hull, daughter of a carpenter, Jim, and a cook, Maggie, of Bromley, Kent, she was considered too tall and gawky a schoolgirl to learn to dance. Her first passion was for socialist politics: as a young woman at secretarial college, she volunteered to type letters for the Labour MP Herbert Morrison and planned to stand for election herself one day. That idea ended with her marriage in 1940 to Jack Spencer, the birth of their children, Helena and Michael, and the second world war.</p> <p>Her brother-in-law, Frank, was a world championship ballroom dancer who, before the war, had put together an experimental formation team. Dancing had been democratised by the 1930s \u2013 the gramophone helped, as did film musicals \u2013 and had widened from a super-smart social requirement to a mass pastime for the young, who met and courted in dance halls. A man disciplined enough to master ballroom moves gained a mating advantage.</p> <p>After Frank joined the army, she helped the Spencer family run his music shop in Sydenham, south-east London, and during the blitz, decided to teach teenaged boys who spent their nights in an air raid shelter under a cinema how to foxtrot and quickstep. She was not a great dancer, but swotted up from a manual, one page and two steps ahead of her pupils. Her classes spread to a pub and, after the war, to village halls in Kent, where she created groups and set them to compete village against village.</p> <p>Frank, on return from the war, saw the big potential of the formation format, as the maturing, now more respectable, dance market needed a new and dreamier glamour. He and she were instinctive partners, and after she divorced Jack in 1947, they moved in together. Now partners both on the dance floor (he was the more nimble of the two, she had more grace) and in a new joint business, the Royston Ballroom and dance school above a working men\u2019s club in Penge, everyone assumed them to be married. But it was only when the law forbidding the marriage of the siblings of living ex-spouses was modified almost 20 years later that they could wed. Their base in Penge was snobbily mocked for decades, but the school was an enduring success.</p> <p>Come Dancing was broadcast from Mecca ballrooms nationwide from 1949 and featured her pupils. When it changed from an instructional to a competitive programme in 1953, she trained more than 20 winning teams. Her dance floor aesthetics, influenced by Paris couture\u2019s 1947 New Look \u2013 hair up, multiple net petticoats, shoulder straps, sequins \u2013 were part of the evolution of ballroom\u2019s folk costume. Come Dancing made her a television personality, appearing as a guest across light entertainment from Blue Peter to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/mar/31/ronnie-corbett-obituary\" title=\"Ronnie Corbett obituary\">The Two Ronnies</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"487dc2a5affd76b7456e84d9668b8c9477fc1279\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/487dc2a5affd76b7456e84d9668b8c9477fc1279/6_62_709_425/500.jpg\" alt=\"The Your Mother Should Know scene from the Beatles film, Magical Mystery Tour, 1967, in which Peggy Spencer\u2019s dancers backed the Fab Four.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Your Mother Should Know scene from the Beatles film, Magical Mystery Tour, 1967, in which Peggy Spencer\u2019s dancers backed the Fab Four.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: YouTube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI could train beginners and I could train champions,\u201d she said, and did, as coach, consultant and choreographer. She taught Grace Kelly\u2019s children, Princess St\u00e9phanie and Prince Albert, in Monaco. Paul McCartney asked her to realise his fantasy, for the 1967 TV film Magical Mystery Tour, of her dancers backing the Beatles on a white stairway to heaven in Your Mother Should Know. But she had to revise her choreography quickly when she heard his music: \u201cI said to Paul, this is not a waltz: a waltz has three beats to a bar and you\u2019ve done four.\u201d She also coached Rudolf Nureyev in the tango for his lead role in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/nov/28/ken-russell\" title=\"\">Ken Russell</a>\u2019s 1977 film Valentino. The fun was always in the setting-up, the mutual learning, she said \u2013 \u201cthe terrific joy of teaching\u201d.</p> <p>Unhampered by nostalgia, she had no animosity towards rock\u2019n\u2019roll or the rise of Latin, since dancing those well took the same hard work as the quickstep. She choreographed a show for Elton John\u2019s 50th birthday party in 1997, fusing ballroom, Latin and rock in the spirit of the 1992 film Strictly Ballroom, and a party guest, the producer Harley Medcalf, asked her to amplify it into Burn the Floor, a dance show since staged in more than 100 countries.</p> <p>The BBC first exiled Come Dancing to scheduling limbo, then dropped it in 1999, only for it to reappear in a different form as the Burn the Floor-style Strictly Come Dancing in 2004. As ballroom\u2019s queen mother, Spencer was asked to appear but considered herself too old, and was royally amused when Bruce Forsyth was hired as host. He creaked far more than she did.</p> <p>Spencer retired officially in 1997, after publishing that year her own manual, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Joy-Dancing-Peggy-Spencer/dp/1844425479\" title=\"\">The Joy of Dancing</a>, but every year compered a Ballroom Blitz at the Royal Festival Hall, where she sometimes took beginners\u2019 classes, \u201cseeing their pleasure and joy\u201d in gaining foot control; she believed most of all in ordinary lives enriched by worked-for achievement. She went on teaching dance at her local community centre until she was 93.</p> <p>The Spencers were appointed MBE in 1977 (her teams had twice danced at Buckingham Palace), and she won nine <a href=\"https://www.idta.co.uk/site3/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/CARL-ALAN-AWARD-WINNERS-2011-press-release.pdf\" title=\"\">Carl Alan</a> ballroom awards. Frank died in 1988. Michael, who ran her school, also predeceased her; Helena survives her.</p> <p><em> \u2022 </em>Peggy Spencer, dancer and teacher, born 24 September 1920; died 25 May 2016</p>",

      "body": "<h2><strong>Zusi and Besler might be the next great survivors</strong></h2> <p>Over the years there have been certain players who have repeatedly found their way back into the national team set up, often in the face of popular opinion. DaMarcus Beasley was one such player, though he has now finally left the international scene. So, to an extent, is Kyle Beckerman.</p> <p>Looking ahead it\u2019s possible to see a couple of others emerging, both of whom happen to play for the same club \u2014 the appropriately hardworking, no frills Sporting KC.</p> <p>It\u2019s sometimes hard to see the single virtue\u00a0Graham Zusi\u00a0possesses to a greater degree than any of the men competing for places with him. There are faster players, others who are better at set pieces or more influential. But an aggregate of his virtues and versatility should make clear what he brings as a roster choice \u2014 there\u2019s no sense of \u201chope this works\u201d when he\u2019s asked to deputize, and often plenty of balance, if not necessarily inspiration, in the teams he starts in.</p> <p>And then there\u2019s Matt Besler: the straight man in the double act with the more celebrated Omar Gonzalez during the last World Cup qualifying Hex stage; the man whose club form fell away on his return from the World Cup; the man who kept plugging, even as the commentariat began celebrating Matt Miazga.\u00a0</p> <p>But Besler is a dutiful, solid player less prone to the type of mistakes or flashes of indiscipline you can associate with his ball-playing, lunge-tackling counterparts. You can see why Klinsmann continues to call him up.\u00a0</p> <p>What\u2019s harder to see, perhaps, is why Klinsmann started Besler as a left-back against Bolivia, given that he had not played there since he was a rookie at Sporting KC. And yet 45 minutes later, as Besler left the field after an undramatic shift, to make way for a rested Fabian Johnson (who will presumably start against Colombia), you could see the reasoning. Besler can nearly always do a job for his coach. Players that can do that tend to stick around.</p> <h2><strong>Darlington Nagbe will have to deal with a new level of expectation at Copa Am\u00e9rica</strong></h2> <p>Since finally gaining his citizenship as well as a smattering of chances to impress in a US jersey, Darlington Nagbe has quickly gone from a player the fans have clamored to see, to a player the fans will now expect to deliver as a difference maker. How he handles that expectation may be one of the X-factors of the US Copa Am\u00e9rica campaign.</p> <p>Fans of the Portland Timbers, can tell you how frustrating expectations can be when they come to Nagbe. He is capable of sublime skill and worrying disappearing acts, often in the same game. Until a late season shift that finally moved Nagbe to the center of the Portland midfield. he had seemed to confound his one time college coach Caleb Porter\u2019s attempts to get the best out of his undoubted potential.</p> <p>Porter did move Nagbe inside however, with MLS Cup winning results. And Klinsmann too has tended to play him in a similar fashion, when he has brought him on to provide a spark. The spark came late against Ecuador, but it\u2019s hard to argue with a winning goal. And\u00a0<a>on Saturday night</a>\u00a0he was given an ideal opportunity to impress, entering a 3-0 game against Bolivia that was opening up nicely \u2014 with plenty of potential space for Nagbe to work in. He duly trotted on to the field alongside Christian Pulisic \u2014 who of course has his own particular air of expectancy around him \u2014 before making his first significant contribution to the game in the form of a driving run, give and go, and a slipped pass for Pulisic to finish.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/27/copa-america-usa-argentina-1995\">The day USA beat Argentina in Copa Am\u00e9rica: 'Simeone threatened to kill us'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was an exciting reminder of what Nagbe is capable of, though the context was an already won game against a demoralized opponent rather than the rather tighter game the US found themselves in in the first half, and which they will see plenty of once the Copa gets underway. And that\u2019s where Nagbe must demonstrate his worth in reliably unlocking defenses, in those moments when the USA\u2019s tournament fate hangs in the balance.</p> <h2><strong>Pulisic is not just in the tournament for the experience</strong></h2> <p>One of the great US fan rituals is the constant anointing of the next big thing \u2014 usually accompanied by disgust for the pretensions of the last would-be-next-big-thing. Never mind the Landon Donovan MLS MVP award, the Landon Donovan Next Landon Donovan award is constantly being conferred and revoked.</p> <p>The latest contender is Borussia Dortmund\u2019s Christian Pulisic, who entered the second of the three friendlies as a substitute, having missed the first due to the small matter of the German Cup final. He looked lively in midfield \u2014 scampering after loose balls and showing tenacity in keeping possession. And in case you missed that aspect of his game, you could always watch the animated gifs of those fragments of action the next morning, as the case for the LDNLD award was made across social media. Writing this\u00a0<a>on Saturday night</a>, I can only imagine the equivalent renderings of the 17 year old\u2019s goal against Bolivia, that are currently being prepared for excitable distribution.</p> <p>The fact is that all this frothy conjecture might be a constant part of US soccer life, but it\u2019s also fairly meaningless until Klinsmann says otherwise. Including Pulisic in the final 23 sent a fairly clear signal of faith in the young player, but Klinsmann has also suggested this week that Pulisic might be under consideration as a starter.</p> <p>It\u2019s hard to see that, given that for various reasons Pulisic hasn\u2019t started any of this last week\u2019s three friendlies, but the general mood around him in team circles is discernibly different, more bullish, than moments when other young players were called into the team. Julian Green was always a long shot to feature, let alone start at the World Cup, even if he did his best to take his chance when it was already too late against Belgium.</p> <p>But Pulisic\u2019s Bundesliga pedigree is rather more credible than Green\u2019s when he arrived in the team and Klinsmann expects accordingly.\u00a0</p> <h2><strong>Gyasi Zardes is becoming a less polarizing presence</strong></h2> <p>Gyasi Zardes has had a strange and oddly privileged international career. When other attackers, with pedigrees at more storied clubs, have struggled for minutes or been given opportunities in the most testing of circumstances, Zardes has been repeatedly called up from the LA Galaxy to provide \u2026 well, it\u2019s not always clear.</p> <p>For sure Zardes offers pace, attacking width and an ever-improving sense of movement that owes plenty to an informal apprenticeship with Robbie Keane. But as time has gone on, and the young player has come under more focus, there have also been periods where he has looked like the place where promising attacks go to die.</p> <p>Too many runs into dead ends; too many poor touches at crucial moments when trying to make space for shots; too many moments where Zardes has looked nothing like a lethal international finisher.\u00a0</p> <p>Is that changing? Slowly, yes. If nothing else, Zardes has been one of the exemptions to the constant changing line ups under Klinsmann, and the benefits are that the players behind him have a rather better idea of his runs. With the game in a stalemate against Bolivia, one such Zardes run put him a step ahead to slide the opening goal past a stranded Guillermo Viscarra. A second goal came from being in the right place at the right time to finish an opportunistic US attack, and also, perhaps, offered a glimpse of future US line ups where Zardes is trusted to spearhead the attack rather than support such players.</p> <p>Zardes is still a way off that yet, but there\u2019s a general acceptance these days that for better or worse he\u2019s going to be part of the team going forward. Two goals in the USA\u2019s final warm-up game is about as much as can be asked of any striker.</p> <h2><strong>J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann won\u2019t change</strong></h2> <p>There\u2019s a fair chance that the team that started the second half against Bolivia, with Fabian Johnson and DeAndre Yedlin replacing Besler and Michael Orozco, was the team that starts against Colombia. Or at least it would make a certain sense. Or maybe he\u2019ll play Beckerman, or\u2026</p> <p>We should know better than to know what to expect from a Klinsmann team, even on the brink of a major tournament. Orthodoxy might suggest that the final tune up game should feature the favored tournament line up from the start, but Klinsmann instead opened the Bolivia game with yet another variation on a back four.\u00a0</p> <p>Perhaps Klinsmann wanted to avoid exhausting hard-working attacking backs like Johnson and Yedlin, coming off injury and a Premier League relegation battle respectively. With sweltering conditions across much of the country expected to continue into the tournament, how Klinsmann manages his playing resources may have a direct bearing on his team\u2019s fate. And if that\u2019s the case, it\u2019s hard to criticize a coach for paying attention to a facet of conditioning he arguably got wrong in the World Cup, by over-working the team physically in training.</p> <p>But watching the line up appear it was just as easy to believe that this was vintage Klinsmann \u2014 tinkering to the end. As we\u2019ve noted on Besler, he did a solid job in an unfamiliar position, while in front of the defense, the players eventually played themselves into a degree of rhythm and intensity that augured well for the tournament. It meant that by the time we did see the possible starting line up for the opening game, they were playing in a game that was essentially already over.\u00a0</p> <p>It ended up being a fun game to watch, and the US finished with a record victory over South American opposition, but like so much of what Klinsmann does during friendlies, the value of the game as preparation was somewhat obscured by the opaque nature of the coach\u2019s own process. At least his team will know to expect anything, especially from their coach.</p> <p><br /></p>",

There he identified opportunities for the CD in data storage and in entertainment media, and he moved on from research to lead efforts at bringing standards and uniformity to the conflicting interests and technologies that abounded in the 1990s.</p> <p>From 2000 he continued his work in leading cross-industry, cross-company efforts on CD and DVD standardisation, security and copyright protection, a field in which he was widely recognised for his role in securing the unification of the DVD format.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"016a50db09d424d30531f3c27b76974cda74a694\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/016a50db09d424d30531f3c27b76974cda74a694/0_25_433_541/400.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Bell with the first optical disk.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alan Bell with the first optical disk.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alan also played a leading role in negotiations that led to the development of DVD copy protection, without which the leading film studios would not have released content to DVD.</p> <p>Born in Brixton, south London, the son and first child of Ivy (nee Smith), a factory worker, and Ted, a printer, Alan grew up in Crawley, West Sussex, to where the family had moved in 1957. He attended Thomas Bennett comprehensive school in the town and went on to study at Imperial College, London, gaining a first class degree in physics, followed by a PhD in solid state physics in 1973.</p> <p>It was then that he went to take up a one-year research fellowship at RCA. He was accompanied by his wife, Patricia (nee Wilkinson), a haemotologist whom he had met during his doctoral studies in London. They were married from 1972 until their divorce in 2009.</p> <p>On retiring from full-time work, he spent a day or two a week with start-up companies in the entertainment media business, and represented Microsoft in cross-industry discussions about the future of the DVD. He also enjoyed photography when on his travels. Alan\u2019s legacy of achievement touches every one of us who watches DVDs or listens to CDs today.</p> <p>He is survived by his mother, his son, Geoff, daughter, Melissa, sister Janet, and his partner of three years, Lori.</p>",

      "headline": "Everything you ever wanted to know about vertigo (but were too dizzy to ask)",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-30T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Up to one in 10 people will experience vertigo, dizziness or unsteadiness in any given year. In the vast majority of cases, the symptoms are unpleasant but harmless, and get better without treatment. Vertigo is used by health profressionals to describe the feeling that you, or the world around you, is moving when it is not: Alfred Hitchock\u2019s masterpiece Vertigo is actually about a man\u2019s morbid fear of heights (acrophobia) and not true vertigo, although the terms are often used interchangeably.</p> <p><strong>Have I got dizziness or vertigo?</strong></p> <p>Specialist physiotherapist <a href=\"http://www.vestibular.co.uk/\">Nicola Harris</a> says \u201cdizziness covers a multitude of things. It can be a lightheaded feeling, like you are going to faint, which is more likely to be a cardiovascular or breathing pattern problem. Or you may feel unsteady on your feet. When you move your head, it can feel like what you are looking at has to \u2018catch up\u2019 with you afterwards.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Diego_Kaski\">Dr Diego Kaski</a>, neuro-otologist at London\u2019s Charing Cross hospital, says vertigo creates the illusion of movement. Normally, the brain recognises that you are moving by integrating signals from your eyes, inner ear and receptors that sense body movement in the neck and limbs. But in true vertigo, you feel as though you are standing still while the world moves around you.</p> <p><strong>What causes it? </strong></p> <p>Vertigo is often attributed to an inner ear infection called <a href=\"http://cks.nice.org.uk/vestibular-neuronitis#!topicsummary\">vestibular neuritis</a> that starts after a cold and can last for up to a couple of weeks. But Kaski says vertigo is often mislabelled as this when in fact <a href=\"http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/vertigo/basics/definition/con-20028216\">benign paroxysmal positional vertigo</a> (BBPV), and<a href=\"http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/neurology_neurosurgery/centers_clinics/vestibular/conditions/vestibular_migraine.html\"> vestibular migraine</a> are the more common and likely culprits.</p> <p>BPPV is a mechanical problem of the inner ear. We have crystals inside the inner-ear balance organs that move when we do, but if the signals lag behind those emitted from the eyes and limbs, it creates an illusion of movement. In vertigo, the inner-ear signals cause jerky, uncoordinated eye movements, known as nystagmus, which conflict with the brain\u2019s other movement signals. The repeated attacks usually last less than 30 seconds, and are precipitated by head movements including rolling over in bed or looking up.</p> <p><strong>It could be a migraine</strong></p> <p>One in 10 people with migraines get bouts of vertigo which come and go, that don\u2019t necessarily coincide with the more typical symptoms of a headache and can last from a few seconds to a few days. These people may be hypersensitive to light, noise and smells. The treatment is the same as managing migraine headaches: try to identify and avoid triggers, short-term painkillers and anti-sickness medication and long-term preventive treatments such as beta blockers.</p> <p><strong>How do I treat vertigo?</strong></p> <p>It depends on the cause. Medical advice for vestibular neuritis is to avoid bed rest and get back to normal life as quickly as possible. This kick-starts the brain into compensating for the vertigo so it doesn\u2019t become a long-term problem. BPPV can be cured by head movement exercises (for example, the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBzID5nVQjk\">Epley manoeuvre</a> or <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj0lJTUpfXMAhVhIsAKHVrECbwQFgguMAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.swbh.nhs.uk%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2012%2F07%2FBrandt-Daroff-Exercises-ML3094.pdf&amp;usg=AFQjCNHtu3IT1RFcawExcGWujRD9nA1ROw&amp;sig2=vyScQTlCns11K8oGpaQTSQ&amp;bvm=bv.122676328,d.ZGg\">Brandt-Daroff exercises</a>) that reset the inner-ear organ of balance. Kaski is exploring novel ways of delivering this treatment using <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23302708\">virtual reality glasses</a> and a mobile phone app. You will be guided through the exercises without having to wait months for an appointment with a trained physiotherapist. Drug treatment of BPPV doesn\u2019t work very well, according to Kaski. Prochlorperazine is good for nausea, but Betahistine, often prescribed by GPs, doesn\u2019t help much at the doses that are given.</p> <p>Kaski is interested in <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3870277/\">non-invasive brain stimulation</a>. An electrical coil is placed over the head overlying the part of the brain \u2013 the parietal lobe \u2013 that processes balance. Modifying the electrical activity in this may relieve vertigo.</p> <p><strong>Can it be caused by stress?</strong></p> <p>There is certainly a link to stress; animals, including us, rely on signals about movement of predators and prey to survive. Illusions of movement activate the<a href=\"http://www.med.or.jp/english/pdf/2006_04/153_157.pdf\"> autonomic nervous system, </a>which includes an adrenaline-fuelled fight-or-flight reaction. The extra adrenaline can cause unpleasant symptoms such as palpitations and anxiety. Conversely, anxiety itself can cause unsteadiness; people say it feels as if the world is moving under their feet.</p> <p><strong>Why do some people get vertigo more than others?</strong></p> <p>Some people are prone to vertigo because they are more <a href=\"http://www.neuropt.org/docs/vsig-physician-fact-sheets/visual-vertigo-motion-sensitivity.pdf?sfvrsn=2\">visually dependent</a> than others. This group will think they are moving because the signal from their eyes isn\u2019t being integrated with the information from their body. We all experience this to a certain extent; when you are sitting on a train and it pulls out slowly from the station, it can be hard to know what\u2019s moving.</p> <p><strong>What else could it be?</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Menieres-disease/Pages/Introduction.aspx\">Meniere\u2019s disease</a> is a rare condition that affects the inner ear. It causes sudden attacks of vertigo lasting two to three hours, with ringing in the ears (tinnitus) and progressive hearing loss. Harris says further investigations, scan and consultations are important if there are any red-flag symptoms suggesting more serious underlying disease. These rare but potentially dangerous conditions include <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Head-injury-severe-/Pages/Introduction.aspx\">head injuries</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Head-injury-severe-/Pages/Introduction.aspx\">strokes</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Multiple-Sclerosis/Pages/Introduction.aspx\">multiple sclerosis</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Acoustic-neuroma/Pages/Introduction.aspx\">acoustic neuromas</a> (benign growths on the nerve in the inner ear) and <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/brain-tumours/Pages/Introduction.aspx\">brain tumours</a>.</p>",

I suppose you would think a talented person is a famous actor or actress, or a dancer or a gymnast and all those snappy usual and attractive talents which you would think of straight away. Well, Harper\u2019s talent is that she can play any instrument without even learning a single note!</p> <p>One day Harper\u2019s beloved best friend, her cat Midnight, disappears and so do all the other cats in the town. Harper tries playing Midnight\u2019s favourite tune but even this doesn\u2019t bring her cat back. Harper knows she must team up with her friends, the other children in her apartment block, to find out what happened to the missing cats. Did they get lost? Had they been stolen? Had they moved out? Can the children solve the mystery with the help of the flying scarlet umbrella? Read this book to find out!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"5d29decadf164a9d3feb102d8e74b1990351ce1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d29decadf164a9d3feb102d8e74b1990351ce1b/0_0_257_400/257.jpg\" alt=\"harper and the scarlet umbrella\" width=\"257\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I really enjoyed this wonderful adventure book by Cerrie Burnell.

      "body": "<p>My partner, Jonathan Webber, who has died of cancer aged 58, was director of international trade at Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, former chair of the West Midlands Liberal Democrats and a lifelong cricket fanatic.</p> <p>Born in Oxford, Jonathan was the eldest of the three children of Deirdre (nee Millward), a schoolteacher, and John, managing director of a plastics company. He attended Culford school in Bury St Edmunds, but left with no formal qualifications.</p> <p>After studying drama and setting up a small business as a bookseller, Jonathan worked as a bus conductor in Exeter. There he met a Greek student, Kleio \u2013 and later hitchhiked 1,500 miles to Athens to be with her. He spent the next 18 years in Greece, becoming fluent in Greek and working as a literary agent publishing Greek versions of bestselling Penguin novels.</p> <p>After moving to Thessaloniki, he was asked to run the UK government division of the British Hellenic Chamber of Commerce to help stimulate business links throughout the Balkans \u2013 and he also started the Thessaloniki Cricket Club.</p> <p>Jonathan returned to the UK in 1995. He joined the Department of Trade and Industry, helping to promote British exports and advising on trade with Greece and the Balkans, before joining the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, where I met him, and where he became director of international trade in 2005.</p> <p>Jonathan led a series of EU-funded projects involving business development and institutional capacity building in Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan. He led 16 trade missions across the region, as well as hosting numerous business delegations from south-east Asia. On his last trip he accompanied the then deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, on a trade mission to India.</p> <p>Jonathan amassed a large collection of books, which filled the bookcases at his home and spilled on to the floor. He was knowledgable about Scandinavian glass, owning many pieces, and was an authority on Byzantine history.</p> <p>He was appointed MBE for services to international trade and development in the Queen\u2019s birthday honours in 2011. In 2014 he was made a deputy lieutenant in the West Midlands and received the president\u2019s award from the Liberal Democrat party.</p> <p>Jonathan is survived by me, by Michael, Daniel and Rania, his three children with Kleio, and by George, his son from his second marriage, to Susan, and by his mother, his brother, Mathew, and his sister, Abbie.</p>",

      "body": "<p>My friend Nicky Daw, who has died aged of cancer aged 65, was one of Hay-on-Wye\u2019s warmest and most distinctive characters in a town well populated with colourful people. She inherited a number of traits from her forebears that were to mark her life. Among them were her mother\u2019s flair for design and a bent for fighting injustice \u2013 one of her grandfathers was a founder of the <a href=\"https://www.nuj.org.uk/home/\" title=\"\">National Union of Journalists</a>, and Fabian socialism was the mindset of many of her uncles and aunts. She blended these traits with her warm personality and a mischievous sense of humour.</p> <p>Nicky was the daughter of Jane (nee Williams), a specialist in interior design, and John, a stockbroker. Born in London, she was largely brought up in Lewes in Sussex, where she attended the private Southover Manor school, followed by the <a href=\"http://www.sgscol.ac.uk/queensroad/queensroadart/\" title=\"\">Bristol School of Art</a>. She switched to reading English at <a href=\"http://www.bristol.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Bristol University</a> and then undertook teacher training.</p> <p>Her most fulfilling teaching period was her 17 years at the <a href=\"http://www.rnc.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Royal National College for the Blind</a> in Hereford. Quickly mastering braille, she was hugely popular with the students, both for her teaching and her counselling. She often had a vase of highly scented flowers on her desk, much appreciated by her students.</p> <p>She had gone to Herefordshire in the late 1970s with her husband, Pete, when her father told her he had a piece of land up a hill on which there was thought to be a hidden cottage. Hidden it was, behind a mountain of briars, but it became their first Herefordshire home.</p> <p>She was a persistent fighter against injustice. She cut her teeth as a demonstrator at Greenham Common and went on to protests both local and national, notably those against the Iraq war. To the pro-war David Blunkett she wrote in braille. He did not reply.</p> <p>Her talent for design showed itself especially in her house just outside Hay \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.lowerhousegardenhay.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Lower House</a> was chosen by the travel writer and publisher Alastair Sawday as the best British B&amp;B for a relaxing break. Nicky and Pete ran the business for 10 years, pulling out all the stops for the <a href=\"https://www.hayfestival.com/portal/index.aspx?skinid=1&amp;localesetting=en-GB\" title=\"\">Hay Festival</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps the finest aspect to Lower House was the gardens, Nicky\u2019s horticultural tour de force, open to the public under the <a href=\"http://www.ngs.org.uk/\" title=\"\">National Gardens Scheme</a> and to tours of gardeners from around the world. She displayed a fine balance between the formal and the wild: <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/species/snakes-head-fritillary\" title=\"\">snake\u2019s-head fritillaries</a> populated the grass banks in profusion, causing locals to make spring pilgrimages to see them. They were in flower when she died. Nicky is survived by Pete, by her children, Emily, Henry and Johnny, and her grandson, Milo.</p>",

      "headline": "Royal Ballet mixed bill review \u2013 a winning world premiere from Wayne McGregor",

      "body": "<p>As <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/wayne-mcgregor\">Wayne McGregor</a> has evolved from contemporary to classical choreographer, he has made deliberate use of the traditional balletic contrasts between male and female dancing. He plays with the extreme, airborne possibilities of the pas de deux and the skimming, stabbing language of pointe work. But in his latest work, he restricts himself to an all-male cast and, as a result, mines a captivating and challenging new language.</p> <p>Obsidian Tear is set to the music of <a href=\"http://www.esapekkasalonen.com\">Esa-Pekka Salonen</a>, pairing his violin piece Lachen Verlent with the orchestral work Nyx. The latter, whose title refers to the Greek goddess of night, inspires the imaginative world of the ballet, which is both archaic and futuristic, tribally male and intriguingly transgender. McGregor\u2019s nine men are dressed in kilts and tracksuit trousers created by a selection of contemporary designers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2550ed314680d00ed9a32473378117fbf7f77793\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2550ed314680d00ed9a32473378117fbf7f77793/0_181_2998_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alexander Campbell and Eric Underwood in Obsidian Tear\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alexander Campbell and Eric Underwood in Obsidian Tear.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the opening duet, <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/matthew-ball\">Matthew Ball</a> and <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/calvin-richardson\">Calvin Richardson</a> dance together like two androgynous, innocent beings. Their choreography catches the light of the music in floating caressing gestures, phrases that ripple through their bodies in curious tender eddies of shape and rhythm. When the sound shifts to the darker turbulence of Nyx, a harsher imperative takes hold: <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/edward-watson\">Edward Watson</a>, commanding and hieratic, dominates the stage, and his six followers are rougher, fiercer beings, capable of elegance but driven by more atavistic principles of male energy. As pure dance, this section is sharp, but the choreography is also an expression of male power, as the group test their acceptance of Ball and Richardson, and eventually eject the latter \u2013 symbolically the only dancer dressed in red rather than black.</p> <p>The pacing of the ballet\u2019s closing duet feels slightly off, yet Obsidian Tear is nevertheless one of McGregor\u2019s strongest works to date. It is fabulously danced \u2013 Richardson is a talent to watch \u2013 and saturated with invention and ideas. It also requires an astonishing wrench of sensibility to move from its finely calibrated ambiguities to the world of Kenneth MacMillan\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.kennethmacmillan.com/ballets/all-works/1960-1966/the-invitation.html\">The Invitation</a> \u2013 the middle work of a programme that also contains a superbly performed revival of Christopher Wheeldon\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/productions/within-the-golden-hour-by-christopher-wheeldon\">Within the Golden Hour</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b77eda5b5fe508350b4a84af2072b1e283dba044\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b77eda5b5fe508350b4a84af2072b1e283dba044/0_197_4980_2987/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Confrontational \u2026 a scene from The Invitation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Confrontational \u2026 a scene from Kenneth MacMillan\u2019s The Invitation.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>MacMillan choreographed The Invitation in 1960, and it\u2019s an odd transitional piece, a brutal story of rape that\u2019s couched within a much more old-fashioned ballet. Much of the choreography involved in the overlong scene-setting \u2013 a colonial house party filled with cute young people and their blase elders \u2013 feels like a poor imitation of Frederick <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/frederick-ashton\">Ashton</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cranko\">John Cranko</a>. Yet the characterisations, of the two young lovers and the married couple who corrupt them, contain moments of surprising and subtle psychology. <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/zenaida-yanowsky\">Zenaida Yanowsky</a> and <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/gary-avis\">Gary Avis</a> are excellent, tightly coiled as the unhappy Husband and Wife, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/oct/19/francesca-hayward-next-great-ballerina\">Francesca Hayward</a> is harrowingly good as the Girl. As she flinches from, and becomes fascinated by, her own sexual power, she seems genuinely innocent of the danger she is courting with the Husband. When the moment of rape arrives, the giddy girl is broken horribly, a victim of violence filled with self-disgust.</p> <p>\u2022 In rep at the <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/mixed-programmes/obsidian-tear-the-invitation-within-the-golden-hour\">Royal Opera House</a>, London, until 11 June.

I am in individual therapy and my partner and I recently started sex therapy. I still want to have sex and am very sexually frustrated; I just want to understand what I\u2019m going through and have some reassurance that this is temporary.</strong></p> <p>Therapy can awaken memories and elicit strong feelings. This is useful, because these phenomena are usually paths to healing. In the case of therapeutic work for survivors of sexual abuse, the healing process can shut down sexual interest for a while. This drop in libido is an attempt by the body and psyche to separate past coercive childhood sex from current consensual adult sex. In fact, some therapists advise survivors not to engage in partner sex during healing, and to help their partners understand and support this. Sexual coercion has a powerful effect on future adult sexuality. Some people emerge with a horror of sex, others are only comfortable when they have complete control during sex, certain individuals repeat earlier unhealthy sexual behaviours and so on. Once healing begins, survivors \u2013 as well as their partners \u2013 usually have to relearn how to connect sexually without aspects of lovemaking that owe a legacy to abuse.

      "body": "<p>It was a tale of two Americas. In Las Vegas the casinos were humming with a hell-yes tide that was about to sweep the manic Donald Trump to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/23/donald-trump-wins-nevada-caucuses-results\">his most pumped-up victory yet</a>. In Washington DC, civilisation still existed. In the week Trump\u2019s xenophobic bid to be the Republican presidential candidate began to look unstoppable, the man whose Americanness he has questioned was meeting 106-year-old <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/feb/23/10-milestones-in-black-history-that-virginia-mclaurin-lived-through\">Virginia McLaurin</a>. In Pete Souza\u2019s official White House photograph of their get-together, President Barack Obama cracks a delicious smile as the first lady dances with McLaurin, who was invited to visit the White House in recognition of <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/inspired-life/wp/2016/02/22/dancing-106-year-old-describes-the-day-she-charmed-the-obamas-i-can-die-smiling-now/\">community work she has done for decades in the US capital</a>. The meeting was also a celebration of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/blackhistorymonth\">Black History Month</a> \u2013 and Souza\u2019s picture manages to be both intimate and historic. Here are three African Americans in the White House. The room they are in \u2013 the Blue Room \u2013 is opulently decorated with gold stars, Empire-style furniture, and a portrait of some grand national father who holds a white handkerchief in his white hand.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3384967144637436c18fd52fcb61c9e6f547c97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3384967144637436c18fd52fcb61c9e6f547c97/0_0_2502_3500/715.jpg\" alt=\"Feb 2016 Watching the first lady dance with 106-year-old Virginia McLaurin in the Blue Room of the White House\" width=\"715\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Feb 2016 \u2013 Watching the first lady dance with 106-year-old Virginia McLaurin in the Blue Room of the White House</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is just one in a stream of vividly human and often funny photographs \u2013 released not just through White House press office, but on Flickr and Instagram \u2013 in which Souza has documented moments of the Obama administration that will never be forgotten. These photographs are precious historical documents. Critics from left and right blame the two-term presidency of this evidently intelligent and decent man for everything from the failure to close Guant\u00e1namo Bay (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/23/obama-guantanamo-bay-closure-plan-congress\">he\u2019s still trying</a>) to a continuing economic malaise that has fuelled what is shaping up to be the most extremist presidential election <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1860\">since 1860</a>. Yet Souza\u2019s photographs tell a different story \u2013 and the one that matters. Obama accomplished the impossible and made the White House an African American home for eight years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"ec8d2ea2870c068ced0194e8806ba8819ad0102e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec8d2ea2870c068ced0194e8806ba8819ad0102e/0_0_4096_2731/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nov 2009 Obama jokes with staff before the Summit of the Americas in Singapore\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nov 2009 \u2013 Obama jokes with staff before the Summit of the Americas in Singapore</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If the image ofMcLaurin \u2013 who was born in 1909, a time when the civil war was still a living memory for many Americans \u2013 visiting the first black US president does not communicate the soft power of the Obama age, consider some of Souza\u2019s other pictures. In 2012, he photographed Obama bowing to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/may/25/barack-obama-bows\">let five-year-old Jacob Philadelphia feel his head</a>. The boy had told Obama: \u201cI want to know if my hair is just like yours.\u201d The president had replied: \u201cTouch it, dude!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"540175025fd33c9371badfd9b96a70803a90ed5d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/540175025fd33c9371badfd9b96a70803a90ed5d/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"May 2009 Jacob \u00adPhiladelphia asked Obama if his hair was like his, so the most powerful man in the world bowed to a child\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">May 2009 \u2013 Jacob \u00adPhiladelphia asked Obama if his hair was like his, so the most powerful man in the world bowed to a child</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Jacob Philadelphia is just one in a long line of African American children who have met Obama in the White House, in encounters that have been touchingly, spontaneously, comically captured by Souza\u2019s camera.</p> <p>In a moving monochrome image, Souza showed three-year-old Clark Reynolds looking up in awe as <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/20/this-photo-of-obama-and-a-little-visitor-at-a-black-history-month-celebration-says-a-lot/\">Obama touches him on the cheek</a>. The photograph is taken from child height and brilliantly captures a child\u2019s-eye view of the president. We only see Obama\u2019s hand caressing Clark\u2019s face. Unlike the ones in all paintings and photographs of all previous presidents, it is not a white hand. How can anyone say that means nothing? Young Clark Reynolds evidently thinks it means something, and so does Souza, whose photography has perhaps become more lyrical, more poignant over Obama\u2019s final year in office.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d24efc35323b72767f4132f3adfd8e6696fde505\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d24efc35323b72767f4132f3adfd8e6696fde505/0_0_1000_1500/667.jpg\" alt=\"Feb 2016 Obama touches the face of three-year-old Clark Reynolds, in one of Souza\u2019s most moving photographs\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Feb 2016 \u2013 Obama touches the face of three-year-old Clark Reynolds, in one of Souza\u2019s most moving photographs</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not every delightfully warm and human moment recorded in Souza\u2019s White House pictures is a chapter in history, of course. A lot of the time, he simply captures Obama\u2019s sense of fun and quick-witted social grace. There is a great image of the president pretending to be caught in an invisible web, thrown by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2013/jan/04/white-house-pictures#img-19\">a boy in a Spider-Man costume</a>. In another lovely moment, the president demonstrates his best dad moves backstage before his daughter\u2019s dance recital. A more reflective portrait captures the tensions and secrets of power, as Obama is <a href=\"http://www.readingthepictures.org/2011/04/obama-playing-both-sides-against-the-middle/\">reflected in a White House mirror</a>, finger to his lips, deep in a conspiratorial conversation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"3ae7f2d7d2e5ae620212acd575d89ae24741cd6d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ae7f2d7d2e5ae620212acd575d89ae24741cd6d/0_0_4096_2731/1000.jpg\" alt=\"April 2011 Souza captures Obama at the heart of events, perhaps feeling the burden of his job\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">April 2011 \u2013 Souza captures Obama at the heart of events, perhaps feeling the burden of his job</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What made Souza such an ideal day-to-day chronicler of Obama\u2019s presidency? The answer is surprising. Before he recorded the White House life of America\u2019s first black president, Souza did the same job for the first Hollywood actor to rule from the Oval Office. From 1983 to 1989, he was <a href=\"http://www.musarium.com/stories/reagan/\">Ronald Reagan\u2019s official photographer</a>. Perhaps his <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Michael_Jackson_Reagan_Pete_Souza_1984.jpg\">most famous picture of that era</a> shows Ronald and Nancy Reagan meeting Michael Jackson, who is wearing a spangly military-style jacket. Reagan looks understandably confused \u2013 is this the king of pop or the commander of the Star Wars defence programme?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91e6ddcb00c27a97433bb5f758b1d0a82c801241\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91e6ddcb00c27a97433bb5f758b1d0a82c801241/0_0_2848_4288/664.jpg\" alt=\"Nov 2005 A young Obama ascends the Capitol steps\" width=\"664\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nov 2005 \u2013 A young Obama ascends the Capitol steps</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There may be more connecting Reagan and Obama than at first appears \u2013 and Souza can see it all. Both are great communicators. Neither let the pomp of office turn them into a stuffed shirt. Reagan, like Obama, had a human touch, a capacity to relate to people. Simply being human is a rare gift among modern politicians. Seeming relaxed in office is even rarer. Reagan was famously so laid-back that he could joke about nuclear war. He may have terrified peace activists, but the American public took confidence from the ease he projected.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"b488c6be62bcd190bdb8e607b5950ca4dfd116d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b488c6be62bcd190bdb8e607b5950ca4dfd116d4/0_0_2500_1718/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jan 2009 Humour, love and friendship \u2013 the Obamas share a joke in a lift on inauguration night\" width=\"1000\" height=\"687\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jan 2009 \u2013 Humour, love and friendship \u2013 the Obamas share a joke in a lift on inauguration night</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Obama, too, projects absolute ease in the presidency. It is not a love of power. Souza\u2019s photographs never show him looking arrogant, or distant, or dangerous. In these pictures, he always seems both happy and modest in his office: a photograph of him <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/10/01/barack-obama-fist-bumps-picture_n_1928838.html\">fist-bumping a cleaner in a government building</a> quietly captures his sense of the larger realities of inequality that will go on beyond his eight-year presidency.</p> <p>Reports on Souza\u2019s photographs tend to repeat over and over again that they show how \u201ccool\u201d this president is, but that word means nothing. These images tell the true story of a presidency that words have failed. After all the hate, anger, birther theories, leftist critiques, rightist critiques, and even the liberal white awe of a \u201ccool\u201d black dude vanishes into the babble of the past, Souza\u2019s photographs will tell the story of a leader who was calm under fire, unfazed by office, unquenchably human, and who showed the way for all the kids who passed through his Oval Office, and millions more, to be good people, good Americans, and good citizens of the world. Will we miss the man in these pictures? Hell, yes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"2e11820ba3f6d97524cdbf5fd3f87bb6e990b75e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e11820ba3f6d97524cdbf5fd3f87bb6e990b75e/0_0_1500_1069/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The president jostles with congressmen during a basketball game at the White House\" width=\"1000\" height=\"713\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>Above:</strong> Oct 2009 \u2013 The president jostles with congressmen during a basketball game at the White House. <strong>Below:</strong> March 2009 \u2013 Running down the White House\u2019s East Colonnade with Bo, the family dog.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"3d69d6a08a352338156639fc1d925949568416c7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3d69d6a08a352338156639fc1d925949568416c7/0_0_3500_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Running down the White House\u2019s East Colonnade with Bo, the family dog\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--immersive\" data-media-id=\"19f3d8296aa8fdc4a3c2d765f6edf729d9a7772d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/19f3d8296aa8fdc4a3c2d765f6edf729d9a7772d/0_0_1500_1000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Obamas\u2019 loving relationship is a very important part of their global popularity and this moment of private tenderness, taken by Souza during a public appearance captures it.

      "body": "<p>As the summer\u2019s sporting calendar again comes into view, another familiar ritual of the season is an anguished backward look at the Battle of the Somme, which the British army launched against the Kaiser\u2019s Germany on 1 July 1916. But should it share some of the anniversary attention?</p> <p>At the Somme, Britain suffered 20,000 dead on the first day alone, beginning a grinding attrition that staggered to an inconclusive end on 18 November 1916. Little wonder that it always overshadows a briefer passage of arms to break the first world war\u2019s military deadlock just a month earlier. Over in a few hours with 10,000 dead on both sides, it proved far more significant to the eventual allied victory.</p> <p> The naval Battle of Jutland, fought in the shallow waters of the North Sea 80 miles off Denmark on 31 May 1916, seems to be gathering a little more attention this year than usual. The BBC is showing Dan Snow\u2019s Battle of Jutland: The Navy\u2019s Bloodiest Day on Sunday. Scores are still being settled between supporters of the main British admirals, cautious Sir John Jellicoe, commander of Britain\u2019s Grand Fleet, and his swashbuckling cruiser chief, Sir David Beatty.</p> <p>Shrouded in mist and confusion during the battle, Jutland was instantly controversial and remains so. Who were the real winners and who the heroes or villains? Was it \u201cthe battle that won the war\u201d, as Jellicoe partisan and ex-defence minister, Admiral Lord West, reasserted on Radio 4. or a missed opportunity to repeat Nelson\u2019s comprehensive destruction of the French and Spanish fleets at Trafalgar in 1805 and end the war more quickly?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a4c52125ac029de786070f6c719d38ecdca946c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a4c52125ac029de786070f6c719d38ecdca946c3/0_186_5568_3341/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A sea cadet attends a service at a war graves cemetery to mark the Battle of Jutland on 28 May in South Queensferry, Scotland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A sea cadet attends a service at a war graves cemetery to mark the Battle of Jutland on 28 May in South Queensferry, Scotland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As a much diminished Britain prepares to debate the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/09/chilcot-report-iraq-war-inquiry-published-6-july\">painful findings of Sir John Chilcot\u2019s report</a> on the 2003 Iraq war, the \u201cJutland Controversy\u201d \u2013 as it quickly became known \u2013 serves to remind us of the fearsome cost of military miscalculation and how a victorious commander can be as readily pilloried for caution as a reckless one by a glory-hungry press.</p> <p>The basic facts  are that in 1898 the new German empire of Kaiser Wilhelm II decided to challenge Britain\u2019s centuries-old, worldwide naval dominance by building its first fleet. A naval arms race followed, focused on super battleships known as dreadnoughts. Britain won numerically, but new technologies, notably mines and submarines, complicated the equation. When war broke out in 1914, the Royal Navy set about blockading Germany while German U-boats sank allied shipping on a prodigious scale.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/may/29/tony-blair-comments-long-awaited-chilcot-inquiry-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4jqxa\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2518732\"            data-video-name=\"Tony Blair comments on long-awaited Chilcot inquiry \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"BBC One / The Andrew Marr Show\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-574ae0b4e4b006af16bc1a81\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/29/160529MarrBlair_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11317552&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11317552&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11317552&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11317552&amp;format=video/webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/may/29/tony-blair-comments-long-awaited-chilcot-inquiry-video\">Tony Blair comments on long-awaited Chilcot inquiry</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Both aimed to starve the other into submission while the rival fleets \u2013 one at Scapa Flow in the Orkneys, the other at Wilhelmshaven on the Jade bay of the North Sea \u2013 waited in stalemate as profound as in muddy Flanders. Heavily outnumbered, the imperial High Seas Fleet, commanded by Reinhard Scheer sought to even things up with raids on east coast towns such as Scarborough, hoping to lure Beatty\u2019s rapid response cruisers into a bitesized trap.</p> <p>Under pressure to help the German army, bleeding from another futile \u201cbreakthrough\u201d initiative around the French fort of Verdun, Scheer took his fleet to sea on 31 May 1916. But, not for the first or last time, British codebreakers were ahead of him. Jellicoe had already put to sea 28 dreadnoughts (against Scheer\u2019s 16) and other warships, bent on a counter-trap.</p> <p>In preliminary skirmishes between the lighter battlecruiser squadrons of admirals Franz Hipper and Beatty, Germany\u2019s relative novices sank more British ships, 14 to 11 lost, and claimed a great victory as soon as they got safely back to port. But as soon as he unexpectedly caught sight of Jellicoe\u2019s awe-inspiring Grand Fleet \u2013 opening fire and brilliantly positioned at high speed to destroy him in the rays of a setting sun \u2013 Scheer fled. He immediately turned his highly trained fleet 180 degrees and escaped his pursuers via a second bold change of course under cover of darkness.</p> <p>In London, Arthur Balfour (of Balfour Declaration fame), First Lord of the Admiralty after the Dardenelles-disgraced Winston Churchill, later remarked: \u201cIt is not customary for victors to run away.\u201d </p> <p>But, as its reaction to the Dublin Easter Rising had just shown the world, Whitehall\u2019s stuffed shirts were hopeless at PR. For several days the Germans were allowed to proclaim a triumph in what they called the Battle of Skagerrak, while London said nothing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0afcdc76585e80049296617cd98a86ce01515676\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0afcdc76585e80049296617cd98a86ce01515676/277_127_4521_2712/1000.jpg\" alt=\"British ships in the Battle of Jutland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">British ships in the Battle of Jutland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Express/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After all, Beatty\u2019s cruisers had been beaten by a smaller force, the 113,000 tonnage lost was, like the death rate, double Germany\u2019s loss, even when the Germans were forced to tell the whole truth about their own losses and damage. Short of information and outraged at its failure, the press turned on the navy. Battered ships returning to port were booed. The Admiralty had to call for Churchill\u2019s deft pen to restore some perspective.</p> <p> But Germany\u2019s tactical victory masked a strategic defeat of great consequence. As a New York newspaper explained to its readers, most of them keen to stay out of a European bloodbath, \u201cthe German fleet has assaulted its jailer, but it is still in jail\u201d. The blockade\u2019s slow strangulation continued. </p> <p>In consequence, Scheer swung his prestige behind those generals loudly demanding a resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare. It had already been twice attempted, then curtailed for fear of provoking war with the nascent power of the US. Now the desperate calculation became that, if Britain could be crippled, the war might be won on the western front \u2013 as it was soon to be against Russia \u2013 before the Americans could organise an army and intervene decisively.</p> <p>As with Hitler in 1940-41, Britain was waiting for an American intervention and German mistakes. Berlin duly took a conscious gamble and it failed. In April 1917, its mediation efforts spurned and its ships being sunk, an angry America entered the war and made the predicted difference. Four days after the 11 November 1918 armistice, when German admirals came to negotiate the surrender of their fleet to Beatty in the Firth of Forth, their sailors were in open mutiny, having refused a last-minute plan to attack the Grand Fleet.</p> <p>Instead they endured humiliation. One starving senior officer in the surrender party was caught stealing a piece of cheese from HMS Queen Elizabeth\u2019s table. Six months later, a week before the new German republic signed the humiliating Treaty of Versailles, their crews scuttled and sank most of the 74 rotting ships of the High Seas Fleet interned in Scapa Flow. Only then could Scheer talk of honour restored. </p> <p>But what of Jellicoe\u2019s honour? Churchill would later write that he had been \u201cthe only man on either side who could lose the war in an afternoon\u201d by way of a major defeat in the North Sea. A modest man, much-loved by his officers and men, Jellicoe was also a cautious perfectionist of centralising instinct. So Sir John turned his great battle fleet to the east \u2013 to port, not starboard \u2013 at the crucial moment at Jutland when Scheer did his U-turn. Going west would have offered greater opportunities to destroy the enemy, but also greater risk from submarines (torpedoes were Scheer\u2019s speciality) and from mines. Jellicoe was not a man to take a risk he didn\u2019t need to take. A draw that upheld Britain\u2019s dominant status quo was good enough.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c10178abf6af8a18f222ed04b1426bca8d60d8d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c10178abf6af8a18f222ed04b1426bca8d60d8d4/0_0_2862_4803/596.jpg\" alt=\"The bust of Admiral Sir John Jellicoe in Trafalgar Square seen during a wreath-laying ceremony to commemorate the Battle of Jutland\" width=\"596\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The bust of Admiral Sir John Jellicoe in Trafalgar Square seen during a wreath-laying ceremony to commemorate the Battle of Jutland.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He was right. But Beatty, a hunting-and-shooting socialite with a rich and glamorous American wife, let it be known almost immediately that he disagreed. He had done his job, delivering Scheer\u2019s fleet into Jellicoe\u2019s hands, in the \u201ccrossed T\u201d formation of which every admiral dreamed. Jellicoe had flunked it. </p> <p>The truth, as usual, was messier. Modern British battleship design had sacrificed armour plating for speed and those great 15-inch guns that now greet visitors to the Imperial War Museum had failings. Its shells were poorly designed and did less damage than they should. Communication between the Admiralty and the fleet, as well as between ships, was not that much advanced on Nelson\u2019s own, primitive by 1939 standards, let alone today\u2019s. </p> <p>Systemic failures were matched by tactical ones. Whitehall blundering failed to alert Jellicoe to Scheer\u2019s exact movements. More extraordinary still, Beatty failed to tell his chief where exactly the enemy was heading and at what speed \u2013 vital to interception in poor visibility \u2013 a silence that lasted from 4.45pm to 6.06pm. Later he would fiddle the record and suppress the official history of the battle to exculpate himself, as Nick Jellicoe, the admiral\u2019s grandson, <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/info/press/programme-information/jutland-ww1s-greatest-sea-battle\">explained on Channel 4 this month</a>.</p> <p>Beatty won the immediate PR war and got control of the levers of power. First succeeding Jellicoe as commander of the Grand Fleet (Jellicoe went ashore to be first sea lord), he then became first sea lord after the armistice while Jellicoe was dispatched to distant New Zealand as governor general. Never mind that Beatty\u2019s cruisers had been beaten by Hipper\u2019s inferior force. \u201cSomething wrong with our bloody ships today,\u201d he remarked as another one blew up with 1,000 lost lives. Poor gunnery practice and carelessness with safety regulations (to increase the rate of fire) was part of the story. Beatty\u2019s style was \u201cmore inspirational than preparation\u201d, Admiral West said on Radio 4.</p> <p>But Beatty was as glamorous and self-promoting as Jellicoe was not. He was made an earl and granted \u00a3100,000 by parliament, Jellicoe initially only a viscount (and \u00a350,000). Papers such as the Daily Mail and a string of early books promoted Beatty\u2019s version of events and denigrated Jellicoe. It was years before they were challenged, less by Jellicoe than by his outraged captains. </p> <p>In his own history of the war, The World Crisis, Churchill equivocated, torn between his awareness of Jellicoe\u2019s cautious wisdom and his own preference for the gloryseekers. In our own times, scholarly works such as Andrew Gordon\u2019s The Rules of the Game (1996) have put the arguments fairly in the wider context of their times.</p> <p> But the story is a familiar one, which will be as evident in the pages of the Chilcot report as the postmortem on Jutland. Political imperatives compromise military strategy, which veers between reckless and cautious. Poorly designed or outdated equipment is found wanting in the heat of battle. The armchair press and war-weary public longs for stirring victories and seek scapegoats when they do not happen. Politicians, officials and commanders shamelessly pass the buck and cover up their mistakes.</p> <p> Beatty made it up with Jellicoe to the extent of acting as a pallbearer at his funeral, despite evident poor health. It prompted a bystander to pass him a glass of brandy as the procession passed along Fleet Street, where he had won so many battles. Beatty died four months later. In 1948, busts of them both were unveiled in Trafalgar Square on the anniversary of Nelson\u2019s greatest victory. In death, as in all ambitious British admirals\u2019 lives, Nelson still overshadows them.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-30T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>An academy trust has been accused of segregating disabled pupils after announcing that it would bus children with special educational needs and disabilities from a well-performing school to a worse school because of limited resources.</p> <p>The Dean Trust, which runs schools in Trafford, Cheshire and Liverpool, has informed parents of children with special needs who are due to start at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2005/jul/05/1419education.schools\">Ashton-on-Mersey school</a> in September that, because of \u201climited resources\u201d, their children will attend lessons at the undersubscribed Broadoak school in Partington, six miles away.</p> <p>Justine Bailey, director of the Trafford Parents Forum, said parents were angered by the move. \u201cMany of the children want to go to Ashton. They don\u2019t want to go anywhere else. Their friends go there, their brothers and sisters go there,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Bailey said that allowing the Dean Trust to go ahead with the plans would give a green light to all academy trusts across England to move children between their schools without consulting parents. \u201cThe parents feel very strongly that it\u2019s discriminatory,\u201d she said. \u201cThey think it breaches so many parts of the Equality Act, the Human Rights Act and [principles of] inclusion, and it could most definitely lead to segregation.\u201d</p> <p>In the letter sent to parents, the headteacher of Ashton-on-Mersey school, Aidan Moloney, wrote: \u201cDue to pressure placed upon limited resources by the existing very large cohort of SEND [special educational needs and disabilities] pupils, Ashton-on-Mersey school has reached its capacity in delivery of SEND provision and therefore having to consider alternative options for this in future.\u201d</p> <p>He reassured parents that their child would still be on the roll at his school and that the school would continue to have responsibility for their education. Moloney argued that the lower number of pupils attending Broadoak would mean the pupils with special needs could be taught in smaller class sizes.</p> <p>Deborah Key, one of the parents to receive the letter, said she was determined that her 11-year-old son, Samuel, who has autism, would go to Ashton-on-Mersey.</p> <p>\u201cThey want him to go from an outstanding school with years of experience with children like Samuel to one where they don\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s discriminatory. They want to keep all the clever children at Ashton \u2013 getting very good GCSEs \u2013 and then put children like my son in a less high-achieving school.\u201d </p> <p>Broadoak school is rated \u201cgood\u201d by Ofsted and the number of pupils that achieve five A* to C grades at GCSE falls below the national average. Ashton-on-Mersey received an \u201coutstanding\u201d rating in its most recent inspection.</p> <p>Many parents expressed concern that their children would be identified as different if they were forced to board a special bus to travel between the sites. Katy McAinsh, whose 10-year-old son was hoping to start at Ashton-on-Mersey school in September, said: \u201cCan you imagine the kinds of comments that will be made when all of these children get on the bus every day. Children are cruel and they don\u2019t think.</p> <p>\u201cIf there\u2019s an issue with overcrowding at that school then why are they not bussing the non-disabled children out?\u201d</p> <p>Kate Green, the Labour MP for Stretford and Urmston and shadow minister for women and equalities, has written to the education secretary, Nicky Morgan, to ask what guidance the Department for Education gives academies about coeducating children with special educational needs and non-disabled children.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>\u201cAs you will be aware, there are often significant social and educational benefits for all children if those with special educational needs and those without study together for some, or possibly all, of their learning,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd of course parents will have a good understanding of what would be best for their children \u2013 yet their views do not appear to have been sought in advance of the proposals.\u201d </p> <p>Also writing to Morgan, the Trafford Parents Forum said it wanted her to provide an assurance that the school could not decide to send its members\u2019 children to another school within the academy trust when their education, health and care plans \u2013 drawn up by Trafford council \u2013 clearly stated that they would be best educated at Ashton-on-Mersey. </p> <p>The Children and Families Act of 2014 places a mandatory duty on an academy to admit a child with an EHC (education, health and care) plan that specifies that particular school. \u201cThey are segregating these children, but they are getting around the law by putting them on Ashton\u2019s roll, so technically they are going to Ashton, but they\u2019ll bus them [to another school],\u201d said McAinsh, whose son has ADHD and learning difficulties. </p> <p>Tarun Kapur, chief executive of the Dean Trust, said Broadoak school was well-equip\u00adped with outstanding support for children with special needs and that many pupils already split their education between the two schools because of the facilities for vocational training at Broadoak. </p> <p>\u201cWe fully understand our obligations and continue to explore how best to fulfil the terms of each child\u2019s plan,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, we are at the point where we cannot physically accommodate the increasing number of [dis\u00adabled and special needs] children in what is a mainstream school without resourced provision.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesperson for the Department for Education said it was aware of the concerns at Broadoak school and was in discussions with the council and the academy trust. \u201cOur priority is ensuring that the transition from primary to secondary school for pupils is as smooth as possible,\u201d they said.</p> <p>Articles 7 and 24 of the UN convention of the rights of persons with disabilities commits the UK government to promoting inclusive education of disabled children and young people and \u201cthe progressive removal of barriers to learning and participation in mainstream education\u201d. </p>",

Shorten goes negative in introduction, Turnbull accentuates the positive</strong></h2> <p>Bill Shorten attacked the government for having had \u201cthree economic plans in the last three months\u201d: one to increase the GST to 15%; one to allow states to levy income taxes; and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/06/company-tax-cut-plan-will-cost-482bn-over-10-years-treasury-reveals\">\u201c$50bn tax giveaway for large businesses in Australia</a>\u201d in the 2016 budget. </p> <p>Shorten called the tax cuts a \u201cvery expensive gamble\u201d because \u201cmuch of the money will go to overseas shareholders\u201d, and pointed out that $7bn of the tax cuts would go to the big four banks.</p> <p>Malcolm Turnbull was much more positive in his introduction \u2013 he saved <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/26/scott-morrison-says-67bn-black-hole-claim-a-tactic-to-flush-out-truth-from-labor\">criticism of Labor spending</a> for his closing speech. He spoke about company tax cuts and Indigenous entrepreneurship.</p> <p> Turnbull said government policies had created 39,000 more jobs for Indigenous Australians and were increasing the number of government contracts to Indigenous businesses 10-fold.</p> <h2><strong>2. Panel struggles to get Turnbull to talk about himself</strong></h2> <p>The first question, from Laura Tingle of the Australian Financial Review, was about whether Turnbull had let down voters who thought he would move politics to the centre and now felt he had abandoned what he believed in.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/29/no-winners-election-debate-night-answers-scripted-ideas-untested\">No winners on election debate night when answers were scripted and ideas untested</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In response, Turnbull talked about his and his wife Lucy\u2019s record of creating businesses, and countered Shorten\u2019s points on company tax cuts.</p> <p>Tingle was blunt in the follow-up: \u201cI don\u2019t think it actually answered the question, prime minister.\u201d</p> <p>Moderator Chris Uhlmann also tried to give Turnbull a steer: \u201cI think the question is about yourself, prime minister.\u201d</p> <p>But Turnbull denied the premise of the question \u2013 that he had changed views or let voters down. \u201cThe question is about where I stand, and where I stand on climate change is where I have always stood,\u201d he said. The early exchange showed the panel was more easily ignored than a crowd of ordinary voters getting their shot at the leaders, as in the first debate.</p> <h2><strong>3. Leaders trade \u201csame old Labor/Liberal\u201d barbs and won\u2019t commit to honour opponent\u2019s mandate</strong></h2> <p>Turnbull took aim at Labor for previously supporting company tax cuts but now opposing them. \u201cThey have no plan for economic growth and no plan for jobs. It\u2019s the same old Labor \u2013 just spending.\u201d</p> <p>Shorten shot back: \u201c[It\u2019s the] same old Liberals, just give tax cuts to the top end of town and let the rest of the people make do with not much at all. That\u2019s what I would say, Mr Turnbull.\u201d</p> <p>Call it the top hats versus hard hats election, voters have a distinct set of choices in this election and this exchange exemplified it. When Uhlmann asked if they would respect the mandate of their opponent if they lost, neither leader ruled out blocking their opponent\u2019s spending or savings in the Senate.</p> <p>Shorten rounded his answer out by promising Labor would provide cost forecasts for its policies over four and 10 years. \u201cOur principle is we will have more repairs to the budget bottom line than spends,\u201d he said.</p> <h2><strong>4. Turnbull says people smugglers will use Labor victory to sell boat trips</strong></h2> <p>Speaking about the challenge of deterring asylum seeker boats, Turnbull said people smugglers looked to changes in the debate in Australia as a marketing opportunity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/29/election-2016-turnbull-tells-leaders-debate-he-will-meet-tough-climate-change-targets\">Australian election 2016: we will meet tougher targets on climate change, Turnbull says in leaders' debate</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThey\u2019re out there marketing now, telling their customers that if Labor is elected it will be all on again. That\u2019s what they\u2019re saying,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cWe do no favours to anybody by being weak on border protection in the way Labor was. The truth is that Bill [Shorten] leads a party that is hopelessly divided on this issue.\u201d</p> <p>This provoked Shorten: \u201cShame on you, Mr Turnbull, for what you just said.\u201d But Turnbull was unrepentant, replying \u201cfor telling the truth\u201d.</p> <p>Shorten tried to turn the logic back on Turnbull, saying implying Labor was weak might give the green light to people smugglers. \u201cMr Turnbull is playing with fire when he says that somehow Labor would be a better deal, and he shouldn\u2019t say that, because he just conceded in his own remarks that the people smugglers are efficient and watching every bit of the debate.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>5. Shorten more specific about the best way to reduce emissions</strong></h2> <p>Tingle asked whether the Coalition\u2019s Direct Action climate policy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/27/election-2016-greg-hunt-coalition-emissions-trading-scheme\">would become more like Labor\u2019s after a safeguards mechanism is introduced</a> to prevent companies increasing their emissions.</p> <p>Turnbull committed to ensure that Australia would meet the target agreed to at last year\u2019s Paris climate talks and said \u201cwhen the global community agrees to higher targets, as I have no doubt it will, that we will meet them, too\u201d. But he would not be drawn on the safeguard mechanism and how the government would achieve reductions. Turnbull <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/09/malcolm-turnbull-labors-climate-targets-will-destroy-australias-bargaining-power\">attacked Labor\u2019s proposal as \u201cunilateral action\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Shorten had a few digs at Turnbull, saying he was implementing Tony Abbott\u2019s policies, but expressed hope for bipartisanship on the issue in future.</p> <p>\u201cThese are all real issues and I believe, I hope, this is the last election where we have the climate change wars and I know that if Labor is elected, hopefully then a Liberal opposition will learn to back in the science and deal away with the sceptics,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Shorten was also more specific about how to reduce emissions. He explained Labor\u2019s policy involved \u201ccutting pollution, and we do so through focusing on renewable energy, through our better vehicle emission standards, through revisiting the rate of land clearing through having an emissions trading scheme which is internationally linked\u201d.</p>",

      "headline": "Neal Ardley seeks Hollywood finale for AFC Wimbledon\u2019s remarkable rise",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-30T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>AFC Wimbledon, formed in the lower non-leagues 14 years ago by supporters who rejected the transplanting of their club to Milton Keynes, have reached Wembley: one play-off final victory from an astonishing promotion to League One. Following late-night delirium at Accrington Stanley, where Lyle Taylor\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/18/afc-wimbledon-accrington-stanley-league-two-play-off-semi-final-match-report\">extra-time goal won the</a> semi-final 3-2 on aggregate, the whole club is euphoric, trying to knuckle down to the tough business of facing Plymouth Argyle in the final on Monday.</p> <p>The manager, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/nov/30/neal-ardley-afc-wimbledon-mk-dons\">Neal Ardley, his status as a former Wimbledon player</a> meaningful to supporters who fought so hard for their club\u2019s identity, describes the Accrington celebrations as \u201cemotional, a bit surreal\u201d. Speaking at the club\u2019s south London training base on Tuesday, Ardley did not even attempt to be matter-of-fact about leading his side out at Wembley.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t buy into that idea that it\u2019s only another game, that you don\u2019t play the occasion, you play the game,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody can replicate Wembley. When we walk out, I\u2019ll be proud, my emotions will be all over the shop. I\u2019m going to be feeling the butterflies and the players will feel the same. But once we\u2019ve walked out, put our shoulders back, smiled, gone \u2018wow\u2019, we\u2019ve got a job to do. We\u2019ve got to take all of that in, embrace it, accept it and then go and play the game.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/copa90/2016/may/18/afc-wimbledon-players-fans-manager-league-two-play-off\">AFC Wimbledon: their manager, fans and staff on their rise through the leagues</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Argyle, Ardley accepts, are marginally favourites, having finished fifth in League Two, six points ahead of Wimbledon in seventh place, although Ardley\u2019s side beat them 2-1 away in April during an excellent run into the play-off places. Taylor, only 26 but at his ninth club, has scored 21 league goals, his partnership with Tom Elliott keeping their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/mar/22/ade-akinfenwa-northampton-town\">striking talisman, Adebayo Akinfenwa</a>, as a substitute.</p> <p>Akinfenwa, whose abundant talents can be overlooked in the focus on his huge size and strength, said there is a unity at the club which has eased his disappointment and he came off the bench at Accrington to score the first goal in the 2-2 away draw.</p> <p>\u201cPraise has to go to the gaffer,\u201d Akinfenwa said. \u201cHe has assembled a team, a mix of young players and more experienced players like myself and [the captain] Barry Fuller, and there is an ethos of togetherness. I haven\u2019t played as much as I\u2019ve wanted but I never felt disrespected. To walk out at Wembley, for this club which the fans started from nothing \u2013 it\u2019s the stuff of dreams.\u201d</p> <p>At a club to whom history means so much, following the perceived theft of theirs when a panel appointed by the Football Association voted in 2002 to allow a groundless <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/aug/12/match.sport3\">Wimbledon to move to Milton Keynes</a>, the significance of the final is monumental. Ardley said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d agrees with supporters who feel their club, not MK Dons, is the continuation of the old Wimbledon and this is their first competitive trip to Wembley since the landmark \u201ccrazy gang\u201d <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/may/15/dave-beasant-wimbledon-liverpool\">FA Cup victory over Liverpool in 1988</a>.</p> <p>If they win, it will be Wimbledon\u2019s sixth promotion since they began as a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/copa90/2016/may/18/afc-wimbledon-players-fans-manager-league-two-play-off\">newly formed, supporter-owned club in the Combined Counties League</a> following a trial of players on Wimbledon Common. And promotion would put them, after so short a time, in the same division as the Milton Keynes club they still revile as \u201cthe franchise\u201d.</p> <p>Revulsion is felt deeply for MK Dons themselves and for the FA panel which, by a 2-1 majority, allowed the unprecedented relocation. Ardley needs no encouragement to quote and scoff at the opinion of the panel, that if the supporters were to reject the Milton Keynes move, and form their own club, it would not be \u201cin the wider interests of football\u201d.</p> <p>Ivor Heller, commercial director since the 2002 beginnings, said of that: \u201cEverybody still talks about it; it was a great catalyst for everything we\u2019ve done. How anyone could suggest a club like ours is not in the wider interests of football: you\u2019d have to be stark raving bonkers.\u201d</p> <p>The mix of idealism and knowhow required to negotiate the play-off final has characterised the Wimbledon way since they began again. Their ambitious plan to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/10/afc-wimbledon-new-stadium-plough-lane\">build a new 11,000-seat stadium</a>, capable of expansion to 20,000, back in their home borough of Merton hit an obstacle in March when Boris Johnson, then still the London mayor, \u201ccalled in\u201d the project.</p> <p>Johnson\u2019s own planning officials <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/10/afc-wimbledon-new-stadium-plough-lane\">had recommended the stadium be approved</a>, as it was unanimously by Merton council, but his reference to \u201cthe future of cultural and sporting venues\u201d appeared to express concern about the loss of the Wimbledon greyhound stadium if the development goes ahead. The new mayor, Sadiq Khan, must be persuaded.</p> <p>Erik Samuelson, the club\u2019s chief executive, explained that the \u201cmid-20s millions of pounds\u201d cost will be met partly from a developer, Galliard Homes, which is proposing to build 602 residential units, some borrowings and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/17/chelsea-afc-wimbledon-kingsmeadow\">the sale of the club\u2019s current Kingsmeadow stadium to Chelsea</a>.</p> <p>Samuelson defended the position relating to Kingstonian, the Ryman League Premier Division club which previously owned Kingsmeadow. By 2002 Kingstonian had fallen into administration and the ground was bought by a family of investors, the Khoslas, from whom the new supporter-owned Wimbledon purchased it. Kingstonian have remained as tenants on good terms and Samuelson said Wimbledon will pay a substantial sum, so far not disclosed, from the Chelsea money to enable Kingstonian to become established elsewhere.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a windfall opportunity for them to get at least an equity share of their own stadium or many years rental money, so actually this is really positive,\u201d Samuelson said.</p> <p>If Wimbledon achieve another dream at Wembley, Samuelson said he believes they can be sustainable in League One, even before the new stadium is built. Ardley\u2019s target is to keep Wimbledon four places above where they would be in a table of the wages each club pays.</p> <p>\u201cA manager has to add value,\u201d Samuelson said. \u201cNeal is such an impressive guy. He will go a long way but we desperately hope he will go a long way with us.\u201d</p> <p>If Ardley\u2019s achievements do earn him an offer from another club too good to turn down, Samuelson said, his contract has a buy-out clause which means Wimbledon would be well compensated.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/apr/01/the-afc-wimbledon-film-might-seem-like-a-curveball-actually-its-an-open-goal\">The AFC Wimbledon film seems like a curveball \u2013 actually it's an open goal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Asked about Wimbledon\u2019s rise, under the ownership of supporters, in 14 years from that FA panel decision, Ardley said: \u201cThis is the most unique story in football, AFC Wimbledon. The story is football, it\u2019s for the greater good of football. Every time I talk about this story I go wow; no wonder they want to make a film about it.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, last month the club announced that 20th Century Fox, with the author and Wimbledon patron John Green, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/apr/01/the-afc-wimbledon-film-might-seem-like-a-curveball-actually-its-an-open-goal\">has bought the rights to turn their story into a movie</a>. It has been proposed that it ends with the club\u2019s 2011 victory on penalties which took them deliriously into the Football League. If they win at Wembley, the Hollywood script might have to be extended.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Malcolm Turnbull conceded bipartisanship on climate change was desirable and committed to meet higher targets if set by the global community in the second leaders\u2019 debate of the Australian election campaign.</p> <p>But the prime minister failed to outline how Australia would reach the 2030 emission reduction targets <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/dec/12/what-does-paris-climate-agreement-mean-for-australia\">agreed to in Paris</a>. Bill Shorten, the Labor leader, baited Turnbull, asking: \u201cWhatever happened to the old Malcolm Turnbull on climate change?\u201d<br /></p> <p>\u201cYou were so impressive when you were leading on climate change,\u201d Shorten said. \u201cNow you\u2019re just implementing Tony Abbott\u2019s policies.\u201d<br /></p> <p> Turnbull, who lost the Liberal leadership to Tony Abbott in 2009 over his commitment to climate change policy, said the Coalition completely supported the science of global warming. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/29/no-winners-election-debate-night-answers-scripted-ideas-untested\">No winners on election debate night when answers were scripted and ideas untested</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cBipartisanship is always desirable on issues \u2013 long-term issues \u2013 like this,\u201d Turnbull said.</p> <p>\u201cMy view is, as somebody who is committed to action on climate change and who has paid a high price for my commitment to that issue, for my commitment to global action in the past \u2013 my commitment is to ensure that Australia meets the target we agreed to in Paris. And when the global community agrees to higher targets, as I have no doubt it will, that we will meet them, too.\u201d</p> <p>Shorten attacked Turnbull\u2019s support for Abbott policy of Direct Action which created the existing emissions reduction fund \u2013 a policy he <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/sep/14/malcolm-turnbull-the-three-things-we-need-to-know-about-the-challenger\">originally described as bullshit</a>.</p> <p>No clear winner emerged out of the second debate, held at the National Press Club in Canberra before a panel of press gallery journalists. The issues raised included asylum seekers, tax policy, trust, superannuation policy and whether the new government would emerge with a mandate, particularly in the senate.</p> <p>Turnbull began the debate with a pitch on the rise of the middle class in Asia, which he said represented both \u201copportunity and uncertainty\u201d. \u201cWithin a few years, half of the world\u2019s middle class will be living to our north in east Asia,\u201d Turnbull said.</p> <p>\u201cWe have seen the pace of change in technology as great businesses and great industries are overtaken by newcomers. These are times of enormous opportunity and uncertainty.<br /></p> <p>\u201cWe measure the economy in numbers and percentages and growth figures. But where it counts is with every single Australian\u2019s life and their opportunities.\u201d</p> <p>Turnbull invoked Indigenous innovation as an example of both reconciliation and an opportunity for \u201cjobs and growth\u201d.</p> <p>Shorten used his introduction to outline his health and education policies \u2013 considered strengths for Labor \u2013 while comparing the government\u2019s corporate tax cuts to the policies of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>\u201cThese economic theories have been tested before by Thatcher and Reagan but it\u2019s a very risky expensive gamble to take with Australian taxpayer money for little economic benefit,\u201d Shorten said. \u201cLabor has the best plans to ensure real jobs, genuine growth and fairness.\u201d </p> <p>The first question addressed the issue of apparent voter disappointment that Turnbull has been inhibited by his party since becoming prime minister. \u201cWill they see a different Malcolm Turnbull if you win your own mandate to the one that they see now?\u201d <br /></p> <p>Turnbull failed to address the question, instead using climate change as an example of how his views had not changed.</p> <p>Shorten honed in on voter disappointment in Turnbull and linked the prime minister back to his predecessor Tony Abbott.</p> <p>\u201cWhen Mr Turnbull got elected eight or 10 months ago, I thought my job would be harder but I thought the politics would go to a better place in this country,\u201d Shorten said. </p> <p>\u201cI thought we would see a more elevated debate about ideas but on each issue I see this government shrinking in to an Abbott-style government of three-word slogans and scare campaigns.\u201d</p> <p>Both men were asked how they could be trusted when Turnbull deposed Abbott and Shorten was involved in moving against the former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd and then supported Rudd against Julia Gillard. </p> <p>Shorten said Labor had learned from the 43rd parliament. \u201cLabor\u2019s learnt its lesson about that difficult period and I\u2019m fortunate to lead a very united team,\u201d Shorten said.</p> <p>Both men invoked the influence of their parents, Shorten his mother and Turnbull his father. The prime minister delivered a very personal pitch for voter trust.<br /></p> <p>\u201cI had a great education, I was brought up by a single dad who didn\u2019t have much money,\u201d Turnbull said. \u201cAnd he struggled to send me to school, and I had some really charismatic teachers that transformed my life. I would not be where I am today without them.</p> <p>\u201cI am a well-known quantity in Australian public life. I did not come into this role as apolitical activist. Did not come in here as a political staffer. I came into this role as an adult. At 50. After a lifetime of working, building businesses.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Asked if Labor had a ceiling on how much tax should be collected as a proportion of the economy, Shorten would not reveal total costings but promised to reveal forecasts before the election.<br /></p> <p>\u201cI undertake before this election campaign is over we will provide all of our forecasts once we have released all of our policies \u2013 which we haven\u2019t yet,\u201d Shorten said. </p> <p>Turnbull was asked how company tax cuts would improve jobs rather than be passed on the shareholders.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/gallery/2016/may/29/turnbull-and-shorten-face-off-in-australian-leaders-debate-in-pictures\">Turnbull and Shorten face off in Australian leaders debate \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe companies up to $10m in turnover employ 5 million Australians and they will all benefit from that support because they will see more investment in their business. This is why other countries have reduced their company tax rate,\u201d Turnbull said.</p> <p>Four weeks into a double dissolution election on the Australian Building and Construction Commission following a combative Snate, neither leader would promise to respect the other\u2019s mandate in the next parliament. </p> <p>And Turnbull again promised never to bring any asylum seekers on Nauru and Manus to Australia. \u201cI can rule out any of the detainees coming to Australia,\u201d Turnbull said.</p> <p>\u201cLabor taught all of us a very, very harsh lesson. They proved what happens if you abandon secure borders. Thousands of arrivals, deaths at sea, the people smugglers back in business.\u201d</p> <p>Shorten again promised Labor have an identical policy on people smuggling. </p> <p>\u201cWhoever forms the government after 2 July, there will be no change in policy about our determination to defeat the people smugglers, the criminal syndicates who play and prey upon people, taxi them out to sea and in too many tragic cases drown,\u201d he said.</p> <p>But he said he would instruct his immigration minister to talk immediately to the UN about resettling asylum seekers in offshore detention on Nauru and Manus.</p>",

      "body": "<p>This revival is an exercise in unalloyed nostalgia for <a href=\"www.wno.org.uk\">Welsh National Opera</a>, celebrating its 70th anniversary in strong musical form. In 1946, the Mascagni and Leoncavallo pairing \u2013 familiarly known as Cav &amp; Pag \u2013 marked the company\u2019s first production; Elijah Moshinsky\u2019s classic take was created for WNO\u2019s half-century, hence its re-emergence now. Moshinsky and designer Michael Yeargan mix the charm and claustrophobia of southern Italian village life as seen from two perspectives, 50 years apart: Cavalleria Rusticana is set at the end of the 19th century when it was composed; Pagliacci has been updated to the 1940s. The themes of love and betrayal seem sharply contemporary, as <a href=\"www.carlorizzi.com/about/biography\">Carlo Rizzi</a>, conducting from memory and with uttermost conviction, ensures their emotional veracity. The WNO chorus and orchestra assert themselves with pride.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3e2111fbec60787bf05183a36da12f6414133f00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3e2111fbec60787bf05183a36da12f6414133f00/257_536_3518_2111/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Camilla Roberts in Cavalleria Rusticana\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Camilla Roberts in Cavalleria Rusticana</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The biggest challenge is faced by the singers who sing in both operas.

Pagliacci\u2019s circus and play-within-a-play elements retain their colourful appeal, but it is the contrast of innocent facade with the ugliness of the double stabbing, with its echo of the previous opera\u2019s off-stage vengeance murder, that reinforces the double bill\u2019s gutsy perennial punch.</p>",

Voters were promised repeatedly at elections that net migration could be cut to tens of thousands. This promise is plainly not achievable as long as the UK is a member of the EU and the failure to keep it is corrosive of public trust in politics,\u201d the letter states.</p> <p>With 25 days to go until polling, Patel also took a swipe at remain campaign leaders Cameron and the chancellor, George Osborne, in the Sunday Telegraph, even though she did not directly name them in the article. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s shameful that those leading the pro-EU campaign fail to care for those who do not have their advantages. Their narrow self-interest fails to pay due regard to the interests of the wider public,\u201d Patel writes. <br /></p> <p>\u201cIf you have private wealth or if you work for Goldman Sachs you\u2019ll be fine. But when public services are under pressure, it is those people who do not have the luxury of being able to afford the alternatives who are most vulnerable,\u201d she sayswrites.</p> <p>\u201cGetting your child a place in your local school becomes more and more difficult; there is more competition for jobs; wages are held down.\u201d</p> <p>As the war of words heightened, the Tory former PM Sir John Major accused the leave side of telling deliberate untruths. </p> <p>\u201cThey have \u2013 knowingly \u2013 told untruths about the cost of Europe. They have promised negotiating gains that cannot \u2013 and will not \u2013 be delivered. </p> <p>\u201cThey have raised phantom fears that cannot be justified, puffing up their case with false statistics, unlikely scenarios and downright untruths. To mislead the British nation in this fashion \u2013 when its very future is at stake \u2013 is unforgivable,\u201d Major writes in the Mail on Sunday.</p> <p>In another dig at the prime minister, the justice secretary ridiculed Cameron\u2019s insistence that Turkey was not set to join the EU, saying: \u201cYou\u2019re having us on.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Gove indicated this was the latest in a series of \u201clies\u201d regarding EU membership. He told the Sun on Sunday: \u201cPeople are fed up with being told, don\u2019t worry, this thing isn\u2019t going to happen and then they wake up a year or two later and it has.</p> <p>\u201cThey were told in 1975 when we joined the common market that it wasn\u2019t going to mean anything for our democracy and our parliament and for all of us. That was a lie. Now we\u2019re being told don\u2019t worry, Turkey won\u2019t join.\u201d </p> <p>The justice secretary also hit back at claims theleave campaign is fuelled by prejudice. \u201cWhen people fling the charge of racism, what they are actually doing is attacking working-class people for wanting to maintain a decent standard of living. I think that\u2019s wrong,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Cameron was cheered by a survey of more than 600 economists who agreed with him that Brexit would damage the UK economy. More than 80% of the economists surveyed by Ipsos Mori for the Observer believed withdrawal would have a negative impact on household incomes, while 61% thought it would fuel unemployment. </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/may/29/general-election-christmas-tory-backbencher-european-union-david-cameron-audio\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4jq2f\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2518764\"            data-video-name=\"General election needed before Christmas, says Tory backbencher \u2013 audio\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-574b04e1e4b006af16bc1b0b\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/29/160529Bridgen5Live_1_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11317554&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11317554&amp;format=video/webm\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11317554&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11317554&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/may/29/general-election-christmas-tory-backbencher-european-union-david-cameron-audio\">General election needed before Christmas, says Tory backbencher</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Labour former prime minister Tony Blair told wavering voters considering Brexit: \u201cIf you\u2019re not sure, don\u2019t do it,\u201d as he wrote in the Sunday Times that withdrawal would be a \u201cbetrayal of British interest\u201d. </p> <p>However, Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen said Cameron was \u201cfinished\u201d as Tory leader because of the way his \u201cOperation Fear\u201d tactics had divided the party.</p> <p>In an interview with the BBC, Bridgen said that pro-Brexit Tory MPs were so angry about the \u201cexaggerated\u201d claims made by Cameron during the campaign that it was \u201cprobably highly likely\u201d that at least 50 would demand a no confidence vote \u2013 the number needed under party rules to ensure one takes place.</p> <p>If remains wins the EU referendum, Cameron would probably win a confidence vote quite comfortably. But a sizeable vote against him could fatally weaken his authority, possibly forcing him to name a date for his departure from No 10.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-30T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Property investors provided Dominic Chappell with the \u00a335m needed to show Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia group that he was a credible buyer for BHS, it has emerged. Allied Commercial Exporters (ACE) then went on to make millions from a series of real estate deals with the department store chain.</p> <p>ACE, which is run by Guy and Alexander Dellal, the son and grandson of property investor <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/nov/08/jack-dellal\">\u201cBlack Jack\u201d Dellal, </a>backed Chappell\u2019s takeover with the consortium Retail Acquisitions before buying an office block from BHS and loaning the retailer money at such a fierce interest rate that it was known by management as the \u201cWonga\u201d loan.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Arcadia executives told MPs investigating the collapse of BHS that the \u00a335m payment was vital in determining the credibility of Retail Acquisitions, the consortium led by Chappell, before it bought BHS in March 2015.</p> <p>Paul Budge, Arcadia\u2019s finance director, said: \u201cWe actually asked them to make sure that they deposit \u00a335m with Olswang [Retail Acquisitions\u2019 lawyers] in the Olswang client account to confirm their intentions. If we were going to go forward, sign up some heads of terms and give them a period of exclusivity, they had to do that. So they put \u00a335m into an escrow.\u201d</p> <p>Mishcon de Reya, the legal firm acting for ACE, confirmed the payment had been made by ACE. It said: \u201cIn February 2015 an amount of \u00a335m was transferred by Mishcon de Reya on behalf of ACE to the client account of Olswang against an Olswang solicitors\u2019 undertaking to repay on demand.\u201d</p> <p>Sources close to Arcadia said the group was unaware that ACE had made the payment on behalf of Retail Acquisitions at the time, but subsequently became aware of their involvement. \u201cBlack Jack\u201d Dellal helped to finance Green\u2019s takeover of retail group Sears in 1998. However, sources close to the deal said Chappell was an associate of Alexander Dellal and that was how the agreement came about. \u201c[Arcadia] didn\u2019t know he knew him,\u201d a source said.</p> <p>Following the \u00a335m payment, on the day that Retail Acquisitions bought BHS from Arcadia for \u00a31, ACE bought North West House, a BHS office building next to its headquarters in north London. ACE acquired the building from BHS for about \u00a333m. Two months later ACE sold the building for \u00a338m.</p> <p>ACE also lent \u00a35m to Retail Acquisitions in March, which was paid back when BHS sold its warehouse in the Midlands in August, and loaned \u00a325m to BHS, which cost the retailer \u00a36m in interest and fees in just three months.</p> <p>The profits from the sale of North West House and the charges on the loans mean that ACE collected more than \u00a310m from its dealings with Chappell and BHS. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by ACE. The company has said the various agreements were not connected and at commercial rates.</p> <p>The fact that ACE backed the deal raises further questions about whether Chappell had the financial strength to take control of BHS. Chappell has been declared bankrupt three times and had little experience of the retail industry.</p> <p>The Guardian revealed on Friday that a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/27/5m-windfall-cited-bhs-buyer-bolster-credentials-disputed-dominic-chappell\">\u00a35m \u201cbonanza\u201d cited by Chappell to bolster his business credentials</a> when buying BHS was an accounting estimate and not the cash payment he had previously claimed.</p> <p>Chappell had presented the windfall in the accounts of Olivia Investments, his family\u2019s holding company in Gibraltar, to counter concerns that the former bankrupt had little relevant experience when acquiring the retailer in 2015.</p> <p>BHS collapsed into administration last month with a pension deficit valued at about \u00a3571m. The retailer has been saddled with the deficit despite <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/bhs-philip-green-family-millions-administration-arcadia\">Green and other investors collecting more than \u00a3580m</a> in dividends, rent and interest payments during his ownership.</p> <p>The retailer was owned by Green for 15 years until he sold it for \u00a31 to Retail Acquisitions, a consortium of little-known accountants and lawyers led by Chappell. Retail Acquisitions received payments of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/bhs-owner-retail-acquisitions-25m-administration\">more than \u00a325m from BHS</a> during its 13-month ownership of the retailer.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/26/portuguese-backed-consortium-close-to-deal-for-bhs\">Administrator Duff &amp; Phelps is in talks with a Portuguese-backed consortium about a rescue deal for BHS</a>. The consortium is being led Greg Tufnell, the former managing director of Mothercare and Burton, and the brother of former England cricketer Phil Tufnell.</p> <p>An announcement about a rescue deal is likely on either Wednesday or Thursday.</p> <p>Chappell did not respond to requests for comment. </p>",

Something has changed in her voice, however: the cracks are now crevices, offsetting the lunar coolness of her new music. Orton may have produced contrasting work since her 1990s chillout-queen days, but her tone has matured to the point at which it claws through the gauzy electronic fabric of her just-released seventh album, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/26/beth-orton-kidsticks-review-radical-reinvention-is-as-dreamy-as-ever\">Kidsticks</a>.</p> <p>Her change in tone is amplified by the pristineness of this recently reopened arts centre. The glacial loops of Moon, and the grumbles that run through Petals, melt into the cool air, leaving Orton\u2019s husky voice adrift, often, but not always, arrestingly. Later, the world\u2019s least obtrusive guitarist and drummer plump up Falling\u2019s grey-zone vagueness as Orton murmurs over the top. All of these elegant little drifters were written while she was living in Los Angeles, and it\u2019s a relief when she throws in scuffed mementos of 90s England in the form of Central Reservation and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFZc4ax4tJs\">She Cries Your Name</a>. It\u2019s a pleasure to see that she has matured \u2013 Kidsticks is about her experiences of motherhood \u2013 without California buffing away her awkwardness.</p>",

You\u2019ll notice none of that actually addresses the exact economic benefits of the company tax cuts he is proposing as the central reason people should vote for him.</p> <p>Tingle tried to get Shorten to say whether Labor had an upper limit in mind for spending as a proportion of the economy, but that didn\u2019t get far either. After a long attack on Turnbull\u2019s tax cut plan (the calculation that it would benefit the largest banks in Australia by $7.4bn over the next 10 years got a mention multiple times), the Labor leader got around to saying he was determined to put \u201cdownward pressure\u201d on spending as a proportion of GDP, whatever that might mean.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/27/election-2016-greg-hunt-coalition-emissions-trading-scheme\">Hunt plays the long game on his glaringly obvious emissions trading scheme | Lenore Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Andrew Probyn, from the West Australian, tried to steer around the \u201cstop the boats\u201d rhetoric to get some idea what each leader would do about the humanitarian problem of 1,600 refugees and asylum seekers languishing on Manus Island and Nauru. Not much doing there either. </p> <p>Each gave a lengthy \u201ctough on people smugglers\u201d dissertation, before Turnbull eventually got around to saying, \u201cwe are committed to ensuring that they are treated humanely and have the opportunity to return from whence they came, to the countries they came from, or be resettled in other countries\u201d, but without saying which other countries, or when, or how.</p> <p>Shorten said he would send his immigration minister to \u201csit down with the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, to work through how we can have regional resettlement which stops people being kept in indefinite detention\u201d \u2013 which doesn\u2019t really answer the where, how or when questions either.</p> <p>The angry spark in that exchange had nothing to do with how the asylum seekers might be given some hope, but with Shorten\u2019s jab that Turnbull should be ashamed for giving people smugglers hope by suggesting Labor wasn\u2019t just as hardline as the coalition.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/may/29/australian-election-leaders-debate-turnbull-and-shorten-go-head-tohead-live\">Shorten: 'Whatever happened to the old Malcolm?' \u2013 leaders' debate as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A final question trying to nail down the government\u2019s deliberately unclear policy on climate change elicited a declaration from the prime minister that he was \u201ccommitted to action on climate change and who has paid a high price for my commitment to that issue\u201d, before he completely avoided the question on how that commitment translates into an actual policy and segued into a discussion on international targets.</p> <p>And neither leader was prepared to answer a question from the Herald Sun\u2019s Ellen Whinnett about why they should be trusted by the electorate.</p> <p>Both Turnbull and Shorten are putting big ideas to the voters this election.

      "body": "<p>After Hillary Clinton won the New York Democratic primary in April, her surrogates began relaying the message: game over, Bernie Sanders. <a href=\"http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/276935-team-clinton-to-sanders-its-over\">Time to go home</a>. It is mathematically impossible to win the nomination.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/28/hillary-clinton-campaign-emails-bernie-sanders-trump-polls\">Hillary Clinton's week from hell: can she shake off troubles to take on Trump?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Technically, they were right. The rivals may be separated by only 270 pledged delegates, a large but not insurmountable gap, but that figure does not take into account the superdelegates who do not owe allegiance to any vote and almost all of whom \u2013 571 \u2013 are already pledged to Clinton.</p> <p>Nobody appears to have told Sanders. The Vermont senator has set a punishing pace in California: in the last week alone he addressed crowds in National City, Vista, Irvine, Santa Monica, Anaheim, East Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, Cathedral City, Lancaster, Ventura, San Pedro, Santa Barbara, Santa Maria, Pomona, Bakersfield, Fresno and Visalia.</p> <p>Sanders has outspent Clinton on advertising and his ground game is strong; he has more than 55,000 volunteers in the state who have made more than two million phone calls, according to the campaign.</p> <p>His rallies, attended by tens of thousands, sometimes more, certainly don\u2019t feel like those of a losing candidate.</p> <p>His audience hang on his every word, joyously finishing his favoured talking-points. They sport hats, T-shirts and even tattoos of Sanders\u2019 unofficial logo: a silhouette of his unkempt hair and glasses which has become almost as recognizable a totem of the 2016 primary as Donald Trump\u2019s red \u201cmake America great again\u201d hats.</p> <p>Still, the challenge Sanders faces is steep. Even if you allow for a 10-point or greater swing in the California primary on 7 June, the superdelegates mean Clinton would still have enough to clinch the nomination at the convention in July. In fact, because polls close three hours earlier in New Jersey on the same day, Clinton will likely have reached the 2,383 delegates required for the nomination before California\u2019s results even begin to come in.</p> <p>Few attendees at Sanders rallies \u2013 least of all Sanders \u2013 seem the least bit fazed. He is clearly having fun, eagerly accepting Donald Trump\u2019s challenge to debate him, a challenge <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/26/california-debate-bernie-sanders-donald-trump\">the Republican hastily walked back</a>, to avoid facing the 74-year-old former mayor of Burlington, Vermont, mano-a-mano.</p> <p>Many Sanders supporters remain convinced he is going to get the nomination, either by a miraculous landslide in California or by convincing superdelegates to switch their support. Others, like Joe Tellez, whom the Guardian spoke to at a Sanders rally earlier this month in a packed 15,000-capacity stadium in Sacramento, are less sure of victory but remain upbeat. </p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s difficult \u2013 that might be true,\u201d Tellez said. \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy \u2026 but I remain hopeful.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018We\u2019re going to leave it all on the field\u2019</strong></h2> <p>Jeff Weaver, Sanders\u2019 campaign manager, told the Guardian: \u201cWhat [everyone is] missing is that although the secretary [Clinton] has obviously racked up a substantial delegate lead, there is an incredible wellspring of support for the senator and it has not really made it through the process.\u201d</p> <p>Weaver seems confident of a win in California. </p> <p>\u201cThis kind of intensive campaigning by the senator, it really does move a lot of voters,\u201d he said, pointing to the Michigan primary, which Sanders won despite being 10 points behind just a week before the vote. \u201cHe has the capacity to move voters just by his presence at these large events.\u201d</p> <p>Sanders\u2019 energetic campaigning is certainly paying dividends. Recent polling shows Clinton\u2019s lead in California \u2013 a state she won against Barack Obama in 2008 \u2013 is dwindling, with Sanders well within the margin for error, <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-sac-essential-politics-california-polls-clinton-sanders-democratic-primary-htmlstory.html\">trailing by just 2%</a>.</p> <p>California\u2019s primary is open, which means independents can vote. In other states, such voters have favoured Sanders over Clinton. There have also been 1.5 million new registered voters, many under 30, a demographic Sanders has won elsewhere by enormous margins.</p> <p>The Sanders campaign office in San Diego was having a party on Thursday evening, celebrating a day of canvassing with the actor Rosario Dawson. Volunteers ate cupcakes and crudit\u00e9s, and used a small hand-cranked press to make \u201cBernie 2016\u201d badges.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m a goal-oriented person, and the goal is 7 June,\u201d said Carolina Rodriguez, a volunteer from San Diego who has been campaigning for three months. \u201cIf we as California win, we send a message to the rest of the United States \u2026 it\u2019s going to be a huge day, and were going to leave it all on the field.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI truly believe he can win the nomination,\u201d said Debbie Luna, another volunteer in San Diego. \u201cCalifornia alone has a lot of delegates, he\u2019s not that far behind ... from what we see I truly believe that he will win California by a large amount.\u201d</p> <p>Next to her was Kelly Collison, a single mother from Michigan who was part of the Sanders operation that won the primary there, and had brought her eight-year-old daughter to San Diego to help. </p> <p>\u201cI have never seen anything like this,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t remember anyone being this hyped and excited in my lifetime, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>\u2018A largely political argument\u2019</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d3099401493129b9732c0e6bc79e8913f963bf2d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3099401493129b9732c0e6bc79e8913f963bf2d/0_85_3958_2375/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sanders\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sanders speaking in Ventura on 26 May.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Ralston/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/29/sanders-wants-hostile-barney-frank-ousted-from-convention-role\">Sanders wants 'hostile' Barney Frank ousted from convention role</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If Sanders\u2019 volunteers share this undimmed hope for victory, they share another trait \u2013 distrust of the mainstream media, which they see as part of an establishment that wants to see Clinton win. </p> <p>\u201cThe media is bought out by corporate billionaires,\u201d said Luna. \u201cCNN, MSNBC, Fox News \u2013 they\u2019re all contributors to Hillary Clinton.\u201d</p> <p>Unlike Clinton, Luna said, \u201cBernie ... doesn\u2019t get any money from anybody but regular people like us, so they\u2019re not gonna show him on the media, we\u2019re not gonna see him.\u201d </p> <p>Several volunteers said Sanders supporters aim to get their news from Twitter rather than any traditional media source.</p> <p>Ultimately, the narrow path forward for Sanders \u2013 a path only open at all if he wins big in California \u2013 will come down to convincing superdelegates to switch their allegiance. </p> <p>\u201cIt would be extremely difficult to surpass [Clinton] in pledged delegates, she has a 270-pledged delegate lead right now,\u201d Weaver said.</p> <p>But he added that what the Sanders campaign could do was \u201cto substantially narrow that lead\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis is going to be a largely political argument to be made to the superdelegates,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cAll the polling shows that, at state level and national level, he\u2019s just a stronger general election candidate.

It keeps dollars in Puerto Rico. I\u2019m very proud that we\u2019re working and supporting Puerto Rico.\u201d</p> <p>The headline figures of the century-long decline of Puerto Rican agriculture are depressing. In 1914, revenue from farming, food production and related activities accounted for 70% of the island\u2019s gross domestic product. According to the most recent statistics from the <a href=\"https://www.agcensus.usda.gov/\">US Census of Agriculture</a>, it now accounts for less than 1%.</p> <p>Furthermore, the loss to development of more than a million acres of prime farmland and the collapse of the sugar industry robbed Puerto Rico of vital income. Self-sufficiency declined to the point where the island imports up to 85% of the food it consumes \u2013 a \u201ccritical situation\u201d, in the words of <a href=\"http://www.susta.org/staff/puertorico.html\">Dr Myrna Comas Pag\u00e1n</a>, secretary of the island\u2019s department of agriculture.</p> <p>However, thanks to a growth in demand for locally grown produce, financial incentives from the federal government and renewed focus on agriculture from local leaders, more families are returning to the land. According to the <a href=\"https://www.agcensus.usda.gov/Publications/2012/Full_Report/Outlying_Areas/prv1.pdf\">US Department of Agriculture</a> (USDA), more than 1,700 new farms have begun operations. Farmers, food distributors, politicians and analysts increasingly believe that Puerto Rico can grow its way out of trouble.</p> <h2>\u2018We\u2019re planting the seeds to bring foods for the future\u2019</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/14/puerto-rico-woos-us-investors-with-huge-tax-breaks-as-locals-fund-debt-crisis\">Puerto Rico woos US investors with huge tax breaks as locals fund debt crisis</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about recovering our lands and changing the culture of our people to make agriculture a way of life,\u201d Dr Comas Pag\u00e1n told the Guardian<em>, </em>pointing to a recent reclamation of 30,000 abandoned arable acres that lifted land available for growing to 637,000 acres, the first such increase in decades.</p> <p>\u201cSome of it will take time. For example, we\u2019ve established 8,000 [new] acres for avocado and 8,000 acres for coffee that we can\u2019t see for three years. But we\u2019re planting the seeds to bring food for the future. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re seeing new farmers, new technology, new farms. Already our agricultural income has increased since 2011 by 24% to more than $900m.\u201d</p> <p>On a hillside near Caguas, about 20 miles south of San Juan\u2019s old town, brothers Pedro and Jorge Casas work in two giant greenhouses, tending crops of organic mint, chives, rosemary and basil. The farm was remodelled last year, in part through a $280,000 loan from the <a href=\"http://www.fsa.usda.gov/\">Farm Service Agency of USDA</a>.</p> <p>The physical footprint of the Agroponicos Cosecha farm is small, because no land or soil is required to grow. Instead, the tightly packed plants\u2019 roots receive nutrition from a constant flow of water filtered in three large tanks full of tilapia fish. Since 2011 the brothers, who had no previous experience of farming, have harvested and sold increasingly large yields.</p> <p>The entrepreneurs have also set up an expanding distribution network, to serve themselves and dozens of other farmers around the island and to help drive the food revolution.</p> <p>\u201cEverything is local,\u201d said Jorge Casas, 31. \u201cThe point of everything is to grow the agriculture on the island and that\u2019s the way we\u2019re going to help the economy of the island.</p> <p>\u201cThe farmers usually don\u2019t like to go out and sell, so we\u2019re creating this community of \u2018You grow, I sell\u2019. You grow what you\u2019re expert in, we grow what we are expert in, and let\u2019s join it all together and sell it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You grow what you\u2019re expert in, we grow what we are expert in, and let\u2019s join it all together and sell it</p> <footer> <cite>Jorge Casas, farmer</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe\u2019re working with more than 80 farms in food service, and hotels and restaurants are the main goal. Almost everything we have is sold with these clients, we\u2019re not even in the supermarkets.\u201d</p> <p>The knock-on effect is more jobs, a welcome development on an island where according to the federal <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/eag/eag.pr.htm\">Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> the unemployment rate is a highest-in-the-nation 11.7%, more than twice the US average of 5%. </p> <p>With the farming boom come more farm labourers, drivers and retail workers, and urban produce markets are opening up across Puerto Rico. One such, O-Mrkt in the San Juan suburbs, opened in April with the Casas brothers as partners.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to grow food,\u201d said Pedro Casas, who was formerly a web graphics designer. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter how but we need to grow it. If we don\u2019t teach our kids these things you don\u2019t turn that spark on.

From small beginnings and a $10,000 loan from a friend, in 2010, she has built the business into a flourishing community hub, focused exclusively on locally grown produce and sustainable farming.</p> <p>\u201cI got to know all these amazing farmers, and wondered how people get to know about them and have access to these products if you\u2019re not up at 8am on a Sunday for a farmer\u2019s market,\u201d said Rodr\u00edguez, 31. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re creating demand. We have this pool of buyers, a pool of farmers and we\u2019re bringing them together. Food is my bet on how to change this island, if not the world.

I feel we\u2019re on the verge of something with this island.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018Farmers have iPads, there are drones to monitor crops\u2019<br /></h2> <p>Many of Puerto Rico\u2019s new generation of innovators and thinkers are gathering in San Juan this weekend for Agrohack, a specialist conference that will bring together for the first time the island\u2019s food growers, sellers, chefs and consumers.</p> <p>Much of the focus will be on \u201cgreen\u201d farming and new technology solutions that Carlos Cobi\u00e1n, the event\u2019s founder, says will transform the island\u2019s agricultural industry into an unrecognisable incarnation of its former self, with better energy and land efficiency and lower costs.</p> <p>\u201cYou think of agriculture in Puerto Rico and the first image that comes to mind is an old <em>jibarito</em> in a straw hat walking the field slowly with his two bulls,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the landscape is different now. Farmers have iPads, there are drones to monitor crops and spread seeds, they\u2019re taking old warehouses and turning them into aquaponics and vertical farming.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Food is my bet on how to change this island, if not the world.

The island\u2019s vulnerability was exposed last summer when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/05/puerto-rico-extends-water-rationing-drought\">drought led to widespread crop failure</a> and an emergency declaration in 10 counties.</p> <p>Still, Dr Comas Pag\u00e1n was upbeat. </p> <p>\u201cWith the technology we have we can aim to produce 40% of our local consumption,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re in a crisis so we need to be efficient and contribute to our economic and labour development by creating agricultural jobs.

Ignorance is Strength.</p> </blockquote> <p>1984 is a dystopian novella by George Orwell published in 1949, which follows the life of Winston Smith, a low ranking member of \u2018the Party\u2019, who is frustrated by the omnipresent eyes of the party, and its ominous ruler Big Brother. </p> <p>\u2018Big Brother\u2019 controls every aspect of people\u2019s lives. It has invented the language \u2018Newspeak\u2019 in an attempt to completely eliminate political rebellion; created \u2018Throughtcrimes\u2019 to stop people even thinking of things considered rebellious. The party controls what people read, speak, say and do with the threat that if they disobey, they will be sent to the dreaded Room 101 as a looming punishment.</p> <p>Orwell effectively explores the themes of mass media control, government surveillance, totalitarianism and how a dictator can manipulate and control history, thoughts, and lives in such a way that no one can escape it. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"acecd85638a18abea050c9087f13043910bd09f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/acecd85638a18abea050c9087f13043910bd09f9/0_0_245_400/245.jpg\" alt=\"1984\" width=\"245\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The protagonist, Winston Smith, begins a subtle rebellion against the party by keeping a diary of his secret thoughts, which is a deadly thoughtcrime. With his lover Julia, he begins a foreordained fight for freedom and justice, in a world where no one else appears to see, or dislike, the oppression the protagonist opposes.</p> <p>Perhaps the most powerful, effective and frightening notion of 1984 is that the complete control of an entire nation under a totalitarian state is perfectly possible. If the world fell under the control of one or even multiple dictators, the future could easily become a twisted, cruel world where every movement, word and breath is scrutinised by an omnipotent, omnipresent power that no one can stop, or even oppose without the fear of death.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Orwell\u2019s novella is a warning for the human race.

Always the literary buccaneer, he was an indefatigable man of letters. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/21/anthony-burgess-book-critic\" title=\"\">Blake Morrison</a>, his literary editor, tells the story of sending out two review copies \u2013 a novel to Burgess, and a new book on China to an expert sinologist. When the books got muddled, the China expert phoned to alert Morrison to the mix-up. But not, however, before Burgess had filed his copy.</p> <p>I remember him as a kind of a dormant literary volcano \u2013 projecting a distinct air of danger, wreathed in cigar smoke, liable at any minute to erupt with a flow of molten judgments. For 30 years, from 1962, he wrote more than 400 reviews for the <em>Observer</em>. Among his \u201cdiscoveries\u201d were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/sylviaplath\" title=\"\">Sylvia Plath</a> and the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/feb/20/umberto-eco-obituary\" title=\"\">Umberto Eco</a>. Burgess on a Sunday would range from airport fiction (one of his great loves), to a new biography of Wagner, to a book on linguistics (another passion). He was the ideal weekend reviewer: generous, entertaining, witty, informative and wise. As a critic, he was what Thomas Carlyle called a \u201cprofessor of things in general\u201d. In 1979, he was duly named critic of the year at the National Press Awards. In a moment worthy of <em>A Clockwork Orange</em>, his trophy was presented by Margaret Thatcher. Burgess died in 1993. I think we still miss him, and this prize helps fill the gap that he left.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb236466051cc127be5666da35fa1b2f3b435b2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb236466051cc127be5666da35fa1b2f3b435b2e/0_30_2077_1246/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Malcolm McDowell in the film adaption of A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Malcolm McDowell in the film adaption of A Clockwork Orange by Anthony Burgess.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Observer/Burgess prize honours the most imaginative and original unpublished journalism across the fields of literature, theatre, film, music and art.

      "body": "<p>I was 19 years old when my brother disappeared, and I was 20 when I discovered he was in Guant\u00e1namo. I\u2019m 33 now, and a German citizen living in Dusseldorf, where I work as a computer systems engineer.</p> <p>I have a productive and peaceful life because of my brother. We grew up in Mauritania, one of the world\u2019s poorest countries. I am the youngest of 12 siblings. My father died not long after I was born, and Mohamedou became the heart of our family. He studied hard, winning a scholarship to study engineering in Germany. </p> <p>When my brother was a student in the early 1990s, he briefly went to Afghanistan and fought with al-Qaida in the US-supported war against the communist government there, but he has always said that he ended his connection to al-Qaida in 1992. He returned to Germany and finished his studies, becoming the first in our family to earn a university degree. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/16/-sp-guantanamo-diary-exposes-brutality-us-rendition-torture\">Guant\u00e1namo Diary exposes brutality of US rendition and torture</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For almost 10 years he lived and worked in Duisburg, not far from where I live today. In 2000, after a decade of hard work to help support our family, Mohamedou returned to Mauritania, got a job there and supported me while I, too, studied in Germany.</p> <p>On 21 November, 2001, Mohamedou came home from work and was asked to go to the police station in Nouakchott for questioning. He went voluntarily, telling my mother he would be home in a few hours. For 11 months, the government told my family that the United States was saying Mohamedou had been involved in a terrorist plot. They said that, because the US had no evidence of this and my government knew it wasn\u2019t true, he was being held in the police prison for his own protection.</p> <p>Every week, my mother and my oldest brother delivered clothes and food to that prison for his provisions. And then, a week after my 20th birthday, I picked up a copy of Der Spiegel in Germany and read that my brother wasn\u2019t in Mauritania at all, and that he was a prisoner in Guant\u00e1namo.</p> <p>Just the name Guant\u00e1namo can give you a nervous breakdown. My family was terrified. My mother\u2019s blood pressure skyrocketed and her eyesight began to fail. We knew Mohamedou had done nothing against the United States, that he was not in any way a violent man, a terrorist or any other kind of threat to the United States.</p> <p>Knowing his innocence was in some ways a comfort, but in other ways just made it worse: one of my nephews became so convinced that he or another innocent family member would be the next to disappear that he actually did suffer a breakdown. This was even before we knew what Mohamedou was suffering in Guant\u00e1namo.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/16/-sp-guantanamo-diary-flight-saw-cockpit-saw-guards-saw-ghosts-of-fellow-detainees\">Guant\u00e1namo Diary: \u2018I saw the ghosts of my fellow detainees\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Through my twenties, I learned little by little what was happening to my brother. I read reports in the German press that included accounts by men who had been released from the prison. I met Mohamedou\u2019s American lawyers and German journalists who wrote about his case. It was hard for me to believe that the United States could treat my brother so cruelly and unjustly.</p> <p>The US sometimes tried to <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/2010-4-9-Slahi-Order.pdf\">say</a> he was a 9/11 recruiter, and sometimes that he had been involved in the Millennium plot in Canada, but he was never charged or brought to court and we knew these allegations were not true. <br /></p> <p>Then, in 2010, we received some hope: Mohamedou\u2019s lawyer called to tell me that a federal judge had <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/files/assets/2010-4-9-Slahi-Order.pdf\">reviewed</a> all of these allegations, found that Mohamedou\u2019s detention was not justified and ordered him released. When I told my family in Nouakchott, they began cleaning the house and preparing for the many guests who would want to greet him on his return. Five years later, we still cannot understand why the US government did not honor that decision.<br /></p> <p>Like people around the world, my family has now read Mohamedou\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/guantanamo-diary\">Guant\u00e1namo Diary</a> (I have read it four times, in English, German, French, and Arabic). It has confirmed the many terrible reports I had heard of what had happened to my brother, and the worst fears of my family. But it has also given my family solace. </p> <p>Alongside the sadness that came with reading about all the stages of torture he was subjected to, first in Jordan, then in Afghanistan and worst of all in Guant\u00e1namo, they are extremely proud of how he managed to maintain his sanity, his humanity, and his faith. As Muslims, we believe in the existence of a God who oversees everything and who will not allow injustice and suffering to continue forever for an innocent person.</p> <p>Since I turned 30, my family\u2019s pain has included having to tell my brother that we have lost our mother in 2013 and an older brother last year. Death is sad, but it is part of life. What was terribly hard was conveying this news to a brother who had missed 10 years of family life.</p> <p>At the same time, we have found a new source of faith: the American people. So many have stood up to support Mohamedou as if he were their own brother, and my family has been heartened by all their calls and letters. Many thousands have also signed my <a href=\"https://plataformawww.change.org/p/secretary-of-defense-ash-carter-release-my-brother-from-guantanamo\">petition</a> to the United States government to release my brother, and we are hoping many more will add their names in the next week.</p> <p>Yes, we are deeply disappointed in the US government for keeping Mohamedou so long when he has done nothing wrong. But there is a difference between a government and its people, and one of our greatest sources of strength has been the support my family has received from citizens of the United States.<br /></p> <p>On June 2, my brother will finally have his case reviewed in Guant\u00e1namo. In Mauritania, my family is again readying our house for a flood of friends and well wishers. The Mauritanian government has said it will welcome his return. My brother already has several job offers in Nouakchott, because like my family, our community needs Mohamedou, too. God willing, the heart of our family will be home where he belongs soon.</p>",

Basically we put a glass roof on it.\u201d</p> <p>Evans said he will be disappointed with anything fewer than 5 million viewers for the show\u2019s return in the UK. Within 72 hours it will also have been shown in more than 80 countries on six continents. <br /></p> <p>Does Evans think Clarkson and co will be watching? \u201cI am definitely going to watch their show so I would presume they are going to watch ours,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir show is going to be great because they are good at what they do.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he added. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to ask them.\u201d</p> <p>The eagerly awaited first episode comes just short of a year since the Radio 2 breakfast presenter was handed the long-running motoring show following Clarkson\u2019s departure after a \u201cfracas\u201d with a producer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"31e2c04e75f726bf8375d8705df699d6258faae2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31e2c04e75f726bf8375d8705df699d6258faae2/0_67_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Top Gear: Chris Evans and a Zenos E10S.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Top Gear: Chris Evans and a Zenos E10S.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Yeoman/BBC Worldwide/Mark Yeoman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The intervening months have seen <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/24/matt-leblanc-rubbishes-claims-of-top-gear-feud-with-chris-evans\">reports of tension</a> between Evans and his co-presenter, former Friends star Matt LeBlanc, allegations of bullying dating back 20 years and suggestions that the Radio 2 DJ was \u201cout of control\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNonsense,\u201d said Evans at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/25/chris-evans-says-perfect-storm-of-top-gear-criticism-facile-and-fictitious\">programme\u2019s global launch at the Surrey aerodrome where it is filmed this week</a>. \u201cNone of it was true, but there\u2019s no point saying that, there\u2019s just no point.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIn many ways my job for this year has been not only to make this show but to take all the shit, which was going to happen. I knew I was going to get the shit kicked out of me.\u201d</p> <p>Viewers can expect the new series to be familiar, but different. Instead of one star driving a \u201creasonably priced car\u201d around the Top Gear track, two celebrities will drive a souped-up Mini Cooper around a track extended to include a rally section complete with water and a jump.</p> <p>Two of the three films which will feature in the first episode certainly had echoes of its old incarnation \u2013 two muscle cars with laser guns attached to the top, and a preposterous off-roader being chased by a drone, a motorbike and a giant fan-powered parachute.</p> <p>Evans said the films were \u201clike mini movies. That\u2019s what people want. I want the show to be happy escapism, it\u2019s a hopes and dreams show. Maybe you haven\u2019t got one of these cars but you can imagine, let\u2019s live in that world for a while, especially on a Sunday night.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/video/2016/may/26/top-gear-the-stig-interview-john-plunkett-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4jj7q\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2513807\"            data-video-name=\"Top Gear's The Stig: the Guardian's hard-hitting interview \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5746e790e4b00a2e2e3a0aef\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/26/160526TopGear_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/26/160526TopGear.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/26/160526TopGear_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11541530&amp;format=video/webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/26/160526TopGear_large.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/video/2016/may/26/top-gear-the-stig-interview-john-plunkett-video\">Top Gear\u2019s The Stig: the Guardian\u2019s hard-hitting interview</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>But in a change to its previous form, the new Top Gear appears to have embraced the electric car.

In these years, she writes, America came \u201cperilously close\u201d to \u201closing the protections of the <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights.html\">bill of rights</a>\u201d. </p> <p>After the towers of the World Trade Center disintegrated and the Pentagon was set aflame, the administration of George W Bush systematically exploited the panic of a horrified country to dramatically expand its own powers. It never hesitated to undermine \u201cthe rights to freedom of speech and religion, to freedom from capricious searches and seizures, to due process and fair treatment, and to protections from cruel and unusual punishment\u201d\u2013 in other words, all of privileges guaranteed by the first, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth amendments to <a href=\"http://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html\">the US constitution</a>.</p> <p>Greenberg is director of the <a href=\"http://www.centeronnationalsecurity.org/\">Center on National Security at Fordham University</a> in New York. She begins her book with the astonishing intelligence failure that may have made 9/11 possible. </p> <p>An FBI field agent in Minneapolis had filed a report about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/04/zacarias-moussaoui-al-qaida-backed-by-saudi-arabia\">Zacarias Moussaoui</a>, a French citizen of Moroccan descent who had paid $8,300 in cash to get time on a flight academy\u2019s 747 simulator. As part of a request for a search warrant to examine Moussaoui\u2019s computer \u2013 after agents had jailed him when they discovered he had overstayed his visa \u2013 the agent wrote: \u201cThis is a guy who could fly an airplane into the World Trade Center.\u201d</p> <p> It turned out that the computer contained what Greenberg calls a \u201ctrove of information\u201d about the hijackers and their plans. The FBI, however, only found that out <em>after</em> the 9/11 attacks. </p> <p>Washington never acted on the agent\u2019s request for a warrant, which required the approval of the foreign intelligence surveillance (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/fisa-court\">Fisa</a>) court. But the court never even received a request for the warrant, because a Fisa judge had accused the FBI of \u201croutinely lying in the affidavits used to obtain court orders, and agents had become unwilling to stick out their necks by approaching the court for the warrants it could issue\u201d. </p> <p>This failure to crack the biggest terrorism case the FBI ever had set off a stream of decisions in federal courts and Congress that were designed to free the intelligence community of nearly all the restraints the Fisa court had imposed on surveillance activities since <a href=\"http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/courts_special_fisc.html\">its creation in 1978</a>. </p> <p>Greenberg meticulously describes how these actions created a system in which virtually all communications in America by e-mail or telephone could be swept up, in a vast government effort that mostly remained secret for more than a decade.</p> <p>A principal defender of the new surveillance policy, and much of the rest of the \u201crogue justice\u201d detailed by Greenberg, was deputy assistant attorney general <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2008/apr/18/usa.guantanamo\">John Yoo</a>, who gleefully \u201cignored some of the most sacred principles of American democracy and law\u201d , sometimes without even bothering to inform his boss, Attorney General John Ashcroft. Yoo often preferred to work directly with the White House, where his crucial ally was <a href=\"http://www.heritage.org/about/staff/a/david-addington\">David Addington</a>, a member of the office of Vice-President Dick Cheney.</p> <p>Yoo was the perfect ally for a White House that wasn\u2019t interested in \u201clegal nuance\u201d. Presidential aides, Greenberg writes, wanted advice not \u201cto guide them in determining which policies were legal, but, rather, to provide plausible cover for the policies they wanted to impose\u201d. </p> <p>Yoo\u2019s vilest contributions to the war on terror were his memos legalizing torture. Those who knew the most about effective interrogation techniques \u2013including more than three dozen retired admirals and generals \u2013 believed that torture <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/news/la-op-kaiser24sep24-story.html\">was completely counterproductive</a>. Cheney and his minions were convinced, though, that when terrorists were interrogated it was essential to \u201cgo to the dark side\u201d. </p> <p>Yoo asserted in one memo that \u201cany effort by Congress to regulate the interrogation of battlefield detainees would violate the constitution\u2019s sole investing of the commander-in-chief authority in the president.\u201d </p> <p>As Greenberg points out, this was \u201can extreme and unprecedented position, one with sweeping consequences for all laws, both military and civilian, concerning the treatment of prisoners\u201d.</p> <p>After Ashcroft made Jack Goldsmith the head of the Office of Legal Counsel in the Justice Department, Goldsmith concluded that Yoos\u2019s memo seemed \u201cdesigned to confer immunity for bad acts\u201d and made arguments \u201cwildly broader than was necessary to support what was actually being done\u201d.</p> <p>Publicly, though, the Bush administration called the torture \u201cenhanced interrogation techniques\u201d.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-29T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>This time last year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/02/bj-novak-the-office\">BJ Novak </a>was already an acclaimed actor, stand-up comedian and author. He had starred in Hollywood movies (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/inglourious-basterds\"><em>Inglourious Basterds</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/saving-mr-banks\"><em>Saving Mr Banks</em></a>) and popular sitcoms (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/tvandradioblog/2007/may/18/iprefertheamericanversion\">the American version of <em>The Office</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/jun/01/mindy-kaling-project\"><em>The Mindy Project</em></a>). His children\u2019s book had been a <em>New York Times </em>bestseller for several months. His collection of short stories had been garlanded with praise. He was the worst kind of high-achiever, in that his achievements were myriad and in different fields. People were calling him a polymath and they weren\u2019t even being sarcastic. Unlike <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/james-franco\">James Franco</a>, another actor who tried his hand at creative writing only to be roundly derided by the critics, Novak actually seemed to be <em>good</em> at the many things he was doing.</p> <p>Was he ever worried about being called pretentious? \u201cNot pretentious,\u201d says Novak when we meet on a sunny afternoon at Soho House, West Hollywood. \u201cFor me, it was more [the worry of] seeming distracted from my main work by a side project I was oddly passionate about. And side projects \u2013 especially from celebrities \u2013 don\u2019t tend to be successful either, they tend to be distractions.\u201d</p> <p>Still, even all those side projects (and it\u2019s worth pointing out that he also served as a writer on <em>The Office </em>and executive produced <em>The Mindy Project</em>) weren\u2019t quite enough to sate Novak\u2019s ambitions. He wanted to be a millionaire tech entrepreneur, too. As a little kid growing up in Boston, his earliest ambition was \u201cto be a real-estate developer. I think I had some vague awareness of Donald Trump. Like, \u2018I want to put my name on buildings, I want to be rich and important and a businessman!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>You don\u2019t get many Hollywood liberals admitting that Trump used to be their hero, I tell him.</p> <p>\u201cBut culturally, he\u2019s an icon,\u201d counters Novak. \u201cI think a secret aspect of [his popularity] is how familiar he is. He\u2019s not a crazy man on the street, he\u2019s the crazy uncle that\u2019s been at your Thanksgiving for 30 fucking years! He\u2019s been there for ever. So I think people feel safe with him considering how outrageous he is as a candidate. There is some subliminal comfort with him.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f1fcd1b23196c83a275f4671d9040dceef2ffad4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f1fcd1b23196c83a275f4671d9040dceef2ffad4/215_53_2337_1402/1000.jpg\" alt=\"As Ryan Howard in the US version of The Office.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I am proud of being associated with quality things\u2019: as Ryan Howard in the US version of The Office.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: UPPA/Photoshot</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In pursuit of his Trumpian dream to become a multi- millionaire businessman, Novak came up with an idea for an app. His idea was deceptively simple: lists. Lists of things people wanted to share, such as recommendations of the best places to eat in Paris or five of their all-time favourite ice-cream flavours or three pieces of advice for a first date.</p> <p>Novak got backing from private investors, hired some of the best people (his co-founder <a href=\"https://twitter.com/devwastaken\">Dev Flaherty</a> is a tech developer and Stanford graduate), set up an office in Venice Beach and launched the <a href=\"https://li.st/\">Li.st</a> app for iPhone last October. In its first four months, it has amassed more than 250,000 lists, many of them compiled by celebrity users such as Lena Dunham, who admitted to lusting after a small marsupial <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/grrlscientist/2015/jun/27/baby-sugar-glider-takes-flying-lessons\">sugar glider </a>in \u201cExotic Pets I Want\u201d or Snoop Dogg who puts \u201cthyme\u201d at number one of his \u201cTop Five Essential Herbs\u201d.</p> <p>You can make anything into a list, says Novak. Although he conceived the app as a sort of advice-sharing mechanism, it\u2019s actually turned into a medium for \u201cstructured self-expression\u2026 If I asked you: \u2018Hey, would you write me an essay about your father?\u2019 it\u2019s such an enormous ask. If I send you a list request for \u2018memories of your dad from childhood\u2019 \u2013 any of us can come up with seven, random, funny memories. And before you know it it\u2019s very involving.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One night I was lying awake in bed and my mum came in and asked: \u2018Can\u2019t you ever just think stupid thoughts?\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So, in the spirit of the Li.st, the top five things I learn about BJ Novak in the first 10 minutes of meeting him are:</p> <p>1. He is wearing a lot of clothes. Despite the Californian heat, Novak is dressed in dark jeans, a black T-shirt, a navy-blue blouson jacket and a baseball cap emblazoned with the single letter \u201cB\u201d. When he takes off this cap at several points during the interview, his hair is slick with sweat. He then puts it back on again.</p> <p>2. He orders green tea and, when it arrives, studiously ignores the biscuit on the side of the saucer.</p> <p>3. He wants to run for mayor of Los Angeles. One of his flagship policies would be that everyone would have to refer to the city by its full name and not as \u201cLA\u201d because it\u2019s \u201cbad branding\u201d. Another would be founding a museum of hip-hop in the suburb of Compton.</p> <p>4. He\u2019s smart. Very smart. He speaks rapidly, almost nervously, and he throws out ideas at a median rate of 35 a minute (approximate guess).</p> <p>5. He doesn\u2019t smile that much. When he does, you feel like you\u2019ve done something unexpectedly brilliant.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86b23d06201c267616abcba3df7680c0a3c42e20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86b23d06201c267616abcba3df7680c0a3c42e20/325_176_1735_1040/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With co-star Mindy Kaling.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We\u2019re very close in sort of a natural, eternal way,\u2019: with co-star Mindy Kaling. The pair have been offered a rumoured $7.5m to write about their friendship.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Of course, it\u2019s unfair to expect someone to be constantly cracking jokes and gurning with hilarity simply because they are known for their comedic presence on-screen. And Novak clearly has a lot going on inside that sweaty head of his. His father was a writer who ghosted Nancy Reagan\u2019s memoirs and Novak, the eldest of three boys, describes himself as a \u201cthoughtful\u201d child.</p> <p>\u201cI remember my mum coming into my bedroom when I was lying awake one night and she asked what I was thinking of\u2026 And I was telling her about the inventions I would invent and she said, \u2018Can\u2019t you ever just think stupid thoughts?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Novak went on to Harvard and did his thesis on the film adaptations of Shakespeare\u2019s plays (his favourite is Kenneth Branagh\u2019s <em>Hamlet</em> because \u201cit was not obsessed with novelty and it was not obsessed with fidelity\u201d.) He moved to LA\u2026 sorry, Los Angeles, after graduating and started out on the stand-up circuit as a way of testing his writing on a wider audience. Then he fell into acting and found he enjoyed it.</p> <p>His parents are said to have set up a Jewish matchmaking service. Is that true?</p> <p>\u201cYeah, that\u2019s one of those questions that comes up every time.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s because it\u2019s in your Wikipedia entry.</p> <p>\u201cWell I\u2019m not going to take it off. It\u2019s not not-true, but it\u2019s not like a big aspect of my life. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s interesting.\u201d</p> <p>Don\u2019t you? I think it\u2019s completely fascinating. Were they always trying to matchmake you?</p> <p>\u201cNo.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8f1a04d6c921e6311707473de7654a18531fac8b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8f1a04d6c921e6311707473de7654a18531fac8b/0_137_6144_3686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"With Jason Schwartzman in Saving Mr Banks.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Spoonfuls of sugar: with Jason Schwartzman in Saving Mr Banks.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Photoshot</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At 36, Novak is single, but has been engaged in a highly public on-off flirtation with his co-star from <em>The Office</em>, Mindy Kaling, for years. They used to date, but then realised they spent most of their time arguing, so broke up. They still have an intensely close friendship.</p> <p>In the past, Kaling has described Novak as \u201cintoxicating\u201d and referred to the two of them as \u201csoup snakes\u201d \u2013 a reference to a scene in <em>The Office </em>where a character writes a romantic note to his girlfriend only to misread \u201csoul-mates\u201d as \u201csoup-snakes\u201d. They signed a rumoured $7.5m joint book deal last year to write about their long friendship.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re very close in sort of a natural, eternal way,\u201d says Novak, before getting his phone and reading out a series of recent texts from Kaling.</p> <p>\u201cShe texted me: \u2018Remake <em>I Dream of Jeannie </em>with me. You be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/us-news-blog/2012/nov/24/larry-hagman-dallas-jr\">Larry Hagman</a>.\u2019 This was on Saturday. Then I texted her: \u2018I\u2019m writing a list: Eight Times Mindy Kaling Bullied Me on the Set of <em>The Office</em>.\u2019 So I was asking her details for that.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>His book has sold more than 1m copies. When he tours primary schools, he is greeted like a hero</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>She used to bully you?</p> <p>He cracks a smile. A huge grin that seems to take over the entire lower half of his face.</p> <p>\u201cShe would lie to me. She would make up these \u2013 just out of nowhere \u2013 purposeless lies that I believed. Like saying that Allison Jones, the casting director of <em>The Office</em>,<em> </em>was also an actress who had been the third lead in <em>Cold Mountain</em>. And so I just thought that.</p> <p>\u201cAnd there was this director, this older woman who directed a couple of episodes, and Mindy told me I couldn\u2019t tell anyone, but Greg Daniels, the show runner, used to date this woman in college. And then Greg asked me what I thought of her cut and I lied to Greg and said I thought it was great, because I was nervous to insult his ex-girlfriend, so he didn\u2019t make the edits that I wanted.</p> <p>\u201cAnd later I asked him about it and he was like, \u2018What are you <em>talking</em> about? She\u2019s 20 years older than I am, we didn\u2019t go to college together!\u2019 I realised that Mindy just made it up and\u201d \u2013 he breaks off, laughing \u2013 \u201cit actually affected my work life!\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"70211fec0083a286268c5353153ae84130eaadac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70211fec0083a286268c5353153ae84130eaadac/0_544_1999_1199/1000.jpg\" alt=\"BJ Novak reading from his latest book in New York.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Kids care whether or not you have the book on you, they don\u2019t care whether you wrote it\u2019: reading from his latest book in New York.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Unique Nicole/FilmMagic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even though romance hasn\u2019t blossomed with Mindy or through his parents\u2019 Jewish matchmaking service, Novak is open about the fact that he wants to meet someone and be a father someday.</p> <p>\u201cYeah. I just need more of a test audience.\u201d</p> <p>Still, the fact that he has no kids hasn\u2019t stopped him becoming a hugely successful children\u2019s author. Novak wrote <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/07/the-book-with-no-pictures-bj-novak-review\"><em>The Book With No Pictures </em></a>after testing it out on his best friend\u2019s two-year-old, Bruce. Again, the idea is winningly simple: the book consists entirely of funny things the person reading it must say out loud (\u201cMy head is made of blueberry pizza\u201d). It has sold more than 1m copies in the US and has been translated into 26 languages. When Novak tours primary schools, he is greeted like a hero.</p> <p>The people who stop him in the street now fall into two distinct categories. The first are those who say: \u201cLove your work\u201d (\u201cI think you say it to everyone,\u201d says Novak. \u201cI think you say that to Russell Crowe, I think you say that to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/georgesaunders\">George Saunders</a>, I think it could mean absolutely anything. \u2018Love your work!\u2019 As though they\u2019ve been poring over my \u2018work\u2019.\u201d) The other half are excitable parents who come up to him with their children in tow. \u201cGenerally, kids care whether or not you have the book on you, they don\u2019t care whether you wrote it.\u201d</p> <p>Novak thinks of himself as a writer first and foremost. He has always struck me as someone who has chosen not to be as famous as he could have been, I tell him. \u201cI think I am very proud of being associated with quality things. So if I were massively famous for doing massively beloved things, yeah, that sounds great. I think the pickiness is really just about\u2026 I want to be in cool things.\u201d</p> <p>He removes his baseball cap, then smoothes back his hair. His eyes dart left and right, like a magpie looking for shiny things to steal. I can sense his attention wandering on to the next thought, the next big idea. So, I say: \u201cAt 36 you\u2019re more than halfway through your allotted biblical time\u2026\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBiblical time?\u201d he jokes, \u201cIn biblical time, I could live to 860.\u201d</p> <p>But is that something you are aware of? That there are only a finite number of years left in which to achieve the things you want to achieve?</p> <p>\u201cSure. But why do you ask?\u201d</p> <p>Because it\u2019s an interview and it\u2019s my job to come up with the questions.</p> <p>\u201cSo, are you asking: is mortality behind my drive?\u201d</p> <p>Yes.</p> <p>There is a long pause, emphasised by the fact that Novak actually says: \u201cHe takes a long pause, pondering the universe and its destiny\u2026\u201d Eventually, he concludes: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I mean, I don\u2019t think so more than anyone else.\u201d</p> <p>Three Things I Notice About BJ Novak As He Leaves The Interview:</p> <p>1. The biscuit is still untouched.</p> <p>2. He walks rapidly, as though fuelled by his own nervous energy.</p> <p>3. He is probably going to take over the world.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It is the childhood ambition for many a budding naturalist, bringing Fluffy the rabbit into the home complete with its own purpose-built hutch. But, according to the wildlife expert Chris Packham, the nation\u2019s pet rabbits are hopping mad about their wooden homes. </p> <p>Delivering a withering assessment at this weekend\u2019s Hay literary festival of how we keep our pets, the BBC presenter said: \u201cWe don\u2019t revise our ideas about animal husbandry quick enough. Rabbits are kept in hutches because we were growing them for food, not keeping them as pets.</p> <p>\u201cSo if you\u2019re not going to eat your rabbit, why not give it a better quality of life and not cram it in to a hutch where it is going to defecate on to a huge pile of its own defecate.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not an ideal place, they need a place to run around.

A formative experience was eating tadpoles as a boy, something he encouraged others to repeat \u2013 in moderation \u2013 as it may instil a \u201cpassion for life\u201d.</p> <p>They do not, he said, taste of chicken. \u201cThey taste sort of gritty and they\u2019re difficult to bite because they slip on the tongue. The reason they are slightly moreish is because they are quite difficult to taste.\u201d</p> <p>Packham is about to begin the next live series of BBC2\u2019s Springwatch. While he would not be drawn on his views on the EU referendum, he did complain about the lack of debate about environmental and ecological issues.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m very disappointed that both the pros and the cons brigade are not talking about the environment at all. We\u2019re hearing a lot about the usual suspects, immigration, the economy and so forth but ... I\u2019ve not heard a single comment about the environment.</p> <p>\u201cEuropean legislation has a very positive impact when it comes to looking after the environment and species who live here, but also the Common Agricultural Policy has been nothing but a blight to the UK and farmers since we joined. All these things should be discussed.\u201d</p> <p>Packham is working on other projects but, he said, is still trying to persuade the BBC to agree with one of his current obsessions: that he should make a programme on tyrannosaurus rex, believing Jurassic Park got it wrong and the dinosaurs were feathered. </p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-30T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Tony Blair has suggested that he will refuse to accept the verdict of the Chilcot inquiry if it accuses him of committing Britain to invading Iraq before he told parliament and the public.</p> <p>In an interview on the BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, the former prime minister said he did not think anyone could say he did not make his position clear ahead of the 2003 war that led to the toppling of Saddam Hussein.</p> <p>Sir John Chilcot is due to publish his long-awaited report into the war on 6 July. It is expected to be highly critical of Blair and other political and military figures. During the inquiry hearings there was particular focus on evidence suggesting Blair had given a firm commitment to back President George W Bush\u2019s decision to invade while he was publicly saying a final decision had not yet been taken.</p> <p>Asked if he would accept Chilcot\u2019s conclusions, Blair told Marr: \u201cIt is hard to say that when I haven\u2019t seen it.\u201d</p> <p>He continued: \u201cBut I think when you go back and you look at what was said, I don\u2019t think anyone can seriously dispute that I was making it very clear what my position was.\u201d</p> <p>Blair also said that when the report comes out, he would be taking to the airwaves to defend himself rather than going to ground.</p> <p>\u201cThe thing that will be important when it does happen is that we have then a full debate,\u201d Blair said. \u201cAnd I look forward to participating in that. Make no mistake about that. It is really important we do debate these issues.\u201d</p> <p>Blair may not have seen the full report, but it is understood that he has seen the key passages criticising his conduct, as part of the Maxwellisation process that allows people facing criticism from a report like this to see and respond to its draft conclusions.</p> <p>The Sunday Times recently quoted an unnamed source with knowledge of the report saying that <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/chilcot-will-savage-blair-and-generals-bjwhg9c69\">Blair \u201cwon\u2019t be let off the hook\u201d</a> over claims that he told Bush he would support an invasion of Iraq in 2002, a full year before the decision was publicly confirmed. </p> <p>At the Hay literary festival in Powys, Wales, author Tom Bowers took aim at Blair on Sunday by suggesting that criticism of his role in the Iraq war would not go far enough.</p> <p>Bower is the author of a scathing biography of Blair that portrays him as a man with few policies and no ideology. Bower told the festival: \u201cChilcot in my view will criticise the wrong people, the easy targets ... the cabinet secretary, the chief of the defence staff, who was not told the truth. The man obviously to blame is Blair.</p> <p>\u201cHe wil be criticised perhaps for undermining government, for having no plan for post-war Iraq ... but he won\u2019t be blamed for lying, that will not happen.\u201d</p> <p>Bower suggested that Chilcot himself was too close to the establishment, in that he was heavily involved in the second Iraq inquiry conducted by the cabinet secretary, Sir Robin Butler.</p> <p>His book argues that Blair worked hard to gain power but had no idea what to do with it when he got it. It was a government without ideology and by its second term it was too late to get one as he was being weakened by Gordon Brown and was on the \u201ctreadmill to Iraq\u201d, he says.</p> <p>The Chilcot report is expected to be especially damning about the British and American failure to prepare for the aftermath of the invasion, which triggered years of violent sectarian conflict and virtual civil war. </p> <p>But there will be particular interest in what it says about Blair\u2019s candour regarding his pre-war intentions because his critics claim he lied to the public about his plans. Whether or not Chilcot will accuse Blair of dishonesty on that scale remains to be seen.</p> <p>In his Marr interview, Blair also denied claims that remarks he made in an interview on Saturday about how it would be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/28/tony-blair-corbyn-government-dangerous-experiment\">\u201cvery dangerous\u201d if a leftwing populist took power were aimed at Jeremy Corbyn. </a></p> <p>\u201cI wasn\u2019t talking about Jeremy Corbyn, by the way. I was talking about the general populism there is in the world today,\u201d he claimed.</p> <p>In a BBC interview broadcast on Saturday, Blair had said: \u201cIt would be a very dangerous experiment for a major western country to get gripped by this type of populist policymaking left or right.\u201d This was widely taken as a reference to Corbyn because Blair was responding to a question that specifically mentioned him.</p> <p>Blair said he was \u201cnot being disloyal\u201d to the current Labour leader and, although he said he was waiting to see what policies Corbyn produced, he insisted: \u201cI don\u2019t disrespect him as a person, or his views at all.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>He also said he would be backing Labour at the general election even if Corbyn remained leader. \u201cI\u2019ll always tell people to vote Labour because I\u2019m Labour. That\u2019s just the way I am,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In the Marr interview, Blair also dismissed claims that his wealth and globetrotting lifestyle meant he was now out of touch with the views of people who used to support him.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I say to that is, if you are reading stuff in the press about what I do nowadays, don\u2019t read it or believe it. Go and look at my website and you\u2019ll see what I actually do,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI spend 80% of my time on unpaid work. I have just literally spent weeks in the Middle East on the Middle East peace process. I have two foundations. I employ around 200 people. I have to raise the money and make the money for all of them. What we actually do is very good and exciting work around the world, but you won\u2019t read a bit of it here.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>For some it is the sound of the first cuckoo. For others it is the chock of leather on willow. But for those who write about the economy the first sign of spring is when colleagues start asking for advice on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/aug/16/foreign-currency-top-tips-buying-holiday-money\">when to buy their foreign currency for a holiday abroad</a>.</p> <p>This year, inevitably, the decision has been made more difficult by the EU referendum on 23 June. Is it better to buy euros or dollars now or wait to see which way the vote goes? Admit it, lots of you have been weighing up the risks in the past few weeks, haven\u2019t you?</p> <p>Well, here are a few of the factors to take into consideration. If the vote is for Brexit, those who have held on before buying their foreign currency will be kicking themselves, because there will be a sharp fall in sterling that is almost certain to persist for the rest of the summer \u2013 and perhaps beyond.</p> <p>Opinion polls suggest the remain side is on course to win, and financial markets react badly to surprises. There would be a lot of political and economic uncertainty. There would be doubts about whether David Cameron could survive as prime minister. There would be speculation that the result could pave the way for Jeremy Corbyn to become prime minister. It would take time to establish what sort of relationship Britain could negotiate with the other 27 members of the European Union.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2012/aug/16/foreign-currency-top-tips-buying-holiday-money\">Foreign currency: top tips for buying your holiday money</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Of course, the entire government machine would do a rapid volte face on 24 June in an attempt to reassure the markets that the consequences of Brexit would be minor and manageable. There would be no more lurid warnings about impending recessions; instead the Treasury and the Bank of England would come up with an action plan in double quick time.</p> <p>Even so, the experience of the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/13/black-wednesday-bad-day-conservatives\">UK\u2019s departure from the exchange rate mechanism in September 1992</a> would suggest a hefty decline in the pound. The fall would probably be bigger against the dollar than against the euro, because the collateral damage from Brexit would be greater for the EU than for the US.</p> <p>A fall in the value of the pound makes exports cheaper and imports dearer. It means people coming into the UK get more pounds for their foreign currency while those leaving the UK get less foreign currency for their pounds. Brexit would be good news for the UK tourism industry, less good news for the short-haul airlines and package holiday companies.</p> <p>Another possible scenario is that the battle between the two sides remains close over the next three weeks but that, as in Scotland in 2014, the referendum ends with a narrow victory for those arguing for the status quo. If a couple of rogue polls had previously suggested that the Leave side was on course to win, there would then be what markets call a relief rally. Sterling would rise on the foreign exchanges because there would be no need for the prime minister to fall on his sword and the civil service would not have to spend the next couple of years renegotiating access to the European single market.</p> <p>In these circumstances, though, it might be advisable for those wanting the best foreign currency deal to move swiftly. Relief rallies don\u2019t tend to last very long, and there are good reasons for thinking that would be the case after a narrow win for remain. For a start, Cameron\u2019s position would still be precarious, with the threat of a leadership challenge from Brexiters in his own party who would say that remain had won by underhand means.</p> <p>Financial markets would quickly get the idea that 23 June had not actually resolved Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU and thus start to speculate about the possibility of another referendum.</p> <p>The relief rally might last longer against the euro than against the US dollar. That\u2019s because the threat of Brexit has been one of the factors that has been deterring America\u2019s central bank, the federal reserve, from raising interest rates.</p> <p>The prospect of higher UK interest rates might also be brought forward in the event of a vote to remain, but the Bank of England is likely to be more cautious than the Fed. British households are more indebted than their US counterparts and less likely to have borrowed at long-term fixed rates. That makes them more exposed to higher borrowing costs. As a result, the gap between US and UK interest rates is likely to widen, and that would tend to push up the value of the dollar against the pound.</p> <p>The final scenario involves a convincing win for the remain camp. In this outcome, those who currently say they don\u2019t know how they are going to vote have actually decided that Brexit is too risky and that will ensure that the margin of victory is big, perhaps of the order of 60%-40%. If that\u2019s the case, wouldn\u2019t it be better to hang on until after 23 June?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2016/may/12/the-smartphone-app-revolutionising-foreign-currency-exchange\">The smartphone app revolutionising foreign currency exchange</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Well, perhaps. A convincing remain win would certainly shore up Cameron\u2019s position and would put the idea of a second referendum to bed. The pound\u2019s rally would be stronger and would go on for longer.</p> <p>Hanging on, though, is still something of a gamble. For a start, much will depend on what happens in the polls over the coming weeks. If it looks as if the remain side will win convincingly, the rally in the pound will take place before the referendum not afterwards. In the jargon of the markets, defeat for Brexit will already be in the price. The post-referendum upside would then be limited, and markets would move on to something else.</p> <p>That \u201csomething else\u201d might well be the poor underlying state of the UK economy, which has a twin deficit (budget and current account) problem, high and rising levels of debt, low levels of saving, sluggish productivity growth, and poor infrastructure.</p> <p>These structural weaknesses were there before the Brexit debate began and they will be there whichever side triumphs in a few weeks\u2019 time. When the Bank of England reported on the state of the economy in its <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Pages/inflationreport/2016/may.aspx\">quarterly inflation report </a>earlier this month, it noted that only half the fall in the pound since November had been the result of Brexit concerns. The other half reflects unease about the fact that the economy is both slowing and grotesquely unbalanced.</p> <p>These concerns have largely been buried since the referendum was called, but will resurface whether or not Britain remains in the EU. Sterling has been remarkably steady on the foreign exchanges, but will need to fall in order to increase exports and dampen consumption. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>For this year\u2019s holidaymakers to Spain, Italy, France and the US, the question to consider is how long it will take the financial markets to start selling the pound. Even with a remain vote, it might not take long.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>",

'Scum!': protesters v Donald Trump supporters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The decisive moment occurred just after 9am on a bright May morning, when Stephen Ohlemacher, chief delegate counter for the Associated Press, called John Trandem. </p> <p>The owner of a car accessories shop in Fargo, Trandem was elected as delegate in April, at the North Dakota state Republican convention. When he took the call, the goateed 41-year-old was speeding down Interstate 94<strong> </strong>to Bismarck, where Trump was holding a rally. </p> <p>He had committed to Trump in a call with the North Dakota Republican party\u2019s executive director two days before, but he had not shared this with the AP reporter. Trandem asked Ohlemacher what the AP\u2019s count was. It was 1,235, two short of the magic number.</p> <p>Trandem insisted on being No 1,237 and said he could easily find another unbound delegate to be 1,236. State representative Ben Koppelman was giving Trandem a lift to Bismarck in his Chevy Yukon SUV, and was also a delegate to the national convention in Cleveland. Trandem handed over his phone. </p> <p>Koppelman said he was supporting Trump, then handed the phone back to Trandem. He then pledged his support. Shortly thereafter, a newsflash hit the AP wire.</p> <p>Donald Trump, just a year ago best known as a bombastic reality television host, would follow in the footsteps of Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt as the standard bearer of the Republican party.</p> <p>Although it was inevitable that Trump would hit 1,237 once Ted Cruz and John Kasich dropped out of the race at the beginning of May, his campaign only made reaching that threshold before the last primary a priority after the vote in Oregon on 17 May. With their win there, and a pledge of support from Guam delegates who heretofore supported Ted Cruz, there was a path to clinching the nomination before the California primary on 7 June.</p> <p>Trump\u2019s delegate team, which was led by two men formerly employed by opponents \u2013 Ed Brookover, who ran Ben Carson\u2019s campaign, and Ken McKay, who did the same for Chris Christie - made reaching the 1,237 mark a goal. Trump delegate counter Brian Jack led the effort, with the aim of hitting the threshold before Memorial Day.</p> <p>It was always going to be a symbolic achievement. As one veteran operative from a rival campaign pointed out: \u201cIt\u2019s unimpressive and unsurprising that all the unbound delegates are going to support the only candidate left in the race. He\u2019s going to have the numbers bound anyway, and so it\u2019s to be expected.\u201d </p> <p>However, Trump\u2019s early win did carry resonance beyond mathematics. With many senior Republicans, including House speaker Paul Ryan and Senator Ted Cruz, still hedging on whether to endorse Trump, hitting the 1,237 mark would make it that much easier to rally party loyalists, clarifying the fact that their only choice was now Trump \u2013 or Hillary Clinton.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b0c1d90accaa13ce2efa06228419a5019d844d4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b0c1d90accaa13ce2efa06228419a5019d844d4c/0_0_3000_1983/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Demonstrators protest outside of an arena where Donald Trump held a rally in San Diego.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Demonstrators protest outside of an arena where Donald Trump held a rally in San Diego.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Spencer Platt/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The goal was to make the announcement on Thursday in North Dakota, with delegates from that state and when Trump was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/26/donald-trump-environmental-policy-climate-change-keystone-xl\">scheduled to speak at an oil industry conference</a> in Bismarck. </p> <p>North Dakota\u2019s April state convention was widely considered a disappointment for Trump. Unusually, the state holds a convention where delegates are elected without pledging themselves to a candidate. However, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/02/north-dakota-delegates-ted-cruz-ben-carson-donald-trump\">enough had committed to Cruz</a> to mark a major reverse for Trump. A triumphant announcement back in North Dakota would serve as a rebuttal to those who criticized the real estate mogul\u2019s campaign at the time.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was funny. They were kind of tentative about asking me about all the death threats</p> <footer> <cite>Steve House, Colorado Republican chair</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The campaign divvied up the remaining unbound delegates \u2013 those who had been elected to represent their states in Cleveland in July without committing to any candidate \u2013 and started hitting the phones. Jack took the lead in North Dakota and Louisiana; Alan Cobb, a longtime Trump operative, reached out to unbound delegates in Colorado. </p> <p>This effort was supplemented with in-state staff in Pennsylvania, Oklahoma and West Virginia. Trump\u2019s children also reached out to delegates. </p> <p>Trandem said he talked to Ivanka Trump, receiving assurances from her that her father was pro-life and opposed to same-sex marriage. Another delegate from North Dakota, Shane Goettle, aired his concerns about the type of supreme court justices a President Trump would nominate with Trump\u2019s older son, Eric. </p> <p>That conversation happened on Tuesday, a week after Trump <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/18/donald-trump-supreme-court-picks-conservatives\">released a list of judges</a> who he might appoint. Then, the billionaire was only 10 delegates short of clinching the nomination. Having seen the list, Goettle was already much more at ease with Trump. He and Trump\u2019s son discussed energy policy too.</p> <p>Others required less persuasion. When Cobb called Colorado\u2019s state party chair, Steve House, he discovered House was already on board. The Coloradan sent out a press release shortly after Cruz and Kasich dropped out, announcing that he would vote for Trump on the first ballot. </p> <p>At its state convention, Colorado saw a Cruz sweep, prompting a backlash from Trump supporters who alleged that the contest was rigged. There were even death threats against the state party chair. </p> <p>\u201cIt was funny,\u201d House said. \u201c[The Trump campaign] were kind of tentative about asking me about all the death threats.\u201d </p> <p>House, however, was \u201calready on board\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/28/mitt-romney-interview-donald-trump-republican-nominee\">'The last lion': Mitt Romney claims high ground in stand against Donald Trump</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Once the newsflash went out on Thursday morning, the Trump campaign announced a press conference to be held deep in the bowels of the Bismarck Civic Center. A dozen delegates lined up behind the podium. A touch ironically, they were led by the state\u2019s RNC committeeman, Curly Haugland, who has long fought a losing battle against the very concept of binding delegates. </p> <p>As national television cameras soaked in every moment, the delegates jokingly bickered over who was actually the 1,237th for Trump. Then Trump came in. He embraced each one before holding court.</p> <p>The dingy room didn\u2019t compare to the golden escalator of Trump Tower, where the campaign was launched, or to the baroque extravagance of Mar A Lago in Florida. But it was symbolic of the way in which Trump reached his mark so early. </p> <p>He had not reached the 1,237 mark with one of his oversized rallies, or with any over-the-top remarks. Instead, his campaign had just devoted some time to doing the basic blocking and tackling of politics. It worked. </p>",

      "body": "<p>Selima Hill begins her new book with a flourish:</p> <p>To the Woman with the Long Black Hair<br />who may or may not want to be dedicated to<br />but to whom I am going to dedicate this anyway</p> <p>The dedication seems good-humoured, if defiant, and foreshadows an important quest for the narrator of these vivid, undeluded poems \u2013 to emerge from the solipsism of mental trauma and form connections with that notoriously hellish breed, \u201cother people\u201d.</p> <p>The inpatient\u2019s view of the psychiatric hospital as a theatre of abuse is a staple of Hill\u2019s imagination. The family and society sometimes operate in similarly coercive manner. Poetry is the defence of the private, \u201ctrue\u201d self. As the latter is tamed \u2013 by routines, drugs, therapies and the enforced communal interactions of every day \u2013 poems break out, earthy and surreal, emblems of suppressed authenticity. In this new exploration of the intractable conflict, Hill\u2019s playfulness has not deserted her, but her anger has been honed. Her narrator is often bracingly outspoken: \u201cWe\u2019re not lazy, we are <em>tranquillised</em>, / and neither are we \u2018bored\u2019, we are <em>suffering</em>.\u201d (Tranquillity).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/17/poetry-human-therapy-mental-health\">Poetry expresses what it is to be human \u2013 it\u2019s therapy for the soul | Adam O\u2019Riordan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hill\u2019s menageries have delighted readers over the years: her animal characters bring a major English tradition of children\u2019s writing into adult poetry, glittering with X-certificate sexuality. Here, there are brief encounters with eels, owls, jellyfish, and some agreeable headlice, rejoicing in the absence of neurotypical censure from their innocent life cycle: \u201cto never not be normal must be bliss\u201d. A rubber zebra makes several mysterious appearances: in fact, it\u2019s the word \u201czebra\u201d that teaches the speaker to accept her own intellectual truth: \u201cBeing loved is good. It\u2019s what we want. / But secretly I prefer spelling.\u201d Another mode of self-realisation is metamorphosis: the obedient patient evades the doctor by becoming \u201csomeone else entirely / who sleeps in fins and spends the whole night swimming\u201d. (Dr D.)</p> <p>In The Day-room the sufferer compares her silence to that of \u201ca fire alarm / whose silence is a kind of thwarted ringing\u201d. It\u2019s a stunning simile, revealing how elective mutism contains a repressed fury of communication. Hill\u2019s narrator isn\u2019t concerned with the retrieval of mere \u201cnormality\u201d, but of utterance. The demand that her own uniqueness be recognised involves an obligation to recognise that of others, exchanging self-protective isolation for conversation and kindness. In spite of herself, she watches and notices people. When, in The End of the World, an irritating fellow patient says she wants to be friends, the initial rage (\u201c\u2013 <em>excuse me, / never mention friends in here, OK?</em>\u201d) gives way to grumpy acknowledgement of the comforts of social interaction: \u201cbut when I get too bored of despising her / I\u2019ll go and talk her through her various pills\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThe Woman with Long Black Hair\u201d appears in a poem of the same title, placed almost halfway through the book. More animal than woman, she has \u201chairy legs she kicked the doctor with\u201d. Although the narrator knows that the new patient will come to smell the same as the doctor (a fine metaphor of institutionalisation) the image of that transgressive rebuttal seems to energise her own recovery. The animal-woman\u2019s anarchic bravery provides a link in the evolution of these terse, tough couplet-poems, which are the narrator\u2019s own kicks against hierarchy, gender stereotype and the false walls between people. The collection\u2019s title is not ironical. There is magnitude and sublimity in this latest chronicle of a long, hard pilgrimage to inner freedom.</p> <p><em>The Magnitude of My Sublime Existence is published by Bloodaxe (\u00a39.95). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/390361/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a37.96</em></a></p> <h2>Me and K</h2> <p>When everyone\u2019s asleep except the two of us<br />I watch her as she feels for her lighter</p> <p>and, leaning her enormous body forward,<br />scorches the tips of her fingers,</p> <p>and sometimes I imagine that she\u2019s watching me,<br />although I know she\u2019s blind; and I can\u2019t talk</p>",

Presumably, those who live in lands that are really hot don\u2019t feel like this. You can\u2019t imagine people in the tropics associating \u201cToday the sun is in the sky, And sunny is the weather\u201d with all that\u2019s desirable.</p> <p>There are a score of habits, however, that are welcome just because they mark the end of our dismal, soggy winter. The grass has to be cut, the coat and gumboots put away; the cotton frock really must be cleaned this time, and that garden bench mended. We make salads instead of soup and put the rum to the back of the cabinet bringing the Pimm\u2019s to the front. For some of us spring means stopping having mostly black clothes and switching to almost anything lighter in every sense. And oddly, when the weather\u2019s getting warmer, or should be, we start thinking that we ought to be feeling cheerful.</p> <p>There must be something in the British structure, or at least its civilisation, that matches goodness and happiness with sunny weather \u2013 and doom and ill luck with being cast out into the cold snow.</p> <p>In my family, one of my memories is of my brother as a small boy, crying and making a fuss. Our exasperated mother says: \u201cJohn, how can you be so irritating and upset on this lovely sunny day?\u201d He replied: \u201cIt\u2019s not my fault the weather\u2019s lovely. If I had my way it would be horrid and pouring with rain.\u201d</p> <p>But it\u2019s the other option on which maybe the entire holiday travel business relies: people trying to change their feelings by changing the weather. And sometimes it even works \u2013 especially if they\u2019ve brought the right clothes.</p> <p><strong>What do you think? Have your say below</strong></p>",

But, Basu said in an interview with the Sunday Times, there were concerns over the risk to the night-time economy. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d want to see the owners and event managers taking the same kind of security precautions,\u201d he was quoted as saying. </p> <p>Glastonbury, the world\u2019s largest music festival, is expected to draw about 135,000 people to Worthy Farm in Somerset next month, with many more expected to fill parks and green spaces for music events throughout the summer. </p> <p>But after the attacks in Paris last November, where terrorists attacked revellers on the streets and in a concert venue and attempted to bomb the Stade de France, Basu warned that crowded entertainment events were a priority for police. </p> <p>\u201cThese people are perfectly happy to target civilians with the maximum terror impact,\u201d he said. \u201cCrowded places were always a concern for us, but now they are right at the top of the agenda.\u201d</p> <p>Stadiums and music events were particularly vulnerable due to the high concentrations of people, but music festivals were particularly hard to control and secure because of their larger perimeters, Basu said. </p> <p>Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, announced on Friday that he had launched <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/27/sadiq-khan-orders-review-london-terrorist-attack-response-lord-harris  http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/27/sadiq-khan-orders-review-london-terrorist-attack-response-lord-harris  http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/27/sadiq-khan-orders-review-london-terrorist-attack-response-lord-harris\">a review of the capital\u2019s ability to tackle a major terrorist incident</a> that will investigate how emergency services would cope if extremists launched simultaneous attacks, such as those that hit Paris last year.</p> <p>But elsewhere in the country, particularly in rural areas that host some of the country\u2019s largest summer festivals, forces are warning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/17/rural-police-would-be-sitting-ducks-in-terror-attacks\">they could be \u201csitting ducks\u201d in the face of a terrorist attack</a> as they wait for armed officers to arrive from as far as 70 miles away.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the government\u2019s overall counter-extremism strategy has been mired in controversy after it was suggested that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/21/muslims-jews-police-extremism-bill\">it could actually fuel terrorism</a> by alienating communities. A counter-extremism bill unveiled in the Queen\u2019s speech has been criticised for failing to define extremism, while the police lead on anti-radicalisation has said government plans risk <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/24/anti-radicalisation-chief-says-ministers-plans-risk-creating-thought-police\">turning British officers into a \u201cthought police\u201d</a>.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-29T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Leomie Anderson has a blog called <a href=\"http://www.crackedchinacup.com/\">Cracked China Cup</a>. \u201cChina because it looks delicate and beautiful,\u201d she says, \u201ccracked because it\u2019s flawed and cup because it spills.\u201d It\u2019s here the 23-year-old Victoria\u2019s Secret model posts her videos (\u201cThe black model survival kit\u201d), her outfits of the day and, every now and again, something like this: \u201cIn light of recent stories that have surfaced from young girl nudes being leaked, slut shaming, sexual assault and more, I felt it was important to reach out to my young readers and discuss the issue of consent, being pressured and the right to say NO.\u201d</p> <p>It started with a tweet. One of those young readers messaged her: \u201cI\u2019ve been pressured into sending nudes, and FaceTiming naked by three different guys, and when you say no they try to make you feel bad about it.\u201d Anderson, who was 14 when she started modelling, says she felt compelled to reply. \u201cConsent is very important in my job. It\u2019s crucial.\u201d Since being scouted near her school in Tooting, south London, she has walked for Topshop and Moschino, as well as holding a coveted job as one of the Victoria\u2019s Secret models at the catwalk show that has become a sort of Oscars for pants. And in between being delicate and beautiful, she has \u201cspilled\u201d. When she wrote about the lack of make-up artists equipped to work with black models, with a backstage photograph of a rainbow of pink foundations, it sparked <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/feb/22/leomie-anderson-model-racial-discrimation\">a row about diversity</a> in the fashion industry. \u201cWhy is it that the black make-up artists are busy with blonde white girls\u2026 and I have to supply my own foundation? Why can a white model sit in anyone\u2019s chair and feel confident they\u2019ll look OK, but black models have to worry?\u201d And when, in April, she wrote about consent, she unwittingly started the next chapter of her career.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2016/may/28/leomie-anderson-key-summer-trends-for-women-in-pictures\">Leomie Anderson: key summer trends for women \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cIn the 90s models were expected to be mysterious. But today we\u2019re allowed to speak. Which is great, because I want to be known as more than a face.\u201d She visited a school in south London, where students told her that three of their friends had committed suicide after their nude photos had been shared. \u201cThese girls had nobody to talk to. Their reputations had been destroyed; their trust had disappeared. I went on breakfast TV to talk about it, because talking about it can\u2019t be taboo. Schools need to teach boys and girls about consent. And I wanted to tell young people to be careful, because online nothing disappears. And nothing ends well.\u201d Despite being young when she moved to New York to model, and despite finding herself in situations where she felt \u201cuncomfortable with the photographer\u201d, she always knew she could trust her agency. \u201cI\u2019d go to the toilet and call them.\u201d By the time she returned to set, the atmosphere would have changed. At school, she points out, girls are out there all alone. \u201cThe dangers aren\u2019t just old men, catfishing online. They\u2019re your friends, your exes. And once they\u2019ve got that picture, it\u2019s like they own you.\u201d</p> <p>What\u2019s her advice to girls? \u201cDon\u2019t do it! To parents, I\u2019d say they need to realise that if it happens, their daughters are victims, not sluts. Boys need to realise they\u2019re not entitled to a girl\u2019s body. And girls \u2013 they tear each other down to make themselves feel better. Misogyny is imprinted on them. But the easiest way to avoid it is by remembering that this exchange doesn\u2019t need to happen.\u201d She pauses. \u201cI\u2019m not saying showing your body is a bad thing.\u201d Anderson became famous for modelling underwear. When she first discussed sexting, some commenters called her a hypocrite. \u201cDoing Victoria\u2019s Secret was the best time in my life. It was empowering. What I\u2019m talking about is not nudity, it\u2019s consent. OK?\u201d OK.</p> <p>Anderson\u2019s career has grown alongside social media and its impact on the industry means that what it means to be a model has changed. \u201cIn the time of Kate and Naomi it would take years to get a <em>Vogue</em> cover. Now it just takes followers. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2016/feb/27/gigi-hadid-stars-at-the-milan-versace-show-in-pictures\">Gigi</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/jun/30/kendall-jenner-instagram-photo-most-liked-history\">Kendall</a>? Supermodels? No way.\u201d Since talking about make-up artists on Twitter, she has decided not to discuss race and fashion \u201cbecause it changes nothing. Three years ago there was a big push to see more black models. That year I walked 13 shows. The next year, when it had died down? One. I\u2019ve stopped trying to get work in Milan any more. They\u2019ll say: \u2018Sorry, we don\u2019t want any Africans this season.\u2019 It would be easier if they just put a sign on the door, \u2018No blacks allowed.\u2019\u2019\u2019 She chuckles, and sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to say: \u2018We need more black models\u2019 than to investigate institutional racism in places where diversity really matters \u2013 police, government, even media.\u201d</p> <p>But, I say, you\u2019re not discussing that. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not discussing that any more.\u201d She holds my gaze for a second, before cracking into laughter.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s 40 years since Richard Dawkins suggested, in the opening words of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/04/100-best-nonfiction-books-10-selfish-gene-richard-dawkins\" title=\"\"><em>The Selfish Gene</em></a>, that, were an alien to visit Earth, the question it would pose to judge our intellectual maturity was: \u201cHave they discovered evolution yet?\u201d We had, of course, by the grace of Charles Darwin and a century of evolutionary biologists who had been trying to figure out how natural selection actually worked. In 1976, <em>The Selfish Gene</em> became the first real blockbuster popular science book, a poetic mark in the sand to the public and scientists alike: this idea had to enter our thinking, our research and our culture.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Previous attempts to explain evolution had been academic and rooted in maths. Dawkins walked us through it in prose</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The idea was this: genes strive for immortality, and individuals, families, and species are merely vehicles in that quest. The behaviour of all living things is in service of their genes hence, metaphorically, they are selfish. Before this, it had been proposed that natural selection was honing the behaviour of living things to promote the continuance through time of the individual creature, or family, or group or species. But in fact, Dawkins said, it was the gene itself that was trying to survive, and it just so happened that the best way for it to survive was in concert with other genes in the impermanent husk of an individual.</p> <p>This gene-centric view of evolution also began to explain one of the oddities of life on Earth \u2013 the behaviour of social insects. What is the point of a drone bee, doomed to remain childless and in the service of a totalitarian queen? Suddenly it made sense that, with the gene itself steering evolution, the fact that the drone shared its DNA with the queen meant that its servitude guarantees not the individual\u2019s survival, but the endurance of the genes they share. Or as the Anglo-Indian biologist JBS Haldane put it: \u201cWould I lay down my life to save my brother? No, but I would to save two brothers or eight\u00a0cousins.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d882560cf3892e7370a8b75a72d3729889866d6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d882560cf3892e7370a8b75a72d3729889866d6c/1076_1369_1892_2917/649.jpg\" alt=\"The original Selfish Gene book cover, illustrated by Desmond Morris\" width=\"649\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The original book cover, illustrated by Desmond Morris.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These ideas were espoused by only a handful of scientists in the middle decades of the 20th century \u2013 notably Bob Trivers, Bill Hamilton, John Maynard Smith and George Williams. In <em>The Selfish Gene, </em>Dawkins did not merely recapitulate them; he made an impassioned argument for the reality of natural selection. Previous attempts to explain the mechanics of evolution had been academic and rooted in maths. Dawkins walked us through it in prose. Many great popular science books followed \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/sep/27/scienceandnature.books\" title=\"\">Stephen Hawking\u2019s <em>A Brief History of Time</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2009/jun/18/iq-steven-pinker-blank-slate\" title=\"\">Stephen Pinker\u2019s <em>The Blank Slate</em></a>, and, currently, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/apr/22/the-vital-question-nick-lane-review-secret-life\" title=\"\"><em>The Vital Question</em></a> by Nick Lane.</p> <p>For many of us, <em>The Selfish Gene </em>was our first proper taste of evolution. I don\u2019t remember it being a controversial subject in my youth. In fact, I don\u2019t remember it being taught at all. Evolution, Darwin and natural selection were largely absent from my secondary education in the late 1980s. The national curriculum, introduced in the UK in 1988, included some evolution, but before 1988 its presence in schools was far from universal. As an aside, in my opinion the subject is taught bafflingly minimally and late in the curriculum even today; evolution by natural selection is crucial to every aspect of the living world. In the words of the Russian scientist Theodosius Dobzhansky: \u201cNothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.\u201d</p> <p>Back in the 1980s, it fell to the BBC to switch on the light for me. Repeats of David Attenborough\u2019s 1979 series <em>Life on Earth</em> were the prime source of my exposure to natural selection, and though wondrous, the scientific content is slight. But if Attenborough was the gateway drug to a love of evolution, Dawkins made me an addict. My father, a psychologist, had a first edition of <em>The Selfish Gene</em>, the hardback with the <em>Monty Python</em>-esque cover, those strangely evolved shapes stalking a surreal landscape drawn by the zoologist Desmond Morris. Dawkins\u2019s prose is lucid and powerful, his argument difficult to contend. I bought my own copy at university, and when I pulled it from my shelf today, tucked inside I found my old University College London photocopier credit card, a Proustian trigger to my undergraduate days in the 1990s.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If Attenborough was my gateway drug to a love of evolutionary theory, Dawkins made me an addict</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is a shame that Dawkins is now perhaps better known for his irritable contempt for religion, since his true legacy is <em>The Selfish Gene</em> and its profound effect on multiple generations of scientists and lay readers. In a sense, <em>The Selfish Gene</em> and Dawkins himself are bridges, both intellectually and chronologically, between the titans of mid-century biology \u2013 Ronald Fisher, Trivers, Hamilton, Maynard Smith and Williams \u2013 and our era of the genome, in which the interrogation of DNA dominates the study of evolution.</p> <p>Since 1976, our understanding of why life is the way it is has blossomed and changed. Once the gene became the dominant idea in biology in the 1990s there followed a technological goldrush \u2013 the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/human-genome-project\" title=\"\">Human Genome Project</a> \u2013 to find them all. Then it turned out that we didn\u2019t have enough genes to account for our presumed sophistication, and that the genome itself was replete with DNA that wasn\u2019t made up of genes. Many of these areas were genetic control switches, the on and off buttons to tell genes where and when to function. Some are just the decaying remains of genes whose function have been lost in time.</p> <p>Genes aren\u2019t what they used to be either. In 1976 they were simply stretches of DNA that encoded proteins. We now know about genes made of DNA\u2019s cousin, RNA; we\u2019ve discovered genes that hop from genome to genome, inserting themselves into a new host to be replicated there. And what by far the larger part of the genome is doing for much of the time is still something of a mystery. Today we can scan genomes by the hundreds and look for the signals of natural selection in DNA, regardless of what that DNA is actually doing. It\u2019s like knowing an animal had been there by finding its prints in the forest. Genomics has become an industry devoted to trying to work out the immense complexities of DNA. None of the complications of modern genomes erodes the central premise of the selfish gene.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I was an undergraduate, I recall a tutor shirtily suggesting that I read some papers rather than 'that book'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Dawkins himself has attracted more than his fair share of animosity over the years. Setting aside the response to his views on religion and politics, there have been plenty of attacks on the idea of the selfish gene. When I was an undergraduate, I recall a tutor rather shirtily suggesting that I should read some papers rather than \u201cthat book\u201d, and <em>The Selfish Gene</em> has been attacked variously by philosophers, comedians, vicars and journalists too. Much of the enmity stems from people misunderstanding that selfishness is being used as a metaphor. The irony of these attacks is that the selfish gene metaphor actually explains altruism. We help others who are not directly related to us because we share similar versions of genes with them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6d04e6d4057b3c92cf958fa62f2e88138bc493f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6d04e6d4057b3c92cf958fa62f2e88138bc493f/0_50_1191_764/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Selfish Gene genetic DNA illustration\" width=\"1000\" height=\"641\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>In the scientific community, the chief objection maintains that natural selection can operate at the level of a group of animals, not solely on genes or even individuals. These exchanges, such as with the great <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/jun/24/battle-of-the-professors\" title=\"\">entomologist EO Wilson</a>, are often ill-tempered spats, in which entrenched positions are expressed with animosity. To my mind, and that of the majority of evolutionary biologists, the gene-centric view of evolution always emerges intact.</p> <p>It\u2019s also an idea that permeates all biology, right back to the beginnings of life on Earth. We\u2019ve made great strides in understanding the process by which chemistry on Earth became biology. Life was simpler then, and the first information encoded in a gene would probably have simply been the instruction to replicate itself. Molecules that do just that have been created in the lab, or, more precisely, have been allowed to create themselves by a process of chemical natural selection. We will never know whether these self-replicators are like the ones at the beginning of life, because those are lost to very ancient history. But the premise remains exciting that a gene\u2019s only desire is to reproduce itself, and that the complexity of genomes makes that reproduction more efficient.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9864bed450d5f3918367b460c2ff4d3104b96050\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9864bed450d5f3918367b460c2ff4d3104b96050/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Richard Dawkins in 2014\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Richard Dawkins today: he has regretted the title of his book, since many failed to see \u2018selfish\u2019 was being used metaphorically.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Where Dawkins places the origin of life squarely with the origin of replicators, ie the first gene, an emerging view suggests otherwise. This view (as I argue in my most recent book) is that this process \u2013 genetics \u2013 followed the establishment of a system that could <em>host </em>that information replication. Genes in cells rely on a metabolism that generates the power needed for them to enact their programmes and replicate themselves. It seems to me to be important that we try to understand the origins of biology by modelling what living things actually <em>do</em>. Logically, a metabolism of sorts must have preceded the establishment of the first selfish gene, and some of us now think that it might have occurred deep in the geological crannies in the ocean floors some 4bn years ago.</p> <p>Life has been continuous on this planet ever since \u2013 on a sort of single evolutionary tree (which more like sprawling tangled thicket now). We share dozens of genes with our most distant relatives, single-celled bacteria and archaea. These are probably the most successful \u2013 the most selfish \u2013 of any genes, since their existence spans the entire duration of life on Earth.</p> <p>Richard Dawkins has occasionally lamented his own choice of the \u201cselfish gene\u201d title since it has for decades been misinterpreted by detractors and fools. He has said he might have preferred <em>The Immortal Gene</em>. I disagree, as immortality implies foresight, and is for ever. Species go extinct, and genes can be lost even after millennia of success. Life has no plan other than to keep chugging along. Nevertheless, <em>The Selfish Gene</em> has attained its own literary and scientific immortality: as long as we study life, it will be read.</p> <p><em>Adam Rutherford is the author of Creation: The Origin of Life/The Future of Life (Penguin, \u00a39,99).

      "body": "<p>When lost, baffled and afraid, I yearn for guidance from an outside power. But is there a God? I hope so. But it\u2019s hard to be sure. If there is, He doesn\u2019t seem to pipe up that often with concrete advice. The same cannot be said for the man some consider His slayer, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/dawkins\">Richard Dawkins</a>. He is possessed of all the certainty I look for in the Almighty and his truth is a lot more effable. God is dead, long live God. In the apparent absence of omniscience, I\u2019ll settle for a know-all.</p> <p>So I was glad to hear that the revered professor had spoken out about the forthcoming <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\">EU referendum</a>, a subject that has made me feel particularly lost, baffled and afraid lately. Don\u2019t misunderstand me, I know how I\u2019m going to vote \u2013 I\u2019m for Remain. I\u2019m unshakable on that. I just don\u2019t know if I\u2019m right. And I also don\u2019t know if the side I\u2019m going to vote for will win. I fear the consequences of its defeat and, to a lesser but still significant extent, I fear the consequences of its victory. I\u2019m not finding any of this much fun.</p> <p>But <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/higher-education/dawkins-speaks-out/news-story/3d252a2a2a24702b45092626f1ef60b3\">Dawkins\u2019s words</a> gave me solace. He said: \u201cIt is an outrage that people as ignorant as me are being asked to vote. This is a complicated matter of economics, politics, history, and we live in a representative democracy not a plebiscite democracy. You could make a case for having plebiscites on certain issues \u2013 I could imagine somebody arguing for one on fox hunting, for example \u2013 but not on something as involved as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/eu\">European Union</a>. This should be a matter for parliament.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was comforted by the thought that Dawkins, too, longs for the intercession of a greater power: not God, but government</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Goal! Hear hear! Amen. That is so totally what I think, but I didn\u2019t realise until I heard it. It was a wondrous epiphany. If the man can work such miracles, maybe there is no God. And I was comforted by the thought that Dawkins, too, longs for the intercession of a greater power: not God, but government. In Britain we get to choose our leaders, and dismiss them if we\u2019re disappointed by the direction they\u2019ve led us in. But we must surely reserve our bitterest disappointment for leaders who refuse to lead us anywhere at all.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a340b297d8d76cb668edec7dd88a484c5c5ba549\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a340b297d8d76cb668edec7dd88a484c5c5ba549/0_0_1790_3011/594.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by David Foldvari.\" width=\"594\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by David Foldvari.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Calling this referendum is the worst thing Cameron has done to Britain. It\u2019s such a hugely selfish and irresponsible act that I can hardly believe we\u2019ve wasted so long talking about how he\u2019s eviscerating the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/nhs\">NHS</a>, attacking the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/06/bbc-report-niche-distinctiveness-david-mitchell\">BBC</a> and slashing disability benefits when, horrendous though those developments are, this crime is much greater because its consequences could be irreversible.</p> <p>The issues surrounding Britain\u2019s membership of the EU are complicated. The EU\u2019s problems, its waste and questionable democratic accountability, are clear. So are its trade advantages and the transformation of Europe under its influence from the world\u2019s most murderous war zone, in which each generation strove to slaughter in greater numbers than its predecessor, to a largely peaceful continent. Crucially, the EU has made the prospect of a war between France and Germany unthinkable. Few people in 1945 would fail to be amazed and overjoyed by such an achievement.</p> <p>Maybe the EU\u2019s flaws are leading inexorably to tyranny. Or maybe imperialist and xenophobic emotions within Britain are luring us into a self-defeating isolation that will insult our neighbours and make us poorer. These are just the quandaries that come up when you think about it for five minutes. The deeper you get into it, the more terrifying questions arise.</p> <p>What is the point in politicians if it isn\u2019t to give clear answers to those questions? To understand the broad truth that this country wants to continue to exist independently, but also wants to accept global realities enough to protect its prosperity, and then make a bloody decision? Yet both major parties are, to a certain extent, divided on the issue \u2013 the party of government disastrously so.</p> <p>Cameron has structured his whole career around avoiding this question \u2013 around continuing to lead a party that\u2019s divided on the most important decision about the country\u2019s future. All because he worked out that, if the subject of the EU was properly debated by the Tories, the party would split and it would be harder for him to become prime minister.</p> <p>So he has conspired in the absurd scenario where successive general elections have been fought on other issues \u2013 where Britain\u2019s future in Europe has not really been addressed by the Tories and instead this bunch of aspiring leaders who can\u2019t agree on this vital issue of leadership have brushed it aside, saying: \u201cWe\u2019ll hold a referendum\u201d; \u201cWe\u2019ll let you decide\u201d; \u201cLet us be captain of the ship but we\u2019ll negotiate the most lethal reefs by holding a steering vote among the passengers.\u201d I don\u2019t think a political party has any business existing if it can\u2019t agree a policy on this.</p> <p>Cameron\u2019s policy-avoidance policy was deftly done, mind you. It plays well, rhetorically \u2013 telling people they\u2019ll get to decide, flattering the public\u2019s estimation of its collective wisdom. It\u2019s a rhetoric politicians have increasingly used of late: \u201cWe\u2019re just normal decent people who listen\u201d; \u201cWe\u2019re like an unthreatening mate whose heart\u2019s in the right place\u201d; \u201cBy putting us in power you haven\u2019t committed to anything except fair and sensible niceness for hard-working people who do the right thing.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMake the public think that all a leader needs to be is normal and inoffensive, and then maybe I\u2019ve got a chance!\u201d is the modern politician\u2019s motto. We\u2019ve stopped looking to MPs to display great intelligence, insight, fortitude or a cool head in a crisis. Now they just get to shrug and say \u201cIt\u2019s tricky, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cVote for me, I think it\u2019s tricky too!\u201d</p> <p>They won\u2019t step up and lead. They won\u2019t say they know. Expertise is dismissed as elitist. It\u2019s worse to be \u201cout of touch\u201d with the price of milk than to misunderstand the consequences of Britain suddenly severing all its trade deals. They\u2019re happy for that decision to be made by random vote after a frenzied few months of both sides trying to make the other seem the more apocalyptic or Hitlerian, everyone suddenly so certain in their hyperbole.</p> <p>Except perhaps David Cameron himself. He\u2019s campaigning for Remain but, according to his long-time political ally <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/26/david-cameron-would-be-in-favour-of-leaving-eu-if-he-werent-pm-says-steve-hilton\">Steve Hilton</a>, Cameron\u2019s \u201cinstinct\u201d is for Brexit: \u201cIf he were a member of the public\u2026 I\u2019m certain that he would be for Leave.\u201d So perhaps he can\u2019t decide. Our leader doesn\u2019t know which way to go. I\u2019m not just sorry he\u2019s prime minister \u2013 I\u2019m sorry he gets a vote.</p>",

      "body": "<p> After three dates, and an almighty kerfuffle over tickets, Radiohead\u2019s mini-residency at London\u2019s Roundhouse comes to an end. As much attention has been given over the past three nights to those stuck outside without tickets as those inside \u2013 take the plight of one young fan who bought a last-minute ticket on Gumtree only to fall foul of the venue\u2019s stringent ID checks. Even a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/getcallumhouseinroundhouse?src=hash\">Twitter hashtag</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theladbible.com/articles/let-s-get-this-lad-to-the-roundhouse-to-see-radiohead-280516\">an intervention from the Lad Bible</a> wasn\u2019t enough to help him beyond the velvet rope.</p> <p>For those who have been able to get through the doors, the rewards have been plentiful. For so long, Radiohead, as a live experience, have felt distant, both in their often recalcitrant demeanour and in their physical remove from the crowd in vast venues like the O2. The Roundhouse forces an unusual level of intimacy on a band of their size. Not only have these been the most intimate Radiohead performances in some time, they\u2019ve also been some of the most intriguing, featuring set lists chock-full of favourites, from The Bends onwards, as well as a handful of rarities.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/28/radiohead-review-textured-set-which-flits-between-medicinal-bliss-and-fractious-fury\">Radiohead review: textured set that flits between medicinal bliss and fractious fury</a> </p> </aside>  <p></p> <p>The band open with their now customary run of songs from A Moon Shaped Pool. Despite the album having been out only for a matter of weeks, there\u2019s something worn-in and familiar about these songs \u2013 a fair few of them have been in the band\u2019s live repertoire for some time. Burn the Witch, stripped of the strings of the recorded version, feels thicker and somehow more triumphant. . Everyone remains rapt throughout the new tracks, from the itchy, urgent Identikit to the languid soul of The Numbers.</p> <p>One of the most persistent observations about A Moon Shaped Pool has been that, in its absence of synthetic sounds and accessible song structures, it represents Radiohead finally becoming at ease with their early rockier incarnation. Certainly there\u2019s a sense that the band are comfortable dipping into their various iterations. Where once you got the sense that older material was being performed somewhat grudgingly, here Yorke seems equally at ease during Lucky as he does The Gloaming, becoming a wavy-armed raver during the latter\u2019s glitchy breakdown. <br /></p> <p>Yorke\u2019s rather crotchety reputation seems to have been completely upended over these three nights, and he\u2019s an immensely effusive presence on this final night. During the first of two encores, a gentle acoustic rendition of Give Up the Ghost from The King of Limbs is derailed by some errant whooping from a particularly boozy quarter of the crowd. It\u2019s the sort of thing that might prompt an angry walkoff in a less celebratory environment, but here Yorke cuts the track short with a nonchalant \u201cfuck it\u201d, before jokingly suggesting that he\u2019ll see the perpetrator after the gig. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/27/radiohead-review-roundhouse-london-thom-yorke\">Radiohead review \u2013 Yorke and co hit new heights on a night of muscular mayhem</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In truth, Radiohead can afford to write off the odd track, given the breadth of their output. It\u2019s hard to think of few bands who could earn one of the largest cheers of the night from a B-side, but the latent menace of Talk Show Host manages it.</p> <p> The only gripe you might have about this final Roundhouse date is that, given that bountiful back catalogue, there aren\u2019t more of the sort of surprises that were being predicted by the superfans. A debut on this current tour for Yorke\u2019s lovely piano-led rendition of Like Spinning Plates, all rolling arpeggios and quiet unease, proves deeply satisfying. But there\u2019s no shock on the level of Creep, dusted off for a rare performance in Paris last week. Nor is there True Love Waits, an unreleased tour favourite that was resurfaced on A Moon Shaped Pool, and would have likely blown away the Roundhouse\u2019s audience. Yet, given the feast on offer, these seem like minor quibbles, and as the closing Paranoid Android reaches its thrilling climax, few care about what they\u2019re not hearing.</p> <h2>Set list:</h2> <p>Burn the Witch<br tabindex=\"-1\" />Daydreaming<br tabindex=\"-1\" />Decks Dark<br tabindex=\"-1\" />Desert Island Disk<br tabindex=\"-1\" />Ful Stop<br tabindex=\"-1\" />Lucky<br tabindex=\"-1\" />Talk Show Host<br tabindex=\"-1\" />Separator<br tabindex=\"-1\" />Climbing Up the Walls<br />Like Spinning Plates<br />Tinker Tailor Soldier Sailor Rich Man Poor Man Beggar Man Thief<br />Identikit<br />The Numbers <br />The Gloaming <br tabindex=\"-1\" />Everything in its Right Place<br tabindex=\"-1\" />Idioteque<br tabindex=\"-1\" />Bodysnatchers</p> <p><strong>Encore 1<br /></strong></p> <p>Give Up the Ghost<br tabindex=\"-1\" />Bloom<br tabindex=\"-1\" />Present Tense<br tabindex=\"-1\" />2+2= 5<br tabindex=\"-1\" />There There</p> <p><strong>Encore 2</strong></p> <p>Nude<br />Paranoid Android</p>",

      "body": "<p>In a disused military aircraft hangar buried deep in a granite hillside, Johan Tofeldt flicks a switch on the future of mining.</p> <p>\u201cLook, no hands!\u201d he beams, as the truck lurches backwards and executes a precise reverse. \u201cIt\u2019s a little heavy on the clutch, but then it\u2019s not designed for driver comfort.\u201d</p> <p>The cheerful Swede is sitting in a standard Volvo FMX heavy duty truck, a haulage industry workhorse. But where once there was a narrow bed behind the seat there is now a laptop and a tangle of wires. This is Volvo Group\u2019s driverless truck, designed to work in underground mines far beyond the limits of GPS navigation.</p> <p>Hitting a button on the dashboard turns the vehicle into a robot. A controller in a remote location sends a digital \u201cmission\u201d to the truck, which sets off into the gloom, threading itself through narrow gaps in the deserted tunnels.</p> <p>Six lidar (light radar) laser sensors positioned around the vehicle generate a cloud of data points, creating a 3D map of the surroundings and enabling the truck to navigate precisely and, in principle, to respond to unexpected obstacles or people.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYmKI2o_uag\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gYmKI2o_uag?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Volvo\u2019s self-driving lorry in action.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Challenged to leave his seat and jump out in front of the truck, however, Tofeldt declines: \u201cSafety comes first, and we still don\u2019t trust it,\u201d he says. This is an experimental model, and Volvo doesn\u2019t want the wrong sort of headlines at the launch of its flagship automation project.</p> <p>Driverless trucks are beginning to make business sense. The mining industry in particular \u2013 free from other road users and unpredictable pedestrians \u2013 is pioneering the technology. In October, Rio Tinto <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/43f7436a-7632-11e5-a95a-27d368e1ddf7.html\">rolled out two fleets of fully automated driverless trucks</a> at iron ore mines in Western Australia, in what it claimed to be a world first. Rivals BHP Billiton and Fortescue are not far behind. </p> <p>Volvo has gone into partnership with Swedish mining group Boliden to develop the technology, spurred on by potential productivity gains, improvements in safety and environmental benefits.</p> <p>\u201cWe do things to make our customers more profitable \u2013 the difference between us and the car industry is that we don\u2019t just add technology for the fun of it: there has to be a business case,\u201d says Torbj\u00f6rn Holmstr\u00f6m, Volvo Group\u2019s chief technology officer.</p> <p>\u201cIndustry is strongly driven by what makes commercial sense right now, which also includes buses, excavators and dumpers \u2013 there is lots of potential for automation.\u201d</p> <p>From a ruthless costs point of view, autonomous vehicle technology eliminates the salaries of drivers, who also need to take meal breaks, sleep, and take time off sick. \u201cIn a confined area where you have control and no pedestrians, driverless is relatively easy \u2013 it is ridiculous to have the overheads of staff,\u201d says Kevin Curran, leader of the ambient intelligence research group at the University of Ulster. \u201cAnd with GPS you can build sensors for peanuts.\u201d</p> <p>For these reasons Volvo has gone straight for the highest possible level of automation straightaway. \u201cWe believe high levels of autonomy will come to mines first, where we are not restricted by legislation in the same way as we would be if we were preparing to drive on public highways,\u201d says Anders Kellstr\u00f6m, a senior planning manager at the company. \u201cIt makes sense and is technically possible to do, so we are doing it.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"38b3667f25b6d97a24b5243f427365c0c154e6bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38b3667f25b6d97a24b5243f427365c0c154e6bb/0_0_2362_1417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The modified Volvo FMX truck\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The modified Volvo FMX truck is being prepared for driverless tests in a real mine this autumn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Cicci jonson/Bilduppdraget</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The technical systems differ very much from how people drive. Human drivers are still the best</p> <footer> <cite>Ola Benderius, professor</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are other advantages, truck companies claim. Cost savings can be measured on a societal level, because there will be a need for fewer vehicles, reducing CO<sub>2</sub> and fuel consumption, while driverless technology also has safety benefits. Mines are full of hazards, so reducing the number of people in them cuts the risk of accidents, and the costs associated with them.</p> <p>Is it realistic to expect to see driverless juggernauts not just in mines, but also hurtling along Europe\u2019s roads?</p> <p>Last month, six of the largest European truck brands took part in an EU programme to trial the driving of \u201cplatoons\u201d of driverless trucks in close proximity to each other, thereby cutting fuel consumption by reducing air drag. Companies such as Otto, formed by former Google executives this month, are racing to develop autonomous vehicle technology for the long-haul trucking industry.</p> <p>But Volvo Group is cautious. \u201cCustomers realise the challenges are quite significant to putting driverless trucks on the roads,\u201d Kellstr\u00f6m says.</p> <p>The Swedish truck maker\u2019s former stablemate, Volvo Cars, meanwhile, is pressing ahead with ambitious plans to bring driverless passenger cars to the streets. Next year it will trial 100 autonomous cars in Gothenburg and a similar number in London, promising to \u201crevolutionise Britain\u2019s roads\u201d to make them faster, cleaner and safer. </p> <p>However, the cars will only use specified stretches of major roads in a data-collecting exercise aimed at mapping possible scenarios \u2013 a far cry from mining, where unpleasant surprises can be minimised and the environment is far more structured.</p> <p>\u201cIt is hard to speculate how long we will have to wait to see driverless cars on the roads \u2013 a decade, perhaps?\u201d says Ola Benderius, an assistant professor working with adaptive systems at the Department of Applied Mechanics at Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, who is developing automated driving systems that mimic human behaviour.</p> <p>\u201cThe technical systems developed by the automotive industry differ very much from how people drive. Human drivers are still the best.\u201d</p> <p>Back in the underground hangar, Tofeldt has no illusions about the obstacles ahead. Volvo\u2019s driverless trucks will be piloted in a real mine in northern Sweden in the autumn, which will bring a host of complications.</p> <p>\u201cThese tunnels are like a living room compared to a mine,\u201d he says.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-29T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Brian May is examining his hands. His fingernails are painted with a futuristic, silvery polish, but it\u2019s his fingertips he\u2019s focused on. They are, he informs me, covered with soft calluses. It\u2019s hardly surprising \u2013 he\u2019s just flown in from Barcelona, where he\u2019s been on tour, thrashing out hits with Queen (with <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/watch-adam-lamberts-soaring-american-idol-return-20160318\" title=\"\"><em>American Idol</em> runner-up Adam Lambert</a> on Freddie duties). But here in London, his guitar is nowhere in sight. Because it\u2019s not a gig he\u2019s eager to talk about: it\u2019s the launch of his latest invention.</p> <p>Dubbed the <a href=\"http://www.londonstereo.com/\" title=\"\">\u201cOwl VR Smartphone Kit\u201d</a>, his low-tech, adjustable plastic gadget looks like a cross between a kiddie\u2019s shoe gauge and <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/get/cardboard/\" title=\"\">Google Cardboard.</a> By attaching a smartphone to the back of its frame, using some tape, a metal plate and a magnet, the device can be used to view 360-degree videos \u2013 handy, since Queen are currently filming one of their own. But as May reveals, it can do far more than that. Slot in a card bearing two, almost identical, photographs and when you look through the lenses the image suddenly bounces forth in glorious 3D \u2013 a technique known as stereoscopy. With an app, he demonstrates, you can even make 3D versions of your smartphone shots. \u201cThis is a proper scientific instrument,\u201d he says, with the confidence of a man who has a patent pending.</p> <p>His pride in the contraption is palpable, and rather endearing \u2013 not least because he admits his invention (available for \u00a325 a pop this June) is unlikely to be a big money-spinner. But\u00a0then, May is on something of a mission to share his seemingly inexhaustible fascination with the art of stereoscopy. As well as <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/about/press-office/press-releases/dr-brian-may-lends-rare-victorian-3d-photographs-tate-britain\" title=\"\">lending the Tate highlights from his vast collection of Victorian \u201cstereocards\u201d</a>, he\u2019s co-authored several books on the topic and spent years tinkering away to\u00a0perfect the Owl. Essentially an upgrade of the Victorian stereoscope, it not only lets you marvel at images from the past, but also propels you into virtual reality. And that, says May, might have more attractions than you\u2019d\u00a0think...</p> <p><strong>Let\u2019s be honest, an obsession with Victorian photographs is a bit niche. Where did that come from?</strong><br />It all happened when I was a kid. I opened my eyes and I saw the world around me. I loved music and I loved images as well. And I loved astronomy \u2013 I used to beg to be allowed to stay up to watch Patrick Moore on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6t0exJznEZg\" title=\"\"><em>The Sky at Night</em></a>. I was told when I was a kid that you can\u2019t be an artist and a scientist: you have to choose. I felt very strongly that there was something wrong with this, and I always pursued music alongside the science I loved. Stereoscopy, to me, is magical.</p> <p><strong>How did you stumble across it?</strong><br />I think it was the hippopotamus in the wild animal series of <a href=\"http://www.monarkcameras.com/Vistascreen/NEW_Vistascreen.htm\" title=\"\">Vistascreen</a>. They gave them away free in Weetabix packets. I would have been nine, and I sent away for the viewer \u2013 it cost one-and-six pence plus a Weetabix packet top \u2013 and you got a little Vistascreen viewer back. Suddenly, instead of two little pictures there was the hippopotamus, real, with its mouth yawning, and you felt like you were going to fall in. I was just enchanted.</p> <p>Virtual reality and 360-videos seem a world away from Victorian \u201c3D\u201d, but it\u2019s all the same. The Victorians were for the first time able to see their favourite politicians and royalty and actors privately, in their stereoscope, but they were also travelling to the pyramids, to China and to India. They didn\u2019t have TV or the internet or films; they had the stereoscope \u2013 and they experienced the world in a way that was totally new. I think virtual reality is going to bring us back to this.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fbb22cfb8e334bbaea63b73db8b9e8a1b8c489ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbb22cfb8e334bbaea63b73db8b9e8a1b8c489ae/0_0_3065_4833/634.jpg\" alt=\"Brian May\" width=\"634\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><strong>As well as this gadget, you famously invented your </strong><a href=\"http://www.theredspecial.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Red Special guitar</strong></a><strong>\u2026 do you have a house full of contraptions you are working on?</strong><br />I love inventing. I have my little workshop and all sorts of stuff happens down there. The first version of this was made out of cardboard \u2013 this was all designed geometrically in my little workshop. We did a guitar and we made a telescope in my dad\u2019s workshop. I am always doing stuff.</p> <p><strong>Was Queen a distraction from science, or science a distraction from Queen?</strong><br />Both, really. I always believed that I should do both, that I could do both. But when I was attempting to finish off my PhD in astronomy at Imperial College London \u2013 not succeeding \u2013 we were rehearsing Queen and I was teaching in a comprehensive school. It was painful that I had to give up something in order to do something else. But I did \u2013 I said \u201cMusic is calling me, and if I don\u2019t answer that call now it will go away\u201d. So we all went off and took a giant step. But strangely enough, when you take a giant step in one direction it gives you the opportunity to take other giant steps later on; so I was able to come back to the PhD 30 years later and finish it off. I was able to come back to stereoscopy because it never really left me.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you could put virtual reality in an abattoir, I think we'd see a lot of people turning vegan overnight</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>You\u2019re passionate about animal rights, particularly when it comes to badgers and foxes. Do you think virtual reality and 360-degree videos, like those you can view with the Owl, have a role in activism?</strong><br />I think so. I think if this technology could be applied to letting people understand that animals have the same kind of feelings as we do, that would be a giant step. If you could step into this world through virtual reality and become a fox which is being pursued by a pack of hungry hounds, and experience being torn apart, I think that might actually change a few people\u2019s sensibilities. If you could put virtual reality in an abattoir and if people could see what happens to those animals that they were eating, I think we\u2019d see a lot of people turning vegan overnight.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve also been vocal about fracking - how do you feel about </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/24/anti-fracking-activists-declare-war-north-yorkshire-ruling-kirby-misperton\" title=\"\"><strong>the latest plans in North Yorkshire</strong></a><strong>?</strong><br />I think it\u2019s another example of money winning, selfishness winning. Nobody cares that they are inconveniencing other people, destroying other people\u2019s lives. I think we have gone wrong in Britain: we have the wrong kind of people governing us \u2013 people who have no concept that other people\u00a0matter.</p> <p><strong>Should we be looking for extraterrestrial homes for mankind, or should we pay more attention to looking after Earth?</strong><br />I\u2019d love to see us looking after our planet. If we start setting up colonies on other planets, we are going to ruin them as well, aren\u2019t we? I actually said this at a <a href=\"http://www.starmus.com/\" title=\"\">Starmus convention</a>, and in the front couple of rows were about 10 astronauts. I said, with great trepidation, \u201cI admire these people for going off on pioneering space travel. But I fear for humanity, doing this, because I don\u2019t think humanity is ready. We destroy everything we touch.\u201d I came off and Neil Armstrong came up to me and said \u201cYou\u2019re right, that needed to be said.\u201d I treasure that moment.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve also embraced blogging with your page, </strong><a href=\"http://brianmay.com/brian/brianssb/brianssb.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Brian\u2019s Soapbox</strong></a><strong>. You seem pretty pissed off a lot of the time. Has society gone to hell in a handcart?</strong><br />That\u2019s what soapboxes are for \u2013 to get angry on. I think Britain is in a horrible, awful state, where it is obsessed by economics and money and it has forgotten that life is to be lived and enjoyed. I hate the building that goes on senselessly to satisfy people\u2019s speculative desire to make money. London is a disaster.</p> <p><strong>Are you ever tempted to just grab your Owl and immerse yourself in the good old days - back to Queen\u2019s early years, for\u00a0instance?</strong><br />Back to 1851, perhaps. I would love to be at the Great Exhibition \u2013 the Crystal Palace that was in Hyde Park. To walk in to that would be unbelievable. I think virtual reality will take care of that one day.</p> <p><a href=\"http://londonstereo.com/\" title=\"\"><em>londonstereo.com</em></a></p>",

      "body": "<p>This is the first full-on LGBTQ+ book that I have read. What We Left Behind by Robin Talley is a coming-of-age novel. People all around the world are finally starting to understand the LGBTQ+ community. Considering the fact that this community is vast, it is really hard for anyone to fully understand it. Robin Talley\u2019s book surely expanded my horizons about these issues \u2013 I won\u2019t say I am an expert now but I have a broader perspective on people in general.</p> <p>This book is initially a high-school love story of a perfect lesbian couple \u2013 Toni and Gretchen \u2013 who are leaving for college. They end up in different cities which is obviously hard for both of them. However, they try to make their relationship work. But as they go separate ways, Toni joins a Harvard community where she is introduced to people with different sexualities. That makes her wonder who she is. She gets so absorbed in figuring who she is that she starts neglecting her girlfriend, hiding things from her and lying to her. Gretchen is equally suffering. She had always defined herself based on her relationship, which is scaring her. If Toni decides to be a boy what does that make her?

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-29T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p><strong><em>The Gene</em> is subtitled An Intimate History, and a very personal story runs through it. Can you explain what that is</strong><br />The book gets intimate from the first page. I have two uncles who have schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and then one of my cousins, also from my father\u2019s side, was also diagnosed with schizophrenia and institutionalised. So that story hung over my childhood and raised questions that were very urgent. Would I be affected? Was there a genetic predisposition? What was happening in my family? We\u2019re often tempted to think about genes in terms of laboratories or universities, but of course it\u2019s personal: it\u2019s your story, it\u2019s my story, it\u2019s a story of how hereditary factors influence our lives. It\u2019s the question that we\u2019ve all wondered about. Why do we look like this? Why do we behave like this? Why are we like this?</p> <p><strong>Did you uncover things about yourself?</strong><br />Absolutely. I had blocked out anything to do with mental illness. I didn\u2019t want to understand partly because I was too fearful of understanding, but then this book allowed me to answer that with a clarity I would have otherwise lacked. When you have a history like this, amazing forces of denial rise inside you. Much of my childhood and my family was organised around the idea that it wasn\u2019t there.</p> <p><strong>What you wrote about your mother\u2019s experience of being an identical twin was very moving. The idea of the twin, with the same genome, but shaped differently by experience, as a shadow self living another life, was very powerful. Did you ever think about your shadow self? What he might be doing now?</strong><br />That\u2019s a wonderful question. You know if you think about genes in a deep way, you do have to think about alternative lives because you have to think about what would happen if that same set of genes, that same self, was put under very different circumstances. It\u2019s a natural question that arises. I think everyone thinks about alternative lives. We have fictional doppelg\u00e4ngers. That idea has been around a long time, but our knowledge of genes has increased our anxieties around it.</p> <p><strong>Though you\u2019ve carefully avoided the question\u2026</strong><br />I could certainly still be in India. Perhaps never having left the neighbourhood that I grew up in. I could easily have not been a scientist\u2026 it could have been very, very different.</p> <p><strong>Though you already embody a number of alternate selves, don\u2019t you? You\u2019re a research scientist and a practising oncologist and an award-winning writer. It\u2019s quite a lot for any one person, isn\u2019t it?</strong><br />Yes. I mean I try to fulfil my roles. I try to always turn back to patients. And almost all the research I do is focused on moving medicine forward. So in some ways by restricting the themes, I find it actually becomes much easier.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Much of my childhood and my family was organised around the idea that mental illness wasn\u2019t there</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Your scientific work sounds incredibly involving and intellectually complex\u2026 it did make me wonder where this drive to write books as well comes from?</strong><br />This book came out of a need to describe what it was that I was looking for in trying to search for answers for my family illness. What that means and what it would mean for the future. It starts as a memoir and only afterwards does it become an exploration of history and other things. There was a real urgency that I needed to explore this.</p> <p><strong>Your last book, a biography of cancer, </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/23/emperor-maladies-biography-cancer-siddhartha-mukherjee-review\"><strong><em>The Emperor of All Maladies</em></strong></a><strong>, won a Pulitzer prize. That must be a tough gig to follow?</strong><br />It was very important to write completely afresh. I always thought this would be a memoir but it started growing on its own accord. Books are like that. They take off and then you have to follow them.</p> <p><strong>The extract </strong><a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/05/02/breakthroughs-in-epigenetics\"><strong> in the New Yorker recently about epigenetics</strong></a><strong> provoked a quite violent </strong><a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/researcher-under-fire-for-new-yorker-epigenetics-article-1.19874\"><strong>backlash from biologists</strong></a><strong>. They accused you of oversimplifying. Did that come as something of a shock?</strong></p> <p>It was an excerpt and in retrospect, I could have emphasised more of the material on the foundational role of gene regulation\u2026 it was covered at length in the book. It was three pages out of a 600-page book.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jun/06/the-gene-an-intimate-history-siddhartha-mukherjee-review\">The Gene by Siddhartha Mukherjee review \u2013 intriguing and entertaining</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>In your work as an oncologist, you\u2019ve talked about being with people in their most terrifying moments as a \u201ctranscendental experience\u201d. I wondered what you meant by that.</strong><br />It\u2019s not spiritual. It means it transcends ordinary things. Most of us don\u2019t experience that moment in which we\u2019re interacting with someone facing their own death. It\u2019s an unbelievable moment but in oncology you do this every day. And you encounter people with astonishing resilience. With startling internal resources.</p> <p><strong>How does that affect you personally?</strong><br />Some people find themselves dejected by this, I find myself energised. Every clinic visit for me is a source of energy. I find myself understanding more. I find myself respecting more. I find myself learning more every time I\u2019ve been in the clinics or the wards.</p> <p><strong>Does it affect how you think about life and death?</strong><br />Absolutely it does. I mean I don\u2019t have a formulaic response to life and death. The one thing I\u2019ve learned is that people\u2019s response to dying is extremely different. It ranges widely and there is no archetypal response.</p> <p><strong>In the west though, death tends to be treated as a medical condition rather than a philosophical concept. People end up in the hospital attached to machines\u2026</strong><br />Absolutely, and I\u2019ve written about this. My grandmother\u2019s death was a signature moment for me. It was one of the most dignified deaths I have ever witnessed. Dying at home, without machines, can be very beautiful.</p> <p><strong>At 45, you\u2019re still young in terms of your career. What\u2019s next?</strong><br />I\u2019m basically trying to understand how the intersection of medicine and biology and culture enables who we are. I\u2019m still trying to understand that over and over again. Every book is about trying to understand that intersection. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll write another book. I mean, I write books when I get confused.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The one thing I\u2019ve learned is that people\u2019s response to dying is extremely different</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>And your scientific ambitions?</strong><br />We\u2019re working on leukaemia mainly and blood formation, a little bit of work on bone formation. A lot of the work that we\u2019re doing is trying to figure out new ways of curing leukaemia.</p> <p><strong>Are you hopeful that there will be a cure?</strong><br />I\u2019m very hopeful. Every year has brought a kind of clarity about what works and what doesn\u2019t work and how we can move things forward in trying to take care of a disease that has so many different manifestations and yet has some core similarities across these manifestations.</p> <p><strong>An article in<em> </em>US<em> Vogue</em> described you and your wife \u2013 </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/jun/24/sarah-sze-interview-london-show\"><strong>the sculptor, Sarah Sze </strong></a><strong>\u2013 as New York\u2019s most brilliant couple. That seems like quite a lot to live up to\u2026</strong><br />We don\u2019t seem like New York\u2019s most brilliant on most days. I feel as if I\u2019m spending my time, you know, getting through the day, paying the parking tickets, going to work at the hospital and trying to write and finish a book. I don\u2019t feel particularly brilliant a lot of the time.</p> <p><strong>The article also said that when she went to the Venice Biennale, you not only remodelled the kitchen as a surprise, but you also bought a summer house. You\u2019re setting quite a high bar for husbands everywhere\u2026</strong><br />It\u2019s not like I was sitting there with a hammer and nails making a new kitchen\u2026 The house was empty, and our kitchen was falling apart, so I hired a friend of ours who is an amazing architect. We had to move out while this was being done so that\u2019s why I found another place. Far from being a rather glamorous enterprise, it was motivated by the fact that we can barely keep our lives together.</p> <p><strong>At the end of the book, you say that the influence of genes on our lives is richer, deeper and more unnerving than we had imagined. In what way?</strong><br />Genes are an incredibly important factor in determining who we are as ourselves. That idea I find very unnerving. We know we\u2019re dominated by the vagaries or the ups and downs of fate and chance and destiny and random accidents and so forth. But behind that, there\u2019s a kind of predisposition or structure. And it\u2019s those predispositions and structures which I think are governed by genes. That\u2019s what we\u2019re trying to figure out and I find that to be fascinating.</p> <p><strong>Do you think about it when you look at your children and think about how to bring them up?</strong><br />I have two daughters, six and eleven, and I think it\u2019s every parent\u2019s dilemma to figure out how genes and environments and chance will result in the unique human beings that are your children. I think it\u2019s every parent\u2019s conundrum and that\u2019s why the conundrum I try to get to in the book. But you know\u2026you can\u2019t live your life as if you\u2019re in a clinical trial.</p> <p><em>The Gene: An Intimate History is published by Vintage (\u00a325). </em><em><a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/404018/s/the-gene/\">Click here to order a copy for \u00a320 </a></em></p> <ul> <li>This article was edited on 31 May as \u201cbipolar disease\u201d should have read \u201cbipolar disorder\u201d</li> </ul>",

      "body": "<p>It is now two years \u2013 and two chief executives \u2013 since the launch of Halfords\u2019 \u201cGetting Into Gear\u201d three-year plan, a plan that was singled out by <em>Management Today</em> for playing \u201chost to some of the most corny corporate language on the planet\u201d (from an exceptionally strong field).</p> <p>The document promised to introduce an \u201cH Factor\u201d to Halfords while aiming to reassert \u201cthe business\u2019s proposition authority to Support Drivers of Every Car, Inspire Cyclists of Every Age and Equip Families for Their Leisure Time\u201d.</p> <p>Anyway, when Jill McDonald got the top job at the retailer a year ago, she did not rewrite this plan, but added a few flourishes of her own, with a sequel called (wait for it) \u201cMoving Up a Gear\u201d.</p> <p>The enhancements by McDonald focused on customer service \u2013 her area of expertise \u2013 with the bike and car accessories retailer saying it would gather more data from its customers in an effort to get them to spend more. There was also a commitment to focus on exclusive deals, plus some much-needed modernisation for its stores.</p> <p>All of which brings us to this week, when the retailer announces full-year results. The chat will be about the group\u2019s move into the upmarket cycling sector with the acquisition of Tredz, and how McDonald\u2019s first year has gone. Is she moving up or missing the gears, as Halfords might put it?</p> <h2>Jenkins steps up to another podium</h2> <p>Antony Jenkins, the rather colourless former boss of Barclays, is not an obvious raconteur. No matter. He seems to be more in demand on the speaking circuit than he currently is in his old trade.</p> <p>We get another chance hear the Peter Ustinov <em>de nos jours</em> this week when he speaks at Chartered Accountants Hall \u201con the future of financial services and the importance of values in banking and fintech\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThis is an opportunity to hear from a high-profile industry insider on issues on which he has expressed firmly held, and sometimes\u00a0controversial, views,\u201d the bumf for the event gushes.</p> <p>More likely what they mean is \u201cyet another opportunity\u201d. Earlier this\u00a0month Jenkins appeared at a House of Commons event when he revisited his favoured theme of \u201cturning values into\u00a0value\u201d.</p> <p>What rarely gets mentioned is that before Jenkins became a crusading chief executive of Barclays, he had been in the driving seat of the high-street part of that bank as it merrily sold payment protection insurance (PPI) to people who never needed it or could have claimed on it. Odd that.</p> <h2>Back to the daily grind at Sports Direct</h2> <p>Another week, another chance for Mike Ashley to have a row with MPs on the business, innovation and skills select committee, who have summoned him to appear next month to talk about working conditions at the firm\u2019s Derbyshire warehouse.</p> <p>You\u2019ll recall Ashley said he would attend on 7 June, but only if the MPs agreed to come for a presumably whitewashed visit to the facility the day before. They <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/26/mps-mike-ashley-not-visit-sports-direct-head-office\" title=\"\">declined that invitation last week</a> \u2013 so Ashley said he would consult with lawyers. We all look forward to their response.</p> <p>Still, Ashley\u2019s mouthpiece, Keith \u201cThe Bishop\u201d Bishop, has been keen to extend similar invitations to inspect the facilities to anyone else who might fancy a trip to the Midlands. He included this page \u2013 seemingly unaware that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/09/how-sports-direct-effectively-pays-below-minimum-wage-pay\" title=\"\">we had spent a few days toiling undercover at the very same warehouse</a> before Christmas.</p> <p>Anyway, as it seems in vogue to attach conditions before accepting these calls, we have agreed to show up, but only in return for an audience with the reclusive Ashley.</p> <p>\u201cShall we say 6 June for that interview with Mike in Shirebrook?\u201d we asked, after the MPs had declined. \u201cHe has a spare slot that day now.\u201d Strangely, the Bishop seems to have taken a sudden vow of silence.</p>",

      "headline": "The secret army of cheerleaders policing China\u2019s internet",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-29T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>If you ever wanted an illustration of why academic research is not just important but vital, then the work of <a href=\"http://gking.harvard.edu/\" title=\"\">Gary King</a>, professor of sociology at Harvard, could serve as exhibit A. Why? Well, one of the more pressing strategic issues that faces western governments is how to adjust to the emergence of China as a new global superpower. The first requirement for intelligent reorientation is a rounded understanding of this new reality. And while it may be that in the foreign offices and chancelleries of the west officials and policy makers are busily boning up on Chinese industrial and geopolitical strategy (what the hell are they up to in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/south-china-sea\" title=\"\">South China Sea</a>, for example?), I see little evidence that anyone in government has been paying attention to how the Beijing regime seems to have solved a problem that no other government has cracked: namely, how to control, manage and harness the internet for its own purposes.</p> <p>Strangely, our rulers still seem blissfully unaware of this, which is odd because \u2013 as I pointed out <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/14/truth-behind-great-firewall-of-china-headlines\" title=\"\">ages ago</a> \u2013 there\u2019s no longer any excuse for ignorance: Professor King has done most of the heavy lifting required. In a landmark study published in <a href=\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/345/6199/1251722\" title=\"\"><em>Science</em></a> in 2014, for example, he and his colleagues reported on a remarkable, fine-grained investigation that they conducted into how the Chinese regime controls the network.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>China's \u2018strategic distraction\u2019 is the political equivalent of the LOLcats that keep western youth anaesthetised</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What the research showed was a degree of subtlety and sophistication undreamed of in western coverage of Chinese online censorship. In essence, King et al suggested that almost everything we think we know about the Chinese internet is wrong. For one thing, its users do not cower nervously behind the \u201cgreat firewall\u201d. On the contrary: online debate and discourse in China is as raucous, untamed and virulent as it is here. And yet the government devotes massive resources (200,000-plus people) to watching and censoring the network. So what are they doing? Answer: censoring some predictable stuff (pornography, Falun Gong, Tiananmen, etc); but much of what we would regard as \u201cpolitical\u201d discourse (criticism of local communist party officials, for example) remains apparently unrestricted. There is, however, one type of discourse that <em>is</em> ruthlessly and efficiently suppressed: any kind of social media post that could conceivably lead to collective mobilisation \u2013 to people on the streets. And this applies even to posts that are favourable to the government!</p> <p>What emerged from Professor King\u2019s first foray into Chinese cyberspace was an image of a political regime that had a more nuanced, insightful approach to managing the internet than most of us had assumed. This may be because the regime is, by western standards, overwhelmingly technocratic: something like 80% of the country\u2019s ruling elite have engineering backgrounds. They know that the internet is essential for a modernising economy and they also appreciate that it provides the citizenry with a safety valve \u2013 one that also serves as a feedback loop that highlights potential trouble spots (local corruption, for example). But, most of all, they know that it is essential to keep people off the streets, which is why they censor it as they do.</p> <p>There was, however, one bit of the jigsaw missing: the way the regime harnesses the internet to get <em>its</em> message(s) across. It has long been suspected that large numbers of citizens (up to 2 million) were paid the equivalent of 50 cents per post to insert pseudonymous content into the torrent of real social media posts in which they argue with critics of the regime.</p> <p>The problem was that there was little empirical evidence for this suspicion or \u2013 more importantly \u2013 for the regime\u2019s strategic objectives in employing 50 cent bloggers. Professor King and his colleagues have now filled in this blank with the publication of <a href=\"http://gking.harvard.edu/files/gking/files/50c.pdf?m=1464204445\" title=\"\">another remarkable paper</a>. The researchers were able to identify the secretive authors of many of these posts and to estimate their volume (488m a year).</p> <p>However, the most interesting finding is that the phoney posters <em>avoid</em> arguing with sceptics and critics, and indeed avoid discussing controversial topics altogether. So what are they up to, then? Mostly, it seems, \u201ccheerleading for the state, symbols of the regime, or the revolutionary history of the Communist party\u201d. In other words, trying to swamp social media with happy-clappy stuff and thereby dilute conversations about grievances, state shortcomings and other tricky topics. Professor King calls it \u201cstrategic distraction\u201d, but really it\u2019s the political equivalent of the LOLcats that keep western youth anaesthetised and off the streets.</p> <p>King\u2019s other discovery is more mundane. It turns out that the 50 cents angle may be a myth. Most of the phoneys seem to be government employees who contribute part-time outside of their normal jobs and not ordinary citizens doing piecework. Jobsworths, not stooges, in other words. Another beautiful theory vaporised by a banal fact. That\u2019s research for you.</p>",

      "body": "<p>There\u2019s always been more than a touch of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/janeausten\" title=\"\">Jane Austen</a> about the films of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/sep/15/whit-stillman-the-cosmopolitans\" title=\"\">Whit Stillman</a>, the incisive social satirist behind 1998\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEUGmWlkJZk\" title=\"\"><em>The Last Days of Disco</em></a> and 2011\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBDYl-p9dH4\" title=\"\"><em>Damsels in Distress</em></a>. Stillman\u2019s 1990 debut feature <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3plmkRy_k5o\" title=\"\"><em>Metropolitan</em></a> drew inspiration from <em>Mansfield Park</em>, and his subsequent studies of social manners have all possessed an arch observational tone that one imagines Austen might have appreciated. In 2003, he was reported to be working on a project called Winchester Races, which would marry material from the unfinished Austen novels <a href=\"http://www.janeausten.ac.uk/edition/ms/WatsonsHeadNote.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Watsons</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.janeausten.co.uk/sanditon-a-completion/\" title=\"\"><em>Sanditon</em></a>. Here, he draws on the title and plot respectively of two early epistolary works; <a href=\"http://www.pemberley.com/janeinfo/lovfrend.html\" title=\"\"><em>Love and Freindship</em></a> (Stillman duly standardises the young Austen\u2019s spelling) and <a href=\"https://austenprose.com/lady-susan-plot-summary-by-letter/lady-susan-plot-summary-letters-1-11/\" title=\"\"><em>Lady Susan</em></a>. The subtitle of the former was <em>Deceived in Freindship and\u00a0Betrayed in Love</em>, a delightfully ironic phrase that resonates somewhat with the narrative of the latter, a tale with which Stillman takes some delicious modern liberties as he brings the slightly inaccessible source material to the big screen with crowd-pleasing panache.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Stillman brings the slightly inaccessible source material to the big screen with crowd-pleasing panache</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI am going to take a heroine whom no one but myself will much like,\u201d Austen said of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/05/jane-austen-emma-changed-face-fiction\" title=\"\"><em>Emma</em></a>, and that dictum could perhaps be applied to this terrifically brittle account of a middle-aged woman who brilliantly manipulates those around her through a mixture of intelligence, elegance, and fox-like cunning. Kate Beckinsale is superb as Lady Susan Vernon, the widowed mother whom we first meet leaving the Manwarings\u2019 Langford estate amid rumours of impropriety, to\u00a0the bracingly chosen strains of Purcell. Lady Susan is en route via London to Churchill (\u201cHeavens, what a bore!\u201d), the Surrey country house of her late husband\u2019s brother, Charles (Justin Edwards), where she plans to stay with her companion Mrs Cross (Kelly Campbell), an \u201cimpoverished friend\u201d and unpaid skivvy who, \u201conce rested, <em>craves</em> activity\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGzmvUVBGI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WpGzmvUVBGI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpGzmvUVBGI\">Watch the trailer for Love &amp; Friendship</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Satirical title cards introduce us to a plethora of key players including Morfydd Clark\u2019s Frederica Vernon, Susan\u2019s \u201celigible daughter\u201d; <a href=\"http://observer.com/2016/05/love-friendship-tiny-green-balls-tom-bennett-on-playing-the-fool/\" title=\"\">Tom Bennett</a>\u2019s Sir James Martin, \u201cher unintended\u201d and \u201ca bit of a rattle\u201d; and Xavier Samuel\u2019s dashing Reginald DeCourcy, Charles\u2019s handsome brother-in-law and the new focus of Lady Susan\u2019s schemes. \u201cYour renown precedes you,\u201d Reginald cattily tells the coquettish Lady Susan upon her arrival, only to be handsomely slapped down with a skill and precision that will soon make him the lovesick slave of the target of his jibes. For some, such as Emma Greenwell\u2019s Catherine Vernon, Lady Susan is \u201ca genius\u2026 diabolically so\u201d, whose machinations must be halted at all costs. For the audience, she is a devilish delight, a femme fatale who believes \u201cfacts are horrid things\u201d and whose electrifying company we cannot help but crave.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>She is a devilish delight, a femme fatale whose electrifying company we cannot help but crave</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Brilliantly described by the BBFC as\u00a0containing \u201cno material likely to harm or offend\u201d, this acerbic U-certificate gem must be the most politely impolite film of the year. Intelligently adapting the monologues of Austen\u2019s source material into dramatic dialogue (a scene between Reginald and his father, for example, conversationally intertwines <a href=\"https://austenprose.com/lady-susan-plot-summary-by-letter/lady-susan-plot-summary-letters-12-22/\" title=\"\">Letters 12 and 14</a> of the novella), Stillman\u2019s screenplay draws spicy cream from the milk of the author\u2019s formal experiments.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e18644c1ff48984279eb6047181cafd18b7a4ef1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e18644c1ff48984279eb6047181cafd18b7a4ef1/0_5_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Chlo\u00eb Sevigny and Kate Beckinsale in Love and Friendship.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chlo\u00eb Sevigny and Kate Beckinsale in Love &amp; Friendship, who also co-starred in Whit Stillman\u2019s Last Days of Disco.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Performance adds another layer to the cake; as the splendidly stupid Sir James, Bennett pulls off one of the great comic coups of the year, creating a character of whom Richard Curtis would have been proud. One part Austen to two parts <em>Blackadder</em>, Sir James is the not-too-distant cousin of Hugh Laurie\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEtCEcuxprI\" title=\"\">gormless George</a>, whether delightedly chasing peas around his plate (\u201chow jolly... tiny green balls!\u201d) or wondering which two of God\u2019s 12 commandments he is now allowed to break. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/14/chloe-sevigny-now-total-disdain-directors\" title=\"\">Chlo\u00eb Sevigny</a>, who co-starred with Beckinsale in <em>The Last Days of Disco</em> (and features in Stillman\u2019s Amazon pilot <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/The-Cosmopolitans-Season-1/dp/B00MU56A98\" title=\"\"><em>The Cosmopolitans</em></a>), makes light work of Lady Susan\u2019s American-exile friend and confidante, Alicia Johnson, with Stephen Fry lending cameo support as Alicia\u2019s drearily \u201crespectable\u201d husband whose next bout of gout is eagerly awaited. But this is Beckinsale\u2019s show, and just as Lady Susan commands the attention of all those around her, so she draws our eyes and ears at all times with a performance of poise and precision.</p> <p>Most important is just how much fun Stillman seems to be having with what is only his fifth feature in 26 years. <a href=\"http://stageandscreendesignireland.ie/designers/eimer-ni-mhaoldomhnaigh/\" title=\"\">Eimer N\u00ed Mhaoldomhnaigh</a>\u2019s eye-catching costumes and cinematographer <a href=\"http://www.richardvanoosterhout.com/richard_van_oosterhout/home.html\" title=\"\">Richard Van Oosterhout</a>\u2019s well-chosen Irish locations lend visual heft, but it\u2019s the sound of the wicked laughter that <em>Love &amp; Friendship</em> provokes that I will remember longest.

      "body": "<p>Much like fiction boils down to a few archetypal stories framed by genre strictures, rock albums have recurrent motifs. <em>The Ride</em>, Catfish and the Bottlemen\u2019s second album, finds this foursome \u2013 surprise winners of a Brit for breakthrough act, against far more house-trained opposition \u2013 at a tipping point. Having sold 250,000-odd copies of their debut, 2014\u2019s <em>The Balcony</em>, these north-westerners (plus token Geordie guitarist Johnny Bond) are on a quest \u2013 to become the new Oasis, this generation\u2019s purveyors of everyman tales, written to be hollered back by the\u00a0hordes.</p> <p>Catfish have an authentic, anthemic edge over the landfill indie rock that blighted the 00s, and a natural star in singing guitarist Van McCann, a man who exudes self-belief without the douchebag-ness that often accompanies it. Interestingly, there\u2019s also a Beatles to Catfish\u2019s Stones: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/the-1975\" title=\"\">the 1975</a> are not dissimilar in age, \u201covernight sensations\u201d a decade in the making, sharing the same dedication to the idea of being a rock band.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is the well-worn tale of a band on the up, retold with slightly different detailing</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The 1975\u2019s recent take on ambition involves the 80s, R&amp;B and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/28/1975-like-it-when-sleep-beautiful-yet-unaware-review\" title=\"\">long titles</a>. By contrast, Catfish and the Bottlemen are almost comically one-dimensional, keeping things tight. As with Catfish\u2019s debut, <em>The Ride</em> boasts one-word song titles and tunes that don\u2019t fanny about. \u201cShe tends to obfuscate, when it\u2019s black and white,\u201d spits McCann on Oxygen. He\u2019s half-appalled, but half-intrigued. The song\u2019s chorus, meanwhile, owes a debt to Noel Gallagher\u2019s \u201croute one\u201d approach.</p> <p>Naturally, our protagonists head off to America to get the widescreen treatment, this time courtesy of producer Dave Sardy (Oasis, Primal Scream). Subplots unfold. \u201cNew York surprised me,\u201d begins McCann on Emily, unwittingly summarising the plot of the 1975\u2019s album to boot: \u201cI must admit, I think I lost my way a bit.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvTIgdpT1Mw\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VvTIgdpT1Mw?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Catfish and the Bottlemen performing 7.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>This is, then, the well-worn tale of a band on the up, retold with slightly different detailing: of getting confused about the time difference, of being in love, \u201cbut I need another year alone\u201d, as McCann sings on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibv5N70ncsk\" title=\"\">7</a>. Of racing from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mLD8FL28Nk\" title=\"\">soundcheck</a> to catch a girl on her fag break, of picking someone special up from Heathrow, of love trouble. On Glasgow, McCann is plucking an acoustic guitar, being propped up on Sauchiehall Street, falling for the girl that makes him \u201cdo the shit that I never do\u201d.</p> <p>There is little original here. But McCann has his moments. The way he tinkers \u2013 as though off-handedly \u2013 with repeated lyrics belies attention to craft. <a href=\"http://www.hotpress.com/Catfish-And-The-Bottlemen/news/LISTEN-Catfish-And-The-Bottlemen-Share-New-Song/17261437.html\" title=\"\">Twice</a> is a particularly likable high point. \u201cChrist!\u201d McCann sings on the chorus, \u201cI ain\u2019t ever going back to thinking straight.\u201d He\u2019s uncomfortably sober \u2013 regretting arguments, calling in sick on Mondays and mourning \u201cevery ex I didn\u2019t treat right\u201d. Bond\u2019s guitar solo on Anything, meanwhile, is an object lesson in pithy eloquence \u2013 this unadventurous but crowd-pleasing album\u2019s strongest suit.</p>",

And the earth is damp and smells of\u2026 I take a deep noseful and think about this. It smells of earth. If you were a long, long way away in a cold and alien place, this spot here, Ottery St Mary, near the folded east Devon hills, is the kind of landscape that might come to you in a hallucinatory dream.</p> <p>It\u2019s the essence of the English countryside on a cool early summer morning. And somewhere, high above, in a tin capsule circling planet Earth, is Major Tim. The urge to quote David Bowie lyrics is almost irresistible \u2013 is irresistible \u2013 because at the King\u2019s School in Ottery St Mary, there\u2019s a massive antenna in the playground, a temporary space station in the school hall and a small crowd of children and parents waiting patiently. Ground control is literally about to call Major Tim: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/tim-peake\" title=\"\">Tim Peake </a>\u2013 our man in space.

We wait. It\u2019s a genuinely exciting moment. We\u2019ve had an hour of presentations. We\u2019ve seen a film of a year\u2019s worth of events at the school that have led up to this moment: space-poetry competitions and rocket launches and an art contest. And there\u2019s a whole week of events yet to come. We\u2019ve heard how the school is one of just 10 that were chosen. We\u2019ve had a live countdown on a satellite map. A technical explanation of what\u2019s going to happen. And then\u2026 crackle\u2026 hiss\u2026 silence. Nothing.

As it turns out, it\u2019s actually a team of middle-aged men and a ham radio rig. There\u2019s something pleasingly homespun about this; it\u2019s a completely voluntary effort that has been more than a year in the planning and has involved a whole army of people. And yet, what they\u2019re doing \u2013 education outreach \u2013 is also a crucial part of the UK\u2019s space policy and an important element of an industry that the government hopes will be worth \u00a340bn a year by 2030.</p> <p>Because manned space flight \u2013 the fact that Tim Peake is out there now, in space, and that public consciousness of it is so high, arguably higher than at any point since the moon landings or at least since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/18/blast-off-why-has-astronaut-helen-sharman-been-written-out-of-history\" title=\"\">Helen Sharman</a> became the first Briton in space, 25 years ago this month \u2013 is just one part of what is a new era of space exploration. Earlier this month, the modern transport bill, which will put into place the legal framework for commercial space flight in the UK, was announced in the Queen\u2019s speech.</p> <p>It\u2019s a spectacular reversal of fortunes. In 1987, the Thatcher administration abandoned our manned space flight programme and decided we would not contribute to the International Space Station. Only in 2012 was this overturned.</p> <p><a href=\"https://space.blog.gov.uk/author/libbyjackson/\" title=\"\">Libby Jackson</a>, of the UK Space Agency\u2019s education programme, tells me that she first met Peake before that when she worked at Nasa\u2019s mission control in Houston. \u201cHe\u2019d just been selected, but neither he nor I thought he\u2019d be going into space any time soon.\u201d</p> <p>Back in Ottery St Mary, Ilsley is calmly carrying on. \u201cGolf Bravo One Sierra Sierra, this is Golf Bravo One Sierra Mike calling and standing by for the International Space Station.\u201d Still nothing. We\u2019ve been told that the ISS is travelling at 17,000 mph and that there\u2019s only a brief window of time \u2013 eight minutes \u2013 from when he\u2019s in mid-Atlantic to after he\u2019s flown overhead, when we are theoretically able to catch him.</p> <p>And then, suddenly, in a blast of static he\u2019s there, first his voice: \u201cGolf Bravo One Sierra Sierra.\u201d And then his face, beaming away at us from the screen on the stage. The audience cheers and bursts into applause and, one by one, a handpicked group of pupils take the microphone and ask him a question. Ben Sheridan, 11, is one of the first: \u201cI often stare into the inky blackness of the sky and wonder, if the universe is expanding, then what is it expanding into? Has your time in space given you any insight?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9ad3218e0bfa4b1fe7f7b329d55c905cc1bcb919\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9ad3218e0bfa4b1fe7f7b329d55c905cc1bcb919/0_159_4874_2925/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The ARISS radio team at Kings School, in Ottery St Mary, Devon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The ARISS radio team at Kings School, in Ottery St Mary, Devon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Wileman for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s such a strange and wonderful place, the inky blackness of the sky. What gave you the idea of asking that question, I ask Sheridan later. \u201cIt\u2019s because of Stephen Hawking,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThe theory of the big bang. It was so exciting hearing Tim speak about it. He said that the ISS is helping to find an answer to that question.\u201d And what do you think it\u2019s expanding into? He ponders it for a moment.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not sure. It\u2019s such a difficult concept to get your head around. I think rocks get thrown out and these group together and become planets and they develop gravity fields.\u201d</p> <p>Sheridan is grappling with the great theoretical questions of the universe. And he is, I\u2019ll repeat, 11 years old. But then, beyond the science that Peake is doing on the ISS \u2013 experiments in microgravity and human physiology and the life sciences \u2013 inspiring the next generation of children has been one of his key tasks. It\u2019s why he appeared at the Brits presenting an award to Adele, and why if you have a young child you\u2019ll have seen him popping up regularly in the CBeebies schedule reading bedtime stories from space. And it\u2019s why he\u2019s been scheduled to broadcast live to Ottery St Mary. Libby Jackson tells me that they\u2019ve reached a million school children through various projects.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve particularly been trying to target primary school-age children,\u201d Jackson says, \u201cbecause all the research shows that by the time they reach secondary school, some children have already been turned off science for good.\u201d A science lesson was broadcast from space in which 400,000 children took part. And more than 600,000 have been involved in a project <a href=\"https://schoolgardening.rhs.org.uk/news/News-results/National/2015/May/rocket-science\" title=\"\">organised by the Royal Horticultural Society</a> that has involved planting two lots of seeds, one of which has been up to the International Space Station and back, and comparing the results.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think space is uniquely able to inspire people,\u201d Professor Ian Crawford of Birkbeck University tells me. \u201cBut it can have quite a profound effect on them. I was seven when the moon landings took place and that had a quite singular effect on me. But even my students who don\u2019t remember the real Apollo 13 have watched the film <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/apr/17/apollo-13-tom-hanks-space-ron-howard\" title=\"\"><em>Apollo 13</em></a> or <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/30/2001-a-space-odyssey-kubrick-sci-fi-epic-back-big-screen\" title=\"\"><em>2001: A Space Odyssey </em></a>and something has captured their imagination.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s been a vocal supporter of a manned space flight programme \u2013 \u201cmy field is planetary science and my real hope is that we\u2019ll go back to the moon\u201d \u2013 because of the huge scientific benefits that he thinks it confers. \u201cI can make a very narrow case for the real scientific benefits of a manned space programme over using robots or whatever but that ignores the hugely inspirational aspects of having an actual person in space which are enormous. And we\u2019ve really seen that with Tim Peake.\u201d</p> <p>The mother of a five-year-old tells me that her daughter jumps up and down with excitement every time Peake appears on the television. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t recognise many famous people at that age but she\u2019s seen him on CBeebies and they\u2019ve planted rocket seeds at school and she\u2019s really got swept up in the excitement.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b03c6c2c83ebad928719a79cb32cf8311993a616\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b03c6c2c83ebad928719a79cb32cf8311993a616/0_228_4657_2794/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ben Sheridan with his question for Tim Peake.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ben Sheridan with his question for Tim Peake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Wileman for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And though I\u2019ve been immune to, or at least ignorant of, Tim Peakomania until I land in Ottery St Mary, there is something irresistible about it. I am sitting at the back of the hall, and when I turn to my left I notice that the older man next to me is crying. Mac Currie, 69, tells me he\u2019s a volunteer at the <a href=\"http://normanlockyer.com/\" title=\"\">Norman Lockyer Observatory</a> in nearby Sidmouth. He did an Open University course in astronomy when he retired and had been drafted in to be part of space week at the school.</p> <p>He says: \u201cIt\u2019s just so much more\u2026 emotional than I\u2019d realised it would be. It\u2019s just quite, quite incredible that he\u2019s up there, rotating around Earth. I\u2019ve got goosebumps.\u201d He\u2019s old enough to remember the moon landings but there are a number of people, many of whom are much younger, who also seem genuinely touched. Anna Musson, 15, who\u2019d won her spot in the hall because she\u2019d been picked to take part in a Women in Engineering project taking place in the school that day, looks genuinely thoughtful when she tells me her reaction. \u201cIt just triggered really interesting thoughts,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019d heard about it, but being able to see it first hand, and how much had gone into making it happen, I just found the technology quite incredible.\u201d</p> <p>Alison Argent-Wenz, the school\u2019s chemistry and Stem (science, technology, engineering and maths) subjects leader, who put in the application to the UK Space Agency and worked for a year to make it happen, tells me she found herself crying when her 12-year-old son, Freddie, asked a question. (\u201cOver 500 astronauts have been in to space, but only 12 have set foot on the moon\u2026. do you think we will return people there in the future?\u201d) Though in her case they could have been tears of exhaustion.</p> <p>A huge team of volunteers worked flat out to make it happen. The project was initiated by ARISS (Amateur Radio on the International Space Station), enthusiasts who work with space agencies all over the world to inspire children about space and technology. Ciaran Morgan, its UK leader, tells me how they approached the European Space Agency and persuaded them to let them do it and how the rest has been down to the volunteers. \u201cAll Tim has to do is put on his headphones and press a button. We do everything else.\u201d</p> <p>Ten people spent three days setting up the equipment, the audio feeds, the video feed and the satellite backup at Goonhilly, down the road in Cornwall. \u201cAll amateur means is \u2018for the love of it\u2019,\u201d Morgan tells the audience. \u201cAs you see, the equipment we\u2019re using is very, very professional.\u201d</p> <p>It is for the love of it. That\u2019s quite clear. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely exhausted,\u201d he tells me. He\u2019d been up at a primary school in Otley, Yorkshire, four days earlier, working for more than a week, all unpaid. \u201cBut it\u2019s been phenomenal,\u201d says Morgan. \u201cTim has done an amazing job of getting to school students. He\u2019s got two young children of his own and some of his answers have been stupendous. He\u2019s having a ball out there and that just comes across when he talks to them. He\u2019s got a very natural way of communicating. And I really think it\u2019s put a ground wave out there: there\u2019s a reason why you do all these subjects because when you go into the real world so many parts of so many different subjects come together to achieve something like this.\u201d</p> <p>What is less well known is that there is now a whole industry out there. One that involves building things right here in Britain, and we\u2019re actually pretty good at it. It\u2019s space: we\u2019re one of the world\u2019s leading countries in building satellites and, to a lesser extent, rockets. The new <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/across-the-universe/2016/apr/29/tim-peake-takes-mars-rover-for-a-test-drive-in-stevenage\" title=\"\">Mars Rover is being built in Stevenage</a>. And the space sector is worth \u00a311bn a year to the UK economy and growing at 8.6% a year \u2013 one of the reasons why the chancellor, George Osborne, committed an extra \u00a370m to the British space programme in 2012, opening up the way for Peake\u2019s mission.</p> <p>Because for all the talk of Stem subjects and industry opportunities, talk to anyone who works in a space-related field and they\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s because, at a young age, something about space captured their imagination. Matthew Allen, a PhD student in Cardiff who set up <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/UKAstroNut\" title=\"\">a YouTube channel explaining space called UKAstroNut</a>, tells me someone bought him a telescope as a boy. You were the boy in the John Lewis ad, I say. \u201cI was! I was that boy! And it was just seeing those tiny dots in the sky and thinking about the infiniteness of it, that it sort of goes on for ever and the scale of it, the unbelievableness of it, that it\u2019s so hard to comprehend, it\u2019s so abstract and strangely impossible but also true.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaOC9danxNo\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KaOC9danxNo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaOC9danxNo\">Chris Hadfield sings Space Oddity.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Tim Peake\u2019s warm-up act at the International Space Station a couple of years ago was the Canadian <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/chris-hadfield\" title=\"\">Chris Hadfield</a>, a singing, tweeting astronaut; the first to go to outer space and employ the new media technologies to devastating effect. Funny and knowing, he played the guitar and shortly before he came back down to earth, released a video \u2013 the first music video made in space \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KaOC9danxNo\" title=\"\">a slightly modified version of David Bowie\u2019s Space Oddity</a>.</p> <p>\u201cGround control to Major Tom: Lock your Soyuz hatch and put your helmet on,\u201d he sings, floating through the ISS. If you haven\u2019t seen it, watch it. It\u2019s had almost 32m views on YouTube and it\u2019s mesmerising. While Bowie\u2019s song was written in 1969 at the height of the space race and the year of the moon landings, Hadfield\u2019s version conveys what it\u2019s like being in space in a way perhaps nothing else has. Bowie officially endorsed it as \u201cpossibly the most poignant version of the song ever created\u201d. But it\u2019s more than that: it\u2019s a meditation on man and space and our own insignificance. \u201cHere I am, sitting in a tin can/far above the world,\u201d sings Hadfield, looking soulfully into the camera as our big blue planet floats past in the window.</p> <p>Peake has picked up where Chris Hadfield left off, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/astro_timpeake?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\" title=\"\">tweeting a stream of incredible images</a>: a plume of smoke rising from Mount Etna, forest fires over Canada, a mountain lake in the Himalayas glinting in the reflected light of the setting sun.</p> <p>\u201cFrom your elevated vantage point looking down on Earth, has your perception of events on our planet, such as conflicts and wars, been altered?\u201d asks Elizabeth Witcombe, 18, when it\u2019s her turn to take the microphone. \u201cDoes the change in perception give any insight we can learn from?\u201d</p> <p>Later, I talk to Witcombe and she tells me she thought of the question because she\u2019d been talking with her mother about how the visual nature of things can change your view on them. \u201cEven though you know, theoretically that Earth looks smaller from space, actually seeing it for real could make you change your opinion. He said he thought it made the world seem more fragile, which I thought was interesting.\u201d</p> <p>Professor Ian Crawford tells me: \u201cI do think this perspective, this cosmic perspective that we can only gain by going out into the universe, has very profound effects. The Apollo astronauts were able to hide the Earth under the thumb of their glove. From Mars, the earth is literally just a star. When environmental awareness took off in the 1960s you can see that this was partly to do with seeing the pictures of Earth that no human being had ever seen before; this whole spaceship Earth concept \u2013 that we\u2019d better look after the planet because it looks pretty small and fragile.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"One of Tim Peake's pictures from space via Twitter.\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Must be about time for another pic of the Himalayas! &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/ioLw47ZSUU&quot;&gt;https://t.co/ioLw47ZSUU&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/wFUk78Osmq&quot;&gt;pic.twitter.com/wFUk78Osmq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Tim Peake (@astro_timpeake) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/astro_timpeake/status/732592574947414016&quot;&gt;May 17, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cAnd the only way to get this perspective of the world is to have more people experience it from above, and though it\u2019s only a few people, others can follow it vicariously and seeing the world\u2019s actual situation in the universe can have a profound effect on the way that we think about things.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps that\u2019s what Peake has given us. Direct access to one person\u2019s viewpoint, his line of vision. Simon Ould is another member of the audience who\u2019s snuck in to see Peake and has come over a bit emotional. He says: \u201cOf course, I\u2019d love to go up there, but this is about as close as I\u2019m going to get.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s an astronomer who runs a mobile planetarium and is taking part in the school\u2019s space week. \u201cI was nine when the space shuttle went up in 1981 and I got caught up in the excitement around that and it really inspired me. The Hubble <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/apr/23/the-hubble-space-telescope-its-a-terrific-comeback-story\" title=\"\">space telescope</a> has been an amazing project but Tim\u2019s mission, that tangible link to the UK, the fact that he grew up just down the road, and is wearing a union jack on his spacesuit, it just makes a huge difference. The inspirational effect of space on children in the UK has been a revelation. There\u2019s no doubt that this will inspire a new generation of space researchers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"59d0581a02e7abcf168c6248457ba203581d3c1c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/59d0581a02e7abcf168c6248457ba203581d3c1c/0_272_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The equipment at Kings School needed for the link-up with the space station.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The equipment at Kings School needed for the link-up with the space station.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jim Wileman for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cA lot of people\u2019s perception is that science is all about facts and figures but it also leads on to incredibly deep questions, some of the oldest questions there are. That\u2019s what space gives us. Why are we here? And what\u2019s it all about? The ancients wondered that when they thought the Earth was the centre of the universe. Now we know that we are just one galaxy among billions, the question becomes even deeper.\u201d</p> <p>It does. It\u2019s what inspired Ben Sheridan\u2019s question about the inky blackness. Though it also underlines how human we are. How we crave human connection and stories and can only cope with the infinity of space and time or even contemplate it when there\u2019s a living breathing human out there strumming along to David Bowie or doing somersaults.</p> <p>\u201cDid you ever struggle with science at school?\u201d Emily Spry, 13, wants to know. \u201cWhat would you say to anyone who finds it difficult?\u201d Tim Peake looks down at her. \u201cI found the maths underlying it difficult,\u201d he says. She nods. It\u2019s a moment of connection. \u201cJust keep trying,\u201d he says. \u201cAnything worthwhile is difficult.\u201d And then it\u2019s over. The eight minutes is up. Major Tim is travelling on at 17,000 miles an hour. Sitting in his tin can. Far above the world.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-29T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Have you heard about the terrific bat houses and hedgehog tunnels down at Hinkley Point in Somerset? Energy minister Andrea Leadsom has been to inspect them herself and raved about them last week to a select committee of MPs. They were evidence, she suggested, of the depth of commitment of French firm EDF to the \u00a318bn nuclear power station due to be built on the site.</p> <p>Well, maybe. Talk of bats and hedgehogs at least provided some relief from the familiar crop of Hinkley news. French economy minister Emmanuel Macron said he was \u201cfully behind\u201d the project but EDF\u2019s unions confirmed that they weren\u2019t. Jean-Luc Magnaval, secretary of EDF\u2019s workers\u2019 committee, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36394601\" title=\"\">told the BBC</a> that the unions \u201chave reservations about several aspects of the project: organisation, supply chain, installation and procurement\u201d. That\u2019s a long list.</p> <p>Meanwhile, EDF Energy chief executive Vincent de Rivaz, appearing before the same committee as Leadsom, had to adopt a humbler tone than on his last outing two months ago. Then he had promised a final investment decision \u201cvery soon\u201d; this time he wouldn\u2019t speculate about a date.</p> <p>This farce \u2013 which has been running since last October, when the final sign-off was due within weeks \u2013 could yet roll on and on. The UK government is disinclined to set a deadline: it\u2019s a \u201ccommercial decision\u201d for EDF.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the current French government could have a radically different shape this time next year \u2013 there is a presidential election in 2017 and the incumbent, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, is the least popular leader in modern French history. French union opposition to Hinkley Point appears entrenched and the workers\u2019 representatives have six seats on an 18-strong board.</p> <p>In theory, management and government can proceed regardless; but to embark on an \u00a318bn venture with a divided boardroom would invite trouble down the line. That is especially so when you remember EDF\u2019s last finance director, Thomas Piquemal, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/07/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-project-in-crisis-as-edf-finance-director-resigns\" title=\"\">resigned over concerns</a> that Hinkley could threaten the company\u2019s future.</p> <p>The best thing the UK government could do at this point is to stop and consider whether the obstacles facing Hinkley are simply too big. Nervousness in France is understandable. EDF\u2019s two current attempts to built a European pressurised reactor \u2013 the model to be used at Hinkley \u2013 are agonising; one is four years late, the other nine years. And the financial arithmetic was always challenging. Hinkley could take 10 years to build, and the owners receive nothing during the construction phase; the cash only arrives when electricity starts to be generated. And, while the returns on capital under the 35-year contract are theoretically enormous, the penalties for failure to hit a 2029 deadline are stinging, and ratchet up.</p> <p>That is why the UK government had to make the 35-year contract so generous \u2013 struck at almost three times today\u2019s wholesale price. That contract now looks to belong to another era given the subsequent fall in the oil price, and thus energy costs. The only weak support holding Hinkley in place is its capacity to provide 7% of the UK\u2019s electricity in a low-carbon fashion.</p> <p>But there are other ways to meet the legally binding emissions targets. Offshore wind is expanding with no Hinkley-style fuss, and its costs are falling. More importantly for the UK\u2019s requirement for secure baseload supplies, other builders are waiting to pursue projects that use different nuclear technology. In theory, planning and appraisal can continue in parallel; in practice, confidence in the UK\u2019s commitment to its new-nuclear programme will drain away.</p> <p>There is not \u2013 yet \u2013 a crisis in UK energy policy because it is always possible to build a few gas-fired stations to avert an emergency. But the Hinkley show is becoming an embarrassment. The project is expensive, uses unproven technology and its builder is a disunited and over-borrowed company that requires constant financial assurances from an ever-changing cast of politicians. The UK government should set EDF a deadline and be ready to enforce it. We can do better \u2013 much better \u2013 than Hinkley.</p> <h2>Banking guru says Bank is too soft on banks</h2> <p>When the architect of banking reform in the UK<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/26/bank-of-england-rejects-claim-watered-down-ringfencing-plans\" title=\"\"> accuses the Bank of England of going soft</a> on the sector, it is time to sit up and take notice. Sir John Vickers, who led the coalition government\u2019s Independent Commission on Banking (ICB), made the assertion again last week when Threadneedle Street issued new guidelines on capital which concluded that the system (largely) had amassed enough capital.</p> <p>While no one appears to doubt that the banking system is stronger than it was before the 2008 crisis \u2013 the amount of capital held by banks globally has doubled since 2007 \u2013 Vickers believes that the Bank should be asking banks to hold even more.</p> <p>While the argument about systemic risk buffers is not easy to digest, it is worth taking a moment to think about it. Vickers argues that the Bank is being too lenient in adopting one of the ICB\u2019s recommendations \u2013 about putting 3% of capital aside as a systemic risk buffer (think of it as a bit of extra insurance in case things go bad). The Bank says the buffer can be on a rising scale, depending on the size of the bank. On its current assessment no UK bank would need to hit the 3% level.</p> <p>It might be easy to decide that Vickers \u2013 now warden at All Soul\u2019s College, Oxford \u2013 is making the point to protect his legacy. Indeed one of his fellow commission members \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/speeches/2016/speech910.pdf\" title=\"\">former Barclays boss Martin Taylor</a> \u2013 last week insisted that the differences in capital requirements between the ICB and the Bank of England were \u201cmore or less invisible to the naked eye\u201d.</p> <p>Taylor, it should be noted, is now a policymaker at the Bank. So, too, is chief economist Andy Haldane who, in seeming contrast, has welcomed what he describes as the \u201cacademic challenge\u201d of prudential regulation.</p> <p>While easily dismissed as a topic for anoraks, this issue is simply too important to ignore. Just as well that Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury select committee, has decided to step in to referee. In April, Tyrie announced an inquiry into the matter. He should get on with it.</p> <h2>M&amp;S needs to put clothes ahead of shareholders</h2> <p>Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s share price is 13% lower than it was last weekend and its new chief executive finds his ambition to \u201ccherish Mrs M&amp;S\u201d derided as patronising waffle. Welcome to retailing\u2019s top table, Steve Rowe: now you know how deep the national obsession with M&amp;S goes. You\u2019re under the microscope.</p> <p>Rowe shouldn\u2019t worry about the share price. His grand strategic plan is to sell clothes his customers actually want to wear, and at keener prices. Easier said than done, of course, but it\u2019s the right priority. M&amp;S\u2019s share price has been sustained for too long by the thin vapours of ever-rising profit margins. Now the website actually works, it\u2019s time to address the loss of market share over many years, and never mind the immediate hit to profits. Shareholders will just have to be patient.</p> <p>But bin the \u201cMrs M&amp;S\u201d lines. The 1970s language is one problem. The bigger drawback is that no one wants to be viewed as a caricature.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>Francis Spufford is the author of five books of non-fiction and has been long- or shortlisted for prizes in science, historical, political and theological writing and writing \u2018evoking the spirit of place\u2019. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and teaches writing at Goldsmiths College. <em>Golden Hill</em> is his first novel and vividly evokes 18th-century New York.</strong></p> <p><strong>After five books of nonfiction why did you turn to fiction?</strong><br />For a long time I didn\u2019t dare to take on fiction. <em>Golden Hill </em>started off as a book about 18th-century New York but then the characters Smith and Tabitha wandered over from the other side of my brain, and the expository stuff about the city could be sucked into the storytelling. To write fiction requires you to mobilise your emotional resources. I\u2019m a first-time novelist at 52 because it\u2019s taken me that long to be on reasonable terms with my own psyche.</p> <p><strong>You describe that fear of facing emotions in your memoir, </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/mar/03/biography.features1\" title=\"\"><strong><em>The Child That Books Built</em></strong></a><strong>...</strong><br />Yes \u2013 and things have happened to me since writing that: I fucked up in some of the standard ways that adults fuck up \u2013 and when you discover that\u2019s survivable it tends to leave you less scared of emotional expression.</p> <p><strong>Was exploring the power of the imagination exciting?</strong> <br />It\u2019s intoxicating and I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t do it sooner. I wish I\u2019d dared a decade ago. I got to explore what it\u2019s like not being me. And that\u2019s what is intoxicating about fiction: how it lets you mess about with identity.</p> <p><strong>The fluidity of identity is an intrinsic theme in <em>Golden Hill</em>\u2026 </strong><br />It is. I buy the Virginia Woolf idea that you\u2019re a bit androgynous when you write \u2013 there\u2019s something like a spark of attention before you write which lets you be different genders, different souls, different colours, different characters. When you\u2019re lucky it works like that for readers too \u2013 it lets you see the world more openly.</p> <p><strong>Why did you choose the 18th century?</strong><br />I liked the idea of getting back to the period in which the novel-form began. Eighteenth-century novels were shameless about using strong forms of story and the later distinctions between high and low culture were not yet in place, so you could have both \u2013 and that\u2019s what I wanted. It also put me a generation before the American Revolution and I was curious about how America stopped being British.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It pisses me off when novelists wipe away religious parts of the past as they don\u2019t compute well with modern readers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Were you interested in exploring slavery?</strong> <br />Yes, partly because it\u2019s not in the later iconography of New York. Benjamin Franklin owned slaves and later decided that he needed to educate them and become an abolitionist but he wasn\u2019t to begin with \u2013 and that was in enlightened Philadelphia.</p> <p><strong>How did you construct the novel?</strong><br />There\u2019s a nice essay by Zadie Smith about different kinds of writer \u2013 her distinction is between the Macro Planner and the Micro Manager. What\u2019s behind me has to feel solid and only when it\u2019s done can I go on to the next bit. Part of what makes writing a novel scary is that the structure can\u2019t be known to you in the same way as nonfiction \u2013 you are taking on trust something that doesn\u2019t yet exist.</p> <p><strong>Tell me about your early passion for stories and how that developed.</strong><br />I lived in stories. I was a child for whom the world was very story-shaped partly because we had a serious illness in the family and there were things to run away from. I grew up with the series of 18th-century novels called the Mothers of the Novels on the shelves so I\u2019m very aware of the novel not just a form in which men invented female sensibility but something that women pioneered.</p> <p><strong>Religion is a powerful theme in your\u00a0writing\u2026</strong><br />Religion is a form of imagining, I think. It\u2019s using the same capacity \u2013 dealing with things that stay paradoxes and don\u2019t settle into certainty \u2013 so imagination used in writing and in religion are both doing Keats\u2019s \u201cnegative capability\u201d of not trying to settle it, not \u201cirritably reaching\u201d for proof. It\u2019s got a lot to do with learning to live with the provisional, the \u201cwhat if\u201d\u2026</p> <p>It pisses me off in a small way that historical novelists tend to wipe away religious parts of the past as they don\u2019t compute well with modern readers so I made a deal with myself: given how obsessively church-going 18th-century New York was, my characters would go to church, but it would make sense as part of the story and cause something to happen.</p> <p><strong>Do you have any writing habits?</strong><br />I like writing in cafes. My wife is a vicar \u2013 she\u2019s about to become a canon of Ely Cathedral \u2013 and I have a perfectly good work room in her vicarage, which is full of terrifying hush and calm and peace but I find it much harder to concentrate there. I like the gentle human white noise of people getting on with their lives.</p> <p><em>Golden Hill is published by Faber (\u00a316.99).</em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/406003/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a313.59</em></a></p>",

These dire predictions appeared to be playing out in January 2016, when tens of thousands of hectares of forest burned, sparked by lightning strikes that came in a month when temperatures were 2C above average and in the wake of the driest two-year period ever recorded for the region.\u201d</p> <p>The deleted section on Kakadu national park contained similarly dire warnings.</p> <p>It described the important natural and cultural values of Kakadu, which has been inhabited by Aboriginal people for 50,000 years.</p> <p>\u201cThe thousands of rock art sites in the park are at risk from damage by more extreme rainfall events, while sea level rise is happening at twice the global average along the northern Australian coast,\u201d the draft report said.</p> <p>It warned that fresh-water wetlands were at risk from sea level rise, as they are likely to be inundated with salt water. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/27/world-heritage-forests-burn-as-global-tragedy-unfolds-in-tasmania\">World heritage forests burn as global tragedy unfolds in Tasmania</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cClimate change threatens Aboriginal traditional use by altering the ecosystems of the vast wetlands of Kakadu and raising temperatures to a level likely to lead to more intense fire regimes,\u201d the report said.</p> <p>The final version of the report entitled \u201cWorld heritage and tourism in a changing climate\u201d was published last week by Unesco, United Nations environment programme and the Union of Concerned Scientists, with all references to Australia removed.</p> <p>The lead author of the report, Adam Markham, told Guardian Australia: \u201cI was shocked when I <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/27/australia-scrubbed-from-un-climate-change-report-after-government-intervention\">read in the Guardian</a> the reasons the Australian government gave for why they had pressured Unesco to drop the Australian sites.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Imeet <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/23/beth-orton-interview-sugaring-season\" title=\"\">Beth Orton</a> for lunch in a pub in Islington, north London. Dressed in a red leather biker-style jacket, T-shirt, jeans and red leather boots, she seems taller than I remember, but just as intense in her own particular way, often veering from garrulous to guarded in a single sentence. We first met in the late 1990s, when she was working on her album <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jul/03/beth-orton-review-abc-glasgow-spontaneous-spine-tingling\" title=\"\"><em>Central Reservation</em></a>. Back then, she was trying to shrug off the unwanted soubriquet \u201cthe Comedown Queen\u201d, which had been applied to her when her first album, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpPjBUUqggkOtFNVl_5ucj9K1hiGTGNk5\" title=\"\"><em>Trailer Park</em></a>, arrived in\u00a01996 \u2013 a soothing balm to the excesses of rave culture.</p> <p>Our paths have crossed many times since and, for a supposedly sensitive singer-songwriter, I have always found\u00a0her engaging company \u2013 funny and feisty. Today, though, she takes time to settle into the interview, initially seeming nervy and unfocused. \u201cI\u2019m a bit stressed,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re still adjusting to life back in London and everything\u2019s a bit topsy-turvy.\u201d</p> <p>Having spent two years living in Los Angeles, Orton and her family \u2013 her husband and fellow musician <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/sep/25/sam-amidon-lily-o-review-folk\" title=\"\">Sam Amidon</a>, and her two young children, Nancy and Arthur \u2013 are now living back in east London, \u201cfor a while\u201d. She longs, she says, for the peace of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laurel_Canyon,_Los_Angeles\" title=\"\">Laurel Canyon</a> and finds London \u201charder than I remember\u201d. What, though, precipitated the move to California in the first place? \u201cWell, Sam is American\u00a0and I fancied some sunshine,\u201d she says, grinning, \u201cbut uprooting yourself when you are older does have a huge impact, more so than I imagined. With hindsight, I think relocating my entire family there was also a desire for some kind of radical creative change. I just needed to shake things up, I guess, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/mar/02/beth-orton-hear-moon-from-new-album-kidsticks\" title=\"\"><em>Kidsticks</em> </a>is the\u00a0result.\u201d</p> <p><em>Kidsticks </em>is Orton\u2019s adventurous new album, her first in nearly four years. She chose the title, she says, \u201cbecause for me it has that joyous feel of kids playing music with sticks\u201d. From the dissonant electronic shudder that opens the set like a statement of intent, <em>Kidsticks </em>does, indeed, sound joyously abandoned. Gone is the folk-rock introspection of old, replaced by\u00a0a dizzying swirl of words and sonic\u00a0collages.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"78758b9e4769ad9acea997e79538a43cfd8c6945\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/78758b9e4769ad9acea997e79538a43cfd8c6945/0_639_3544_4430/800.jpg\" alt=\"Beth Orton.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Even when I was supposed to be this fragile folk singer, I was bringing up a family\u2019 Beth Orton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI\u2019ll astrally project myself into the life of someone else,\u201d she sings on the first song, Snow, and, as the album progresses, it feels as if she might actually have done that, so unrecognisable is her voice and its setting. Many of the songs have evocative single-word titles \u2013 Snow, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SjlHOpAzjxM\" title=\"\">Moon</a>, Wave, Petals \u2013 but only occasionally do they approach familiar\u00a0Orton territory. Words most often used to describe her music \u2013 folkie, fragile, introspective \u2013 are rendered redundant here by the physicality of her singing.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad if you hear all that in the songs,\u201d she says, nodding. \u201cI did feel like I was setting free another part of me in the process of making this record. I was so focused and so intense\u00a0for 16 months, putting it all together like a complex puzzle. I\u2019ve never worked so hard on anything in my life.\u201d</p> <p>She describes the protracted recording experience, which unfolded in fits and starts in garage and back-garden studios in LA and, at one point, in her front room \u201cwith leads everywhere and sometimes the kids running around\u201d, as defiantly old school. \u201cIt was as far from the sterile recording studio environment as you can get and all the better for that.\u201d</p> <p>The album was co-produced by Andrew Hung of Bristolian electronic duo <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/jul/18/fuck-buttons-slow-focus-review\" title=\"\">Fuck Buttons</a>, whom Orton met when he remixed <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpEafEZbWIE\" title=\"\">Mystery</a>, a track on her previous album, 2014\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/30/beth-orton-sugaring-season-review\" title=\"\"><em>Sugaring Season</em></a>. It was Hung who kickstarted her journey into sound by suggesting she play keyboards rather than guitar, when they first began tentatively trading ideas in a studio in Los Angeles two years ago.</p> <p>\u201cGiving me the keyboard gave me control, in a way,\u201d she says. \u201cThat had never really happened before. I got to play the synth, I got to play my own basslines, I got to build my own sound. I just played and played without too much thinking. There was a sense of wonderment to just making sounds again. It\u2019s hard to explain, but it was almost as if I had never played an instrument\u00a0before.\u201d</p> <p>Orton\u2019s musical journey from <em>Trailer Park</em>, through the tentative electronica of 2002\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2002/jul/26/popandrock.artsfeatures2\" title=\"\"><em>Daybreaker</em></a> to the stark alt-folk of 2006\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/feb/10/popandrock.shopping5\" title=\"\"><em>Comfort of Strangers</em></a> and on to the more determinedly song-based thrust of 2012\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXWo2SxqFNg\" title=\"\"><em>Sugaring Season</em></a>, has been characterised by a constant flitting between styles \u2013 often in the company of some surprising collaborators: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/williamorbit\" title=\"\">William Orbit</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/feb/06/andrew-weatherall-guardian-interview\" title=\"\">Andrew Wetherall</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/johnnymarr\" title=\"\">Johnny Marr</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jun/28/chemical-brothers-been-together-longer-than-marriages\" title=\"\">the Chemical Brothers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/may/18/jim-o-rourke-simple-songs\" title=\"\">Jim O\u2019Rourke</a>. As such, she has often seemed like someone longing to fit into an older singer-songwriter tradition while straining against it: a free spirit with a\u00a0paradoxical need to belong.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/mar/02/beth-orton-hear-moon-from-new-album-kidsticks\">Beth Orton \u2013 hear Moon, from her forthcoming album Kidsticks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Given that, in 2004, she started taking guitar lessons from the venerable <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/oct/05/bert-jansch\" title=\"\">Bert Jansch</a> in an effort to ground her music in the English folk tradition, <em>Kidsticks</em> seems even more surprising in its iconoclasm. \u201cWell, that\u2019s a good thing, surely,\u201d she says. \u201cWith Bert, it was like me taking on the big boys, trying to be totally serious and dedicated to learning my craft. In a way, this album is a reaction to that. Like I\u2019d done the English singer-songwriter thing and reached a point where I needed to throw it all off and\u00a0find a new place, both physically and creatively.\u201d</p> <p>It is easily, I say, her most un-English sounding record. \u201cWell, I did kind of lose my identity during my first few months in Los Angeles and, though I\u00a0feel English and my music has always been essentially English-sounding, I\u00a0felt unmoored from that for a while. In a good way.\u201d</p> <p>I ask whether she has ever found it difficult being a woman in what is still a predominantly male world, surrounded by male musicians and collaborators? Producers, in particular, often have a tendency to impose their vision of what is, in effect, someone else\u2019s music. She considers this for a while, screwing her face up in concentration. \u201cI have to be careful here,\u201d she says, finally, \u201cbecause I\u00a0have always worked with brilliant, inspiring people, but sometimes I have got carried away by their suggestions. In fact, I look back and I\u2019m amazed by how many tangents I went on. I also had a tendency to become a bit obsessed with a certain sound, the sound that Jim O\u2019Rourke made or David Roback made. Often it was genius, but it was their genius.\u201d</p> <p>Revealingly, <em>Kidsticks</em> is the first album on which Orton credits herself as co-producer, not least because, though the album began with Hung\u2019s abrasive loops and her synth forays, she then felt the need to bring musicians on board to ground her melodies. The whole process took 18 months, with Orton often writing lyrics as she toured, and then bringing in people from LA\u2019s scattered indie music community, such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jul/05/twin-shadow-confess-review\" title=\"\">George Lewis Jr (Twin Shadow)</a> and Chris Taylor (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/australia-culture-blog/2014/jan/03/grizzly-bear-australia-ed-droste\" title=\"\">Grizzly Bear</a>), as well as more seasoned players such as the multi-instrumentalist Shahzad Ismaily.</p> <p>\u201cI felt I had to impose my vision on the songs at some point,\u201d she says. \u201cThat definitely disappointed Andrew, who wanted it to be a full-on electronic record. But as I was writing to these tracks and started to build up quite complex melodies, I started to hear something linear.\u201d</p> <p><em>Kidsticks</em> is not a pristine studio record. \u201cI worked with Chris Taylor for four days in his house, just pulling the loops and the songs and the live music together,\u201d says Orton, becoming animated. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how freeing that was not to have engineers constantly fussing over the positioning of a fucking microphone or what knob to twiddle a bit more.\u201d</p> <p>I mention that there seem to be a lot of references to falling on the record, not only falling in love, but falling as letting go of the self, intentionally or not. There is even a song called Falling that includes the striking line: \u201cNow my phone book is filling up with dead friends, and I wonder who would answer if I called them.\u201d She nods, looking suddenly sombre. \u201cGrowing older, loss becomes a part of your life and you have to somehow accept it. There are quite a lot of dead people on my mobile and, oddly, I don\u2019t delete their names. It\u2019s like our modern way of staying connected to people we have lost \u2013 we don\u2019t visit their graves like we used to, but we visit their names instead just by scrolling through our phonebook. And there they all are. I\u00a0always think: \u201cOh, they lived. Once.\u201d That\u2019s kind of what the song touches\u00a0on.\u201d</p> <p>It turns out that Petals, one of two spoken-word tracks, is also about loss. It is not, as I had supposed, about the loss of her mother, who died when Orton was 19, but concerns a particularly painful breakup and \u201cthat feeling of sitting poleaxed by grief in a room, so still and silent you almost become inanimate like a part of the furniture\u201d. She does, I suggest, seem to feel things very acutely, \u201cI do. I do,\u201d she says, looking pained, \u201cbut, you know, I\u2019ve learned to accept it, whereas once I would stay up all night trying to drink the lads under the table to prove I wasn\u2019t this fragile thing that everyone seemed to think I was.\u201d</p> <p>In the act of composing on a digital keyboard rather than with an acoustic guitar, Orton seems to have put paid to the lingering notion of her as a fragile singer-songwriter. \u201cMaybe. Maybe,\u201d she says, \u201cBut even when I was supposed to be this fragile folk singer, I was bringing up a family and supporting them and I did nurse my mum when she was dying. For me, the real balance is being strong as a woman in what is still a very male world and, at the same time, allowing my music to express my vulnerability and openness. The difference this time around is that, without the guitar, I\u00a0couldn\u2019t sit strumming by the open window and get all reflective. There was definitely a freedom in that.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXWo2SxqFNg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wXWo2SxqFNg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Listen to extract from Sugaring Season</figcaption> </figure>   <p>What has really grounded her, though, is her family. The tracks Flesh and Blood and Dawnstar are what Orton calls \u201cflesh and blood love songs\u201d to her husband. How is it living with another musician? Are they competitive? \u201cNah, we keep it very separate. He does his thing and I do mine and occasionally we come together on stage or in the studio. He\u2019s just really level and incredibly supportive.\u201d She seems, I venture, to be in a good place, creatively and personally. \u201cWell, making the record was like a cleansing, like a musical sage burning. <em>Trailer Park </em>was a bit warts and all and this one is like that, too. I could have done certain lines better or made a more sophisticated part, but you know what? I don\u2019t want to be obsessive or perfectionist. It just feels better when it all hangs out a bit.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/sep/23/beth-orton-interview-sugaring-season\">Beth Orton: 'I started to believe I had run my course'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Corduroy Legs, the other spoken-word track on the album is an ode to motherhood \u2013 \u201ca hand reaches to me, across the banished sea, and holds me, holds me holding you\u201d \u2013 that manages to be affecting and playful. \u201cI started that song when I was a single parent with this tiny baby and it was just the two of us, me and Nancy, living in Norfolk on our own.

      "body": "<p>The opening bars of <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/productions/oedipe-by-alex-olle\"><strong>Oedipe</strong></a>, questing and visionary, might be by Bruckner. In a trice we plunge into expressionist harmonies and the world of Schoenberg. Then with a sensuous flourish of flute and harp we are whisked into the glassy spheres of Debussy. All that with hardly time to settle in our seats. First performed in Paris in 1936, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2002/oct/25/classicalmusicandopera.artsfeatures\">George Enescu</a>\u2019s \u201ctrag\u00e9die lyrique\u201d in four acts and six tableaux recounting the myth of Oedipus has at last received its UK and Royal Opera premiere in a <a href=\"http://www.lafura.com/en/works/oedipe/\">production from La Monnaie, Brussels</a>. The two directors, <a href=\"http://www.alexolle.com/\">Alex Oll\u00e9</a> and <a href=\"http://www.valentinacarrasco.com/\">Valentina Carrasco</a> \u2013 Spanish and Argentinian respectively \u2013 and the British conductor <a href=\"http://intermusica.co.uk/artist/Leo-Hussain\">Leo Hussain,</a> are also making their Royal Opera debuts. If you want to see this rarity, now is your chance. </p> <p>That <em>Oedipe </em>is not convincing is through no lack of commitment on the part of the exceptional cast, chorus and orchestra. A prodigious composer, violinist, pianist, conductor and teacher, whose pupils included the young <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yKG40sDFew\">Yehudi Menuhin</a>, the Romanian Enescu (1881-1955) has always had advocates but never hit the mainstream. His only opera, considered his masterpiece, explains both factors. This is music that traverses idioms and fleetingly finds its own elusive character, but encounters swaths of blank terrain en route. Enescu struggled with the score for some two decades. It has the feel of a ripe fruit grown too large.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Johan Reuter brought terror and anguish to the taxing title role in a remarkable, heartfelt performance</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Here, the terrible fate of the son of King La\u00efos and Queen Jocaste is told in lengthy detail, combining Sophocles\u2019s <em>Oedipus Tyrannus</em> and <em>Oedipus at Colonus,</em> from birth to a last walk into bright light<em>.</em> That bulk results in an uneven work with longueurs. If the entirety reached the brilliance of the score\u2019s final quarter of an hour, <em>Oedipe</em> would be a repertoire work. As it is, it remains a disturbing oddity, certainly worth an encounter. The librettist, <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/edmond-fleg\">Edmond Fleg</a>, added his own literary interpolations. In Act 1 the blind Tir\u00e9sias \u2013 played by <a href=\"http://johntomlinson.org/\">John Tomlinson</a> on majestic, growly form \u2013 warns the new parents of their baby\u2019s fate. In Act 2, Oedipus\u2019s adoptive parents show affection to their troubled son. Despite some cuts to the score and the gripping nature of the story, it lacks tension.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30ff3f18ff3cf35f763fa66bfed311b4215ac4c3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30ff3f18ff3cf35f763fa66bfed311b4215ac4c3/0_0_3104_4745/654.jpg\" alt=\"A scene from Oedipe, with Sarah Connolly bottom right, as Jocaste and John Tomlinson as Tir\u00e9sias, above.\" width=\"654\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene from Oedipe, with Sarah Connolly bottom right, as Jocaste and John Tomlinson as Tir\u00e9sias, above.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Oll\u00e9 and Carrasco\u2019s striking staging, designed by <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/alfons-flores\">Alfons Flores</a>, takes place within an abandoned, four-tiered building dredged in red mud, indicating ecological disaster.

Without named characters or stage direction, her pithy text has been made into an opera by <a href=\"http://philipvenables.com/\">Philip Venables</a>, resident composer at the Royal Opera in collaboration with Guildhall School of Music and Drama. Kane\u2019s piece is a litany of despair. It captures truthfully the swivels, brake runs and lurches of a mind in torment. Its subject needs no further analysis; Kane has done the job for us.</p> <p>The revelation is how Venables has enriched her play through music. He challenges the conventions of opera. Via an array of resources he ambushes and refreshes an old art form. His technique is that of a collagist. Text is variously spoken, projected, amplified, conveyed rhythmically with percussion and sung, often in aria-like lament or chorale outburst. Snatches of Purcell \u2013 a mini viola fantasia arrests the action for several moments \u2013 and Bach coexist with high-energy funk reminiscent of the late <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/may/08/steve-martland\">Steve Martland</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e3c96c022a020a0020a58522775102885ecdfa79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e3c96c022a020a0020a58522775102885ecdfa79/8_0_3811_2287/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A litany of despair\u2019: 4.48 Psychosis at the Lyric Hammersmith.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A litany of despair\u2019: 4.48 Psychosis at the Lyric Hammersmith.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ROH/Stephen Cummiskey</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On reading later that Martland was Venables\u2019s teacher, I can hear that element as a tribute rather than an imitation. I need to know more of Venables\u2019s music to find his own musical identity: my task, not his. High praise to the 12 members of <a href=\"http://www.chromaensemble.co.uk/\">Chroma</a>, and the conductor, Venables\u2019s fellow composer <a href=\"http://rchrdbkr.com/\">Richard Baker</a>.

This is their <a href=\"http://www.resonusclassics.com/mozart-piano-trios-kv-502-542-564-rautio\" title=\"\">debut recording for Resonus</a>. Pianist Jan Rautio here plays a fortepiano (tuned to A=430\u00a0Hz in unequal temperament), with cellist Adi Tal and violinist Jane Gordon using gut strings and lighter, shorter bows. The result is playing of great agility and intimacy which immediately solves some of the balance problems in Mozart\u2019s trios when played on a modern grand, especially in accompanying figures. It\u2019s an impressive achievement, a disc to return to often.</p>",

Storm lightning injured three others in the same region, and a 61-year-old man drowned in flash flooding.</p> <p>In Germany, more than 30 people were taken to hospital in the western village of Hoppst\u00e4dten when lightning struck at the end of a junior football match. Three adults were seriously injured, including the referee who was hit directly and had to be resuscitated before being airlifted to hospital.</p> <p>Eleven people, including eight children, were injured when lightning struck as they were celebrating a birthday party in a park in north-west Paris. The children, aged between seven and eight years old, took shelter beneath a tree when the storm broke. A hospital spokesman said one child remained in a serious condition.</p> <p>Officials said the situation would have been much worse if an off-duty firefighter, Pascal Gremillot, who happened to be close by, had not been able to quickly administer first aid and heart massages. Eric Moulin, Paris fire service spokesman, said the group had rushed under a tree to shelter when it began to rain. \u201cIt was while they were heading for shelter, when they were still near a tree, that the lightning fell,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Michel Daloz of weather agency Meteo-France said that between 100 and 200 people are struck by lightning every year in the country, killing between 10 and 20 people. Storm alerts had been issued for several regions across France on Saturday, warning of the possibility of violent weather \u2013 but Paris was not on the list.</p> <p>Witnesses to the German lightning strike reported that it happened without warning. \u201cThere was no rain and the sky wasn\u2019t dark,\u201d a police spokesman said.</p> <p>Twenty-nine children, aged between nine and 11, were taken to hospital for tests but later released officials said. </p> <p>German weather experts issued storm alerts for the country\u2019s west and south. Storm Elvira had already caused torrential rain, hail and flooding in some areas.</p> <p>In Rhineland-Palatinate, the region where Hoppst\u00e4dten is located, bad weather caused a train to derail on Friday, but there were no injuries.</p> <p>Weather experts said the storms were the result of a very \u201cunstable\u201d atmosphere over mainland north-west Europe. At the same time the air higher up in the atmosphere was becoming colder, creating a very \u201cunstable\u201d atmosphere. </p> <p>Further storms are forecast over south and east Germany, the Czech Republic and Poland on Sunday.</p> <p><br /></p>",

But it can easily go wrong. The plot is slapdash; the coincidences preposterous; the main characters not interestingly conflicted, just doomed. The play must be ardently spoken and bewitchingly choreographed. If not, it ends up looking less like a tragedy and more like an accident.</p> <p>Which is what happens in Rob Ashford and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/apr/17/kenneth-branagh-residency-garrick-theatre-london\">Kenneth Branagh</a>\u2019s star-led, star-crossed staging. It has intermittent fizz but never feels urgent or perilous. <a href=\"http://lily-james.com/\">Lily James</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/22/richard-madden-bastille-day-idris-elba-game-of-thrones\">Richard Madden</a> look unusually fresh and credible as febrile young lovers. They come with form as a couple, having been directed by Branagh in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2NUtyYsrvao\"><em>Cinderella</em></a>. They were meant to hoist the production sky-high, towards Phoebus\u2019s lodging. But their speaking is earthbound.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>James has an appealing Bambi presence and some good bits of giddy business.

She cartwheels across the stage and swigs a bottle of champagne on her weirdly low balcony. When she is agitated she gets hiccups. Yet her delivery of the verse is watery. True, it\u2019s hideously difficult to sound emotionally out of control while delivering intelligible, calibrated verse. At the moment, James scrambles along, indicating intensity by some odd emphases and by raising her pitch. Madden, robust but generally less mobile, swallows his words. They sound more like an arranged match than a couple transfixed by each other. In case we don\u2019t know when something important is happening, swaths of speech are underscored by emotional bursts of music. Which further muffles the words.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd878bcadc29849fa5aa85287d68f6ed1b2cbf5e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd878bcadc29849fa5aa85287d68f6ed1b2cbf5e/0_196_3189_1913/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Put \u2019em up\u2026 Ansu Kabia as Tybalt, left, with Derek Jacobi as a \u2018dandy\u2019 Mercutio.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Put \u2019em up\u2026 Ansu Kabia as Tybalt, left, with Derek Jacobi as a \u2018dandy\u2019 Mercutio.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Johan Persson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/derek-jacobi\">Derek Jacobi</a>\u2019s lines are flutingly locuted. He is in a show of his own as a dandy Mercutio. A parody of a young blood, he comes on in dapper suit and co-respondent shoes, twirling a cane. He sticks \u201cboom-boom\u201d at the end of a line to land a bon mot. It\u2019s scarcely mercury that is running through his veins, but he just about makes sense of casting an elderly actor in the quicksilver part. Until, that is, he totters up to Tybalt to start a fight, and no one thinks to intervene.</p> <p><a href=\"http://waringandmckenna.com/clients/michael-rouse/\">Michael Rouse</a> makes a memorable bully out of Capulet <em>p\u00e8re</em>. In general, though, the characterisation is broadbrush, part of the transplanting of the play to a postwar, generically excitable Italy. Waiters, wailing, waving arms \u2013 and Italian phrases hurled through the air. No wonder, we are perhaps supposed to think, these two young things got carried away. There is a startlingly dramatic clash of swords and, thanks to <a href=\"http://christopheroramdesign.com/CHRISTOPHER_ORAM/Christopher_Oram.html\">Christopher Oram</a>, some enviable cinched-waist New Look dresses.

      "body": "<p>A circle is itself, pure and simple, but a world of other things too: a bubble, an eye, a planet, the sun. Casually drawn on a scrap of paper, it can be a hole, a halo, a ring or the Earth itself. Since the dawn of mankind we have been looking with wonder at the full moon in the night sky and the coloured discs in each other\u2019s eyes. The lure of the circle is ancient and infinite; it is surely the most potent of all natural symbols.</p> <p>It also turns out to be the ideal theme for a show, or at least for a show as well curated as this. <a href=\"https://www.turnercontemporary.org/exhibitions/seeing-round-corners\">Seeing Round Corners</a> is the work of two artists, <a href=\"http://www.jonathanparsons.com/Welcome.html\">Jonathan Parsons</a> and <a href=\"http://www.davidward-artist.co.uk/davidward-artist/Start_Page.html\">David Ward</a>, who have thought very deeply about every aspect of the circle, from its irreducible beauty to its comforting warmth and its fierce self-containment. Every one of the works here, and there are nearly 200 paintings, drawings, videos, performances pieces and sculptures, has its own fascination but suggests some new idea about circles. This is the most stimulating and compelling exhibition.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Circles are not just emblems of perfection, continuity, strength or clarity, but of some kind of freedom too</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The eyeball is spherical; our field of vision is circular. Perhaps we are predisposed to circles, drawn to their continuity and grace. In our minds we are beings alive on the surface of a sphere \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.edickinson.org/editions/1/image_sets/235952\">a speck on a ball</a>, as Emily Dickinson put it. To be able to draw that ball is to be gifted; Giotto was famously able to produce a perfect circle without a compass. Our arms sweep circles in the air. Leonardo\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vitruvian_Man#/media/File:Da_Vinci_Vitruve_Luc_Viatour.jpg\"><em>Vitruvian Man</em></a> is contained, and perhaps expressed, in a radiant circle.</p> <p>The earliest works in this show are mystical objects: an ancient Egyptian statue of a sun goddess crowned with a disc; a Roman priest\u2019s headdress in the shape of a wheel. A circle has mysterious properties. Turner\u2019s spectral watercolour of Stonehenge emphasises the insistent shape of that immense ring, a primitive yet sophisticated communion of stones.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9d8cb5ec04c27a2d9dce5020398281c250e4f66a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d8cb5ec04c27a2d9dce5020398281c250e4f66a/0_0_3508_2477/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Shipwreck, 1859 by Francis Danby.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"706\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Shipwreck, 1859 by Francis Danby.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wolverhampton Arts &amp; Museums</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The sun that shines on Stonehenge might have something to do with its shape. That great fiery circle, emblematic backdrop to William Blake\u2019s <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Europe_a_Prophecy_copy_B_object_1_Bentley_1%2C_Erdman_i_Keynes_i_Europe_a_Prophecy.jpg\"><em>Ancient of Days</em></a>, with his compass, is as ubiquitous as the horizon line in our world. Every landscape holds a sun, and most landscape paintings too. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/video/2011/apr/06/turner-contemporary-gallery-margate-david-chipperfield\">Turner Contemporary</a> has many beautiful examples \u2013 a Patrick Heron sun glowing red in a scarlet sky; several Paul Nash landscapes in which the sun is variously alive and dramatically dead; Samuel Palmer\u2019s tiny ink and watercolour <em>Moonrise</em>.</p> <p>Condensed as a sonnet, this image shows the crescent moon above the hill implying the palest hint of its full-circle self, just as the rainbow implies more than its arc in a tremendous shipwreck by the Victorian painter Francis Danby.<br /></p> <p>A simple circle drawn on a page represents not only the flat shape of Euclidean geometry, but a sphere as well. We see it that way, just as small children see a circle with two dots and a dash as a face. The circle is only a line taken for a roundabout walk and yet it has the potential to be both purely abstract and entirely figurative, flat and yet three-dimensional.</p> <p>Circles may be balls \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.davidbatchelor.co.uk/works/3D/\">David Batchelor</a>\u2019s bright beach balls fashioned entirely out of sunglasses, which become Sputniks when the arms are opened out, perfect for seaside Margate \u2013 or they may be diagrams.

Hammons blends into the sidewalk, just another poor street trader, invisible to the public, except that his wares (and, it is implied, his livelihood) are melting away.</p> <p>The circle is timeless but also modern and hi-tech: lenses, records, cogs and clocks. Time is circular on Napoleon\u2019s personal carriage clock, seized at Waterloo, the hands always showing the hours past as well as those to come.

But the circularity of our daily existence can drive us insane, and several works here play upon the horror of incessant repetition.</p> <p>Specifically, a film of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/nov/11/marina-abramovic-ulay-performance-art-sued-lawsuit\">Marina Abramovi\u0107 and her partner Ulay</a> literally <a href=\"http://www.li-ma.nl/site/catalogue/art/abramovic-ulay/relation-in-movement-compilation-version/1836\">driving round and round in rings</a> for hours on end, all through one dark night in Paris. Nothing changes, except that the tyre marks grow more indelible on the ground. We chase each other, we repeat our mistakes, we go round in circles: art and life, Abramovi\u0107 implies, might drive you mad.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"989dc6a8202488f801fdae0a1fddf88cfd9f688e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/989dc6a8202488f801fdae0a1fddf88cfd9f688e/403_665_4754_4731/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A \u2018fizz of yellow circles\u2019: Two Yellows, Composition with Circles 5, 2011 by Bridget Riley.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"995\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A \u2018fizz of yellow circles\u2019: Two Yellows, Composition with Circles 5, 2011 by Bridget Riley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Bridget Riley, 2016.

Mangold\u2019s <em>Circle Within a Polygon</em> is characteristically subtle and precise, emphasising the perfect beauty of the circle simply by thwarting it. His drawing superimposes a polygon over a circle, so that the lovely roundness appears distorted by angled lines. The result is strangely disturbing to the mind and eye.</p> <p>What Mangold captures in this work is something particular about circles: their pure buoyancy of form. Circles, as so many of the works in this show reveal, are not just emblems of perfection, continuity, strength or clarity, but of some kind of freedom too. Seeing so many of them at Turner Contemporary raises the spirits as a show about squares never could. The clinching instance is Bridget Riley\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.karstenschubert.com/artists/31-bridget-riley/works/5890/\">fizz of yellow circles</a>, overlapping, bursting on the retina, bubbling up the picture plane: a vision of pure effervescence.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.turnercontemporary.org/exhibitions/seeing-round-corners\">Seeing Round Corners: The Art of the Circle is at Turner Contemporary, Margate until 25 September</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>On a sunny morning earlier this month, a small group gathered at the entrance to Barcelona\u2019s Fossar de la Pedrera, or Mass Grave of the Quarry. They were a mix of ages and types. An elderly woman, smartly dressed, clutched flowers as she stood next to her middle-aged son. A father and his young daughter waited patiently. Another visitor struggled to keep a restless chihuahua in check and hold on to her parasol.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/09/spain-valley-of-the-fallen-general-franco-exhumations\">Spain to make first exhumations from civil war mausoleum</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Fossar is relatively inaccessible from the city. Hidden by sheer walls of sandy rock, it rarely features in the tourist itineraries. Local people generally stay away but, once a month, small huddles can be seen making a dignified progress between the plaques and monuments, tactfully slowing down as members of the group linger over a particular name or a certain tribute.</p> <p>This is a place of mourning. Following the end of the Spanish civil war in 1939, the bodies of 1,700 Republicans \u2013soldiers, civilians, people caught in the wrong place at the wrong time \u2013 were carted through the centre of Barcelona and dumped here without dignity or ceremony, after summary execution by the fascist forces of General Francisco Franco. Their bullet-ridden corpses were covered in quicklime before being thrown into a pit, the better to ensure their rapid decomposition. In a grim example of fascist humour, the medical certificates of many of the dead reported the cause of death as \u201cinternal haemorrage\u201d.</p> <p>A memorial was finally built in 1985 and for the past few years monthly tours have been conducted, in Catalan, by an Englishman, Nick Lloyd, who has lived in Barcelona for 28 years. More often than not, on days such as these, Lloyd ends up doing as much listening as talking. The Fossar de la Pedrera is full of untold stories.</p> <p>The woman with flowers turns out to be the granddaughter of Eudald Coma Gironella, a Republican justice of the peace from the small town of Sant Vicen\u00e7 de Torell\u00f3, an hour\u2019s drive from Barcelona. Until a few months ago his family had no idea where his remains were. Then friends spotted his name on one of the tall columns listing the dead. So here they are. Rosa Vaqu\u00e9 Coma tearfully says a prayer for the grandfather shot two years before she was born, and worries aloud over whether he was allowed to receive the last rites.</p> <p>A few yards away, Alfons V\u00e1zquez Obiols is showing his 13-year-old daughter, Joanna, the name of Antonio Alcoverro Aliern, a municipal policeman in Barcelona when the Nationalist uprising took place. \u201cHe was my grand- mother\u2019s brother,\u201d says V\u00e1zquez. \u201cHe testified against someone who took part in the uprising. He was forced to testify; it was his job, he wasn\u2019t politically involved. When Barcelona fell to the fascists in \u201939, Antonio was arrested. My aunt went every day to the jail to bring him breakfast. One day she was told he was killed. The family were never given the body.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e65dbcb13e56d5dab3febc7b4fad1a1b5a270ea9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e65dbcb13e56d5dab3febc7b4fad1a1b5a270ea9/0_206_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"General Franco strikes a victor\u2019s pose in June 1939\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">General Franco strikes a victor\u2019s pose in June 1939. For 40 years he tried to airbrush the Republican losers from Spain\u2019s history books.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Against the will of his aunt, V\u00e1zquez has sought out the relevant files: \u201cMy aunt said, \u2018Don\u2019t do this. Just forget.\u2019 That generation is still a bit frightened. They said it happened a long time ago, we want to forget. So in the end I didn\u2019t tell them what I did.\u201d</p> <p>Even some of V\u00e1zquez\u2019s friends are unsympathetic to his quest for documents. \u201cI\u2019ve got friends in Madrid who say, \u2018What\u2019s the point? Just leave it\u2019,\u201d he says, but he has no intention of doing that, believing that Spain has a long way to go before its accounts with the civil war are settled.</p> <p>He reserves particular ire for the memorial <a href=\"http://www.feelmadrid.com/valleyofthefallen.html\" title=\"\">of the Valle de los Ca\u00eddos (Valley of the Fallen)</a>. It was claimed by Franco that this grandiose basilica, crypt and monument \u2013 built near Madrid, in part by Republican prisoners, and inaugurated in 1959 \u2013 would represent a \u201cnational act of atonement\u201d. Franco himself is buried there.</p> <p>Dominated by a giant cross and built at the behest of the dictator, who devoted his life to cleansing Spain of godless Marxists, the Valle de los Ca\u00eddos has never come close to being a site of national reconciliation. A few weeks ago, in a historic ruling, a judge ruled that the remains of two Republican victims of summary executions could be exhumed and reburied in \u201cdignified\u201d fashion somewhere else. \u201cThat place is a scandal,\u201d says V\u00e1zquez. \u201cIt is simply a fascist memorial. It\u2019s unacceptable.\u201d</p> <p>Another father in the Fossar group has reluctantly come alone. Sergio Lobo wanted to bring his 12-year-old daughter, Candela, but she backed out. \u201cShe says they\u2019re not teaching her about this at school. She doesn\u2019t feel like she understands enough,\u201d he says. (Candela is not alone: a major survey a few years ago found that 69% of 14-to 17-year-old respondents said they had received little or no information about the civil war.)</p> <p>The body of Lobo\u2019s grandfather has never been found, as remains the case with tens of thousands of other Republican casualties. His remains could be near Girona in north-east Catalonia, where he is believed to have fought, or perhaps closer to Barcelona. Who knows? \u201cI have no idea where my grandfather is buried,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t give you any details at all. Can you imagine!\u201d</p> <p>Two things torment Lobo: the disappearance without trace of his grandfather and the sense that his daughter\u2019s generation will grow up in ignorance of the bloody times that claimed his life. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t we done what other countries have done?\u201d he asks. \u201cWhy haven\u2019t we done what Germany did and performed the hard work of remembering and debating? Why don\u2019t the schools do more? I try with Candela, but it\u2019s very difficult.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact it is left to an Englishman to take guided tours of this place tells you something. We have just stuck a bandage on top of the wound and forgotten about it. It won\u2019t do. Here in Catalonia all the talk is about independence from Spain. Yes, that\u2019s all well and good. But first things first. I fear that my daughter will not be able to tell her daughter about what the civil war really was.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f408cd9b9637138c951c26f6b4dc031b9030aef4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f408cd9b9637138c951c26f6b4dc031b9030aef4/0_501_3072_1843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Defeated Republicans march into exile in France\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Defeated Republicans march into exile in France.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STF/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Eighty years after Franco\u2019s troops launched a military uprising against the elected Republican government of Santiago Casares Quiroga on 17 July 1936, there is still no museum dedicated to telling the full story of the civil war.</p> <p>Around the Arag\u00f3n battle sites, where George Orwell fought alongside the revolutionary Marxist militiamen of the Poum, small museums can be found chronicling the bitter fighting on that crucial front. In the southern port of Cartagena \u2013 the Republic\u2019s naval base \u2013 a former air-raid shelter now houses a series of galleries portraying local experiences of the conflict. In Guernica, the Basque town <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/aug/18/dispatch-guernica-75-years-on\" title=\"\">bombed by German and Italian planes</a> in April 1937 and portrayed in its agony by Picasso, there is a permanent exhibition devoted to the theme of peace. But nowhere is there a museum that attempts to tell the unexpurgated, tragic tale of Spain\u2019s suffering between the summer of 1936 and April 1939.</p> <p>\u201cIt is pretty astonishing,\u201d says Paul Preston, the eminent British historian of 20th-century Spain, \u201cthat there isn\u2019t a museum that tries to give the whole picture and represent all the sides to the civil war.\u201d Preston sits on the international board of the <a href=\"http://amigce.org/en/\" title=\"\">Association of the International Museum of the Civil War (Amigce)</a> which has formally asked Barcelona\u2019s mayor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/26/ada-colau-barcelona-most-radical-mayor-in-the-world\" title=\"\">Ada Colau</a>, to provide a suitable building for such a museum. The project, which would be self-funding and non-profit, has the support of the Orwell Society in Britain and the relatives of International Brigaders around the world. It has also received a remarkable letter of support from the National Socialism Documentation Centre in Cologne, the largest regional memorial site for the victims of Nazi Germany.</p> <p>But Spain is not Germany. The legacy of the past is more contested and considerably more complicated. \u201cIt is still so Manichean in Spain,\u201d says Preston. \u201cIt\u2019s still very much \u2018those not with us are against us\u2019. And there are still a lot of people who think Franco was wonderful.\u201d</p> <p>Abroad the Spanish Republicans\u2019 doomed struggle against Franco and the fascist powers of Germany and Italy was commemorated in the work of writers such as Orwell, Andr\u00e9 Malraux, Ernest Hemingway and Victor Serge. The world remembers a noble fight to safeguard a fledgling democracy from the fascist menace of Franco, backed by Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini.</p> <p>But during the decades of the Franco dictatorship, a counter-version of history was prosecuted with ferocious energy, one in which Nationalist soldiers stepped in to save old Catholic Spain from the alien, hostile forces of atheism and communism. \u201cSpain suffered 40 years of national brainwashing and terror,\u201d says Preston. \u201cThe aim of that war had been to destroy as many Republicans as possible. And under the Franco regime you saw the institutionalisation of his victory.\u201d</p> <p>War memorials appeared across Spain, but only the Nationalist dead were named and remembered. Survivors such as Sergio Lobo\u2019s widowed grandmother, who eventually found work as a cleaner in a Madrid barracks, were warned to knuckle down, say nothing and forget. \u201cWhen she asked questions about her husband, they told her, \u2018Listen, you have two children.

By the time of Franco\u2019s death, in 1975, the mood had altered. But the new impulse was not to rehabilitate the losers of the conflict, but to consign the country\u2019s bloodiest episode to history. The notion that, to use the phrase coined by another historian, Paloma Aguilar, a \u201ccollective insanity\u201d had gripped Spain, became the founding spirit of Spain\u2019s new democracy. A general amnesty was granted for crimes committed during the war and for 30 years or so <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2014/01/06/turning-away-from-painful-chapters/forgetting-in-order-to-move-on\" title=\"\">an unofficial <em>pacto de olvido</em> (pact of forgetting)</a> held.</p> <p>Not any more. One book \u2013 a novel \u2013 sums up a generational shift that has now led Spaniards such as V\u00e1zquez and Lobo to ignore the advice of ageing relatives and seek to shine a light on the country\u2019s unhappiest secrets.</p> <p><em>The Soldiers of Salamis</em>, published in 2001, follows a middle-aged journalist\u2019s attempt to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/jul/13/fiction.features2\" title=\"\">unravel the truth</a> of a famous incident towards the end of the civil war, when a prominent Falangist escapes a Republican firing squad. The recently bereaved narrator, a fictionalised version of the book\u2019s author, Javier Cercas, interviews a member of the battalion charged with performing the execution. The civil war veteran is now in his 80s. Explaining the motives for stirring up old enmities, Cercas tells the old man: \u201cI just want to talk to you for a while, so I can tell what really happened, or your version of what happened. It\u2019s not a question of settling scores, it\u2019s about trying to understand.\u201d</p> <p>Cercas\u2019s meditation on memory struck an extraordinary chord with the Spanish public, shooting to the top of the bestseller lists and staying there.<a href=\"http://www.unsungfilms.com/21871/soldiers-of-salamina/\" title=\"\"> A film of the book came out in 2003</a>, to similar acclaim.</p> <p>\u201cThe significance of <em>Soldiers of Salamis</em> was that it spoke to the notion of filial duty,\u201d says Sebastiaan Faber, a US-based academic who is about to publish a book entitled <em>The Memory Battles of the Spanish Civil War</em>. \u201cIt spoke to a middle-aged generation whose parents had died, or would soon pass away, and who began to feel they owed it to their parents and grandparents to know fully what happened, and to transmit it to the next generation. So you are seeing this generational shift in Spain, the feeling that past suffering creates a duty to tell.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"65f5f88532528c1288bddc212d2b2bd00b1ac920\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/65f5f88532528c1288bddc212d2b2bd00b1ac920/0_281_5100_3060/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Guernica after its devastation by German bombs in 1937.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Basque town of Guernica after its devastation by German bombs in 1937.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Universal History Archive/UIG via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Over the past decade or so, the new spirit of inquiry has generated an outpouring of books, films and documentaries about the civil war. In the former battlefields of Arag\u00f3n, Catalonia and Castile, searches conducted by Emilio Silva\u2019s Association for the Recovery of Historical Memory, founded in 2000, have led to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jul/17/spain.gilestremlett\" title=\"\">recovery of the remains of nearly 2,000 victims</a> of Francoist killings. Like the fictional narrator of <em>Soldiers of Salamis</em>, Silva went looking for the past, beginning with the location and exhumation of the remains of his own grandfather from a ditch in north-west Spain. His work helped to launch a memory movement, focused on reclaiming the lives erased from the history books during the Franco era.</p> <p>Then, in 2007, the Socialist prime minister Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, went far beyond what his predecessors were willing to risk in the 80s and 90s. Though opposed by the conservative Popular party, Zapatero passed a Law of Historical Memory \u2013 a kind of legislative riposte to the <em>pacto de olvido</em>. The new law formally condemned the Franco regime, gave recognition to victims on both sides and offered support to their relatives. It also decreed that overtly Francoist symbols were to be removed from public buildings and spaces.</p> <p>Nearly 10 years on, that last injunction is still the source of bitter controversy. In December, Manuela Carmena, the new mayor of Madrid and the first leftwing incumbent of that post for 24 years, announced that 30 street names in the capital with a connection to Franco were to be changed. Amid fierce resistance, it still hasn\u2019t happened. There are still, it seems, two Spains when it comes to re-examining the civil war.</p> <p>Nevertheless, according to Faber, something fundamental has changed. \u201cThe old argument that Spain is different from other countries in how it deals with issues like the mass graves no longer holds. Even rightwing parties no longer feel they can be on the wrong side of history. I talked to Silva recently and he said he feels that the \u2018commonsense\u2019 view has shifted. Before, the feedback over exhumations would be about misgivings over stirring up the past. That kind of blowback isn\u2019t happening any more.\u201d</p> <p>So has common sense shifted to the extent that the previously unthinkable was now possible: a comprehensive museum of the Spanish civil war? \u201cMaybe Barcelona would be freer to do this than Madrid,\u201d says Faber. \u201cIt would be a less divisive issue there. And part of Catalonian identity is that it sees itself as more forward-thinking than Madrid.\u201d</p> <p>Outside the Rosa de Foc bookshop in Barcelona\u2019s university district, a faded banner proudly celebrates the spirit of the tumultuous summer of 1936: \u201cNeither wars nor frontiers: CNT Catalunya\u201d.</p> <p>The Rose of Fire is run on a voluntary basis by the CNT union, once the mightiest force in Republican Barcelona. During the first summer of the civil war, its members defeated the Nationalist insurgency, took over the city\u2019s factories and <a href=\"http://blog.orangemonkeytours.com/en/2015/02/24/barcelonas-meest-luxueuze-restaurant-was-even-een-gaarkeuken/\" title=\"\">turned the Ritz hotel into a workers\u2019 canteen</a>. For a shortlived period, they ran the entire city.</p> <p>Now there is just a bookshop, albeit one with treasures such as <em>The Golden Book of the Spanish Revolution</em>, produced by anarchist exiles in 1946 to mark the 10th anniversary of the war. The introduction still packs an emotional punch as it declaims: \u201cThose of us who lived those unique and unforgettable days, days destined to light up the history of the world, will never lose the memory of them.\u201d</p> <p>Behind the counter, Carmen is the current custodian of those memories. \u201cThis is a unique place,\u201d she says. \u201cWe are keeping the story alive. And if the story is not kept alive in Barcelona, where will it be kept alive? This is the place where the anarchist revolution really happened. It is a unique place in the world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7db808a63d5a7376e4b3b5684215ccca066bcb89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7db808a63d5a7376e4b3b5684215ccca066bcb89/0_0_2392_2300/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Anarchist fighters in Barcelona in July 1936.

But along with the Fossar de la Pedrera, throughout the city there are plentiful reminders of the traumatic history it shared with Madrid, Seville, Valladolid and Burgos. At the entrance to a bar named La Llibertaria, a lifesize model of a 1930s paper boy selling a revolutionary paper greets the visitor. Upstairs, a blue-overalled female Republican militiawoman stares out from a recruitment poster. This was the image, some say, that inspired Orwell to create the character of Julia in <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em>. In Las Ramblas, a plaque marks the spot where the Poum leader, Andreu Nin, was arrested by Republican police, \u201cassisted\u201d by Soviet agents. And during the week foreign tour groups led by Lloyd and other expatriate guides crisscross Barcelona, retracing Orwell\u2019s steps. But, as in the rest of Spain, there is no central place where the whole story of 1936-39 is told.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s the question I am always asked,\u201d says Lloyd. \u201cWhy is there no museum of the civil war?\u201d</p> <p>Dr Pelai Pag\u00e8s, professor of contemporary history at the University of Barcelona, is one of Spain\u2019s foremost historians of the conflict and a prime backer of the museum project. \u201cWith its enormous cultural tradition, the Barcelona of today can offer an international museum of the civil war which would help Catalans and Spaniards alike, as well as the foreigners who live in the city or visit, to understand what the civil war has meant to our history,\u201d he said.</p> <p>If Ada Colau agrees, there is little doubt that Sergio Lobo and his daughter would be among the first visitors, as would Alfons V\u00e1zquez. \u201cIt would be great if this could happen,\u201d says V\u00e1zquez. But he also sounds a note of caution. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be difficult. When the subject of the civil war is talked about, the two sides of Spain divide immediately.\u201d</p> <p>Can that division be contained and accommodated within the walls of one building? \u201cThere will never be a consensus on what happened between 1936 and 1939,\u201d says Faber, \u201cand even if that were possible, there will never be a consensus about how to narrate what happened. But in a democracy there should be a higher kind of agreement, an agreement that it is good to collectively discuss the past as a society.\u201d</p> <p>Or as Pag\u00e8s puts it, a museum dedicated to the country\u2019s darkest hours can help to safeguard its future: \u201cThe civil war was the most important event in the history of 20th-century Spain. It was the prologue of the second world war; it generated a dictatorship that lasted almost 40 years and its effects continue into our times. Creating a museum is a means to preserve the historical memory of an event that should never be repeated.\u201d</p> <h2>THE SPANISH CIVIL WAR: A BRIEF HISTORY</h2> <p>REBELLION</p> <p>On 17 July 1936 General Francisco Franco launched a military uprising against the Republican government elected that spring. Mobilising troops from Spanish Morocco \u2013 the so-called Army of Africa \u2013 the Nationalist forces quickly took control of Seville and other areas in the south. The plotters claimed to be acting in defence of traditional Catholic Spain and to restore order to the country. Their treatment of the opposition was brutal.</p> <p>REPUBLICAN MILITIAS MOBILISE<br />Civilians join militias and prepare to fight to defend the Republic. In Barcelona, anarchist workers put down the Nationalist insurgency and launch a social revolution of their own. Factories are collectivised, and in some parts of Catalonia money is abolished. The Ritz hotel in Barcelona is renamed Hotel Gastron\u00f3mico No 1 and serves as a workers\u2019 canteen. A short-lived euphoria sweeps the left as the belief takes hold that Franco\u2019s uprising could be the catalyst for a socialist revolution. In Madrid, the Republican government, which hopes to build a popular front including moderates and liberals to combat the Nationalist threat, will become increasingly concerned at the growing radicalism.</p> <p>GEORGE ORWELL JOINS UP<br />On Boxing Day 1936, the writer arrives in Barcelona and joins up with the Poum, a revolutionary socialist party. Orwell goes to the Zaragoza front to fight and will subsequently write the classic war memoir <strong><em>Homage to Catalonia</em></strong> about his experiences. In May 1937, as tensions mount between communist, socialist and anarchist forces behind the Republican lines, Orwell becomes involved in street battles in Barcelona. His experiences will inform his indictment of Stalinism in the book <strong><em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em></strong>.</p> <p>GUERNICA<br />Bombed in April 1937, the fate of the ancient Basque town of Guernica was to become a symbol of the devastation caused by war. Raids by aircraft from Nazi Germany and fascist Italy constituted one of the first systematic aerial bombing campaigns to be conducted against civilians. In January that year, the Republican government had commissioned Pablo Picasso to create a mural for the World\u2019s Fair. After the bombings, that mural became the one depicting the horror and suffering of the town. The artwork remains the most famous ever produced on the subject of war. Hundreds of thousands of civilians died during the civil war as a result of bombings and executions. There is now a museum dedicated to peace in Guernica.</p> <p>BATTLE FOR MADRID<br />The Spanish capital endured what amounted to a two-and-a-half-year siege during the civil war. After invading from the south in the summer of 1936, Franco\u2019s forces, assisted by German and Italian air power, came close to taking Madrid towards the end of the year. A heroic resistance saw the Nationalist forces beaten back. But the government eventually decamped first to Valencia, then to Barcelona. By the winter of 1938 Madrid was freezing, starving, and more or less out of arms and ammunition.</p> <p>On 26 March 1939 Franco ordered his troops to advance on Madrid after fighting there between Republican factions. Two days later the city had fallen. Thousands of its defenders were executed.</p> <p>EXILE<br />For hundreds of thousands of Spaniards, Franco\u2019s victory meant exile. As the Nationalist forces advanced through Catalonia, a steady flow of refugees headed to France. In the winter of 1939 more than 450,000 are estimated to have crossed the border. Some Republicans went on to fight for the French Resistance against the Nazis. The refugees hoped to be welcomed by the French, but they were treated with suspicion and hostility.</p> <p>THE DICTATORSHIP<br />From the end of the civil war in 1939 to his death in 1975, Franco ruled Spain. His regime, particularly in the early years, was cruel, repressive and vengeful towards the defeated enemy. Near Madrid a huge monument to the Nationalist dead, the Valley of the Fallen, was erected. Meanwhile the executions of Republican sympathisers continued well into the 1950s, and thousands languished in prison for years.</p>",

They take two to three months to completely disappear in the ocean, and it takes a similar amount of time to compost if left on the beach, although this varies slightly depending on soil, composition, humidity and temperature.</p> <p>While alternatives to traditional plastic rings exist \u2013 PakTech\u2019s recycled plastic <a href=\"http://www.paktech-opi.com/en/handle/can%20carrier\" rel=\"nofollow\">can carrier</a>, which is 100% recyclable, and Fishbone\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.fishbonepackaging.co/\" rel=\"nofollow\">cardboard holder</a>, for example\u2013 these don\u2019t reduce the risk of entangling wildlife or being ingested. </p> <p>Saltwater Brewery decided to collaborate with advertising agency <a href=\"http://www.webelievers.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">We Believers</a> to engineer an alternative.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Saltwater Brewery edible six pack.\">  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-YG9gUJMGyw\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </figure>  <p>\u201cOur main challenge was figuring out what material would be sustainable and sturdy enough to hold a six pack of beer,\u201d says Marco Vega, co-founder of We Believers. \u201cInitially we wanted to make the rings from seaweed, but it\u2019s too fragile and rigid to use once taken from the ocean.\u201d</p> <p>The first batch of 500 edible six pack rings was produced using 3D-printed plastic moulds. As these aren\u2019t suitable for mass manufacturing, Saltwater is developing metal moulds capable of churning out 400,000 ring units per month.</p> <p>\u201cWe estimate the initial mass-produced batch will cost around 25 cents [17p] per unit\u2013 about 10 cents more thanover the recyclable plastic six-pack rings Saltwater is [currently] using,\u201d says Vega. He believes consumers will be willing to pay more for the alternative, but expects costs to quickly drop. \u201cIf most craft brewers and big beer companies implement this technology, the manufacturing cost will drop and be very competitive.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"4ee436f4362545a481cb3a76381ef67ffa7f2190\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ee436f4362545a481cb3a76381ef67ffa7f2190/86_0_1146_688/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Saltwater Brewery edible six ring pack.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The edible six-pack rings.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Saltwater Brewery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More than 50 craft breweries have already contacted Saltwater expressing an interest in using edible ring packaging.

While small, venue-based jazz and poetry festivals have been around since the 1970s and even earlier \u2013 the <a href=\"http://www.eif.co.uk\" title=\"\">Edinburgh Festival</a> was founded in 1947 to \u201cprovide a platform for the flowering of the human spirit\u201d in the aftermath of the second world war \u2013 the new festival has to offer far more than a few headline acts. \u201cAudience experience is the trend we\u2019re seeing,\u201d said Reed. \u201cLast year more than half of festival-goers said they\u2019d gone for the whole experience, so the numbers of people who turn up just to see a headline band is dropping away.\u201d</p> <p>The AIF\u2019s 2015 audience survey asked: \u201cWhen buying a ticket for a festival, what is the single most important factor when deciding which one to attend?\u201d More than half of respondents cited \u201cthe general atmosphere and overall vibe, character and quality of the event\u201d; 7.7% replied \u201cheadline acts\u201d while 26% said their priority was \u201cthe music generally\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIncreasingly more festivals have found their niche, although I don\u2019t believe that every format has been done just yet,\u201d added Reed. \u201cA major newbie on the scene is a big one: the Bluedot festival in Cheshire, centred around the world\u2019s second largest telescope. It\u2019ll be all science and technology and astrophysics, as well as electronic music from Jean-Michel Jarre.\u201d Food and family entertainment are increasingly important, whatever the theme of the festival, says Reed. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough any more to say \u2018oh, there\u2019s a kids\u2019 tent and there\u2019s a juggler\u2019. You need more. People who went to a festival as teenagers want to take their own kids.\u201d Festivals also provide a vital showcase for emerging bands and an income for established artists struggling to survive financially in the industry\u2019s streaming era.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07f3532860a3c4e8625bf1f97568e71c9a06be08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07f3532860a3c4e8625bf1f97568e71c9a06be08/0_34_1000_600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Blue Dot festival\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of the newer events, the Blue Dot festival in Cheshire is centred around the world\u2019s second largest telescope.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: discoverthebluedot.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>UK Music\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.ukmusic.org/research/music-tourism-wish-you-were-here-2015/\" title=\"\">\u2018Wish you were here\u2019 </a>report in 2015 revealed that 9.5 million incoming \u201cmusic tourists\u201d to an area generated a spend of \u00a33.1bn. And research commissioned by Live Nation from Optimy concluded that a 5,000-capacity festival can generate approximately \u00a3800,000 in net gain to the local area and its supply chains, while a 110,000-capacity festival can generate \u00a318m for the local area \u2013 but grumbles remain that even the most eco-friendly of festivals can bring in traffic, rubbish, noise pollution and can upset some local residents who prefer their fields undisturbed by fun.</p> <p>But who needs a tent to be a festival-goer? Liz Vater is director of the Stoke Newington Literary Festival in north London. \u201cI\u2019d been to a few literary events in London, but they felt quite self-reverential and cliquey,\u201d she said. \u201cI realised that I could create something I\u2019d really love to go to, which was accessible, eclectic and fun. Stoke Newington\u2019s history as a place where dissenters, artists and writers gathered informs the programming.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve done events on the Angry Brigade who lived here, our feminist strand is in homage to Mary Wollstonecraft, who lived and taught here, we\u2019re introducing a Gothic strand inspired by Edgar Allan Poe, who studied here, and we\u2019re constantly trying to better reflect our multicultural community. Our outreach work is growing exponentially \u2013 this year we\u2019ll do author events for about 2,500 schoolkids and a mini-feminism festival for Hackney sixth-formers.</p> <p>\u201cResearch we\u2019ve carried out shows that for up to 70% of our visitors we\u2019re the first literary event they\u2019ve been to. Of all the feedback we get it\u2019s that the programme is so eclectic \u2013 David Mitchell to a <em>Game of Thrones</em> pub quiz, Thomas Keneally to an event up a tree. Making it work has been a mix of incredibly hard work and sheer bloody-mindedness. We\u2019re incredibly entrepreneurial and have become a real focal point for the community. We\u2019ve got a network of volunteers who\u2019ve been with us for years and genuinely feel like family.\u201d</p> <p>Vater faces constant pressure to grow, something Hilary Lawson recognises. As founder of Hay\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.globeathay.org/about-us/how-the-light-gets-in-2016/\" title=\"\">HowtheLightGetsIn festival</a> of philosophy and ideas which began its seventh year this weekend, he has expanded from one site to two.</p> <p>\u201cIt gets a bit bigger each year but that is incremental, it\u2019s important not to be too big. We have to be loyal to the initial idea and concept. I didn\u2019t set out to run a festival. We set out to have some open debates about the way we think about ideas and it turned out to be more popular than I ever imagined.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"829696589d98c0248aff9edbff838ded7e856e74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/829696589d98c0248aff9edbff838ded7e856e74/0_139_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"HowTheLightGetsIn festival at Hay-on-Wye\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Now in its seventh year, HowTheLightGetsIn is a philosophy and music festival based in Hay-on-Wye in Wales.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Morgan/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWe have a very mixed group \u2013 95% of our audience say they will come back and I think that\u2019s because of the whole experience. You can go to a public lecture in a lecture hall, and the place cements the authority of the person speaking. Here you can stand in the coffee queue next to a Nobel prize-winning scientist. We don\u2019t let people come here to sell a book. They have to come here with something to say.</p> <p>\u201cI remember going to Glastonbury one year and getting there and realising it isn\u2019t a band in a field \u2013 it\u2019s a whole town in a field. There\u2019s a tradition in that sense, which is why Britain has become such a centre for festivals. Atmosphere and experience. They\u2019re the keys.\u201d And never mind the weather.</p>",

      "body": "<p>A group of internationally respected historians and writers have called for the first major museum of the Spanish civil war to be created in Barcelona, 80 years after the century-defining conflict began in July 1936.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/09/spain-valley-of-the-fallen-general-franco-exhumations\">Spain to make first exhumations from civil war mausoleum</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In an unprecedented initiative likely to spark fierce debate in Spain, Dr Pelai Pag\u00e8s, professor of history at the University of Barcelona and president of the <a href=\"http://amigce.org/en/\" title=\"\">Association of the International Museum of the Spanish Civil War </a> (Amigce), has written to the city\u2019s leftwing mayor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/26/ada-colau-barcelona-most-radical-mayor-in-the-world\" title=\"\">Ada Colau</a>, asking that a building be set aside in central Barcelona to house the museum and a research centre. Pag\u00e8s told the <em>Observer</em>: \u201cEighty years after the start of the civil war, and 40 years after the death of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/francisco-franco\" title=\"\">General Franco</a>, recovering the memory of what happened for all generations, from the youngest to the oldest, means understanding the conflict in its totality. There is a sad old saying that a society that forgets its past is destined to repeat it. From this perspective, the International Museum of the Spanish Civil War intends to act as a guarantee for the\u00a0future.\u201d</p> <p>Barcelona was one of the key centres of resistance to Franco\u2019s Nationalist forces. In December 1936, George Orwell famously <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/05/second-world-war-spanish-orwell\" title=\"\">travelled to the city to fight</a> in defence of Spain\u2019s elected Republican government. He later wrote the classic war memoir <em>Homage to Catalonia</em> about his experiences and subsequently become a journalist for the <em>Observer</em>.</p> <p>Orwell\u2019s adopted son, Richard Blair, president of the Orwell Society, has lent his support to the museum project. He said: \u201cWe are wholly in favour of this and wish the project every success. Many young people in Spain have not been taught in depth about the civil war and don\u2019t really have an understanding of what happened from 1936-39 or of the dictatorship that followed.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t have a black hole. The time has come for the history to be looked at\u00a0again.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3b4f9ac0ab2d0e9bece61d897245a6d78d52f649\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3b4f9ac0ab2d0e9bece61d897245a6d78d52f649/0_325_4893_2935/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barcelona mayor Ada Colau\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barcelona mayor Ada Colau has been asked to set aside a building in the centre of the city.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sipa/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Other high-profile backers include, in Britain, the world-renowned historian of the civil war Paul Preston, who sits on Amigce\u2019s international board, and Irish writer Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn. \u201cIt is astonishing that no national or regional government has created a museum of the Spanish civil war. The present initiative is a major step to the understanding of the past that Spain so desperately needs,\u201d said Preston .</p> <p>Many relatives of International Brigaders \u2013 the foreigners who travelled from around the world to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/11/spain\" title=\"\">fight for the Spanish Republic</a> against Franco \u2013 have also written letters of support, which have been passed to Colau.</p> <p>The museum would be the first of its kind in Spain. The bitter legacy of the civil war, in which around 500,000 Spaniards died, led to a so-called \u201cpact of forgetting\u201d in the transition to democracy after the death of Franco in 1975. There are museums dotted around Spain which deal with particular battles and experiences during the war, but no institution has dared to attempt an overall narrative of the conflict, in which Nationalist forces, backed by Hitler\u2019s Germany and Mussolini\u2019s Italy, overthrew the Republic\u2019s democratic government elected in February 1936.</p> <p>Pag\u00e8s said that the museum would be balanced and objective, \u201crepresenting the democratic values incarnated in the Republic, while not failing to examine the errors committed on the Republican\u00a0side\u201d.</p> <p>Provisional plans for the museum include interactive exhibitions, a permanent display of artefacts, a study centre for students, and a cafe designed to replicate a canteen of the civil war era. It would be non-profit-making and self-funding, hoping to tap into Barcelona\u2019s thriving tourist industry as well as becoming a focus for school trips and\u00a0research.</p> <p>Support has also come in the form of a remarkable letter from the National Socialism Documentation Centre in Cologne, the largest regional memorial site in Germany for victims of the Nazis. The director of the centre, Dr Werner Jung, wrote: \u201cGermany needed more than 30 years following the end of the second world war to openly confront through monuments and museums the crimes of the Nazis \u2026 In Spain more than 30 years have passed since the death of Franco and the phase of transition.</p> <p>\u201cUnfortunately, 80 years after the military coup of 17 July 1936, there is still no central place where comprehensive and objective information can be obtained about the Spanish civil war. Given that the civil war is still a live subject of debate in Spanish society, a museum would be an important place of study and learning.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/springsteen\">Bruce Springsteen</a> has his eyes screwed shut. His fists, bound in wristbands, are clenched. Veins are popping in his temples, but not from the happy exertion of a song such as Glory Days, or the even more cardiovascular Born to Run, both of which light up the tail end of tonight\u2019s set. He is stock-still, singing almost privately as much as to the 55,000 fans enduring the unrelenting Mancunian drizzle on a cold May evening.</p> <p>This is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5DhmiKVth0\">The River</a>, the title track of his 1980 double album \u2013 his first US No 1, ushering in a decade of superstardom \u2013 and it is one of Springsteen\u2019s finer songs, bearing witness to ordinary people\u2019s travails. Young love goes wrong, foundering on the rocks of responsibility and hardening times. Dreams are remembered with yearning, as a man surveys the dried-up river where love and youth first flourished.</p> <p>An extra frisson comes from the biographical roots of the song, in Springsteen\u2019s own sister\u2019s marriage. In falsetto, Springsteen croons a long, ghostly \u201cooh\u201d-ed lament, taken up at the end by his harmonica. The E Street Band, eight-strong tonight, shorn of the choirs and horns of more recent tours, are dialled down, as twinkly as they can be in the debased sonics of a stadium.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A man with a squeegee wipes moisture off the platforms at the lip of the crowd so Bruce can commune with his people</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The next song is even more bleak. On the piano-led but angry <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhtKQgk79yE\">Point Blank</a>, Springsteen watches as a girl falls into a squalid trap of a life, beyond the help of his narrator. The forces of perdition have got his love right where they want her: \u201cBang, bang, you\u2019re dead.\u201d</p> <p>These two songs remain hard to listen to, never mind hard to play in a stadium, where the dynamics are more suited to blowing off steam after work than having your nose rubbed in life\u2019s vicissitudes. They form the hard emotional core of a three-hour set where lighter forces do come out to play and Jake Clemons\u2019s bright sax solos are mustered as another defence against the elements. A man with a Manchester City blue squeegee wipes moisture off the little platforms at the lip of the crowd so that Springsteen \u2013 often followed by guitar foil Steven Van Zandt, Clemons, guitarist Nils Lofgren and fiddling fourth guitarist Soozie Tyrell \u2013 can come down and commune with his people.</p> <p><em>The River</em> was a pivotal album that kept expanding, to accommodate, <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bruce-springsteen-the-river-new-tour_us_56aa49cbe4b05e4e370386c1\">as Springsteen has noted</a>, \u201cfun, dancing, laughter, jokes, politics, good comradeship, love, faith, lonely nights and, of course, tears\u201d. It was released as a double; still, reams of songs were abandoned. Significantly, this was where the young turk turned his attention to \u201cthe ties that bind\u201d, examining lasting love, duress and community \u2013 all the things that the live-fast-die-young, treat \u2019em mean types that populate the genre usually run from.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"47e784ceb9496addcc1d0a8fa6d184b1c9c8c94b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47e784ceb9496addcc1d0a8fa6d184b1c9c8c94b/0_0_4688_2813/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u201cAre the Manchesterians with me?\u201d\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u201cAre the Manchesterians with me?\u201d</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jon Super/Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Last year, <em>The Ties That Bind: The River Collection</em> box set finally compiled many of these cold store <em>River</em>-era songs. With a <a href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/how-bruce-springsteen-got-back-to-the-river-20160201\">solo album in the can</a>, and an <a href=\"http://brucespringsteen.net/news/2016/springsteens-autobiography\">autobiography </a>ready to roll (due in September), Springsteen agreed to a few low-key dates to promote the box \u2013 laughably, given the sizable merry-go-round this tour has become.</p> <p>The set list has loosened over time, with <em>River</em>-era songs fleshed out by the catalogue, so that no fan could ever go home feeling cheated of the Springsteen they most love: the rabble-rousing bard, the troubled lover, the ordinary guy. Tonight\u2019s set features 32 long songs performed lustily, with the bonhomie that comes as standard when the E Street Band roll in.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The encore is, as ever, designed to send the crowd home a little higher on oxytocin than they arrived</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Things can get corny. A man dressed as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lrkI254iEaU\">Father Christmas</a> waggles a placard and is ushered on stage as the band launch effortlessly into Santa Claus Is Coming to Town. On the US leg, cover versions have marked the passing of David Bowie, <a href=\"http://eagles.com/splash\">Glenn Frey</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XavU8vH1ZLg\">Prince</a>, but a dearth of rock star deaths means we get the set staple Twist and Shout. Crowd requests are accommodated with gusto. Among others, we get <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7xQ480j9CY\">Darkness on the Edge of Town</a>, another vein-popper.</p> <p>Tonight, there are two Courteney Coxes \u2013 the actress first spotted on screen dancing with the Boss in the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=129kuDCQtHs\">video</a> for Dancing in the Dark. One is a school-age placard bearer called Issy, delivered up to sing along on the never more appropriate Waiting on a Sunny Day. For Dancing in the Dark itself, a woman dressed like one of Bananarama circa 1983 places her necklace around Springsteen\u2019s neck. For those paying close attention, <em>The River</em>\u2019s deep cuts are satisfying; a mix of strutting bravado (Out in the Street) and romance. I Wanna Marry You is, says Springsteen, \u201ca daydream of a love song\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=129kuDCQtHs\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/129kuDCQtHs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Courteney Cox in Springsteen\u2019s video for Dancing in the Dark.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Adele recently dubbed Springsteen \u201ca gentleman\u201d <a href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/7384818/adele-bruce-springsteen-coat-lisbon\">for lending her his jacket</a> at his recent gig in Lisbon. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LM7_f88oiPk\">I Wanna Marry You</a> finds his gallant protagonist in love with a girl already pushing a buggy, marvelling at how hard her life must be, undeterred in his affections. Springsteen bears witness, with maracas, then he uplifts. The encore is, as ever, designed to send the crowd home a little higher on oxytocin than they arrived. \u201cAre the Manchesterians with me?\u201d hollers Springsteen at the climax. Even as he shouts it, he is grinning, pretty sure it\u2019s a malaprop.</p> <p>He does come back at the very, very end for a solo version of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6SxF6K6mcI\">This Hard Land</a>. It resonates with me, given the tents erected by the homeless opposite the hotel where later I am fortunate enough to sleep.</p>",

      "body": "<p>What a haunting, unusual thing <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/writersroom/writers-lab/be-inspired/hattie-naylor\">Hattie Naylor</a> has made in her adaptation of <a href=\"https://www.royalexchange.co.uk/whats-on-and-tickets/the-night-watch\"><em>The Night Watch</em></a>. Sarah Waters\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jan/08/fiction.sarahwaters\">2006 novel</a> is so confident, large-scale and apparently unselfconscious that it is easy to forget how subtle it is. And how delicately layered. It winds backwards in time, beginning in 1947, ending in 1941. Its love affairs come bathed in the after-knowledge of sadness. Its evocation of London during the second world war is as pungent as that of the great novelist chronicler, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2016/apr/08/how-patrick-hamilton-hit-bullseye-the-archers\">Patrick Hamilton</a>, who had actually been there. It has a Hamiltonian atmosphere of diffused secrecy and strangeness. Fear is allied to excitement. The great horror of war also brings opportunity: new jobs for women, new chances for different liaisons.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"0113febdb2f7ab9b50e05b88d58696e891e576b9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0113febdb2f7ab9b50e05b88d58696e891e576b9/0_0_768_1152/667.jpg\" alt=\"Thalissa Teixeira, left, and Kelly Hotten in The Night Watch.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Spot-on\u2019: Thalissa Teixeira, left, and Kelly Hotten in The Night Watch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Davenport</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It would be so easy to flatten this in adaptation. A generous wish to include as much as possible might tempt a writer to make it bristle with period detail: fattening it up with a busy design, larding the dialogue with knowing references to spam and dried eggs, ramming home the themes found in its individual stories. Here are the experiences of a conscientious objector, a woman obliged to have a backstreet abortion, same-sex couples forced to hide their love.</p> <p>Naylor avoids the trap. She gives only slivers of the prose in the dialogue, relying on <a href=\"http://www.jtmanagement.co.uk/clients/rebecca-gatward/\">Rebecca Gatward</a>\u2019s first-rate direction and a wonderful cast to embody the rest. So many tiny details \u2013 the way, for example, that a cat moves \u2013 which might be thought untransferable from the page are here. But in a different form, skipping from prose into gesture.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.georgialowe.co.uk/\">Georgia Lowe</a>\u2019s slowly revolving design makes a virtue of being in the round. These lives are not followed in a straightforward linear fashion. And they are not seen like that either. The stage is bare, dark, with a metal grid embedded in the floor. Perfect for the prison in which the action is partly set, suitable for scuffling through town in the blackout. The palette is absolutely right. Subdued blues and greys. And occasionally a splash of red. Racy, high-buttoned red trousers. A smart check duster coat. Blood.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.eamonnbedford.com/jodiemcnee/\">Jodie McNee</a> \u2013 man\u2019s suit, man\u2019s hair, cigarette behind her ear \u2013 is bereft, though apparently Artful Dodger tough. <a href=\"http://www.kellyhotten.com/\">Kelly Hotten</a> jangles perfectly as one of her lovers. <a href=\"http://www.rwcmd.ac.uk/profiles/acting/2014/details/thalissa_teixeira.aspx\">Thalissa Teixeira</a> is spot-on as the exploited beauty: she never for a minute seems to patronise her character. I haven\u2019t seen nearly enough of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7yQVk2k658\">Lucy Briggs-Owen</a> on the stage since, eight years ago, she first riveted me as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/jun/01/theatre\">Cressida</a>. Here she is wonderfully ambiguous. A posh girl dripping sexual allure. She seems utterly in command, yet shows you in one unforgettable moment how emotionally excavated she is. All manage to deliver their 40s phrasing nonchalantly, without sounding arch. Just the ticket.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.royalexchange.co.uk/\">\u2022 The Night Watch is at the Royal Exchange, Manchester until 18 June</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>This delightful French-Belgian co-production is one of the more engaging family films on offer over the half-term break. An appealing blend of a live action backdrop, filmed in the spectacular Ecrins national park in south-east France, and a cast of animated bugs and beasties is combined with inventive sound design to tell a story entirely without words. A plucky young ladybird joins forces with a band of ants to appropriate a box of sugarcubes left at an abandoned picnic. But an army of rival red ants have set their sights on the bounty and lay siege to the ant hill. An orchestral score that evokes the early work of Danny Elfman is integral to the storytelling. The gentle humour comes from deft physical comedy and the playful use of sound, a similar approach to that of the first 30 minutes of Pixar\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/jul/20/animation.conservation\" title=\"\"><em>Wall-E</em></a>. With very little peril, this is suitable for very young children but will charm all ages.</p>",

Benelli Mosell, once mentored by Stockhausen, plays his Klavierstuck XII, drawn from <em>Donnerstag aus Licht</em>, with considerable aplomb (complete with the required shouts, clicks and whistles), but it\u2019s her performance of Scriabin\u2019s 24 Preludes Op. 11 that stands out.

      "body": "<p>By far the most powerful episode in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/tahmimaanam\" title=\"\">Tahmima Anam</a>\u2019s new novel first appeared in the April 2013 issue of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/granta\" title=\"\"><em>Granta</em></a>, which showcased the magazine\u2019s once-a-decade roll call of Britain\u2019s best young novelists. In <a href=\"http://granta.com/anwar-gets-everything/\" title=\"\">Anwar Gets Everything</a> \u2013 a nerve-shredding excerpt from <a href=\"http://www.canongate.tv/shop/genre/fiction/the-bones-of-grace-hardback.html\" title=\"\"><em>The Bones of Grace</em></a> \u2013 a Bengali labourer is ordered to wash the windows of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/10/dubai-plans-skyscraper-taller-than-burj-khalifa\" title=\"\">Dubai</a> high-rise without proper safety precautions. Anyone who extrapolated from this a protest novel about the blood behind Emirati bling might be surprised. Anwar\u2019s story turns out to be only one element buried deep within a wider-roaming saga of star-crossed Ivy League academics.</p> <p>Most of the novel is narrated by Zubaida, a marine palaeontologist from Dhaka, whose fieldwork (in Pakistan, where she\u2019s hunting an ancient whale skeleton) gets caught in the crossfire of sectarian violence. During her graduate study at Harvard, she falls for blue-eyed Elijah, a\u00a0philosopher who hopes that she\u2019ll break off her engagement back home. But \u201chome\u201d is moot anyway: Zubaida is haunted by the knowledge that, as a baby, she was adopted, and that her biological parents left no trace of\u00a0themselves.</p> <p>Zubaida addresses an imaginary Elijah, recounting how they met and her turmoil on returning to Bangladesh. How the novel\u2019s disparate strands come together is a perpetual tease. On page 125 there\u2019s a tip-off: Anwar is \u201ccarrying his secret, which is also my secret\u201d. But 50 pages later, we\u2019re hardly wiser: \u201cDon\u2019t blame me for parsing out the story slowly, Elijah. These things take time.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/13/tahmima-anam-i-have-complicated-relationship-with-bangladesh-interview\">Tahmima Anam: \u2018I have a complicated relationship with Bangladesh\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>While the characters need no convincing of their feelings for each other, we do, and the book\u2019s structure makes this tricky: Zubaida has to write for us as well as for Elijah. Their coded correspondence once she returns to Bangladesh, in text messages consisting only of song titles \u2013 off-the-peg emotion \u2013 feels like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/13/tahmima-anam-i-have-complicated-relationship-with-bangladesh-interview\" title=\"\">Anam</a>\u2019s workaround as much as theirs. Zubaida\u2019s heritage, or the lack of it, does a lot of heavy lifting: \u201cI was a person whose life began with her own life, and not, like you, with a family tree that stretched back generations \u2026 What would you do with this messy history, Elijah? Your chamomile-scented home, your overfed cat, lemonade in the refrigerator, and that family tree, so august, no mystery blood, no revolutions\u2026\u201d</p> <p>Almost all the book unfolds in this tone, wounded and puffed-up. Zubaida implies that her fiance might understand her better by reading Tolstoy, which \u2013 like that whale hunt \u2013 suggests the lofty company Anam wants to keep.</p> <p>Yet there are hints that she\u2019s not wholly happy with how this (at times superlative) novel knits together. With the plot speeding up, someone says \u201cit\u2019s too much randomness\u201d, and even Zubaida calls her story \u201cnonsensical\u201d. It isn\u2019t, but when she says Anwar\u2019s world \u201cmade everything else shrink \u2013 my little quest to find my origins, even the wound of your absence\u201d, it all but pops the ballo\u200bo\u200bn she\u2019s spent 350 pages blowing up.</p> <p><em>The Bones of Grace is published by Canongate (\u00a314.99). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/397018/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a311.99</em></a></p>",

It\u2019s rather like experiencing<em> The Wizard of Oz, Pollyanna </em>and Powell and Pressburger\u2019s war-themed films, all rolled into one \u2013 triumph over adversity, hard work rewarded, generosity repaid, the transformational power of art and self-belief, affirmation that loving relationships are the stuff of happiness.</p> <p>Richard Taylor and Rachel Wagstaff\u2019s adaptation reshapes Paul Gallico\u2019s 1958 novel <em>Mrs \u2019Arris Goes to Paris</em>, about a London charlady, Ada Harris, whose postwar, make-do-and-mend, ration-restricted understanding of the world is transformed by the sight of a client\u2019s Christian Dior dress. \u201cIt\u2019s a work of art... something not real, made to make you feel,\u201d she declares, sinking to her knees in almost religious ecstasy (the gorgeousness of the \u201ciridescent organza\u201d gown slyly suggested by the shimmering cone of a spotlight). \u201cI have to have one!\u201d This is a dangerous key moment \u2013 a silk thread\u2019s width from bathetic ridiculousness. Writing and setting, seamlessly crafted under director Daniel Evans, make it convincing.

No big numbers but plenty of emotional heft, under Tom Brady\u2019s musical direction. Lez Brotherston\u2019s minimal set makes maximum impact \u2013 skyline cutouts silhouette Battersea power station, the Eiffel Tower; Ada\u2019s home a huddled-together dresser and table, kettle boiling on a tiny stove; Dior\u2019s salon, a sweeping staircase in an immensity of space. Lighting by Mark Henderson brings the air to sparkling, multi-textured life.</p> <p>The writers niftily twin Ada\u2019s London clients with obverse characters in the world of Paris couture (although overall the construction would benefit from a few nips and tucks). Roles are doubled so effectively that the cast seems twice its actual size. Unfair, as ever, to single out a few: Anna-Jane Casey (fellow char and fractious best friend); Laura Pitt-Pulford (wannabe actress/ top model); Rebecca Caine (English lady/ put-upon couturier); Louis Maskell (longing lover on both sides of the Channel). Not at all unfair, however, to say that the glittering centrepiece around which the whole production revolves is Ada. Burt\u2019s multi-stranded interpretation of the role is to acting as Dior is to haute couture: impeccable.</p> <p>This is Daniel Evans\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/dec/02/daniel-evans-great-creative-choice-chichester-festival-theatre-artistic-director-sheffield\">final production for Sheffield</a> after seven years as artistic director.

      "body": "<p>The narrative issue is one of the most pressing in dance today. Very few choreographers know how to tell a story; incoherence has become the rule, rather than the exception. In his enthralling new production of <a href=\"http://www.oldvictheatre.com/whats-on/2016/jh/?gclid=CK_qrZvA9cwCFUko0wodRAMF_w\"><em>Jekyll &amp; Hyde</em></a>, the Olivier award-winning director and choreographer <a href=\"http://www.themconiecompany.com/our-company/\">Drew McOnie</a> shows us how it should be done. There is no synopsis in the programme, and no word spoken on stage, but from the moment the curtain rises we are led, with algorithmic precision, along an ever-darkening path. The process, and the final maelstrom of violence, have the ineluctable quality of nightmare.</p> <p><a href=\"http://robert-louis-stevenson.org/\">Robert Louis Stevenson</a>\u2019s novella, 130 years old this year, is an inspired source for dance theatre. McOnie has updated its Victorian setting to the rackety demimonde of 50s London. In a nod to Stevenson\u2019s borrowing of the name from the family of the horticulturalist <a href=\"http://gertrudejekyll.co.uk/\">Gertrude Jekyll</a>, McOnie\u2019s protagonist is no longer a laboratory scientist but a botanist. Daniel Collins\u2019s Jekyll embodies a multiplicity of contradictions. On the surface, he\u2019s a decent, awkward 50s chap, who can\u2019t quite bring himself to express his adoration for Rachel Muldoon\u2019s winsome Dahlia, while in private he\u2019s the snake-hipped hero of his erotic fantasies. Tim Hodges\u2019s Hyde, meanwhile, is all brutal swagger, with a greasy Bill Haley-style forelock and the vicious, pretty-boy sneer of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/richard-attenborough\">Richard Attenborough</a>\u2019s Pinkie in <em>Brighton Rock</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a416f3d24a4cb6351edd83fe1d0cded56910c74d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a416f3d24a4cb6351edd83fe1d0cded56910c74d/0_560_5004_3003/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Daniel Collins (Jekyll) and Jason Winter (Charlie), centre, in Jekyll and Hyde.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Daniel Collins (Jekyll) and Jason Winter (Charlie), centre, in Jekyll and Hyde.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While faithful to the notion of human nature\u2019s duality, the idea that good and evil are in perpetual conflict within us, McOnie is equally interested by the forces shaping cultural eras. His plot is propelled by a wonderfully crafted score by <a href=\"http://www.grantolding.co.uk/\">Grant Olding</a>, who presents a musical landscape in which the reassuring blitz-spirit certainties of orchestral swing are being challenged by the rawer, sexier attack of rock\u2019n\u2019roll. As the repressed Jekyll is overcome by the rapacious Hyde, so the suit and tie gentility of the postwar years is swept away by its darker undercurrents, and by the Pandora\u2019s box allure of an uninhibited future. Olding references this future with rock riffs that project the slaughter of the final scenes far beyond the piece\u2019s 1950s context. As Jekyll and Hyde become one, and the body count rises, we are reminded that there\u2019s a spectre at every sexually liberated feast. A Charles Manson, waiting in the shadows.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/may/22/drew-mconie-choreographer-jekyll-and-hyde-old-vic-interview\">Drew McOnie: \u2018It\u2019s not a technical process, it\u2019s instinctual\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To copper-bottomed storytelling and thematic resonance add terrific dancing. The wiry, steel-sprung Collins is astonishing. He can cringe like <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/norman-wisdom\">Norman Wisdom</a>, all ratty self-effacement, and then morph in the course of a semiquaver into matinee-idol suavity. Muldoon is a strong foil, counterpointing a gentle romanticism with sudden, lush deployments of leg and torso. The ensemble dancers are tireless, their facial expressions providing an oblique \u2013 and in the case of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1ZOJqx4xQA\">Anabel Kutay</a>, hilariously arch \u2013 commentary on the action. That McOnie and company achieve such resounding results with such economy of means should serve as an object lesson to major players in the subsidised dance sector. No amount of lavish production cuts any ice if you can\u2019t tell a story.</p>",

An hour of it also comes on DVD, showing how this tiny figure could dominate a concert stage by the sheer intensity of his playing.

      "body": "<p>The purpose of any interview is to find the best person for the job. But with candidates\u2019 nerves jangling and the recruitment crisis causing increased pressure, it can be hard to make sure the right appointment is made.</p> <p>So we\u2019ve spoken to a range of headteachers and deputies from across the UK to find their top tips on how to be a good interviewer. Here are some insider tips:</p> <h2>Set the questions</h2> <p>Selecting the right questions ahead of interviews is key, according to Andy Smith, headteacher of <a href=\"http://www.carluke-highschool.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Carluke high school</a> in South Lanarkshire. \u201cYou need to develop a clear picture of the behaviours, knowledge and skills you would expect the successful candidate to have, and tailor the questions to ensure that you draw these out,\u201d he says.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/may/23/five-ways-nail-final-term-trainee-teacher\">Five ways to nail your final term as a trainee teacher</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThey should be clear, concise and open.\u201d For example: \u201cPlease describe how you have improved learning and teaching in your current post and tell us how you know you have been successful.\u201d</p> <p>The headteacher might select the questions alone or in consultation with other panel members. For some promoted posts, the questions may be decided upon by a <a href=\"https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=anecAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA1007&amp;ots=TZixasmNCN&amp;dq=leet%3B%20plural%20noun%3A%20leets%20a%20list%20of%20candidates%20selected%20for%20a%20post.&amp;pg=PA1007#v=onepage&amp;q=leet;%20plural%20noun:%20leets%20a%20list%20of%20candidates%20selected%20for%20a%20post.&amp;f=false\" rel=\"nofollow\">leeting</a> panel, while some local authorities have standard question banks.</p> <p>Decide which panel member will be asking each question and take time to discuss what a model answer might be. You could write down the key points you\u2019re looking for, or ask particular panel members to take careful notes relating to particular questions (to avoid everyone scribbling furiously at the same time). And make sure you talk about what will happen if the panel can\u2019t reach agreement.</p> <p>Peter Kent, headteacher of <a href=\"http://www.lawrencesheriffschool.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Lawrence Sheriff school</a> in Rugby, says: \u201cThe interview should be an extended conversation that helps you get to know the person. Tricky questions can often achieve little if they merely put the interviewee on edge.\u201d</p> <h2>Get set up</h2> <p>It\u2019s important to adopt a tone that is both professional and relaxed. Have water and tissues to hand, make sure phones are switched off, hang a Do Not Disturb sign on the door, and arrange the seating so that is not too close to heaters.</p> <p>\u201cSit around a table, keep the panel small and avoid a sense of rushing,\u201d says Kent.</p> <p>Carefully consider where you hold the interview too. \u201cI was once interviewed in a room with a corrugated roof,\u201d Smith says. \u201cHail stones started and the interview turned into a shouting match.\u201d</p> <h2>The questioning</h2> <p>You might want to consider how the interview questions could be rephrased in advance as candidates are allowed to ask for this.</p> <p>It\u2019s also a good idea to give the candidate an idea of the running order from the outset, and that there will be a set bank of questions for each candidate, to make them feel comfortable. Lee Card, deputy headteacher at <a href=\"http://www.cherryorchard-pri.worcs.sch.uk/Cherry_Orchard_Primary_School.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cherry Orchard primary school</a> in Worcester, adds: \u201c[Make clear] that individual responses may elicit further follow-up questions and discussions. This assures candidates that you are not drilling away at a response because it wasn\u2019t a good one.\u201d</p> <p>You can also ease candidates in before getting to more technical questions. Sharon McLellan, headteacher of <a href=\"http://www.dumgal.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=4273\" rel=\"nofollow\">Laurieknowe primary school</a> in Dumfries, says it is good to start with a settling in style question. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/may/22/recruitment-lessons-japan-australia-teachers-rural-schools\">Recruitment lessons: how Japan and Australia attract teachers into rural schools</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Robin Bevan, headteacher at <a href=\"http://www.shsb.org.uk/page/default.asp?title=Home&amp;pid=1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Southend high school for boys</a> in Essex and the <a href=\"https://www.atl.org.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Association of Teachers and Lecturers (ATL)</a> national leadership representative, recommends using questions that don\u2019t have an obvious answer. For example: \u201cHow would you handle a pupil who is refusing to comply with your instructions?\u201d could lend itself to a textbook response. You could re-phrase this to: \u201cCan you give me an example of a time when a pupil refused to comply with your instructions? What did you do and what effect did it have?\u201d As a follow-up: \u201cIf you encountered the same situation again, is there anything you would do differently?\u201d</p> <p>Bevan is also a fan of questions that give a flavour of the individual, such as: \u201cWhat do you do to relax?\u201d, and those that require the candidate to talk at some length, such as: \u201cCan you tell me about your favourite bit of chemistry?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf they come across as unenthused on their favourite topic, then I don\u2019t want anything to do with them,\u201d he says.</p> <h2>Keep to time</h2> <p>You might be spending a full day interviewing, with lunch and coffee breaks scheduled in, so it\u2019s important that candidates aren\u2019t allowed to go beyond their allocated time. \u201cSetting out expectations at the start of the interview will help,\u201d says Smith.</p> <h2>Feedback</h2> <p>It\u2019s easy to fall into a trap of positively encouraging candidates. But Smith cautions against this: \u201cDon\u2019t give praise after responses. A polite \u2018thank you\u2019 is sufficient. You don\u2019t want unsuccessful candidates who have been told their answers were \u2018fantastic\u2019 or \u2018brilliant\u2019. This makes feedback very difficult.\u201d</p> <p>At the end of the interview, Alan Crawford, assistant principal of <a href=\"http://thelearningbank.co.uk/shireland/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shireland Collegiate Academy</a> in Birmingham, says it is important to be clear with candidates about when they will hear the panel\u2019s final decision. You should also devote enough time to give feedback to unsuccessful candidates.</p> <h2>Involve students</h2> <p>Rather than relying on the interview alone, it\u2019s good to use a number of methods to help you identify the best candidate, such as giving the pupil council an opportunity to meet the potential new recruits.</p> <p>And it is highly likely that you will want to see the candidates teach. As Ralph Surman, deputy head of <a href=\"http://www.cantrell.nottingham.sch.uk/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cantrell primary school</a> in Nottingham, says: \u201cThey are not going to know the children, but that doesn\u2019t matter. I am looking to see if they would fit into the context of the school. Would they be the right kind of person to teach the kind of pupils that we have?\u201d</p> <p>You might also want to include a written task for secondary teachers based on the academic content of their subject, for example a question from a recent A-level paper.</p> <p>Offer candidates a tour of the school, but be sure to show them round individually. \u201cOtherwise,\u201d says Bevan, \u201cyou get a fairly horrible piece of behaviour emerging \u2013 the competitive question asking.\u201d</p> <h2>Trust your instincts</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2013/oct/22/teacher-professional-development-school-advice\">10 professional development ideas for teachers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s important to remember that interviewing is a dynamic process, and the person who looks strongest on paper might not turn out to be the best on the day. As Kent says: \u201cWe need process and rigour, but my experience is that instinct is often a key indicator in finding the right person.\u201d</p> <p>It also helps to be prepared for the unexpected, according to McLellan. \u201cI once interviewed with a colleague and one of the candidates had a complete meltdown and was inconsolable,\u201d she says. \u201cAnother time, I had to stop an interview when it became clear that the candidate hadn\u2019t the first clue what we were asking. He had been away from teaching for several years \u2013 a fact he omitted from his fabulous, well-written application form.</p> <p>\u201cAs for the taciturn candidate who stated, straight-faced, \u2018I am very enthusiastic\u2019\u2026 Let\u2019s just say my colleague and I had to suppress our sudden, surprisingly synchronised, coughing fits.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Follow us on Twitter via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianTeach\" rel=\"nofollow\">@GuardianTeach</a>.

      "body": "<p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/14/paris-attacks-parisians-take-to-bloodied-streets-in-cautious-defiance\">days and weeks after the Paris attacks last November</a> were especially harrowing and strange for those who lived in the city. Mostly people just wanted to get back to feeling normal again as quickly as they could, but this was impossible. Everywhere you went you saw something that reminded you of what had just happened \u2013 armed soldiers on the M\u00e9tro, barbed wire at tourist sights and other public places. Everybody was tense, angry or depressed, often all at the same time: it was like living in a city on the edge of a collective nervous breakdown. Strangely, however, one of the few cheering moments during this raw time was the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/17/wembley-football-england-france-fans-display-solidarity\">friendly football match between France and England</a> played at Wembley stadium on 17 November \u2013 a mere four days after the slaughter.</p> <p>That the match was played at all was a brave and reassuring gesture. Most importantly, the prelude to the game was organised as a symbolic show of solidarity with France. The slogan <em>Libert\u00e9, Egalit\u00e9, Fraternit\u00e9</em> was emblazoned on the heights of the stadium. The terraces were decked out in the red, white and blue of the French flag. In a pre-match tribute to the victim of the attacks, English and French players stood together to observe a perfectly sustained minute of silence. Most incredibly, and movingly, the whole crowd, including English fans who had never handled a French irregular verb in their lives, roared out the Marseillaise at full throttle.</p> <p>I watched all of this on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sco0vldkopw\">French television in Paris</a>. The commentator was Christian Jeanpierre, a veteran of the French football scene who had been broadcasting at the match in the Stade de France where the terror attacks had begun on 13 November. As the French and English players stood with their arms around one another, Jeanpierre thanked the Wembley crowd for \u201cknowing what really counts\u201d. His voice then began to tremble and crack. His emotion was shared by French football supporters in Paris and across France. It was irrelevant that France went on to lose the match 2-0. This was the greatest outpouring of love and support for French football since they won the World Cup for the first time in Paris on 12 July 1998.</p> <p>That night, against most expectations, the French beat Brazil 3-0. In a dazzling display of firepower, two of the goals were headed home before half-time by their talisman, Zinedine Zidane. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/zinedine-zidane\">Zidane</a> became an immediate hero; in the hours after the match, his image, along with the rest of the team, appeared on massive screens over the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es. The giddily euphoric crowds chanted his name.</p> <p>Only a few years earlier this would have been unthinkable. Zidane has his family origins in Algeria, a country which in the 1950s and 1960s had fought and won a war against its French rulers. The war was marked by systematic brutality on both sides and Algerian immigrants to France had long lived in the shadow of this conflict. Now it seemed, the Algerian war was finally over. French and Algerian flags were brandished together. The TV news described the celebration of the crowds as the greatest street party in the city since the liberation of Paris at the end of the second world war.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ac1fc37179b5f9586c02ad9941d86dd0ce086582\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac1fc37179b5f9586c02ad9941d86dd0ce086582/0_1063_4842_1637/1000.jpg\" alt=\"England and France stand together before the friendly at Wembley played shortly after the Paris terrorist attacks last year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"338\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">England and France stand together before the friendly at Wembley played shortly after the Paris terrorist attacks last year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Lewis/The FA via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This was not just Zidane\u2019s victory. This was also the victory of the so-called \u201crainbow team\u201d, made up of a group of players whose origins lay outside France or from its non-metropolitan regions. The forward Youri Djorkaeff is of partly Armenian descent; Lilian Thuram, the team\u2019s hard and classy defender, was born in the small town of Pointe-\u00e0-Pitre in the French Caribbean island of Guadeloupe; left-back Bixente Lizarazu is Basque; midfielder Patrick Vieira was born in Dakar, Senegal.</p> <p>Soon it became clear that winning the World Cup was not just about football. The team was the direct product of a new multicultural France. The press dubbed the team g<em>\u00e9n\u00e9ration black, blanc, beur</em> (the black-white-Arab generation). In the excitement the writer Philippe Sollers \u2013 a Left Bank mandarin who had never previously shown any interest in football \u2013 called for Zidane to be made prime minister of France. He was only half-joking. As it was, politicians of all parties, from Jacques Chirac downwards, went out of their way to associate themselves with the team. The only dissenting voice was a sarcastic growl from Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the Front National, who questioned their loyalty and \u201cFrenchness\u201d. Everyone else seemed to agree with the philosopher Pascal Boniface, who described the moment as the birth of \u201ca new Enlightenment\u201d in France \u2013 the nation was reinventing itself as a newly tolerant and racially diverse nation.</p> <p>In 2016 France is gearing up for another major football tournament \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/euro-2016\">Euro 2016 </a>\u2013 which like the 1998 World Cup is to be played on home soil. In footballing terms, the big question during the build-up has been whether the team will cope with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/13/karim-benzema-france-euro-2016-not-selected-sex-tape\">the loss of Karim Benzema</a>, the star striker for Real Madrid who has already scored 27 goals from 81 caps for France.</p> <p>Benzema was suspended from the squad in November when it emerged that he had been trying to blackmail fellow player Mathieu Valbuena over a sex tape featuring Valbuena. Benzema was recorded on tape by the police talking about the video and then placed under formal investigation. When the final squad for Euro 2016 was announced in April, without Benzema, no less a figure than the French prime minister Manuel Valls intervened, saying publicly that Benzema was not yet fit for \u201cthe team of France\u201d.</p> <p>The views of ordinary fans are harsher still. Most mainstream fans resent his self-styled image as a bad boy from the <em>banlieues </em>\u2013 the rotting suburbs with a mainly immigrant population that ring most French towns and cities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/13/karim-benzema-france-euro-2016-not-selected-sex-tape\">Karim Benzema will not be selected by France for Euro 2016</a> </p> </aside> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/26/eric-cantona-didier-deschamps-may-left-out-players-racial-grounds\">Eric Cantona believes Didier Deschamps may have left out France players on racial grounds</a> </p> </aside> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/27/dider-deschamps-legal-action-eric-cantona-race-claims\">Didier Deschamps to take legal action against Eric Cantona over race claims</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe problem with Benzema is that he wants the glory of playing for France but he doesn\u2019t want to be French,\u201d I was told by one fan drinking in the Caf\u00e9 Metro near Pernety in Paris (Benzema is of Algerian descent). This sounds like a comment from a Front National supporter but actually the group of lads I was talking to are normally a liberal, left-leaning bunch. They feel however that \u201che wants to impress his mates in the <em>banlieues</em> with how hard he is and how anti-French, that\u2019s why he doesn\u2019t sing the Marseillaise. We\u2019re all glad he\u2019s out of the team.\u201d The group nodded in agreement.</p> <p>In the past few days, the argument around Benzema has been joined by Eric Cantona, who has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/26/eric-cantona-didier-deschamps-may-left-out-players-racial-grounds\">commented on the current French manager leaving out players on racial grounds</a>. Didier Deschamps of course captained France on that magical night in 1998. Unsurprisingly he is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/27/dider-deschamps-legal-action-eric-cantona-race-claims\">promising legal action against Cantona</a> and no doubt privately fuming that the former Manchester United player is undermining his authority. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/16/france-didier-deschamps-paris-attacks-england-wembley\">Deschamps</a> has a reputation as a strict disciplinarian; under him it\u2019s unlikely that the dressing room will be as chaotic as it was during the tenure of his immediate predecessors, Raymond Domenech and Laurent Blanc.</p> <p>In the past two decades, the French team has suffered many bleak moments, although first there was another triumph, with much the same squad, at the 2000 European championships. But in 2001, under Roger Lemerre, France played Algeria only a few weeks after the attacks on the twin towers in New York. For the first hour or so of the game Zidane and other players were taunted as traitors by Algeria fans, some of whom had been born and brought up in France. There were chants in favour of Osama bin Laden throughout the game. The match was abandoned in the 75th minute when the pitch was invaded. Zidane left the pitch in tears. When I interviewed him in Madrid in 2003, he described the match to me as \u201cthe worst day in my career\u201d.</p> <p>The lowest point for the supporters was reached during the World Cup in South Africa in 2010. The trouble began during a listless opening match against Mexico. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jun/19/france-worldcup2010\">Nicolas Anelka was kicked out of the squad </a>after a half-time dressing-room row with manager Raymond Domenech. During the same match, Franck Rib\u00e9ry was accused of not passing the ball to Yoann Gourcuff \u2013 hailed as the heir to Zidane \u2013 because Gourcuff was <em>un beau gosse</em> \u2013 in other words, a bit too posh.</p> <p>Unbelievably, Anelka\u2019s expulsion then provoked a players\u2019 mutiny, which in turn led to five of the players, including captain Patrice Evra, being disciplined by the French Football Federation. France crashed out of the tournament in the first round, losing 2-1 to South Africa with a performance so bad that French supporters started cheering for the other side.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"3037bfd6d6342c2d0236b0437a2a18886eb4ad08\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3037bfd6d6342c2d0236b0437a2a18886eb4ad08/1210_0_2765_3456/800.jpg\" alt=\"France\u2019s \u2018bad boy\u2019 Karim Benzema, who is out of the Euro 2016 squad.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">France\u2019s \u2018bad boy\u2019 Karim Benzema, who is out of the Euro 2016 squad.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Valery Hache/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The then minister for sport, Roselyne Bachelot, described the players as acting like <em>ca\u00efds immatures</em> \u2013 immature petty gangsters (there is also a racial twist here; ca\u00efd is a word borrowed from north African Arabic). The team of 2010 was also dubbed <em>l\u2019equipe racaille</em> \u2013 the scum team. Most significantly the word <em>racaille</em>/scum was used by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/nov/28/france.matthewweaver\">President Nicolas Sarkozy to describe the rioters of 2005 and 2007</a>. These insults have never been forgotten out in the banlieues, where football is still keenly followed by fans who now tend to support Real Madrid or Barcelona rather than any French teams, including the national squad. Last year I visited an amateur football club in the banlieues of Lyon while making a film; not a single one of the football-mad kids I spoke to supported France or a French team.</p> <p>Since 2010, the French football-supporting public in general though has had negative feelings about the national team. The word used to describe these feelings is <em>d\u00e9samour</em> \u2013 falling out of love. During the match at Wembley in November, and then again in March, when the French thrillingly beat Holland 3-2 in Amsterdam, that love was briefly restored. It remains to be seen how long it will last.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Right now France is still in a \u2018state of emergency\u2019. Security is tight and tensions are high too</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Despite all of this, there is nonetheless a quiet confidence among the fans and professional football pundits that France could do well. They have depth and experience in the squad and the hope is that with the likes of striker Antoine Griezmann replacing Benzema and midfielder Paul Pogba (a child of the Parisian banlieues), on form they will be hard to handle. The French team seems to be going through something of a renaissance and, playing on home territory with their fans behind them, it\u2019s entirely possible that they could become champions.</p> <p>This is also the not-so-secret hope of politicians that a triumphant French team, like that of 1998, will go some way to help heal the traumas of the recent past \u2013 the riots, the terrorism, the anger on all sides. The magazine <em>SoFoot</em>, usually relentlessly football-focused, made a rare foray into politics in its latest issue, calling upon the team to go on to win the Euro championship and so provide the <em>rem\u00e8de anti-crise </em>(the antidote to the crisis).</p> <p>But this is no easy task in footballing or political terms. Although the riots of 2005 and 2007 and the current wave of terrorism may not be directly linked, they have created a poisoned atmosphere. Right now France is still in a \u201cstate of emergency\u201d in the wake of last year\u2019s terror attacks. This not only means that security is tight and everywhere very visible, but that tensions are high too. Most people are still fearful and edgy \u2013 the attacks in Brussels and the disappearance of the EgyptAir flight from Paris to Cairo have only made this worse. Meanwhile, police raids are going on all the time in so-called \u201cradicalised\u201d parts of the banlieues.</p> <p>In 2016, the multicultural France of 1998 seems further away than ever, and many are asking whether it was no more than an illusion. Certainly, even if the French team does well or even wins the final, it is surely too much to ask that it heals the wounds in French society.</p> <p>It is almost a decade since I last met Lilian Thuram. That was in Barcelona in 2007, during what was to be his last season of top-flight football. Like most footballers he wasn\u2019t ready to retire but he was satisfied that his career had been successful.</p> <p>The highlight was of course that he had been part of the French team that won the World Cup in France in 1998. He described this to me then and now as \u201ca kind of mystical experience, beyond words\u201d. On the pitch Thuram was less poetic: he was tough and unrelenting; he was the mainstay of a tough French defence which conceded only two goals in seven games. He also scored the two goals in the 2-1 defeat of Croatia in the semi-final, single-handedly steering France towards the trophy. As we stroll into brasserie Le Congr\u00e8s near the Porte d\u2019Auteuil in Paris, everyone wants to speak to him. He is approachable, funny and polite, and pleased that he is still so obviously adored by the French public.</p> <p>He is also known now in France for his political activities. Politics was also top of the agenda when we met in 2007. Thuram was born in Guadeloupe and came to France with his family in 1981. He first encountered racism there as a small child and has never forgotten how angry and hurt it made him feel. He remembers asking his mother why he was being called names at school and was profoundly shocked when she told him it was because of his race. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to think,\u201d he said to me. \u201cBut from then on I wanted to change the world.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3da30f565c966ad82a53560c7fd40b36adfa2cb5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3da30f565c966ad82a53560c7fd40b36adfa2cb5/0_979_7264_4359/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Retired French international Lilian Thuram in Paris.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Retired French international Lilian Thuram in Paris.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ed Alcock for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In 2006 he spoke out against Sarkozy, accusing him of ignoring the reality of immigrant lives. Since then he has devoted his non-footballing life to anti-racism issues. To this end, he runs an organisation called the Fondation Lilian Thuram, which creates educational materials and goes into schools. Impressively, he curated an exhibition on \u201chuman zoos\u201d (the practice of exhibiting African and other \u201cexotic, primitive\u201d peoples in Paris and other European capitals in the late 19th century) at the Mus\u00e9e Quai Branly in Paris in 2011. He is keen on identity politics and has campaigned in support of the Catalan language (he speaks fluent Spanish to our Spanish-speaking waitress) and in 2013 marched in Paris campaigning for the legalisation of same-sex marriage.</p> <p>Thuram begins our conversation by giving me a map of the world which has been turned upside down, so that Africa and South America are on top. This is a teaching tool he uses in schools. \u201cIt is supposed to make you look again at the world,\u201d he says, \u201cand to see that where you come from, Africa or anywhere else, can be the centre and not just Europe or the United States.\u2019 In the same vein, Thuram has recently published a book called <em>Mes etoiles noires </em>(My Black Stars) \u2013 which is really a history lesson in black achievement over the centuries. \u201cRacists always describe black as negative,\u201d he says, \u201cBut I\u2019m trying to show that that\u2019s all about power. It\u2019s the same way that women have been treated over the centuries as slaves. But just because you have been dominated it doesn\u2019t mean that your own history is not important.\u201d</p> <p>Thuram\u2019s own heroes include the anticolonial psychiatrist Frantz Fanon and Aim\u00e9 C\u00e9saire, poet and politician and founder of <em>n\u00e9gritude, </em>essentially a black pride movement. \u201cIt\u2019s all about respect,\u201d says Thuram, \u201cRespect for who you are, where you come from. Respect too for history, including the history of slavery. You can\u2019t move forward without understanding the reality of the past.\u201d</p> <p>We talk about Fanon, who was a pro-Algerian activist during the Algerian war of independence. Fanon\u2019s big idea was that, first and foremost, the colonised individual must claim back his or her identity as a human being. We talk about Fanon\u2019s great book <em>Peau noire, masques blancs</em> (Black Skin, White Masks). \u201cIt\u2019s about finding and reclaiming your own identity,\u201d he says, \u201cand in France now, in Europe, I still think that this is important.\u201d</p> <p>We also talk about football. I ask him how he would be feeling if he was in the French training camp now. \u201cIt\u2019s very simple,\u201d he says. \u201cI would be full of joy. This is a rare chance for any player, to play at home and to play with love for your team and country. And for the supporters too. Football is all about emotions \u2013 it\u2019s an emotional connection between you and the supporters. That\u2019s why I would not play in Italy for any team with racist fans. I remember when I played at Anfield with Barcelona, when we lost, how the Liverpool fans carried their team.\u201d</p> <p>I ask about the emotional bond between French supporters and the French team, and why the French public has fallen so disastrously out of love with the French team. More to the point, I ask him about the fiasco of 2010. Was this all about bad management? Or just badly behaved players? \u201cI wasn\u2019t there and I think it\u2019s probably more complicated than it seems.\u201d He says this hesitantly, cautious about criticising his fellow players, and, worse still, possibly demonising them. This is partly out of comradely solidarity but also because he is aware how politically loaded that particular footballing crisis still is. \u201cI think it was just a small group of players who had too much money and too much fame,\u201d he continues, slightly opaquely. \u201cSo there was a bad feeling and this destroyed the spirit of the collective. And you can\u2019t play football without that spirit. It just doesn\u2019t work.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s obviously too much to ask of footballers to change the world, but in 1998 that happened</p> <footer> <cite>Lilian Thuram</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What about the current squad? What is at stake for them in Euro 2016? \u201cFirst of all, football,\u201d he says. \u201cYou can\u2019t think about anything else as a player. When you are on the pitch you are always running, watching, always alert \u2013 that is the beauty of the game. So you think afterwards what it can mean. But sport at the top level also teaches you great lessons \u2013 and especially how to give the best of yourself. You have to give to the team and the supporters. That is how it works.\u201d</p> <p>I ask him then about the expectations of the French public, and if a good run in the competition can really help to lift France out of its current malaise. \u201cI am optimistic,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously too much to ask of footballers to change the world, but in 1998 that happened in a way. Things were not the same in France after that World Cup. I know that because I lived through it. It is true as well that France is going through a difficult period now, but I believe that the reality of 1998 still lives in people\u2019s imagination.\u201d</p> <p>This too is the belief of Nathalie Iannetta, who was appointed in 2014 as a special adviser to Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s office on sport and youth. Ianneta has spent most of her career as a television journalist with a special interest and expertise in football. She is not known to previously have had strong political views, although she has always said that her \u201cheart is on the left\u201d. But her appointment to Hollande\u2019s office \u2013 which came as a surprise to many \u2013 has been seen as a deliberate manoeuvre by Hollande to make political capital out of Euro 2016. She is currently backing an advertising campaign by the TV Channel TFI to get people excited about the tournament. This has taken the form of a short film, clearly made all over France, in which people of different races, with a variety of accents, are asking the team to win for them. The reference point is the <em>black, blanc, beur</em> solidarity of 1998. The background is the political reality of 2016, so the payoff slogan is \u201cMake us dream. We need it!\u201d</p> <p>Iannetta\u2019s office has also come up with the mission statements for Euro 2016: \u201c<em>Le foot comme on l\u2019aime\u201d</em> (football as we love it) and \u201c<em>La France comme on l\u2019aime</em>\u201d (France as we love it). The political meaning of these slogans was defined by Iannetta\u2019s colleague, Najat Vallaud-Belkacem, who said on Iannetta\u2019s appointment: \u201cOur priority with Euro 2016 is to create something new, bring the French together, and transcend difference with a common team. Germany completely changed its image after the World Cup in 2006. We can do the same.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e4ddae6dd1b1cb397a069d6c76d6e9774a49eb05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e4ddae6dd1b1cb397a069d6c76d6e9774a49eb05/0_215_6058_3635/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adviser Nathalie Iannetta with President Francois Hollande during the friendly between France and Russia at the Stade de France this year.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adviser Nathalie Iannetta with President Francois Hollande during the friendly between France and Russia at the Stade de France this year.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Xavier Laine/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is a noble enough ambition. But it is also to ignore the real political complexities of French footballing culture. Most importantly, the main fault line in French football is not just race, but class. Football is still by and large seen by the metropolitan elites as a pastime for \u201c<em>beaufs</em>\u201d<em> \u2013</em> effectively \u201cchavs\u201d \u2013 the white working class of France which has always preferred <em>steak-frites</em>, beer and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/johnny-hallyday\">Johnny Hallyday</a> to Jacques Derrida. Or it is the favourite sport of the <em>banlieusards</em>, the often despised outsiders in French society.</p> <p>The literary world is largely indifferent to football. Certainly there is no equivalent of Nick Hornby in France, or the Hornby-reading classes. Briefly, in 1998, it seemed that everyone in France became a football fan \u2013 including politicians and members of the intelligentsia. But the enthusiasm was short-lived and perceived as phoney at the time.</p> <p>The football journalist Raphael Gaftarnik is wary of politicians and football. When I speak to him in Paris, he tells me: \u201cEverybody knows the political elites in France look down on football fans. The great example was Jacques Chirac, who really knew nothing about the game but was the first to be seen with Zidane and all the rest.\u2019</p> <p>Gaftarnik has recently written about how high the stakes are in Euro 2016 for the government of Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. \u201cI would expect Hollande to associate himself with a French success, that\u2019s obvious,\u201d he tells me, \u201cBut the real football fans are not stupid. They know who is real and who is fake. So if Hollande pretends to be a big fan then it could backfire for him in a big way.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-I25588h9o\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C-I25588h9o?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-I25588h9o\">Watch: 1998 Fifa World Cup France \u2013 Brazil v France</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>There is however much more at risk in Euro 2016 for Hollande than just his credibility with football fans. The highest priority for the French government is security. The mass gathering of supporters in stadiums across France is clearly a sitting target for any terrorist, homegrown or otherwise. Fears have been heightened by the serious crowd trouble at the recent French cup final, played between old rivals Paris Saint-Germain and Olympique de Marseille at the Stade de France. Despite three searches before getting to the ground, fans were able to smuggle in flares and glass bottles. The minister of the interior <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/22/french-interior-minister-security-european-championship\">Bernard Cazeneuve</a> has promised an investigation, but no one yet feels very reassured.</p> <p>There is also the strong likelihood that the competition could be sabotaged by industrial action against labour reforms that were recently forced through without the approval of the French parliament. The unions are promising a wave of strikes during June. Lorry drivers, air-traffic controllers and teachers have already expressed their fury with disruptive stoppages, attacking the so-called lack of democracy. Fuel and transport strikes have also started and the militants are threatening to make France ungovernable. The police are already overstretched as they try to clamp down on the increasingly violent protests across the country.</p> <p>Solving all or indeed any of this would be an impossible pressure for any football team. And this is almost certainly not in the minds of the French players as they begin their warm-up to the tournament. But like every England team that ever sets off for a football competition, haunted by the legends of 1966, the French team will be facing not only the opposing team as they step on to the pitch at the Stade de France, but also their country\u2019s history.</p> <p>Thuram, for one, still believes in the healing power of his chosen sport. \u201cFootball is a roll of the dice \u2013 that\u2019s why it is so exciting,\u201d he says to me, \u201cBut I think that the spirit of 1998 is still alive now. Some say it has become a myth but it once was a reality. So there is no reason why good things might not happen in Euro 2016 for this team, and so good things might happen for France.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/french-intifada-264700.html\"><em>Andrew Hussey is the author of The French Intifada (Granta)</em></a></p>",

      "body": "<p>Jodie Foster directs this shouty satire, which blends the glib economic cynicism of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/24/the-big-short-review-crash-riveting-steve-carell-christian-bale\" title=\"\"><em>The Big Short</em></a> with <em>Network</em>\u2019s skewering of an unscrupulous media. But while it makes a lot of noise \u2013 largely courtesy of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/07/jack-oconnell-my-world-just-got-bigger-unbroken\" title=\"\">Jack O\u2019Connell</a>\u2019s sweaty, high-decibel panic attack of a performance \u2013 this is a film that lacks the authentic anger of the former and the sniper-like accuracy of the latter.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/georgeclooney\" title=\"\">George Clooney</a> wears a smirk, an expensive suit and a complete lack of sincerity as the showboating host of a financial TV show titled Money Monster. Lee Gates is a one-man bull market, dispensing profligate financial advice to an audience conditioned to think that their slice of the pie is there for the taking. When one of his tips turns bad, losing $800m in a single day, Lee chuckles that some of his viewers got their \u201casses smacked\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qr_nGAbFkmk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qr_nGAbFkmk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch the trailer for Money Monster.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>But Kyle Budwell (O\u2019Connell) doesn\u2019t see it that way. He manages to sneak into the television studio during a live broadcast with a loaded gun, an explosive vest and a mission: to get some answers from the people he blames for the loss of his life\u2019s savings.</p> <p>While it\u2019s tempting to argue that anyone who takes the advice of a man who prances around wearing a glittery, dollar-green top hat deserves everything they get, Foster tries to muster audience sympathy for Kyle. But her tools are crude. The score is all muscle and posture, the musical equivalent of a MMA cage fighter; the third act kinship between Lee and Kyle is about as convincing as a buddy relationship between a shark and a herring. The film\u2019s main asset is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/juliaroberts\" title=\"\">Julia Roberts</a>\u2019s sharp-witted director Patty, who combines the consummate professionalism of Holly Hunter in <em>Broadcast News</em> with the gutter instincts of Faye Dunaway in <em>Network.</em></p>",

After rehab, a change of label and adoption by the fashion set, she has gone back to basics, with a set of retro-inspired songs that don\u2019t, frankly, refashion the wheel, but boast a certain tremulous, lived-and-loved appeal. The single, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BBk78WFJPA\" title=\"\">Elizabeth Taylor</a>, is not bad, all pianos, strings and textbook triumph over tears; there are plenty more like it. Spookiest and most courageous by far, however, is Falling Leaves, just a few piano notes and ghostly heartbreak.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s hard to think of a movie franchise that is less in tune with the spirit of the source material than Disney\u2019s effects-bludgeoning, action onslaught adaptations of Lewis Carroll\u2019s whimsical Alice stories. This sequel to Tim Burton\u2019s megabucks first film has a new director \u2013 James Bobin takes over and Burton produces \u2013 but it refers more to Alice\u2019s first big screen outing than it does to anything in Carroll\u2019s books. Despite the fact that Alice (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/mia-wasikowska\" title=\"\">Mia Wasikowska</a>) is now a sea captain who can escape pirate pursuers by stunt piloting a three-masted sailing ship over a sand bank, the forces of patriarchy in Victorian England are still out to oppress her.</p> <p>As with the last film, Alice escapes to \u201cUnderland\u201d, where she finds the Hatter (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/johnnydepp\" title=\"\">Johnny Depp</a>, looking as though he fell head first into a Mac counter) in the grip of a morbid depression. To save him, she must steal the chronosphere from Time (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/sachabaroncohen\" title=\"\">Sacha Baron Cohen</a>, responsible for the film\u2019s funniest moments) and travel back to meddle with the past. A blitzkrieg of digital effects and a kind of HG Wells meets Hogwarts aesthetic is not enough to distract from the fact that the storytelling is all smoke and\u00a0mirrors and very little in the way of heart.</p>",

Christian (Paul Schneider) returns home to attend the marriage of his father (Geoffrey Rush), but in doing so unearths a long-buried secret that has ramifications for the family of his best friend, Oliver (Ewen Leslie). The sense of communities rent apart by spectres from the past is reminiscent of the work of Ray Lawrence, the director of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2002/aug/18/features.review7\" title=\"\"><em>Lantana</em></a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/may/27/thriller.worldcinema\" title=\"\"><em>Jindabyne</em>.</a> And it\u2019s perhaps no coincidence that director Simon Stone appeared as an actor in the latter. Other influences include <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/terrence-malick\" title=\"\">Terrence Malick</a>, particularly in the use of sound and the way fragments of dialogue bleed across scenes. The melodrama of the third act is mitigated by the quality of the performances. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/aug/16/sam-neill-terrible-british-food-new-zealand-vineyards\" title=\"\">Sam Neill</a> is particularly fine, as is Odessa Young as the eponymous daughter.</p>",

The cricketers are also at lunch, but the commentary from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbctms\">BBC Test Match Special</a> continues with an \u2018Ask the Umpire\u2019 session, in which bizarre and unlikely cricket scenarios are postulated,<br /></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>A batsman hits the ball in the air towards the stumps, it grazes the bowler\u2019s fingers, hits the stumps (with the non-striker out of his ground) and loops up into the air and is caught at mid-on. Who\u2019s out?</em></p> </blockquote> <p>and their resolution within the laws of cricket is explored. </p> <p>This prokes exasperation and amusement from the rest of my family, but then so does cricket in general to some extent. If you really want to understand the laws of cricket though (and I appreciate that is quite a big \u201cif\u201d), it is a useful exercise to imagine how they would operate in extreme cases.<br /></p> <p>While I am mildly interested in the laws of cricket, I am very interested in the laws of physics. Real experiments arbitrate eventually, of course, but thought experiments have a long and productive history of pointing the way to deeper understanding. <br /></p> <p>Probably the master of them was Einstein. He imagined trying to catch up with a ray of light, and decided the idea was absurd. This influenced his development of his theories of relativity, in which it is impossible to catch up with light, because it travels at the same speed for everyone. The theory led to predictions that are, arguably, equally absurd. Time flows at different rates depending on relative speed, for example. But those predictions have been thoroughly vindicated by real experiments. <br /></p> <p>Thought experiments including relativitistic pole-vaulters running into garages, spacefareing twins, or train guards with flashlights are still important in teaching relativity and testing how thoroughly you and your students have (mis)understood it.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/life-and-physics/2014/nov/22/sizing-up-a-new-particle-accelerator-and-the-cosmic-stupid-limit\">Sizing up a new particle accelerator, and the 'cosmic stupid' limit | Jon Butterworth | Life&amp;Physics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Einstein bowled a series of thought experiments at the great Danish physicist Niels Bohr in the first half of the 20th Century, in an attempt to defeat quantum indeterminism. In this case, Bohr\u2019s straight bat was firm enough to reply, and he finished the innings \u2018not out\u2019. The result was a better understanding of physics all round, however.<br /></p> <p>Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, one of the pioneers of quantum mechanics, also used thought experiments. As far as we know, no cats were harmed in his famous attempt to highlight the apparent contradictions of the so-called \u2018Copenhagen Interpretation\u2019 of the new theory. Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Cat lives on as a useful idea however, still relevant as physicists build larger and larger coherent quantum systems, in attempts to understand the fundamentals of quantum mechanics and also to make use of them in practical applications such as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/22/age-of-quantum-computing-d-wave\">computing</a>.</p> <p>One of the biggest open questions in physics is how gravity and quantum mechanics might come together to give a single consistent description of nature. We may be lucky and get clues about this from real experiments, but much of the exploration of the boundaries between these two giants of physics has to take place at such extreme energies that thought experiments are the only way forward for now. The quantum emission of radiation near the event horizon of a black hole is a good example, famously theorized by Stephen Hawking.</p> <p>The bit about \u2018contrived extremes\u2019 lends itself to certain political analogies, especially in the UK and the USA at present, but I am not going to go there. An important aspect of thought experiments is that they are cheap and safe. In thought, we can travel to the event horizon of a black hole without being spaghettified. We can ponder quantum coherence without harming any cats, and try to overtake a light ray without leaving our armchair.

      "body": "<p>Thanks to its position on a volatile section of the Mid-Atlantic ridge, Iceland is a world leader <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/apr/22/renewableenergy.alternativeenergy\">in the the use of geothermal energy</a>, and of the six geothermal power plants in Iceland, Hellishei\u00f0i (pronounced \u201chet-li-shay-thee\u201d) is the newest and largest. Fully operational since 2010, it sits on the mossy slopes of the Hengill volcano in the south-west of the country; a green and placid-looking landscape that belies the turbulent geological activity rumbling beneath it.</p> <p>To access the potential energy under the surface, wells are drilled thousands of metres into the ground, penetrating reservoirs of pressurised water. Heated by the Earth\u2019s energy, this water can be more than 300C in temperature, and when released it boils up from the well, turning partly to steam on its way. At Hellishei\u00f0i, the steam is separated from the water to power some of the plant\u2019s seven turbines, while the remaining water is further depressurised to create more steam, used to power other turbines. At its maximum output the station can produce 303MW of electricity, making it one of the three largest single geothermal power stations in the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9dc80a5a253922347c24458410f175b2d86decfd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9dc80a5a253922347c24458410f175b2d86decfd/0_0_1701_1134/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hellishei\u00f0i geothermal plant, Iceland.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t see a 300MW geothermal power station very often,\u201d says Marta R\u00f3s Karlsd\u00f3ttir, managing director of natural resources at ON Power, the publicly owned energy company that runs Hellishei\u00f0i. \u201cIt\u2019s big, but it\u2019s also state of the art and very efficient.\u201d What makes Hellishei\u00f0i particularly innovative is that, as well as electricity, it produces a hot water supply for the city of Reykjavik. Once the steam has been extracted, the remaining geothermal water is diverted to a heat exchanger, where it is used to heat up a supply of fresh, mains water. \u201cWe have a 26km pipeline down to Reykjavik,\u201d says Karlsd\u00f3ttir, \u201ctransporting hot water at around 80C.\u201d The natural incline of the mountain means the water travels naturally, and the pipe is so well insulated that it arrives in the city having only lost a degree or so in temperature.</p> <p>The thick billows of steam notwithstanding, it is almost hard to believe that Hellishei\u00f0i is a power station at all, resembling as it does a modern art gallery or conference centre. The station is open to the public, with guided tours, educational installations and even a souvenir shop. \u201c<a href=\"http://www.onpower.is/exhibition\" rel=\"nofollow\">From the exhibition</a> you can look over the turbine hall and hear the roar of the turbines,\u201d says Karlsd\u00f3ttir, \u201cnothing is burning, there\u2019s no mess, and we have walking paths all over the mountain.\u201d According to Karlsd\u00f3ttir, a major proportion of the plant\u2019s thousands of annual visitors are British schoolchildren, witnessing a vision of clean, sustainable power dramatically different from the murky, fossilised industry they are used to.</p>",

      "headline": "The Lost Tommies by Ross Coulthart review \u2013 young martyrs to pointlessness",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-29T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>\u201cLest we forget\u201d is the trusting motto of first world war commemorations. All the same, preoccupied by later disasters, we have forgotten this most pointless of conflicts, which began as a fatuous diplomatic squabble and ended as a rehearsal for Armageddon; we need a rude reminder. More than 17 million soldiers and civilians died between 1914 and 1918, but such totals stupefy the brain and numb the heart. <em>The Lost Tommies</em> therefore deals with individuals, not an indiscriminate mass. Ross Coulthart\u2019s book rescues from oblivion a few hundred British combatants who fought in the trenches and foxholes of the Somme, and forces us to look at their depressed, bewildered or downright anguished faces.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Battle was industrialised, and the Somme was like an abattoir in which the men, as Wilfred Owen put it, died like cattle</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Coulthart has edited and minutely annotated a photographic archive recently retrieved from a farmhouse in Picardy. Here, behind the staging lines on the western front, Louis and Antoinette Thuillier set up an amateurish studio to photograph troops billeted in the area. Their subjects stood solemnly to attention, though they sometimes cuddled local dogs or puffed on cigarette butts to stoke up their courage: they knew, as they often said in the letters they sent home enclosing these plaintive portraits, that they were posing for the benefit of loved ones who might never see them again. Later the Thuilliers photographed the makeshift crosses \u2013 \u201csome carved from the branches of trees, others made from old rifles and even roughly crossed propellers\u201d as Coulthart notes \u2013 that poked out of their burial mounds.</p> <p>At home in Liverpool, businesses like Cunard or the Stock Exchange rounded up their employees and marched them down to enlist as a job lot. Waving them off, the clerk who took their names remarked: \u201cI think you are all going to have a nice holiday.\u201d For Rupert Brooke, those who volunteered were \u201cswimmers into cleanness leaping\u201d. The recruits photographed by the Thuilliers, however, experienced no ritual purification: they had been sent to grovel in mud, filth and gore.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7674a0d25a9dfbb9e0b0f5bf7b8feeb1335322a8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7674a0d25a9dfbb9e0b0f5bf7b8feeb1335322a8/0_0_4028_5725/704.jpg\" alt=\"The Lost Tommies by Ross Coulthart\" width=\"704\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Lost Tommies by Ross Coulthart</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Kerry Stokes Collection, The Louis and Antoinette Thuillier Collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In a village hall they attended lectures on \u201cthe science of butchery\u201d, with instructions about precisely aiming their bayonets to pierce the enemy\u2019s liver or kidneys. A constant artillery barrage ruined their nerves and made them quake and twitch; in the trenches their meagre uniforms were infested by lice, and they were forced to watch rats gnaw the bodies of their fallen comrades in no man\u2019s land. Field doctors reported on unimaginable horrors: half a Tommy, his lower body blown away, gasped: \u201cOh\u00a0chum, help me!\u201d, which prompted\u00a0his corporal to euthanise him with a shot of morphine.</p> <p>To begin with, the men in the photographs exhibit brave grins, pleased to be doing their duty to king and country. But the book concludes with a different gallery, a lineup of shellshocked officers from a Yorkshire regiment. Their faces sag into paralytic dismay; their eyes blankly gaze into a distance where the experiences that have psychologically wounded them are endlessly re-enacted.</p> <p>Coulthart\u2019s commentary acidly sums up the muddle that doomed these ill-prepared men. It was not until 1916 that the British infantry was issued with steel helmets to deflect bullets; the dandified French wore brightly coloured uniforms that made them \u201ceasy targets for German gunners\u201d. Previous wars had been conducted like\u00a0chivalrous tournaments, but now the swaggering lancers on their emaciated nags were instantly cut down by German machine guns. Battle had been industrialised, and the\u00a0Somme resembled an abattoir in\u00a0which the victims, as Wilfred Owen\u00a0put it, died like cattle.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Today we worry about zealots who are happy to die for a cause; this perversity has its origins in the first world war</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Propagandists promised that this war would end all wars. Instead it almost automatically provoked those that followed. In 1916 a British officer condemned a prospective attack at Fromelles \u2013 which went ahead despite his misgivings \u2013 as \u201ca bloody holocaust\u201d. What Coulthart describes is a slaughter as systematic as the Nazi genocide, perpetrated by generals such as Haig and Kitchener who deployed their own country\u2019s miners, navvies and labourers as cannon fodder and dismissed casualties as \u201cacceptable losses\u201d.</p> <p>Today we worry about zealots who are happy to die for their cause; this perversity too has its origins in the first world war, when a corps of machine-gunners was nicknamed the Suicide Club because of its inadequate equipment. Coulthart recalls a cavalry officer who \u201crode his horse out in full view of the Germans\u201d to rally his troops, shouting \u201cStick it, men \u2026 and for God\u2019s sake put up a good fight\u201d \u2013 a Christian paraphrase, I\u2019d suggest, of the salute to Allah intoned by Isis fanatics as they detonate their vests. He was instantly killed by German fire, but posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.</p> <p>Back then, his initiative counted as extraordinary valour; now it seems more like messianic folly. Give me a chocolate soldier any time. War with its cult of heroism is humanity\u2019s death wish, and <em>The Lost Tommies</em> makes me grateful for my self-protective cowardice.</p> <p><em>The Lost Tommies is published by HarperCollins (\u00a340). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/391695/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to order it for \u00a332</em></a><em> </em></p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>EU Referendum Debate</strong> (5 Live) | <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07c57x2\" title=\"\">iPlayer</a></p> <p><strong>Mastertapes: Paul McCartney</strong> (Radio 4) | <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03jznqt\" title=\"\">iPlayer</a></p> <p><strong>Punk, the Pistols and the Provinces</strong> (Radio 4) | <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07byvp2\" title=\"\">iPlayer</a></p> <p>Listening to radio has been tricky over these past few weeks, mostly because of the European question. All mention of the EU used to make me zone out, even before the run-up to the referendum, so now\u2026 it\u2019s like there\u2019s a constant rattle in my head. No intelligible words, just news tinnitus. Background noise that you can\u2019t switch off, a low-level whine that drives you mad. Occasionally I try to listen properly but the constant shouting makes me switch off again. Instead I check out yesterday\u2019s Iain Lee or Lauren Laverne. Podcasts and iPlayer are my saviour.</p> <p>Still. On Thursday evening I had another go, with Victoria Derbyshire hosting the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07c57x2\" title=\"\"><strong>EU Referendum Debate</strong></a> on 5 Live. The studio audience was made up of people aged between 18-30, so I\u2019d hoped that a fresh, open attitude might prevail. No such luck. Everyone had their opinion, and nobody changed their mind. I took copious notes of what people were saying but when I read the notes back, they signified nothing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>McCartney isn\u2019t a gift of an interview. He slips into anecdote very quickly, he avoids the personal</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Instead let\u2019s concentrate on how the show was managed: the bricks and mortar, rather than the soft furnishings. It was solidly built and beautifully maintained. Derbyshire is so good at this stuff, better than most presenters even while she\u2019s going through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/26/victoria-derbyshire-bbc-finishes-breast-cancer-treatment\" title=\"\">cancer treatment</a> (she has just had her final radiotherapy session this week). She encouraged the audience members to speak, got them to shut up, managed the speakers well and kept them on topic.</p> <p>But it\u2019s clear that the European question will not be solved by the referendum. Its subsets \u2013 immigration, housing, jobs, the NHS, free movement between countries \u2013 won\u2019t disappear, no matter which way the vote goes. My Euro news tinnitus is not going to be cured any time soon.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2016/may/24/paul-mccartney-beatles-disbandment-sent-me-into-depression-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4jgpd\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2512093\"            data-video-name=\"Paul McCartney: Beatles\u2019 breakup sent me into depression \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Mastertapes - BBC Radio 4\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-57448bade4b00a2e2e3a0443\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/24/160524Paul_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11263581&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11263581&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11263581&amp;format=video/webm\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11263581&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption>\u2018A gem\u2019: watch a clip from Mastertapes: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2016/may/24/paul-mccartney-beatles-disbandment-sent-me-into-depression-video\">Paul McCartney</a>.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Ah well. Let\u2019s listen to Paul McCartney instead, shall we? Yesterday he appeared on Radio 4\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03jznqt\" title=\"\"><strong>Mastertapes</strong></a> series, talking with John Wilson about some of his solo work. This special \u201cred button\u201d programme was designed for you to watch, rather than just listen, but I found the visuals too distracting. I didn\u2019t need to see Paul Weller or Noel Gallagher before they asked questions. Radio made them a lovely surprise.</p> <p>McCartney isn\u2019t a gift of an interview. He slips into anecdote very quickly, he avoids the personal. Simon Pegg, another famous questioner, asked McCartney about this, wondering how he coped, as a private man who is forced to be public. McCartney said, simply, that he puts his innermost feelings into his songs. We heard him play snippets of a few: a quick blast of Lady Madonna on the piano, a guitar strum of the <a href=\"http://www.thefader.com/2016/05/24/paul-mccartney-says-that-kanye-wests-all-day-riff-came-from-a-picasso-painting\" title=\"\">riff he gave to Kanye West</a>.</p> <p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Wilson_(broadcaster)\" title=\"\">John Wilson</a>, the <em>Mastertapes</em> host, is excellent with musicians. He pushes them for detail at the same time as keeping them relaxed. This isn\u2019t an easy technique, and sometimes, on <em>Front Row</em>, he can seem a little stern. But it works really well with a longer format and with older musicians, especially men (in particular) who know who they are and what they do. Men with a justifiably solid ego, such as McCartney. I really enjoyed this programme, its atmosphere and detail, and also because McCartney clearly enjoyed it too. A gem.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e93b3bdc55fe6a321006bb5c23e40e453ad1eeb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e93b3bdc55fe6a321006bb5c23e40e453ad1eeb/0_42_4176_2505/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Sex Pistols, July 1977.

Hodkinson makes lovely programmes that focus on Yorkshire and, usually, on music. At least, that\u2019s what it seems as though his documentaries are about. Actually, they\u2019re about northern middle-aged men. Hodkinson gets them to talk in a\u00a0beautiful way, revealing the sentiment beneath the brusqueness, the romance of music and how it cracks your heart. Also, how it shapes your life: he spoke to one man who insisted that seeing the Sex Pistols was the single most formative part of his existence, how everything flowed from there. I could listen to this stuff all day. And I shall, as long as everyone else is talking Europe.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Last summer <a href=\"http://www.mattblack.com/\">Matt Black</a> left the Central Valley of California, where he lives, to travel 18,000 miles across the US on a road trip that took him through 30 states and 70 of the poorest towns in America. The startling image of a hand resting on a fence post against a barren backdrop was taken in the small town of <a href=\"http://www.blackpast.org/aaw/allensworth-california\">Allensworth</a>, California, where 54% of the population of 471 people live below the poverty level.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>All these diverse communities are connected, not least in their powerlessness</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cCalifornia always seemed special and unique in terms of how it symbolised promise and progress,\u201d says Black, 45, during a break in shooting landscapes in Idaho, where he\u2019s working on another stage of the same series, Geography of Poverty. \u201cSo it seemed somehow symbolic to begin there and travel east, but what has surprised me is the similarities I have encountered as I travelled from one community to another. All these diverse communities are connected, not least in their powerlessness. In the mainstream media, poverty is often looked at in isolation, but it is an American problem. It seems to me that it goes unreported because it does not fit the way America sees itself.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c954780fa538347a18235af93ba3344f1d1ddeac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c954780fa538347a18235af93ba3344f1d1ddeac/0_0_4660_4660/1000.jpg\" alt=\"USA.

In each instance, the communities he visited were never more than a two-hour drive apart. \u201cI was able to drive from California to the east coast and back without ever leaving these poor areas.\u201d</p> <p>Black\u2019s striking images are on show in a group exhibition, <a href=\"http://www.magnumphotos.com/Package/2K1HRG63XBJY\">New Blood</a>, at the Magnum Print Room in London alongside the work of <a href=\"http://www.newshatavakolian.com/\">Newsha Tavakolian</a> and <a href=\"http://www.maxpinckers.be/\">Max Pinckers</a>. Working in high contrast black and white, he produces photographs that are stark and impressionistic. His work is far from the straight documentary that Magnum is famed for and, in places, as in the image of birds on telegraph wires taken in <a href=\"http://www.tulare.ca.gov/\">Tulare</a>, California, seems more redolent of the grainy visual poetry of postwar Japanese photographers like <a href=\"http://www.michaelhoppengallery.com/artists/64-shomei-tomatsu/overview/\">Shomei Tomatsu</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jul/13/masahisa-fukase-photographed-nothing-but-his-wife\">Masahishi Fukase</a>.</p> <p>\u201cThis is not a polemic and I have no set agenda,\u201d he says of his epic undertaking, possibly the most extensive documentary photography project ever, which he began in 2014. \u201cI\u2019m more interested in the psychology of poverty because poverty is a culture with its own norms, and it requires a different way of looking.

Set just below a lighthouse (they were originally home to the lighthouse keepers and their families) at the very tip of Wigtownshire, the cottages, which sleep between four and six, are run as holiday lets by the Mull of Galloway Trust, which bought the surrounding land (now a nature reserve managed by the RSPB) to preserve it. The still-working lighthouse was built in the 19th century by Robert Stevenson, grandfather of author Robert Louis Stevenson. It is open for tours in the summer months, and you can spot dolphins, porpoises, whales and sea birds from there on a clear day.<br />\u2022 <em>From \u00a3300 for three nights or \u00a3400 a week for a two-bedroom cottage, self-catering, </em><em><a href=\"http://www.lighthouseholidaycottages.co.uk/\">lighthouseholidaycottages.co.uk</a></em></p> <h2>Dartington Hall<strong>,</strong> Devon</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0b07b7f65c1e0ee8fc9edc35024271304983a74b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0b07b7f65c1e0ee8fc9edc35024271304983a74b/0_0_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dartington Hall, Totnes, Devon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2016/may/29/10-best-community-run-pubs-restaurants-museums-uk\">10 of the best community-run pubs, restaurants and museums in the UK</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Founded in the 1920s by the Elmhirst family, the Dartington Hall Trust is an arts, sustainability and social justice charity based in south Devon. The trust now runs retreats, festivals and summer schools, and opens its gardens, shops, cafes and galleries to visitors so there are plenty of reasons to linger. Conveniently, the building at its heart is a smart, 50-room B&amp;B. Guests can wander the gardens, eat local lamb with herb polenta, rainbow beetroot, goat curd and jus at the estate\u2019s White Hart restaurant, then catch a movie at The Barn, an indie cinema set in a medieval barn in the grounds.<br />\u2022 <em>Doubles from \u00a365 B&amp;B, </em><em><a href=\"https://www.dartington.org/visit/stay/our-rooms/\">dartington.org</a></em></p> <h2>Cheese Market Flat<strong>,</strong> Hay-on-Wye<br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"daf80cb3fd5a6da46724bc4390b2a6bd122d72ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/daf80cb3fd5a6da46724bc4390b2a6bd122d72ae/0_133_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Holiday Cottage accommodation above Hay Cheese Market\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Constructed on the site of an earlier guildhall, this twin-arched 19th-century building was once Hay\u2019s town hall and market. By 2012, however, it was semi-derelict. Happily, after much campaigning, the Heritage Lottery Fund agreed to support its renovation and it reopened in 2014. It is now run as a multi-functional space by Hay Community Enterprise and while the ground-floor space hosts regular markets and events, the first-floor has been converted into a stylish, one-bedroom holiday cottage, with local businesses chipping in to provide some of its artfully mismatched furniture and bright textiles. As well as soaking up lovely views over the town, guests are perfectly placed to browse Hay\u2019s bookshops, bric-a-brac shops and cafes.<br />\u2022 <em>Sleeps two, from \u00a3295 for four nights, </em><a href=\"http://www.haycheesemarket.org/cheese-market-flat/\"><em>haycheesemarket.org</em></a><em> </em></p> <h2>Wooler Hostel and Shepherds\u2019 Huts<strong>,</strong> Northumberland</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"ceab563ef54053f1bb2b6e01c5f1f5263da0ab81\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ceab563ef54053f1bb2b6e01c5f1f5263da0ab81/0_261_3996_2398/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shepherds Hut\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Originally built for the Land Girls during the second world war, this independently run hostel now has beds for 57, including twin and family rooms, dorms and a self-contained flat for five, plus four shepherd\u2019s huts. On the north-east edge of Northumberland national park, it\u2019s close to Bamburgh and Alnwick as well as the Cheviot Hills. Owned and run by the Glendale Gateway Trust, whose work it supports, the hostel is deeply embedded locally and is excellent at letting guests know about events they might want to catch during a stay, from dawn chorus walks and heritage train rides to local gigs. Homemade breakfasts and dinners can be ordered if you don\u2019t want to self-cater. <br />\u2022 <em>Dorm beds from \u00a317 per night, twins from \u00a335, rooms for four/six from \u00a359/\u00a384, self-catering, shepherd\u2019s huts </em><em>sleep two or three for</em><em> \u00a342/\u00a354 a night, </em><a href=\"http://www.woolerhostel.co.uk/\"><em>woolerhostel.co.uk</em></a></p> <h2>St Katharine\u2019s House<strong>,</strong> London<br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"714864870b847efc585839f89a08da1f6fc4fd7c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/714864870b847efc585839f89a08da1f6fc4fd7c/0_38_1123_674/1000.jpg\" alt=\"St Katharine\u2019s House\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Limehouse \u2013 in gritty east London \u2013 may not be the most obvious setting for a hotel with a large, leafy garden, elaborately corniced meeting rooms and 40 modern bedrooms but this isn\u2019t like most hotels. Run as a guesthouse, retreat and conference centre by the Royal Foundation of St Katharine, a charitable organisation, St Katharine\u2019s House also offers a monthly supper clubs, tea and cake at its yurt cafe, and the chance to sit and read in its library or listen to piano recitals in its chapel. It\u2019s particularly good value for single travellers and families, with plenty of one- and four-bed rooms as well as doubles and twins. <br />\u2022 <em>Singles from \u00a375, doubles \u00a390, family rooms \u00a3140, all B&amp;B, </em><em><a href=\"http://rfsk.org.uk/stay\">rfsk.org.uk</a></em></p> <h2><strong>The Raven Inn, Clwyd</strong><br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3df2a6183bbd4ae62000bf5fc48bfbd764d90785\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3df2a6183bbd4ae62000bf5fc48bfbd764d90785/0_0_4896_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Raven Inn, near Ruthin, Wales\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>A community-run pub with rooms near Ruthin, the Raven is well-loved among regulars for its local ciders and beers from microbreweries in north Wales and the borders.

From Thursdays to Sundays, you can eat here, too; curry nights, fish and chips and homemade pies are the order of the day, after which you can stumble upstairs to one of three recently renovated bedrooms.

It also runs nature-based activities for children in school holidays and has a farm trail to explore. You can, however, just rent one of its three homely holiday cottages, which sleep between four and 25 people. Welcome hampers include farm jams and apple juice but you can order other produce, from Bore Place veal, beef and seasonal fruit and veg, to local beer and cheeses.<br />\u2022 <em>Cottage rental \u00a369.60pp per night (children \u00a334.80), </em><em><a href=\"http://www.boreplace.org/self-catering-holidays\">boreplace.org</a></em></p> <h2><strong>Rum Bunkhouse, the Hebrides</strong><br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c39081bcf71a23a172f31d51815021b94747cd0f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c39081bcf71a23a172f31d51815021b94747cd0f/0_25_762_457/500.jpg\" alt=\"Rum Bunkhouse, Isle of Rum\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Built in 2014, this contemporary timber bunkhouse was designed as a 21st-century replacement for Rum\u2019s previous hostel accommodation, which had been operating within the island\u2019s grand but decaying Kinloch Castle (actually a grand late-Victorian hunting lodge). Being purpose built means the new bunkhouse has high-grade insulation, a wood-burning stove and can open to guests year-round. Book one of its 20 beds (some are in four-bunk, family-friendly rooms and there\u2019s one twin) and you\u2019ll be contributing to the Isle of Rum Community Trust, and will have a cosy base to explore this appealingly undeveloped island. Rum is one of the Inner Hebrides\u2019 Small Isles and its main attractions are great walking and wildlife plus Kinloch Castle itself, whose Miss Havisham-like rooms and rare orchestrion (a kind of giant music box) are still open to day visitors.<br />\u2022 <em>Bunks from \u00a323 per night, twins \u00a350, rooms for four/six are \u00a383/\u00a3123, self-catering, </em><em><a href=\"http://rumbunkhouse.co.uk/#/home\">rumbunkhouse.co.uk</a></em></p> <h2>The Smugglers Hostel<strong>,</strong> Cairngorms</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"debbaec549ff87360cde91bf7667f7881d3668a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/debbaec549ff87360cde91bf7667f7881d3668a1/0_54_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Smugglers Hostel, Cairngorms National Park\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>When this former Scottish Youth Hostels Association building in the Cairngorms was threatened with closure three years ago, the Tomintoul and Glenlivet Community Trust took it over. In the centre of Tomintoul, the now-renovated shelter takes its name from the whisky smugglers who once operated in the area; its bedrooms are all named after smugglers. The Speyside whisky trail is one of the biggest local attractions (the Glenlivet, Tomintoul and other distilleries are close by) but the hostel is also a stopping-off point for walkers tackling a spur of the Speyside Way. And, in winter, it\u2019s a good base for skiers at the Lecht (in summer, the lifts are used by mountain bikers instead). Day walks, horse riding, fishing and an adventure playground are available on the surrounding Glenlivet Estate, and the hostel has good bike and boot storage.<br />\u2022 <em>Dorm beds from \u00a317, doubles \u00a350, family rooms \u00a370, self-catering, </em><a href=\"http://www.thesmugglershostel.co.uk/\"><em>thesmugglershostel.co.uk</em></a></p> <h2><br /></h2>",

      "headline": "The Private Lives of the Tudors: Uncovering the Secrets of Britain\u2019s Greatest Dynasty by Tracy Borman \u2013 review",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-29T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>When it comes to popular history, the territory occupied by the Tudor monarchs, with their tumultuous religious sectarianism, their beheadings and spouses and intrigues, is thoroughly well trodden. The subtitle of <a href=\"http://www.tracyborman.co.uk\">Tracy Borman</a>\u2019s latest book offers a tempting prospect on a familiar scene. Will she draw back the arras to uncover the \u201csecrets of Britain\u2019s greatest dynasty\u201d?</p> <p>The answer is, no, not really. This is less to do with Borman\u2019s skills as a historical researcher than the idea of physical privacy itself \u2013 which is an intensely modern one, a particular luxury of our era. Certainly, the Tudor monarchs (and their subjects) understood to a high degree the importance of hierarchy and etiquette but saw no requirement, for instance, to establish the sanitary barriers between physical functions that we now coyly regard as necessary. Going to the lavatory was a public activity (28 companionable seats in Hampton Court\u2019s Great House of Easement), and so, for the most part, was childbirth. Bodily smells were rampant. Sex could rarely be conducted in complete secrecy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/nov/22/how-be-be-tudor-ruth-goodman-review-16th-century-england\">How to Be a Tudor by Ruth Goodman review \u2013 cold baths and soot for toothpaste, anyone?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the royal family, privacy was in many respects even more elusive. The body of the monarch was itself the body politic and the Tudor monarchs all understood supremely well the importance of presenting themselves arrayed in majesty, fleshly representations of a divine ordinance. At every stage of their physical lives, their early wet-nursing, their meals, their ablutions, bowel movements, their rich and elaborate costuming, and above all their fertility, there was someone present to bear witness. Borman writes interestingly of how the royal residences (she is co-curator of the <a href=\"http://www.hrp.org.uk\">historic royal palaces</a> with <a href=\"http://www.lucyworsley.com/\">Lucy Worsley</a>) were constructed and decorated to give the sense of hierarchies of intimacy. \u201cOuter chambers led to inner ones then to the sanctum, and the monarch, at the heart of power,\u201d and: \u201cThe outer chambers of court would be hung with tapestries made from wool alone; the middle chambers with wool and silk, and only the king\u2019s private apartments would be decorated with tapestries woven from gold thread.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>On nights the monarch spent with a consort, a group would stand outside the  door waiting until the business was over</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Tudors had people to clean their teeth, run their baths, wash their underwear and dress them. The Gentlemen of the Privy Chamber, dressed in black, were the elite entourage that came closest to the royal body. Among them, the Groom of the Stool, the \u201cintimate body servant\u201d of the monarch, accompanied the king to the privy and looked after the cloths and close-stools involved. The work was not demeaning: on the contrary, it went to a privileged royal confidant as close to power as it was possible to get. Constipation being a widespread problem for the Tudor monarchs with their eye-poppingly gargantuan meat and wine-heavy diets, it is hardly surprising that bowel movements were accorded such importance.</p> <p>The begetting of heirs was the prime purpose for royal marriages and conjugal relations were also conducted with a ceremony that involved a large cast. On those nights that the monarch spent with a consort, a group would escort him to the queen\u2019s door and stand outside waiting until the business was over. As Borman writes: \u201cThe art of majesty was as evident behind closed doors as it was in public.\u201d Her promise to uncover domestic \u201csecrets\u201d is therefore scuppered before it begins: for the Tudors, a private life did not exist in any sense that we would recognise today. Accordingly, those rare glimpses we have of the public mask slipping are particularly moving. On the death of his queen Elizabeth, for example, Henry VII, that most parsimonious number-cruncher, \u201cprivily departed to a solitary place and would no man should resort unto him\u201d.</p> <p>Little of this material will be new to Tudor devotees. But like <a href=\"http://alisonweir.org.uk/\">Alison Weir</a>, whose biographies, among other published sources, she draws on, Borman is an authoritative and engaging writer, good at prising out those humanising details that make the past alive to us.</p> <p><em>The Privates Lives of the Tudors is published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton (\u00a325). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/395067/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\"><em>Click here to order a copy for \u00a320</em></a><em> </em></p>",

      "headline": "Whoever wins, the EU vote has been a disastrous diversion",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-29T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>This is all absurd; yet it is also very important, with serious implications for the future of the UK and the rest of Europe. Yes: in or out, we shall still belong to the continent of Europe. Moreover, given that the rest of the world also seems to be taking an interest, the outcome of the 23 June referendum can hardly be invested with too much importance.</p> <p>Apart from anything else, a Brexit vote would almost certainly add to the growing dissatisfaction with the EU in many continental countries. There are even fears of a domino effect.</p> <p>Regular readers will be aware that, while always being opposed to suggestions that we should ever put the pound into the eurozone, I am a passionate believer in the importance of our remaining within an EU that successive predecessors of David Cameron spent decades trying to join, and which, for all its faults, is better than the alternative.</p> <p>For some time I have been extremely nervous about the outcome. I keep meeting the most surprising people who say they intend to vote Leave. It is also worrying that for cynically political reasons the Conservatives, under the coalition, made it more difficult for 18-year-olds to register to vote.</p> <p>Given that the young are much more strongly European than many of their elders, David Cameron and the Cabinet Office are now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/14/eu-referendum-households-told-sign-up\" title=\"\">desperately encouraging them to register</a>, an act which the prime minister, no doubt himself a master of new technology, promises can be carried out in three minutes on the government website. The worry is that the older, generally pro-Brexit people will turn out in force.</p> <p>Which brings us to an interesting point made at London University last week by that doyen of pollsters, Sir Robert Worcester, at a symposium entitled Brexit \u2013 Then and Now, organised by the Institute of Commonwealth Studies.</p> <p>The \u201cthen\u201d was the June 1975 referendum, held shortly after we joined what was then the European Community in 1973. Worcester pointed out that from January 1975 until June the polls consistently showed that the probable outcome would be what we now refer to as Remain: by the impressive margin of two thirds to one third. Those polls were as good as spot-on when the day came.</p> <p>By contrast the polls have been much closer in recent months \u2013 indeed, from the Remain camp\u2019s point of view, perilously close until the last week or so, when there appears to have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/26/two-thirds-voters-think-uk-will-remain-in-eu-ashcroft-poll\" title=\"\">a shift towards staying in</a>, even among older voters.</p> <p>The betting market is interesting, but not entirely reassuring. William Hill tells me that the odds are now 6-1 on for our voting to remain in the EU. So Remain is apparently a racing certainty: so much so that the big gamblers are prepared to put down \u00a360 in order to win \u00a310 \u2013 something, I have to say (after a salutary experience at Ascot many years ago) I myself would never risk.</p> <p>On the other hand, far more individual bets are being placed on a Brexit outcome. Thus, although almost four fifths of the money has been put on Remain, two thirds of the individual, and obviously much smaller, bets have been for Brexit.</p> <p>One\u2019s overall impression is that while nothing can be taken for granted, the truly abysmal failure of a divided Brexit camp to present anything like a coherent case for leaving is beginning to affect marginal voters. But if there is indeed a shift of opinion in favour of Remain, things could still go awry if there is another terrorist attack and/or the subject of immigration becomes an even bigger issue.</p> <p>Meanwhile, it has to be said that, while historically significant, the referendum is a serious diversion from the underlying economic and political problems facing both the UK and Europe generally. The Treasury, the Bank of England and assorted international institutions and domestic thinktanks have been doing their level best to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/25/wto-eu-uk-consumers-trade-deals\" title=\"\">frighten the electorate with doom-laden prophecies</a> of what lies in store if the nation votes for Brexit.</p> <p>But, as John Llewellyn and Russell Jones of Llewellyn Consulting remind us in their latest weekly comment: \u201cIn or out of the EU, the country is confronted by major economic challenges and the political environment is likely to remain fraught and unsettled.\u201d They point to the huge current balance of payments deficit \u2013 at 7%, much higher than the deficit that brought such problems in 1976, once the 1975 referendum was out of the way.</p> <p>This and problems such as the housing crisis and the lamentable structural weakness of the British economy will resurface, come what may, on 24 June. But a positive outcome is surely a necessary condition for a serious economic recovery plan.</p> <p>I agree with such respected commentators as Roger Bootle, Gerard Lyons and Larry Elliott that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/20/brexit-best-answer-to-dying-eurozone-eu-undemocratic-elite\" title=\"\">there is much wrong with economic policy in the EU</a> (Elliott\u2019s stimulating new book with Dan Atkinson is called <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/414560/\" title=\"\"><em>Europe Isn\u2019t Working</em></a>) but am surprised that they all want to take the Brexit route.</p> <p>Who knows? A Remain vote could set a good example to other member nations where the commitment to the EU is wearing thin.</p>",

However, I have lost \u00a3191 from this card as Frame has \u201cexpired\u201d my pre-paid amount, pointing to a six-month expiry period in its terms and conditions. However, at no point was I asked to accept such terms and conditions, which might have prompted me to read them, and at no point was I told about the expiry period. Neither the \u201cwelcome\u201d email or the card \u201ctop-up\u201d emails mentioned this, nor did an email offering a deal whereby I could pay \u00a3200 and get \u00a330 free.</strong></p> <p><strong>I have spoken to other people at the gym who were also unaware of this, but haven\u2019t yet been caught out. If I sign into my account on the website there is still nothing about the expiry or a warning that is imminent.</strong></p> <p><strong>The company has repeatedly said I should have read the T&amp;Cs, which admittedly I did not, but nowhere did I explicitly accept them either. After going back and forth for weeks I\u2019ve been offered a goodwill gesture of \u00a3100, but I am shocked the company can get away with such poor transparency and conduct. Is this acceptable, or was I too naive in not reading the T&amp;Cs? Is there a regulatory body I can complain to? </strong><em>AI,</em><strong> </strong><em>London SE1</em></p> <p>The established (and expensive) national gym chains \u2013 some criticised for their complicated contracts and unwieldy T&amp;Cs \u2013 have had a barrage of competition from newer and cheaper firms, such as Frame \u2013 a small but expanding London-based outfit.</p> <p>Frame trumpets its pay-as-you-go card model for giving customers the flexibility to \u201crock up at a time that suits, whatever your job, lifestyle or plans for the day\u201d. We tested the online sign-up and it is one of those \u201ctick box to accept T&amp;Cs\u201d, with the expiry clause not clear unless you click in and read it \u2013 which we think few people do. That said, you should have read them properly and if they were not clear before, they are now made plain, so long as you click into them.</p> <p>We contacted the company which confirmed it was in touch with you and had made the offer outlined above. It said in a statement: \u201cIn order to top up online and purchase credit, a customer must create a profile and tick a box which states they\u2019ve read and understood our T&amp;Cs. These T&amp;Cs specify that credit expires six months from the purchase date.\u201d However, since our intervention the company has, as an act of goodwill, recredited you with the full expired amount.</p> <p>Unimpressed with what you thought were flaws in its marketing and advertising you also complained to the Advertising Standards Authority. Well done you \u2013 the ASA upheld your complaint and has ordered the company to change what it considers to be misleading information.</p> <p><strong>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

Such a refreshingly dysfunctional man, in such a refreshingly dysfunctional landscape of snowy subtitles: both the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/tv-season/wallander-swedish-episodes/id658303483\">original Swedish series</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/kenneth-branagh\">Kenneth Branagh</a> outings oozed murkily on to our screens reeking with dark dramatic class. Since then, of course, we\u2019ve had the likes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/dec/12/the-bridge-sofia-helin-being-saga-noren-interview\">Saga Nor\u00e9n</a>, and most recently the splendid Andri \u00d3lafsson in Iceland\u2019s <em>Trapped</em>, but Kurt Wallender was still the first and, arguably, the best written, coming from the highly complex <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/27/henning-mankell-by-kenneth-branagh-observer-obituary\">Henning Mankell</a>, lost in untimely fashion last year to cancer.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The wider hinterland, in every sense, of southern Africa and its politics, was stuffed almost laughably into a pint pot</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>That Mankell had, certainly for a Swede, an abiding love for Africa was never in doubt. What was in doubt was the wisdom of cramming this, the opener to the last ever Branagh series, into 90 short minutes. This meant the standalone story had to be savagely abridged, but more crucially the wider hinterland, in every sense, of southern Africa and its politics stuffed almost laughably into a pint pot; there was hardly room for the landscape to breathe its mighty breaths, never mind the plot. In fact the film <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/video/screenplay/vi478871833\"><em>The Constant Gardener</em></a>, with which this story shared more than surface similarities, managed to grip throughout exactly the same allotted time, which shows it can be done.</p> <p>This, however, seemed somehow leaden and rushed at the same time. Possibly from our having to cope with the myriad shocks to the system of seeing Kurt not only jogging, but actually smiling; once we\u2019d had a good brew and nice sit-down to recover, there wasn\u2019t much time for anything else. Branagh, who can seldom put any feet wrong to my mind, had seemed almost, momentarily, happy, and happy to be happy, drinking coffee on a balcony surrounded by possibly the finest vista in the world and certainly the world\u2019s ugliest accents.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"226830a09636e083af99a8fc16d704d9e5656b67\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/226830a09636e083af99a8fc16d704d9e5656b67/0_260_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tumisho Masha in Wallander.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tumisho Masha in Wallander.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Left Bank Pictures/Steffan Hill</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He\u2019s back in <a href=\"http://www.visitsweden.com/sweden/regions--cities/southern-sweden/wallanders-ystad/\">Ystad</a> tonight, but there won\u2019t be much more of that sly imposter happiness. In fact, Mankell has a determinedly bleak, not to say unconscionable, ending planned for him: I\u2019ve read the end of that last book, and it\u2019s tremendously hard to keep lumps from the throat. Despite last week\u2019s rare misstep, we should still be bereft to see all this go.</p> <p>What we shouldn\u2019t miss, at all, according to a bizarre yet not-unwelcome slice of scheduling, is the Killer, Hidden in our Post-War Homes. It was fascinating for all the wrong reasons. Chiefly the glee on seeing boys\u2019 chemistry sets from the 1950s, and contrasting their recipients\u2019 assumed delight on suddenly being gifted the means to set most of a small suburban area ablaze, with the pursed lips of today\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.which.co.uk/about-which/company-info/what-is-which/\"><em>Which?</em></a> magazine types, rancid with disapproval. The American versions came, splendidly, with actual uranium dust and a mini Geiger counter. The <em>Which?</em> ladies\u2019 faces itched with offendedness.</p> <p>The fact that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b07chyly/hidden-killers-hidden-killers-of-the-postwar-home\"><strong>Hidden Killers of the Post-War Home</strong></a> was offset with hokey-jokey retro titles and jaunty music meant we weren\u2019t meant to take it too seriously, but some serious points emerged. Despite someone from the <a href=\"http://www.rospa.com/\">Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents</a> (Rospa) averring, wrongly, that \u201cthe postwar house was the most dangerous place you could be\u201d \u2013 still, ladder falls, salmonella, (particularly) nylon nighties catching fire, every one a tragedy for that particular family.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d69a51b9f97010cabcdc8249af2246abd5790b59\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d69a51b9f97010cabcdc8249af2246abd5790b59/0_253_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr Suzannah Lipscomb in Hidden Killers of the Post-War Home.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr Suzannah Lipscomb in the \u2018hokey-jokey retro\u2019 Hidden Killers of the Post-War Home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Modern TV/Gary Morrisroe</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I still think it a Good Thing that the Health and Safety Executive exists \u2013 had it been heeded, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jul/04/piper-alpha-disaster-167-oil-rig\">Piper Alpha</a> would never have happened \u2013 but I am also firmly of the opinion that the Consumers\u2019 Association, the publisher of <em>Which?</em>, set up during those killer-homes years, represents the greatest threat to everyday life-affirming happiness this side of Isis. Whatever, this was chiefly an excuse for the presenter, Dr Suzannah Lipscomb, to gaze distractedly at experts, of the Rospa and scientific and <em>Which?</em> communities, while wondering, almost openly \u2013 \u201cWhat must it be <em>like</em> on your planet?

They work with buildings, which are generally large, expensive, long-lived and important to life, but it\u2019s not always obvious what is significant about the specifically architectural aspect of their work \u2013 the refinements and rearrangements to the functional object that might otherwise come into being without architects\u2019 help. If they have some influence over large budgets, it is developers or politicians who usually make the real decisions. At best, an architect can be like a jockey on a horse. Often, he or she is more like the groom, who puts nice plaits in its mane and tail.</p> <p>They\u2019re also open to accusations of self-indulgence, of hijacking commissions to fulfil their creative whim, never more than in the age of \u201ciconic\u201d architecture that may or may not be now coming to an end. Hence the appeal of what is sometimes called \u201chumanitarian architecture\u201d, where architects apply their skills to helping people in disaster zones or suffering extreme need. What, indeed, could be more useful than helping in such situations? Nothing, as long as the architects really are helping. Otherwise they are only taking their self-indulgence to a higher level, at the expense of people least able to afford it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Polish pavilion concentrates not on architects but on the construction workers for which the country is famous</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Such issues are raised, if not completely answered, by this year\u2019s edition of the <a href=\"http://www.labiennale.org/en/architecture/exhibition/\">Venice architecture biennale</a>, the world\u2019s biggest exhibition of architecture. Under the slightly sententious title of Reporting from the Front, it aims, says its Chilean director Alejandro Aravena, to explore \u201cthe social, political, economic and environmental end of the spectrum\u201d. It is not the first time that the biennale has declared a social purpose, but the idea is pursued more vigorously than before.</p> <p>There is a display on the water tanks in Medellin, Colombia, that once stood in fenced-off areas of grass around which settlements grew up, now opened up into public oases. The Indian architect <a href=\"http://www.anupamakundoo.com/\">Anupama Kundoo</a> has built a mock-up of her <a href=\"http://www.anupamakundoo.com/full-fill-homes/\">Full Fill Home</a>, which uses hollow blocks of ferrocement to achieve \u201cspeedy and affordable housing units that have low environmental impact\u201d. Wang Shu and Lu Wenyu show beautiful panels of brick and tile as part of their campaign to support traditional rural techniques, by using them on a new museum in the city of Fuyang.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0818e4ba62f5b92c22e8eb845cf2933292926fbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0818e4ba62f5b92c22e8eb845cf2933292926fbf/0_178_4597_2998/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A mock-up of Anupama Kundoo\u2019s \u2018speedy and affordable\u2019 Full Fill Home.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"652\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A mock-up of Anupama Kundoo\u2019s \u2018speedy and affordable\u2019 Full Fill Home.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Vincenzo Pinto/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Norman Foster, with the help of his <a href=\"http://thenormanfosterfoundation.com/\">Foster Foundation</a>, has produced a full-size prototype of his impressive plan to build \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/sep/30/rwanda-chosen-for-worlds-first-drone-port-to-deliver-medical-supplies\">droneports</a>\u201d in inaccessible parts of Rwanda, where drones can deliver medicines, tools and other essentials. Using a combination of high and low technology, the ports are to be vaulted structures in bricks made out of local earth, which can be built at least partly with local labour. In Venice he and his team are demonstrating how they will be built.</p> <p>One of the most memorable displays is in a tent-like structure created by the German architect Manuel Herz and the National Union of Sahrawi Women. With a combination of photographs, maps and specially woven tapestries, it shows the camps in Algeria created by refugees from Western Sahara since its occupation by Morocco in 1975. Here, says Herz, they have created \u201ca place of emancipation and self-governance, truly democratic, and not a place of misery\u201d. The institutions of society \u2013 ministries, a parliament, schools \u2013 are housed in buildings that, despite their rough building techniques, are planned with \u201cincredible beauty\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5cb3c33ece17b4c5a10622d3e598c26c427a1a07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5cb3c33ece17b4c5a10622d3e598c26c427a1a07/76_224_4718_2831/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Norman Foster\u2019s prototype for a droneport.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Norman Foster\u2019s prototype for a droneport.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: NORMAN FOSTER FOUNDATION with Redline-EPFL and Ochsendorf, DeJong &amp; Block with Block Research Group ETH Zurich</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Aravena\u2019s theme is not only applicable to cases of great need, though it tends to be interpreted in that way. The \u201cfront\u201d he describes is any situation in which an architect can deflect or guide the forces that go into buildings and places such that they have a greater public benefit. It can mean the conversion of expanses of landfill into parks by the Catalan architects Batlle i Roig. The Portuguese Eduardo Souto de Moura shows how he was asked to modify a youthful work of his, a market in the city of Braga, into a completely new use as a dance and arts centre. Heroically, he was prepared to rip the roof off his early masterpiece and leave it as a part ruin.</p> <p>The biennale consists of distinct elements. There are the huge 16th-century corderie, or ropeworks, of the Arsenale and a large central pavilion in the gardens dedicated to the biennale: in both venues the director chooses the content. The gardens also contain national pavilions where individual countries interpret his theme as they see fit. Among these is the British pavilion where the young curators respond to housing need by proposing new ways of living in homes. Their concepts are strong and their installation elegant, although the latter does not always connect perfectly with the former. The Polish pavilion concentrates not on architects but on the construction workers for which the country is famous, and on the pressures and dangers of their lives.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"447777855f2c6b19d887a6ed5b77ae5db79715ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/447777855f2c6b19d887a6ed5b77ae5db79715ed/0_365_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Manuel Herz Architects with the National Union of Sahari Women\u2019s tent.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Manuel Herz Architects with the National Union of Sahari Women\u2019s tent.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Francesco Galli / courtesy: La Biennale di Venezia</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If \u201chumanitarian architecture\u201d sometimes turns out not to be humanitarian, it is not always architecture either. In the urge to do good, or to be seen to do good, architects can forget their skills of making spaces and buildings that are desirable to inhabit. But the biennale includes some corrective installations, for example by the venerable Portuguese <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/jan/08/10-best-concrete-buildings-architecture-pantheon-gaudi-corbusier\">\u00c1lvaro Siza</a> and the Chilean <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jan/26/sensing-spaces-royal-academy-review\">Pezo von Ellrichshausen</a>, that are simply about enclosing spaces and capturing light in delightful ways. It is not clear how they fit the curatorial theme, but they enrich the show.</p> <p>The strongest exhibit combines constructional wonder with the possibility of usefulness: under the title of Beyond Bending, the <a href=\"http://www.block.arch.ethz.ch/\">Block Research Group</a> of Zurich construct beautiful and delicate vaults that update traditional techniques and economise on building materials. The weakest is called <a href=\"http://bernaskoni.com/biennale/matrex\">Matrex</a>, its inclusion inexplicable, a mixed-use building for the Skolkovo business zone near Moscow. For symbolic reasons not worth repeating, it chooses to insert the shape of a multistorey matryoshka doll into a pyramidal exterior, a model of which is then displayed with intrusive blue lights and buzzing noises.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If the biennale offers no more than suggestions, they are nonetheless engaging, enriching and sometimes enlightening</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are many pitfalls in a project such as this year\u2019s biennale, not all of which are avoided. The voices of the people in whose name much of the work is done tend to be in the background, except in films where they express their gratitude and happiness for the results. Poverty and informal construction can be sentimentalised, romanticised and patronised, sometimes made into aesthetic of brownness and low droning music. At its worst, the biennale can look like a Fairtrade garden furniture shop. Truly terrible captioning \u2013 badly lit, small type, obscure wording \u2013 doesn\u2019t help.</p> <p>Ultimately, none of the work on show is verifiable, at least in the context of the biennale. Any form of intervention has social and economic ramifications \u2013 well-meaning volunteer work, for example, might put local builders out of business \u2013 and it takes knowledge of each and every situation to know whether interesting-sounding proposals for water-gathering towers in Africa or for helping crime-ravaged parts of Mexico will have the effect they promise. The Venezuelan pavilion shows small community projects sponsored by the same government under whom the economy is currently tanking, which makes you wonder if the former are a poor substitute for fixing the latter. The biennale is therefore a series of suggestions as to what might be a good idea, rather than evidence of actions that work.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"878089ebfc787f6b386dcd380ccdb7f58ce638e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/878089ebfc787f6b386dcd380ccdb7f58ce638e7/0_0_5315_3543/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Block Research Group vault.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Block Research Group vault.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: La Biennale di Venezia</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sometimes the benefit might flow less from architects to the poor than in the opposite direction. Low-cost, low-technology construction returns architecture to its roots, of laying one block on another by hand, and making best use of light and climate. In an age otherwise dominated by mechanised and impersonal building processes, it enables you to see in a finished structure the story of its making.</p> <p>If the biennale offers no more than suggestions, they are nonetheless engaging, enriching and sometimes enlightening. Compared with previous more Eurocentric biennales, it presents a realigned perspective of the world of architecture, in which Latin America, Asia and Africa take their rightful place. Although the big old names of architecture are still there, a substantially new cast of creative characters is offered. It feels like a new world.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Thomas Jefferson knew which side he was on. \u201cThe basis of our governments being the opinion of the people, the very first object should be to keep that right; and were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government, I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.\u201d And America still more or less keeps that First Amendment faith. But what happens, more than two centuries on, when you have a government with no matching press presence at all?</p> <p>That\u2019s the European dilemma that dogs every debate, and this Brexit referendum. It\u2019s the weakest point for the euro faithful \u2013 and also the reason why the sceptics are wrong about \u201csuper-federalism\u201d. Laws aren\u2019t the answer. Single currencies can\u2019t do the trick. For there is no real union if members can\u2019t watch together, read together, instinctively think and bind together. No news means no common purpose.</p> <p>Of course you can make a contrary case with numbers attached. More and more accredited correspondents \u2013 nearly a thousand of them now \u2013 cluster in Brussels these days. Question the <em>FT\u2019s</em> fidelity and they\u2019ll provide reporters\u2019 names from all over the EU. Politico, opening a European wing to match its Washington DC operation, is already the favoured option for the union\u2019s movers and shakers. Euronews \u2013 the TV and web service that EU money helped kickstart in the early 90s \u2013 is alive and still kicking with a putative audience of 8 million or so: and, only this week, new plans to reach university campuses too.</p> <p>It isn\u2019t that no one is trying to fill the Jefferson gap. The European commission itself knows all about the hole in its defences: the nightmare vision of a snooty, out-of-touch elite bound to some mystic creed and inflicting its will on 500 million ordinary people. The IDS of March. But understanding the problem isn\u2019t solving it.</p> <p>Nothing comes simple from start to finish. Countries joined the market and then the union at different times for different reasons. Germany and France bonded for peace instead of war. The old Soviet satellites rushed to cement their fledgling democracies inside a great democratic club. Spain and Portugal wanted to make sure fascism never came back. And Britain, economically, didn\u2019t want to get left behind, washed up on the beach of history.</p> <p>How does the council of ministers interlock with the commission and the European parliament? Is there a driving force buried deep in the office blocks of bureaucracy, or do we just imagine it? Did Heath and Wilson, when they took Britain into Europe, ever dream that the Soviet empire would be rubble a couple of decades later? And what would they have told the British people then?</p> <p>Evan Davis looked slightly bemused on <em>Newsnight</em> when presented with evidence of how little even his viewers knew about the mechanisms and realities of EU governance. But then, nobody had taken much time to tell them. Bring Jeremy Paxman out of retirement to provide solid answers and all you get is a straight banana of snide condescension, much as though Paxo were auditioning for a Eurovision commentary slot.</p> <p>Of course it\u2019s difficult. Interlocking arms of governance don\u2019t fit I\u2019m-afraid-that\u2019s-all-we\u2019ve-got-time-for media life. Long discussion meetings, open or closed, don\u2019t make snappy television. Compromise isn\u2019t half as newsworthy as confrontation. Seeing things through the prism of 28 nation states means 28 different versions of success or failure (just go to a summit and observe 28 teams of spin doctors toiling away).</p> <p>Unelected elites? But the commissioners \u2013 including Britain\u2019s Lord Hill \u2013 are all nominated by their own elected governments. (We don\u2019t talk about Obama\u2019s unelected US cabinet.) The bureaucrats who flit behind the scenes have been sent to Brussels by their governments back home. We elect the European parliament but don\u2019t report its sessions or votes. Most of Britain\u2019s red-top and middle-market press covers the union from lobby correspondent bunkers in the palace of Westminster. And why is there no powerful, elected EU president? Because none of the 28, including Mrs Merkel, want one?</p> <p>Nothing much here makes mass media fodder. There\u2019s no central authority for praise or blame. It is a stage without heroes and only shadowy villains, one drained of personality or easy opinions. You merely have to observe Euronews\u2019s run of terse, neutral reporting to see that BBC World News, CNN and the burgeoning rest are competitors, not allies.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4903b62d5571c93805e00971838692380b74b5f5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4903b62d5571c93805e00971838692380b74b5f5/0_139_5184_3110/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Europe of many nations: the prime minister of Sweden, Stefan L\u00f6fven, speaks to Swedish broadcaster SVT outside a meeting in Brussels.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Europe of many nations: the prime minister of Sweden, Stefan L\u00f6fven, speaks to Swedish broadcaster SVT outside a meeting in Brussels.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dean Mouhtaropoulos/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And when it comes to the new world of digital, naturally enough, Europe is nowhere. The world\u2019s top digital news sites, the world\u2019s dominant social media presences, are American or (lower down the top 10) British. A continent of many languages has no means of building businesses with the scale digital success seems to demand. Axel Springer, Germany\u2019s and mainland Europe\u2019s most dynamic news force, looks to America and the English-speaking world as its expansion highway. The <em>Guardian</em>, 30 years ago and again much more recently, has made efforts to create a European news and opinion network for 500 million of Planet Earth\u2019s richest, most educated, most cultured citizens. But where\u2019s the truly transnational advertising market that needs? Alas, no lift-off.</p> <p>There is obviously movement, obviously traction. See how, in only five years, British TV screens run Swedish, Danish, French, Italian, Norwegian, German and Belgian dramas with mounting confidence: subtitles no problem. See the complete normality of a Portuguese manager displacing a Dutchman at Man U while a Spaniard moves from Munich to City. See the stream of British undergraduates choosing Amsterdam University over Sheffield or Birmingham. See the fact that a bright, ambitious US digital outfit \u2013 Politico again \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/mar/17/poltico-europe-axel-springer-brussels-paris-london-berlin\" title=\"\">can find Springer a partner</a> and begin to transform the flow of reporting about political Europe. See the tides of economic buoyancy or disillusion that wash across 28 borders. See one great story of threat and challenge \u2013 mass, desperate migration \u2013 that shakes all 28.</p> <p>Some feelings have to be personal. I feel them when I sit down with my Dutch, Danish, Polish, Swiss, French and Russian colleagues to help choose the best European Press Prize entries from \u2013 this year \u2013 40 different countries. I recognise the common urge to discover, uncover and inform. I feel it, like many journalists, when we meet to hand out those prizes and discuss the state of our nations, the state of our continent, the state of the world.</p> <p>Journalists in these environments \u2013 like doctors, engineers, architects, indeed anyone with a common trade or skill \u2013 cross borders naturally. They become a band of brothers and sisters five minutes into the session. They communicate naturally. But that embryo \u201csuperstate\u201d, that federal monster of fevered imagination? It\u2019s a non-government without a leader, or a public identity and space, or a story to tell that links 500 million. It will never endure without the reforms and beliefs that can bridge Jefferson\u2019s gap. Not Leave or Remain, you see: but change.</p> <p>\u25a0 In 2006, before the iPhone, before the iPad, the <em>Telegraph</em> moved from Canary Wharf to Victoria and Will Lewis, then master of digital enlightenment, housed staff on a 65,000 sq ft floor arranged in a giant wagon wheel. State of the art for 15 seconds. And today? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/23/telegraph-smart-working-talent-pay-digital\" title=\"\">Hot-desking is the decree du jour</a>.

      "body": "<p>At a time when Donald Trump is a glaring, bulbous reality, perhaps it\u2019s hard for fictional political satires to compete. Few went to see David Gordon Green\u2019s limber, snappy and very funny<strong> Our Brand Is Crisis</strong> (Warner, 15) in cinemas, but it deserves another chance on DVD: loosely inspired by a 2006 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/mar/22/broadcasting.tvandradio\">documentary of the same title</a>, it\u2019s a cheerfully scalding examination of crooked campaign management. Sandra Bullock, applying a hard enamelled finish to her signature all-American klutziness, aces the change of pace as a famed US spin doctor hired to spearhead the presidential campaign of a Bolivian rightwinger in 2002; even with the cynicism dialled up to 11, she\u2019s likable enough to heat this tale of cool-blooded dealings.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a60873a6ddc6de909eda97d50dda203f24e16672\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a60873a6ddc6de909eda97d50dda203f24e16672/0_227_3000_1768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Dano, Harvey Keitel and Michael Caine in Youth\" width=\"1000\" height=\"589\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Dano, Harvey Keitel and Michael Caine in Youth: \u2018lavishly wearying\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/Studiocanal</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Paolo Sorrentino\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/31/youth-review-michael-caine-harvey-keitel\"><strong>Youth </strong></a>(Studiocanal, 15), on the other hand, is a film intended to stir up warm, soaring feelings on big, capital-lettered themes \u2013 Art, Beauty, Love, Loss \u2013 that nonetheless leaves my heart entirely frozen. Not one grandiose formal gesture or expression of feeling strikes me as sincere in this wobbling, honey-drenched pudding of Eurokitsch, starring Michael Caine as a retired composer contemplating existence and death and nubile young women at a Swiss mountain spa for the inordinately wealthy and contemplative. But what was intended to be a universal meditation on what makes life worth living is stymied by the suffocating tunnel vision of its ultra-privileged male perspective. It\u2019s livened up toward the end by a brassy Jane Fonda cameo, if only because she, unlike everything else in this lavishly wearying film, actually intends to be grotesque.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8JC_NARTdfA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8JC_NARTdfA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>The Club: trailer.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>I\u2019d quite like to see a version of <em>Youth</em> directed by Chilean master Pablo Larrain, who refuses to go easy on any institution of privilege and power. Even then, it probably wouldn\u2019t be half as good as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/24/the-club-review-pablo-larrain-catholic-church-chile\"><strong>The Club </strong></a>(Network, 18), a scorching, black-souled parable that tackles the abuses of the Catholic church as violently head-on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/22/victoria-spotlight-big-short-assassin-mavis-eat-your-bones\">as <em>Spotlight</em> did </a>with reserved finesse. (They\u2019d make a riveting, if somewhat despairing, double bill.) Set in and around a kind of protective sanatorium for problematic priests, it\u2019s gutsy, gutting political film-making, woven through with dark ribbon of acrid comedy.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kDCNOie_78\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-kDCNOie_78?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Rams: trailer</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Gr\u00edmur H\u00e1konarson\u2019s<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/07/rams-observer-film-review\"><strong>Rams</strong></a> (Soda, 15) is a somewhat more tender arthouse option, albeit one that hides behind a particularly Icelandic cold front: this story of estranged sheep-farming brothers, forced into collaboration by an outbreak of livestock disease, gradually thaws into a poignant, off-kilter appreciation of kinship. If you\u2019re after something a little more kinetic \u2013 though not in the shoot-\u2019em-up style its subject matter might lead you to expect \u2013 Mexican director Gabriel Ripstein\u2019s gun-running thriller<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jun/19/600-miles-review-film-tim-roth-mexican-thriller-edinburgh\"><strong>600 Miles</strong></a> (Soda, 15) merits a look: starring Tim Roth as a US federal agent kidnapped by a Mexican arms smuggler, it\u2019s urgent and level-headed, delivering a tacit dressing-down to the pro-gun lobby.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bdbbe2931f1d479afdb64b7bdd46982be689bbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bdbbe2931f1d479afdb64b7bdd46982be689bbf/0_0_1719_1076/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Snoopy and Charlie Brown: The Peanuts movie\" width=\"1000\" height=\"626\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Snoopy and Charlie Brown: The Peanuts movie: \u2018a turnoff to adult Peanuts nostalgists\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/20th Century Fox</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kids have two exercises in nostalgia to choose from this week, each drawn from a source that handily predates the viewers they\u2019re targeting. There\u2019s little to love in <strong>Goosebumps </strong>(Sony, PG), a cluttered, digitally uglified, Jack Black-starring riff on RL Stine\u2019s popular junior horror books of the 90s. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/20/snoopy-and-charlie-brown-the-peanuts-movie-review-wry-adaptation\"><strong>Snoopy and Charlie Brown: The Peanuts Movie </strong></a>(Fox, U) has a sweeter outlook, though it\u2019s unlikely to sell children on Charles Schulz\u2019s classic comic strips, given that his jaded wit has largely gone out of the window. Its smoothed-out CG animation style, meanwhile, is a turn-off to adult Peanuts nostalgists, this one included.</p> <p>Instead, I found myself heading for the jagged, hand-drawn comforts of 1980\u2019s <strong>Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown!</strong> <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/peanuts-bon-voyage-charlie/id1032938896\">on iTunes</a>. Frequently sidelined in the Peanuts canon, but a personal childhood favourite, this feature-length outing strands Schulz\u2019s gang in rural France; decades on, I found its loopy humour and skew-whiff child\u2019s-eye observations reassuringly in place.</p>",

Of the 250 anti-fracking community groups that have sprung up in Britain in the past few years, very many are led, or strongly backed, by women, who say they have been outraged at plans to risk people\u2019s health by exploiting the countryside for shale gas.</p> <p>With drilling companies last week buoyed by North Yorkshire county council\u2019s 7-4 vote <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/23/north-yorkshire-council-backs-first-uk-fracking-tests-for-five-years\">in favour of Third Energy\u2019s plans to drill in Ryedale</a> despite fierce local opposition, women leaders in Lancashire and Kent as well as North Yorkshire say they are prepared for action as a year-long lull in the fracking war ends.</p> <p>New protest camps could be set up, and major demonstrations and legal challenges can be organised quickly, said Rothery, one of a group known as the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/03/nanas-shale-cuadrilla-fracking-lancashire\">Nanas</a> \u2013 several dozen mothers and grandmothers who successfully opposed energy company Cuadrilla\u2019s application to frack in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/feb/09/lancashire-county-council-fracking-cuadrilla-public-inquiry\">Lancashire</a>.</p> <p>Lancashire groups now expect communities secretary Greg Clark to overrule councillors\u2019 rejection last year of applications to frack in the Fylde area, at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/26/lancashire-county-council-rejects-cuadrilla-fracking-bid\">Roseacre Wood</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jun/29/fracking-application-cuadrilla-rejected-lancashire-county-council\">Preston New Road</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe can do big callouts when we need to,\u201d said Rothery, who has spent much of the past 12 months travelling around Britain encouraging women, especially, to protest against the controversial technology. \u201cThere are now Nanas in every corner of the country \u2013 and they are a force to be reckoned with. We expect the companies to start to apply for permits and drill as soon as possible.\u201d</p> <p>Campaigners say there are now so many linked protest groups that it will be next to impossible for companies to operate without ongoing confrontations.</p> <p>\u201cThe police asked us about our plans following last Monday\u2019s decision on Ryedale,\u201d said Rothery. \u201c[We said] we are ready for a surge. But we are not one body. There is no head to pull off.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"612c09d967c9f455317366f0172e77322c96ce20\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/612c09d967c9f455317366f0172e77322c96ce20/0_0_480_706/340.jpg\" alt=\"Preston New Road Action Group poster.\" width=\"340\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Preston New Road Action Group poster.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Preston New Road Action Group</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Research by Nottingham university has suggested that women are much more likely than men to object to fracking. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/23/women-less-likely-than-men-to-support-fracking-due-to-instinct\">A study last year</a> found only 31.5% of women in favour of shale gas exploration, compared with 58% of men.</p> <p>\u201cWomen are strongly against fracking because they tend to take the longer view, because of family,\u201d said Pat Davies, chair of the Preston New Road action group in Lancashire. \u201cMen look at what happens now; women look more to the future. Women are very strong here. But we have got 300 elderly people and a junior school within a few hundred yards of where they plan to frack, so it\u2019s not surprising. I am a twinset and pearls lady, a traditional conservative lady. I have never protested against anything before in my life.\u201d</p> <p>Julie Wassmer, a member of the anti-fracking campaign groups <a href=\"http://www.talkfracking.org/stories-from-the-frontline/julie-wassmer-east-kent-against-fracking/\">East Kent Against Fracking</a> and Mothers Against Fracking, agreed: \u201cA lot of groups are led by women. Fracking is an attack on the environment and public health. It\u2019s a battle for clean air and water, the elements of life. And women understand that. It goes to the heart of women\u2019s role in society.\u201d</p> <p>But Averil Macdonald, chair of UK Onshore Oil and Gas, the industry group that represents many potential fracking companies, has said women are more likely to protest because they \u201cdon\u2019t understand\u201d the technology and follow their gut instinct rather than the facts.</p> <p>Writing in the Guardian at the end of last year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/23/fracking-shale-gas-women\">she said</a>: \u201cThey are concerned because they don\u2019t want to be taking [something] on trust. And that\u2019s actually entirely reasonable. Frequently women haven\u2019t had very much in the way of a science education because they may well have dropped science at 16. That is just a fact.</p> <p>\u201cWomen do not like being preached to by men, and the shale gas industry \u2013 like many other industries in this country \u2013 is dominated by men, and engineers at that. The plain truth is that in this country we are extremely bad at encouraging women to engage with science \u2013 physics is the third most popular A-level among boys but 17th among girls.\u201d</p> <p>But Wassmer responded by saying the issue was that women were fighting for their families. \u201cWomen are key figures in the fracking groups. We do not believe that the regulatory authorities can perform fracking safely in the UK.</p> <p>\u201cAll the reports say that it is safe to go ahead as long as there is robust regulation. Yet that is what we do not know. It is undeniable that there have been problems all around the world with fracking. That is why woman will fight it tooth and claw.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Shortly after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/21/boris-johnson-eu-referendum-campaign-for-brexit-david-cameron\" title=\"\">Boris Johnson</a> and Michael Gove declared that they would campaign for\u00a0Brexit back in February, the former Tory leader William Hague seemed more preoccupied with the fate of the Conservative party than with Britain\u2019s future relationship with the EU. \u201cA sustained battle within a party can open wounds that take a generation to heal,\u201d he wrote\u00a0in a <em>Daily Telegraph</em> column. \u201cJust look at Blair and Brown and the wreckage they left behind.\u201d By suggesting that a split of that magnitude could be on the cards, Hague aimed to focus Tory minds.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/williamhague\" title=\"\">The former foreign secretary</a> knew that, as the country approached the 23\u00a0June EU referendum, it was about to witness the Tory party playing out the final act of its decades-long internal war over Europe \u2013 but this time in public, and ferociously, for every voter to see. What concerned him most was not whether the electorate would decide to leave or stay in the EU, but whether the wounds inflicted in the process would ever heal. Could the Tories survive the bloodbath?</p> <p>\u201cAs they go bleary-eyed back to work on 24 June, will leading Conservatives be able to work together?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>This week, with three weeks to go in a brutal campaign that has already set Tory against Tory as never before, Gove and David Cameron will appear on Sky television on consecutive nights to debate the Brexit question. The two men, friends for decades, had to be kept apart because of their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/19/michael-gove-makes-case-eu-exit-bbc-today\" title=\"\">opposing views</a> on the great question facing the country. Cameron did not want a \u201cblue-on-blue\u201d row on TV.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s like two heavyweight boxers before a fight. You can\u2019t allow them to go at each other. It would be too ugly,\u201d says one Tory MP in the Remain camp.</p> <p>Downing Street refused point-blank to put Cameron on stage with a fellow cabinet minister. \u201cIt was not even considered for a second,\u201d said a senior source.</p> <p>When he named the day for the referendum earlier this year, the prime minister appealed for an \u201corderly\u201d debate that would allow the business of government to run in parallel with the EU campaigns. But his attempt to lance the boil of Europe has unleashed levels of disunity and personal acrimony in his own party that border on anarchy. Relations between Cameron and Gove \u2013 whose first act as a Brexiteer was to say that Cameron\u2019s entire EU renegotiation was worthless because it lacked legal force \u2013 and fellow Old Etonian Johnson, who has described the prime minister\u2019s claim that Brexit will cause severe economic damage as \u201cdemented\u201d, are now strained to breaking point.</p> <p>Senior MPs, including members of the 1922 committee of backbenchers, are so concerned about what will happen in their party after 23 June that they have held secret meetings to plan how to bring MPs and ministers back together, whatever the outcome.</p> <p>Charles Walker, a member of the 1922 executive, says that there is no guarantee of success, and that if Tory MPs cannot bury their differences the effects on the party will be disastrous. \u201cThere is no secret ingredient that will bring people together,\u201d he adds. \u201cIt depends on how each individual chooses to respond afterwards. Do they want a period of two years of internecine warfare followed by an emergency election because we can\u2019t get our legislation through parliament, or do they want to pull together and win the next election? It is up to the individuals.\u201d</p> <p>With Labour disunited under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn, some Tory MPs believe that the Conservatives can afford this temporary period of blood-letting and then make up. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Brexit-supporting MP for North East Somerset, says that, if there is a vote to stay in the EU, he will swallow his pride, accept it and move on. He believes even the most hardline Brexiteers on the Tory backbenches will do so, too.</p> <p>\u201cWere it to happen, I will shut up. I\u00a0believe in democracy,\u201d he says. \u201cWere the British people to say that they want to be ruled by a Brussels bureaucracy, then so be it. I will go off and behave like a Trappist monk. All the leavers are in favour of democracy. I think they would just look silly if they say they don\u2019t accept it.\u201d</p> <p>But that is not a view universally held in the parliamentary party, by any means. And certainly not in private. There is dark talk of the most hardline \u201couters\u201d \u2013 furious at what they say have been wildly exaggerated claims from Cameron and George Osborne about the economic damage of a Brexit \u2013 ganging up in the event of a Remain victory to table a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/24/david-cameron-eu-referendum-tory-unity-brexit-coup\" title=\"\">vote of no confidence in Cameron</a>.</p> <p>To get the necessary 50 signatures for such a move looks a tall order. But wise heads think a core group of Brexiteers will want to exact revenge afterwards by whatever means they can, even if this means inflicting a slow death on Cameron\u2019s administration.</p> <p>A former minister in the Remain camp says: \u201cSensible people are worried. Let\u2019s assume Remain wins. There are 25 people in the parliamentary party who define themselves as being all about Europe. It is all they care about. They can make it really difficult for Cameron with a majority of 18, and they probably will. They can stop him doing what he wants by voting against legislation, claiming they are doing so on issues of high principle. That could make his life virtually impossible.\u201d</p> <p>As the Tory party implodes it offers Labour welcome relief, making Corbyn\u2019s opposition look, by comparison, like a rock of stability and unity. There were ugly scenes last week in the Commons tea room as two Tory MPs exchanged insults over breakfast.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f4113c08bb3a07b9d7e56043487e3301f8916908\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f4113c08bb3a07b9d7e56043487e3301f8916908/0_32_1743_1046/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Samantha Cameron (left) and Michael Gove\u2019s wife Sarah Vine are reported to have fallen out over Gove\u2019s support for Brexit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Samantha Cameron (left) and Michael Gove\u2019s wife Sarah Vine are reported to have fallen out over Gove\u2019s support for Brexit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is not just about the issues and has all become depressingly personal. Cameron and Gove\u2019s wives, Samantha Cameron and Sarah Vine, are said to have fallen out after what the tabloids claim was a foul-mouthed spat at a party, with Mrs Cameron accusing Gove of having betrayed her husband. Vine, writing in the <em>Daily Mail</em> in February, said she hoped the differences between the two men over Europe would not affect the friendship: \u201cThe Camerons are some of our dearest friends. We had been through so much together, both personal and political. I am godmother to Florence, their youngest.\u201d She prayed the closeness would endure.</p> <p>However, harsh words and accusations about honesty and integrity are traded daily. Last weekend Cameron came close to accusing his defence minister, the Brexiteer Penny Mordaunt, of lying over the UK\u2019s ability to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/22/david-cameron-defence-minister-penny-mordaunt-lying-turkey-joining-eu\" title=\"\">block Turkey\u2019s EU entry</a> when she delivered a Gove-Johnson line about a threatened influx of hordes of Turkish immigrants. Tory friendships have been treated as if they never existed. Cameron\u2019s soulmate and ally over decades, Steve Hilton, not only declared for Brexit last week in an interview with the <em>Times</em>, but then twisted the knife by claiming his great buddy Dave was a closet \u201couter\u201d himself, but could not say so because he was prime minister. Few allegations could be more damaging to his friend. Cameron rubbished the claim.</p> <p>Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith, seething with anger against anyone who makes the Remain case, made a similar charge against the business secretary, Sajid Javid, saying Javid had told him in private that he wanted out of the EU before the campaign began. Javid said this was \u201csimply not true\u201d. The entire tribe is riven. Even Tory newspaper groups are warring over Brexit, with the <em>Daily Mail </em>(pro-Brexit) and the <em>Mail on Sunday</em> (in favour of Remain) at odds.</p> <p>Bernard Jenkin, a hardline Brexiteer\u00a0who chairs the public administration select committee, says publicly that, despite everything, his party can pull together afterwards. But if Remain wins, he warns, it will be much more difficult. That is the united,\u00a0and now public, line among the\u00a0outers. If they don\u2019t get their way, it\u00a0will be tough.</p> <p>\u201cIt depends on how the leadership behaves,\u201d says Jenkin. \u201cIf there is judicious leadership, I do not see any reason why we cannot unite and go on to win the next election. But it will be much more difficult if Remain wins, because most Tory MPs want to leave.\u201d</p> <p>But the question then is: what will this judicious leadership entail? Nigel Evans, another member of the 1922 executive and a Brexit supporter, said that, whatever the result, the immediate aftermath and the inevitable ministerial reshuffle that will follow will be a huge test of David Cameron\u2019s healing skills. What will he do with Gove, Johnson, Mordaunt?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9d39d69e61bb2a3fd5a2307a9d27483a8050a4fc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9d39d69e61bb2a3fd5a2307a9d27483a8050a4fc/0_209_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Defence minister Penny Mordaunt, a Brexit supporter, warned over Turkey\u2019s potential entry into the EU.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Defence minister Penny Mordaunt, a Brexit supporter, warned over Turkey\u2019s potential entry into the EU.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI will back David 100% after the result is known,\u201d says Evans, before adding: \u201cThe immediate 24 hours after the result will be important for the PM to reach out to the MPs on the losing side and ensure that any changes within the government sensitively reflect diverse views on the subject.\u201d</p> <p>The big tent will have to include the chief proponents in a civil war who have just spent months questioning the other side\u2019s honesty, integrity and judgment on the biggest question facing the British electorate in generations.</p> <p>The reality is that, win or lose, Cameron will have his work cut out to survive with his authority intact. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/23/david-cameron-i-would-not-serve-third-term-as-pm\" title=\"\">He has said he will not serve a third term.</a> But he wants to remain until close to the next election, and has insisted that even if there is a vote for Brexit he will stay put. Either way his continued occupancy of Downing Street will test his skills and resilience to the limit. If there is a Remain vote, he will be the victor in the strict sense of the word. But he will be leading a blood-spattered party with a large, angry, defeated flank, while trying to secure his legacy through domestic reforms with a tiny parliamentary majority of 18 that may well fall below that number in years to come. Lurking behind him in the Commons and licking their wounds will be dozens of backbenchers who backed Brexit and failed to deliver it. Whatever they say publicly now, they will not sit quietly and watch Cameron delight in victory.</p> <p>Many of his MPs say Cameron\u2019s life will be easier if he loses. They could be right. One says: \u201cThink what will happens if he wins and Cameron goes to his first EU summit after a Remain vote. The other 27 EU leaders break out into a round of applause and greet their hero saying, \u2018Now thanks to you, David, we can move forward with our great European project.\u2019 How will that go down in the party back home?\u201d</p> <p>Intriguingly, most Brexit supporters, including the chairman of the 1922 committee, Graham Brady, insist that, if there is a vote to leave, Cameron must remain as prime minister. Brady says it will be essential to ensure stability in what will be an inevitably difficult period, not least on the financial markets. But will Cameron really want that: to be on parade daily as a defeated leader, helping to deliver stability after defeat, as the markets tumble, as he warned they would do throughout the campaign? Or will he bow out, and let the Brexiteers deal with what Brexit means on their own?</p> <h2>BLUE-ON-BLUE ATTACKS</h2> <p><strong>Michael Gove: \u2018</strong>The European court of justice is not bound by this agreement until treaties are changed and we don\u2019t know when that will be.

The result is a tense slice of neo-noir that has won Dhand comparisons to both BBC drama <em>Luther</em> and HBO\u2019s <em>The Wire</em>. <a href=\"http://www.thebookseller.com/news/film-rights-aa-dhands-bradford-thriller-sold-filmwave-327542\">Television rights were sold</a> before the book\u2019s publication in June, with FilmWave, the producer behind the recent adaptation of JK Rowling\u2019s <em>The Casual Vacancy</em>, working with Dhand on a series.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019d been writing for a while before I came up with the idea for this story,\u201d says Dhand, who continues to work as a pharmacist in Bradford. \u201cI kept trying things that didn\u2019t work because they drew on the detective fiction I\u2019d already read \u2013 so heavy-drinking white detectives with family problems. That\u2019s great but it wasn\u2019t credible when I wrote it.\u201d He continues: \u201cI wanted to create characters who hadn\u2019t been seen before, yet at the same time I didn\u2019t want Harry to just be intensely Asian for the sake of it because that also wasn\u2019t credible. It was important that the character and setting both felt right.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47cb8dd85c4442277193e85ad226f79864d585e3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47cb8dd85c4442277193e85ad226f79864d585e3/0_85_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Idris Elba in Luther.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Idris Elba in Luther. Streets of Darkness has been compared to the acclaimed BBC drama.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steffan Hill/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The central storyline about the murder of a prominent Bradford businessman, which initially appears to have a BNP connection, came together when Dhand realised it was coming up to the 15-year anniversary of the Bradford riots.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a darkness to every city and I do think Bradford gets a negative press,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to take that conception and somehow subvert it. There\u2019s this idea that the story of the Bradford riots is a story of Asians going crazy \u2013 we lost control of the message in that way \u2013 and I wanted to write a book where it seems like a similar thing is about to unfold, but instead the real story is something very different.\u201d</p> <p>Key to that story is his charismatic lead character, a Sikh police officer with a very clear sense both of his identity and his position within the world. \u201cHarry would describe himself as British English,\u201d says Dhand. \u201cHis identity is British and that was important to me because I really wanted a character of Indian parentage and heritage who was also living in the here and now.</p> <p>\u201cI think it can be very easy to take identity for granted, yet at the same time people seem not to know what it is to be British these days. To me it\u2019s about acceptance, tolerance and patriotism about your city and country. And that\u2019s true of everyone.</p> <p>\u201cYou can have a character like Luther who is played by Idris Elba and is black, but if he were played by a white actor he would still be totally compelling, in the same way James Bond doesn\u2019t have to be played by a white man, it\u2019s the character that works.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough Harry is Asian, that\u2019s not what defines him and that\u2019s not how he would define himself.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say that Harry\u2019s background and heritage is ignored. A key plot strand regards his wife, Saima, who is Muslim, a relationship that has caused difficulties with both sets of parents.</p> <p>\u201cThat was really important to me because the pharmacy I work at is connected to a women\u2019s refuge centre and I\u2019d had so many conversations with young Asian women about how lost and marginalised and judged they felt for marrying outside their religion,\u201d says Dhand, the son of Punjabi Hindus who describes himself as agnostic. \u201cAt the same time, a lot of what you read about the Asian community is all about shame and dishonour and I wanted instead to present a relationship where they bounce off each other and understand each other. Saima is a fierce woman. She\u2019s formidable.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fadbc01f164e848ec5494803e968bcf97314d4a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fadbc01f164e848ec5494803e968bcf97314d4a0/0_5_3848_2309/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Henshaw, David Morrissey and Andrew Garfield in Channel 4\u2019s Red Riding.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Henshaw, David Morrissey and Andrew Garfield in Channel 4\u2019s Red Riding.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: c.IFC Films/Everett / Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Until recently, Dhand continued to put in shifts at the family corner shop \u2013 \u201calthough that\u2019s now sold, thankfully\u201d \u2013 as well as working at the pharmacy. He credits both jobs with giving him the insights needed to portray every aspect of Bradfordian life, from the wheelers and dealers in the mayor\u2019s office to the heroin addicts on the fringes.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019re dealing with people all day and you learn so much about them,\u201d he says. \u201cI probably serve about 300 people a day \u2026 It\u2019s a constant conversation. You learn what people are scared about. You learn what their habits are, what they buy, how they talk. I\u2019ll sell nicotine patches to someone one day and the next day they\u2019re back buying 20 cigarettes.\u201d</p> <p>For FilmWave, the book\u2019s appeal lies in that air of verisimilitude. The company\u2019s founder, Paul Trijbits, has described it as intense and timely, but Dhand says he just hopes that people find his home city a fascinating place to hang out.</p> <p>\u201cI love it that people have made comparisons to <em>The Wire</em> and I would love it if people read the books \u2013 or later saw the TV series \u2013 and got a feel for Bradford in the same way,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cI walk around this city and it feels like nothing else, with the old world represented by the mills and then the new world of Bradford City Park and the waterfall and fountains. It\u2019s a calmer city since the days of the riots in 2001 but still its own place. Walking around in it does sometimes feel like being in a film and I hope that sense of atmosphere comes across.\u201d</p> <p><em>Streets of Darkness by AA Dhand is published by Transworld on 16 June.

      "body": "<p><strong>The Garden House Inn, Framwellgate, Peth, Durham DH1 4NQ (0191 386 3395). Meal for two, including drinks and service: \u00a370</strong></p> <p>On the pavement outside <a href=\"http://www.gardenhouseinn.com/\">Durham\u2019s Garden House Inn</a> is a blackboard sign. It reads: \u201cFood now being served.\u201d It\u2019s a very quiet way by which to announce the noisy, muscular, sometimes thrilling cooking to be found inside this pub just outside the city centre. God knows the people of Durham need to be made aware of it. I found out about the things going on in there courtesy of the rather brilliant <a href=\"http://www.secretdiner.org/\">Secret Diner</a>, the restaurant critic for the Newcastle-based Journal newspaper. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Nobody leaves complaining about portion size. This is Durham. They do things properly here</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In a recent review of the Garden House Inn they \u2013 I don\u2019t know their gender, and the English language is unhelpful in these situations \u2013 bemoaned the lack of good restaurants in Durham. This saves me the hassle of doing so. Blame the Secret Diner. Apparently the worthwhile possibilities numbered just two: <a href=\"http://www.restaurantdh1.co.uk/\">DH1</a>, which has the light sheen and gloss of fine dining about it, and Bistro 21 \u2013 part of the 21 Hospitality Group belonging to chef and restaurateur Terry Laybourne.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c99ad749311039f3e8f747c0c4fd6e60a03159d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c99ad749311039f3e8f747c0c4fd6e60a03159d9/175_284_3889_2333/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Light and finishable\u2019: chicken pasty with grilled leeks and chive mash.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Light and finishable\u2019: chicken pasty with grilled leeks and chive mash.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The greedy of Newcastle and Durham ought to erect statues to Laybourne. He\u2019s a grafter whose businesses have provided a benchmark for informal quality in the region for years. One of the first restaurants I reviewed for this column almost exactly 17 years ago, 21 Queen Street in Newcastle, was Laybourne\u2019s, and he has continued feeding the area well in the years in between \u2013 not merely by supplying good restaurants but also by training up chefs. Which in a way is what he has done here. Because Bistro 21 closed not long ago, reducing the city\u2019s choices to one, and the head chef Ruari MacKay turned up here with his colleagues at this low-ceilinged pub.</p> <p>It has cosy nooks, country house furniture and soft furnishings. There\u2019s a large conservatory out back, but upfront is where the charm has been punched up to maximum. Depending on your point of view the menu is eclectic, restless or just plain bonkers. It\u2019s a bunch of things they like to cook, few of which have any business being corralled together on the same piece of paper.</p> <p>When the dishes have little in common with each other like this, they each have to make a case for themselves. It\u2019s a mark of the kitchen\u2019s chops that almost everything, from the hardy, man-of-the-people chicken pasty, through the Russian-oligarch-slumming-it luxe of a lobster sandwich to the bang-on-trend cool of Korean pork belly, finds its target. The latter is listed as a bar snack at just \u00a33.50, but I could well imagine slipping in here by myself and ordering three portions of this and hoping nobody noticed. Then again I do have a filthy imagination.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c8b4347a161e470bdb5f7a401b55492770062691\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8b4347a161e470bdb5f7a401b55492770062691/999_228_2529_2529/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Don\u2019t get that sauce down your shirt; it will never come out\u2019: Korean pork belly.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Don\u2019t get that sauce down your shirt; it will never come out\u2019: Korean pork belly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The pork belly is in squares and has been cooked long and slow until it is almost falling apart. Yet somehow it has a crisp shell which has been then drenched in a deep red glaze of umami and fire with a hint of Sriracha sauce in its depths, which is an amiable slap around the chops. Don\u2019t get that sauce down your shirt; it will never come out. The pork belly is crunchy and soft, sweet and savoury. A dice of spring onion is added to make you feel good about yourself. Other bar snacks include a haggis scotch egg, all crumbly offal and pepper, served warm with a yolk making a bid for freedom, and breaded monkfish cheeks with a coarse-cut tartar sauce.</p> <p>Among the starters there are lobes of ham hock that break with the push of a spoon, in a limpid hammy broth with fresh peas bursting sweetly between the teeth and another soft boiled egg. It\u2019s a soothing and, most of all, generous plateful for \u00a36. Everything here is generous. They are on a mission to feed. Nobody gets to leave the Garden House Inn complaining about the portion size. This is Durham. They do things properly here.</p> <p>A Thai prawn and mussel broth, the fire soothed with coconut milk, is a passable effort as are three cheese croquettes. The star, though is that lobster sandwich, at \u00a310 the most expensive starter. For that you get at least half a lobster and enormous attention to detail. The bread element is sweet, toasted brioche. The shells have been roasted and a broth made which has been reduced down then used to loosen the mayo, until it is the essence of the shellfish it is binding. I run my finger around the pot of extra mayo on the side to check, then check again. Next to the two sandwiches is a lump of claw meat because, well, why not? The lobster sandwich has serious class. Make that two portions of Korean pork and one of these. Yours for \u00a317.</p> <p>A vast main course of lamb shoulder, the strands of meat spoolable on to a fork like spaghetti, have been given the Anglo-Indian treatment. The lamb has been put in its place by a broad-spectrum garam masala in the best of ways so that it is sweet and fiery and cries out to be scooped up into the accompanying flatbreads. That chicken pasty is a whole breast, inside a crimped and glazed shortcrust pastry shell, on chive mash. It could be heavy and relentless, but somehow manages to be light and finishable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e29d7bafc03b9cc107cba2bdf0ab822cd939e262\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e29d7bafc03b9cc107cba2bdf0ab822cd939e262/0_291_4368_2621/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018An unbalanced dish\u2019: monkfish, \u2019Nduja, wild garlic and roast potatoes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Monkfish, \u2019Nduja, wild garlic and roast potatoes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The most expensive main, at \u00a315, brings sizable pieces of monkfish, which have been taken down a back alley and given a proper beating by \u2019Nduja \u2013 the salty, chilli-boosted soft salami of Calabria, which melts unto a crust under heat. (Try it on cheese on toast. No really. Do.) This should be an unbalanced dish. The poor fish should be crying out for mercy. But there are roasted new potatoes for those looking for respite and, anyway, it turns out monkfish rather likes a bit of rough trade. Only the one non-meat dish, wild garlic gnocchi with mushrooms, leeks and a parmesan cream, is a miss. It slips from rich to heavy to an unwelcome challenge, just a little too quickly.</p> <p>Still, there is a solid selection of serviceable wines at prices in the teens which make every London wine list look like an act of extortion. And to follow that, there\u2019s a sticky toffee pudding in a lake of caramel. They make their own ice creams and shortbread biscuits to go with them \u2013 ones that both crack in the hand and melt in the mouth. The sign outside the pub does not lie. They are indeed now serving food at Durham\u2019s Garden House Inn. And how.</p> <h2>Jay\u2019s news bites<br /></h2> <p>\u25a0 The Raby Hunt, a 40-minute drive south from Durham, is a genuine original. Chef James Close strains every sinew to get flavour into his dishes: cylinders of duck liver parfait come wrapped in thin leaves of smoked eel, alongside beetroot; roasted marrowbone is dressed with anchovy and basil; a milk chocolate parfait yields up a centre of salted caramel. Yes, it costs, but you get your money\u2019s worth (<a href=\"http://rabyhuntrestaurant.co.uk/\">rabyhunt restaurant.co.uk</a>).</p> <p>\u25a0 A survey by online money-saving site <a href=\"http://www.promotionalcodes.org.uk/\">promotionalcodes.org.uk</a> has found that the less your food has in it, the more it costs. Or to put it another way, you pay a premium to go gluten free. Regular penne pasta costs 59p per 500g; gluten free it\u2019s \u00a31.20. Gluten-free chocolate biscuits are double the price, and sausage rolls almost four times more expensive.</p> <p>\u25a0 And so to my regular update on the rising value of cake, particularly at Patisserie Valerie: the holding company has recorded a 14.4% increase in revenue over the six months to 31 March, with a 20% rise in profits to \u00a38.4m.

Clownfish (Nemo\u2019s ilk) are usually bred in captivity for the aquarium trade, but blue tangs are \u201charvested\u201d from the wild for aquariums, with up to 80% dying during capture and transportation. There is intense pressure on wild populations, especially around coral reefs.</p> <p>The preferred method of capture remains squirting cyanide straight on to the coral reefs they inhabit.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'Tankbusters' are an ugly feature of home aquariums. Bought as pretty juveniles, these species grow large very quickly</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Of 12.5m tropical fish entering the US each year, 90% are thought to be harvested this way. To identify \u201cgood\u201d \u2013 essentially captive-bred \u2013 fish for aquariums, try the mobile app <a href=\"http://www.hsi.org/news/press_releases/2014/09/tank-watch-new-mobile-app-091014.html?referrer=https://www.google.co.uk/\" title=\"\">Tank Watch</a>.</p> <p>That, however, is not the end of the story. So-called \u201ctankbusters\u201d are an ugly feature of many home aquariums in the UK. Bought as pretty juveniles, these are species, such as pacu and pangasius, that grow large very quickly.</p> <p>It\u2019s a pet-shop myth that fish only grow to the size of their tanks. Many species are characterised by indeterminate growth. The result has been a fish that would migrate thousands of miles in the wild ending up trapped in a tank in which it can barely turn as its muscles atrophy.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://bigfishcampaign.org/\" title=\"\">Big Fish Campaign</a>, promoting responsible fish-keeping in the hobby and aquatic trade, suggests you only buy where retailers have a \u201cNo big fish policy\u201d. Anyone who found that Nemo grew beyond all recognition and has tried to re-home a big fish will know how difficult it can be. <a href=\"http://fishrescueandwelfare.org/\" title=\"\">Fish Rescue and Welfare</a> is a rare charity that does this. Public aquariums around the country report that they are inundated with requests to rehome, but their focus is on research and conservation.</p> <p>Scientists have watched in horror as stocks of species such as the giant Mekong catfish have fallen by 90% in the last 20 years (also due to the building of hydroelectric dams). Increasingly, their tanks will be full of these endangered species \u2013 leaving not much room for unwanted blue tangs.</p> <h2>The big picture: Tomorrow documentary</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d35f2b65daa840617ec53075128b2fb034ea838\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d35f2b65daa840617ec53075128b2fb034ea838/0_112_3360_2016/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Four people walking in front of sharp rocks\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow: in this eco documentary, six people explore the world in search of solutions that can save their children and future generations</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Rather than characters in search of an author, the <em>Tomorrow</em> team are filmmakers in search of a distributor.

      "body": "<p><strong>Truly Irresistible Pinotage, Swartland, South Africa 2015 (\u00a36.99, </strong><a href=\"http://www.co-operative.coop/\"><strong>The Co-Operative</strong></a><strong>) </strong>Good pinotage \u2013 now there\u2019s a statement that feels like an oxymoron. This much-maligned South African variety, a crossing between two varieties I like and love \u2013 cinsaut and pinot noir \u2013 has always been less than the sum of its parts, and can taste like a disaster at an industrial sweet factory: ash, rubber, artificial banana. Even with the drinkable ones (from Beyerskloof and Hamilton Russell), I generally feel I\u2019d rather be drinking something else for the price. A new addition at The Co-operative shows it doesn\u2019t have to be that way, however. It\u2019s made by the very talented Duncan Savage and, with its effortlessly supple berry juiciness, it\u2019s like a slightly wilder, deeper Beaujolais. A genuine bargain.</p> <p><strong>Delas C\u00f4tes du Ventoux, Rh\u00f4ne, France 2013 (\u00a36.49, </strong><a href=\"http://www.co-operative.coop/\"><strong>The Co-Operative</strong></a><strong>) </strong>The Co-op\u2019s wine department is on good form at the moment with plenty worth looking out for if you\u2019re popping in for the pinotage. There\u2019s a fine range of Rh\u00f4ne reds, starting with the appealingly savoury and succulent C\u00f4tes du Ventoux 2014 made by the reliable Delas and rising to a sumptuously chewy, sweetly spiced Ch\u00e2teauneuf-du-Pape 2014 from the Co-operative (\u00a315.99). Domaine les Grandes Costes Pic St-Loup 2013 (\u00a314.39) does a similarly evocative sun-baked grenache-syrah southern French thing, and the peppery Sacred Hill Reserve Hawkes Bay Syrah 2014 (\u00a39.99) is an elegant Kiwi that takes its cue from the Northern Rh\u00f4ne.</p> <p><strong>Ch\u00e2teau de la Petite Giraudi\u00e8re Muscadet S\u00e8vre et Maine Sur Lie, Loire, France 2015 (\u00a36.75, </strong><a href=\"http://www.co-operative.coop/\"><strong>The Co-Operative</strong></a><strong>) </strong>When it comes to whites and fizz, the Co-op stocks two standout wines: the latest vintages of both Les Pionniers Vintage Champagne 2006 (\u00a324.99) from the Heidsieck champagne stable and Denis Dubourdieu\u2019s tangy, toasty sauvignon-s\u00e9millon Bordeaux white blend Clos Floridi\u00e8ne Graves Blanc 2014 (\u00a317.49). Both are as fine as ever. I was impressed, too, by the stone-fruit richness in Italian white Truly Irresistible Fiano 2014 (\u00a36.99) and the estuarine tang of Ch\u00e2teau de la Petite Giraudi\u00e8re\u2019s muscadet. Finally, the Co-op\u2019s Cava Rosado Brut NV (\u00a35.99) is more interesting than prosecco at this price.</p> <p><em>Follow David on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daveydaibach\">@Daveydaibach</a></em></p>",

      "body": "<h2>Wallander</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC1</strong><br />The long goodbye continues. The case pursued in Henning Mankell\u2019s final crime novel, The Troubled Man \u2013 about Linda Wallander\u2019s imposing new father-in-law \u2013 is low in the mix for now, with Kurt (Kenneth Branagh) instead trying to focus on a vanished young woman. The drama focuses on the detective\u2019s disintegrating mind. His blanks and wobbles lead to more elegant pauses than ever, in a penultimate episode so underplayed it\u2019s virtually subterranean.<em> Jack Seale</em></p> <h2>Top Gear</h2> <p><strong>8pm, BBC2<br /></strong>Chris Evans and Matt LeBlanc launch the new-look motoring magazine show, but can they manage to put their own stamp on a format that \u2013 for all its controversy \u2013 was something of a national institution? As the series kicks off, Evans heads to Nevada to take on female racing driver Sabine Schmitz, whose inclusion seems a necessary step post-Clarkson. Elsewhere, LeBlanc explores Morocco in a souped-up buggy and there\u2019s a UK v US showdown. <em>Hannah J Davies</em></p> <h2>Yeti: Myth, Man Or Beast? </h2> <p><strong> 8pm, Channel 4<br /></strong>Mark Evans, presenter of Bigfoot Files, attempts to unravel the mystery of Tibet\u2019s unofficial mascot. With the help of genetic experts and mountaineer Reinhold Messner, the affable TV vet puts two theories under the microscope. Could the world\u2019s most elusive Chewbacca impersonator be a remnant of the Denisovans, a supposedly extinct human species? Or is the abominable snowman actually just a rare bear? <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p> <h2>Channel 4\u2019s Comedy Gala 2016 </h2> <p><strong>9pm, Channel 4</strong><br />The annual all-star standup bash held at London\u2019s O2 Arena returns for a seventh year, with money raised from tickets and DVD sales going to Great Ormond Street Hospital Children\u2019s Charity. This time around, those lending their talents to the cause include Aisling Bea, The Last Leg\u2019s Josh Widdicombe and Alex Brooker, Warwick Davis, Sean Lock, Seann Walsh, Shappi Khorsandi and Alan \u201cChatty Man\u201d Carr. Plus Jake Bugg will provide tunes. <em>Jonathan Wright</em></p> <h2>Damien Hirst And Jeff Koons Side By Side: The Interview </h2> <p><strong>11pm, BBC4</strong><br />To coincide with the opening of a significant new Jeff Koons exhibition, curated by Damien Hirst at the latter\u2019s gallery in London\u2019s Vauxhall, Kirsty Wark interviews these two remarkably well-remunerated titans of modern art. While the camera dribbles over Koons\u2019s Duchamp-inspired readymades and priceless play-dough, Hirst insists he doesn\u2019t think money [in art] \u201cshould be considered a dirty word\u201d. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>Naked And Afraid </h2> <p><strong>9pm, Discovery<br /></strong>More pixelated nude survivalism, with 26-year-old Chalese, an endurance sports nut from Utah, and Steven, a cocky Robin Thicke lookalike from Florida, thrown together in the Alabama backwoods, where there are bears, deadly spiders and 50 species of snake. Soon enough, they\u2019re cuddling in the buff, clubbing creatures to death and eating still-beating snake hearts. But a storm and a few tough, snake meat-free days threaten to derail their outback existence. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2>11.22.63</h2> <p><strong>9pm, FOX<br /></strong>The finale of the well-presented \u201cwhat if...\u201d series about the Kennedy assassination, based on Stephen King\u2019s book. James Franco\u2019s Jake readies himself for the frantic last leg of his mission to thwart Lee Harvey Oswald at the Dallas book depository, hindered persistently by The Past. Events then take a somewhat ironic turn, as Jake is forced to contemplate what success or failure in altering the future means, not just for humanity but those closest to him. <em>David Stubbs</em></p> <h2>Film choice</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c0e5626f6e6a4e68cc31343da0322b97a285e1f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c0e5626f6e6a4e68cc31343da0322b97a285e1f9/0_104_2988_1792/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Matt Damon in Good Will Hunting\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Matt Damon in Good Will Hunting.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/MIRAMAX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Good Will Hunting<br />(Gus Van Sant, 1997), 10.05pm, ITV3</strong><br />The film that showed hot young actors Matt Damon and Ben Affleck were more than just pretty faces: they scripted this well-crafted drama about Will Hunting (Damon), a university janitor-cum-maths whiz who is far brighter than the students. He has to learn to trust himself, and others \u2013 including Minnie Driver\u2019s loving Brit student and Oscar-winning Robin Williams\u2019s volatile shrink. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <p><strong>Grosse Pointe Blank<br />(George Armitage, 1997), 11.40pm, BBC1</strong><br />At the Grosse Pointe high school reunion there are the usual types: bankers, doctors, lawyers \u2013 plus John Cusack\u2019s Martin Blank, who is a hitman. He\u2019s in town to go to the party, make up with the prom date (Minnie Driver) he jilted all those years ago, assassinate someone, and to come to an arrangement with his big rival, Dan Aykroyd\u2019s Mr Grocer. One of the smartest comedies of the 90s, it merges elements of romance and thriller into a brilliantly witty, offbeat tale.</p> <h2>Today\u2019s Live Sport</h2> <p><strong>Test Cricket: England v Sri Lanka 10.30am, Sky Sports 2<br /></strong>The third day\u2019s play from Durham.</p> <p><strong>Formula 1: Monaco Grand Prix 12.30pm, Sky Sports F1<br /></strong>The sixth round of the season.</p> <p><strong>League One Football: Barnsley v Millwall 2pm, Sky Sports 1<br /></strong>The Championship awaits for the winners of this playoff.</p> <p><strong>International Rugby Union: England v Wales 2.30pm, <br />Sky Sports 3</strong><br />Pre-tour warm-up for both sides.</p>",

      "body": "<p>A British bank holiday usually calls for a trip to the ice cream van, even if there is more drizzle\u00a0than dazzling sunshine. But go easy - a big bite of a\u00a099\u00a0Flake can quickly give you a headache, sometimes known as \u2018brain freeze\u2019.</p> <p>While this name describes the feeling, it\u2019s wrong, as the brain doesn\u2019t have any pain receptors of its own. So why does a cold sensation in the mouth lead to pain in the head?</p> <p>The long trigeminal nerve picks up sensations from the mouth, nose, teeth and forehead. A sudden chill causes blood vessels in the roof of the mouth to constrict and dilate, sending pain signals through the trigeminal nerve to the brain.</p> <p>But this pain is felt in the forehead instead of the mouth. This could be because the forehead is more exposed to the outside world, so the brain assumes the signal is coming from there instead. This phenomenon is known as \u2018referred pain\u2019, and is also seen in heart attacks, when pain is felt in the shoulders or back. Luckily \u2018brain freeze\u2019 only lasts a few seconds and can be easily ended by swallowing quickly \u2013 at least until your next bite.</p> <p><em>Dr Daniel Glaser is director of </em><a href=\"https://london.sciencegallery.com/\" title=\"\"><em>Science Gallery</em></a><em> at King\u2019s College London</em></p>",

But a recent study conducted in Canada found that atheists scored around 19% higher on such tests than people who identified as affiliated to a religion. The researchers also combined the findings of previous studies on this topic (more than 15,000 participants) into a meta-analysis, finding a significant, though modest, negative relationship between test performance and religious belief (0.18 on a scale from 0 to 1). These findings, on their own, don\u2019t necessarily suggest that religious people are less intelligent, but that they tend to have a thinking style that is more intuitive than analytical.</p> <p><br /><strong>Answers</strong> 4 days, 29 students, \u00a320</p> <p><br /><em>A fully referenced version of this article is available at </em><a href=\"https://benambridge.wordpress.com/\" title=\"\"><em>benambridge.com</em></a><em>.

      "body": "<p>A green light at the end of the tunnel \u2013 the night tube is coming.</p> <p><strong>1am </strong>A knackered city clerk makes her way back to Ealing. She applied her make-up on the commuter train to work; she removes it on the way home with a blousy sigh. With the night tube comes the night passengers, night conversations, night litter, all of a quality quite different from day. Kebab wrappers, phone numbers, face wipes, discarded by those getting ready for bed. The night tube is one of the most intimate places in Britain, second only after shopping-centre beauty counters where women get their moustaches waxed in their lunch break.</p> <p><strong>2am </strong>A man sits alone. This is not new \u2013 he was born this way. Tonight he left his office, where he works with eight people, six of whom think his name is Ahmed, one of whom calls him <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/dec/09/tolkien-death-of-smaug-began-america-middle-earth\">Smaug</a> on account of the only thing she knows about him coming from the team-building exercise where he expressed an interest in dragons. He left his office with the intention of changing his life and that, he decided, would start with a visit to a place called Wetherspoons. It wasn\u2019t unfun \u2013 you could clearly see the cornicing and plaster details of the church, painted over, which he liked \u2013 but the drinks were too sweet, it was too loud, and the only person who spoke to him also tried to steal his phone. It was with some relief that he allowed himself to leave the bar stool with the knowledge that no lives could be changed in a room that noisy, and walk towards the station, where the novelty of the ticket machines remaining alight tickled him. He boarded a train, and he sits alone. As the doors start to close, a person slips between them with a sigh. They slump across from him, and from their pocket, gratefully remove a book. On its cover, a monster breathes red fire. The man is not alone.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In four years\u2019 time a great novel will be published, having been written right now on the Circle line</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>3am </strong>Ravers are debriefing with strangers, the recently divorced are finding themselves as they miss their stops. The poets, between inspirations. Insomniacs are riding off their coffees. Like montage sequences from happier times, the front pages of yesterday\u2019s free papers fly past tired faces in platform winds; a housing crisis, a doctor\u2019s strike, the most adorable little murder. The night tube becomes more than just a train. The night does that to a place.</p> <p><strong>4am </strong>Much has been lost. You are holding the pole and mourning minicab karaoke, Magic FM supplying the romance and beauty that was lacking at the party due to the host insisting the lights were kept on throughout. You are mourning lost excuses \u2013 no more opportunities to leave before the last train. No, thanks to the night tube you leant on that fridge and kept on nodding until this man whose features seem to have all slipped into the very centre of his face, as if rushing toward a plughole, until he had finished telling you exactly what it means to be an analogue thinker in a digital world. No excuses. You see a series of long nights ahead. You will lie in that friend-of-a-friend\u2019s bed long after you\u2019ve stopped enjoying the smell of them, long after you have realised they are very much not \u201cthe one\u201d. Long after you have dismissed the concept itself, and long after, too, you have had a heated conversation with yourself about the poison and pain within the very concept. This while the friend-of-a-friend is pissing loudly in the sink. Before, you would have been on the midnight train, flushed and dozy, and still a believer in love.</p> <p><strong>5am </strong>The tube map is being pinned with life experience. In four years\u2019 time a great novel will be published, having been written right now on the Circle line. In three years\u2019 time night passengers will witness a wedding in carriage four, a couple who fell on to each other when the tube lurched forward at five past five \u2013 she caught him. Which is what he will say in his speech as they pass Ladbroke Grove. In one year\u2019s time, a newborn baby will be named Angel after its place of conception.

      "body": "<p>It is not unusual for Anthony D\u2019Argenzio to remove a painting from his apartment wall and take it to work with him. He is a prop stylist for photography shoots and creative events, and his home doubles as a prop store. That\u2019s not to say it is a collection of random junk. The tiny New York apartment is a carefully curated tableau with everything designed and placed to create a visual statement.</p> <p>Throughout his living space, props repeatedly lend themselves to decoration. An old wooden ladder hangs horizontally above the kitchen shelves. As you enter the hallway, two slim reclaimed windowpanes are fixed either side of the wall, because he likes the way they look.</p> <p>D\u2019Argenzio is creative director of photographic styling agency <a href=\"http://zioandsons.com/\">Zio &amp; Sons</a>, and his most used item from home is a small still life oil painting of tangerines. He picks these things up on his travels, at flea markets and at regular visits to the stylists\u2019 mecca <a href=\"https://brimfieldantiquefleamarket.com/\">Brimfield Antique Show </a>in Massachusetts. \u201cIt\u2019s where Soho House and Ralph Lauren send huge teams of buyers,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ll buy all the Chesterfields or all the trunks and then put them in storage until they need them.\u201d Just down the street from his home, D\u2019Argenzio has studio space where he houses the majority of his own prop collection.</p> <p>He lives in his one-bedroom Alphabet City apartment with his wife, Hillary, and their dog, Sabra. It\u2019s part of a co-operative they bought three years ago from a \u201cPuerto Rican grandma\u201d who had a fondness for curtain swags and pink. \u201cAll the rooms had been boxed out in the 80s and were really small,\u201d he remembers. One of the first things he did when they moved into the apartment was to remove the dry wall and expose the brick behind it, adding 25cm to the perimeter of each of the rooms.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"389fbeaa98d988ac9bd09607fcf06286a8acab6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/389fbeaa98d988ac9bd09607fcf06286a8acab6c/0_460_3660_3969/922.jpg\" alt=\"Creating space: a coffee table slides away to create a bigger living area.\" width=\"922\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Creating space: a coffee table slides away to create a bigger living area.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marili Forastieri</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The whitewashed walls stand out. \u201cIt was dirty brick when we first revealed them,\u201d he says. \u201cKind of tarred and black.\u201d He transformed them by mixing paint and water \u2013 at a ratio of four to one \u2013 to get a milky consistency, and applied it with a sponge for mottled coverage. Similarly, he tackled the yellowed wooden floors by bleaching and roughly whitewashing them.</p> <p>Textures are central to D\u2019Argenzio\u2019s look. Against one of the bumpy walls sits a smooth, plump navy sofa. To disguise a hot water pipe he tightly wound it in rope. \u201cThat took about 300ft of different types of rope and a month of winding and gluing,\u201d he recalls. It\u2019s no mistake that there\u2019s a nautical feel to the place with its whites, blues and wood. \u201cWhen I was doing the design, I didn\u2019t want it to feel as if you were in New York City,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted it to be more like a little beach shack.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76985bf15bf7c988446b85730409b1141ad2ea71\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76985bf15bf7c988446b85730409b1141ad2ea71/0_365_3840_4238/906.jpg\" alt=\"Colour pop: plants and carefully collected items of crockery add areas of interest to the living room.\" width=\"906\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colour pop: plants and carefully collected items of crockery add areas of interest to the living room.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Marili Forastieri</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s this mix of textures that gives depth to his small open-plan kitchen. The small breakfast bar is made of reclaimed wood from an old church. He constructed a copper pot rack out of piece of piping that he found at a hardware shop. The original wooden under-counter cabinets have been painted, finished with new handles and topped with a slab of salvaged marble which D\u2019Argenzio found for $100. Even the ceiling is lined with panels of tongue-and-groove board.</p> <p>D\u2019Argenzio replaced the original upper wall cabinets with open shelves. As well as allowing more light in the space, his cooking objects and crockery became display items, offset against walls finished with an oversized subway tile.</p> <p>In the lounge, the emphasis is on transformative space saving. When guests come for dinner, a drop-down desk closes and a folding dining table opens. A coffee table slides under a built-in storage unit stacked with trinkets (\u201cMy wife says I have too many <em>tchotchkes.</em>\u201d) The anomaly is the massive sofa. \u201cWe thought, if you\u2019re going to be in a small space, you might as well fill the area with something comfortable for people to sit on.\u201d</p> <p>And that\u2019s where the attraction of the space lies \u2013in comfort. D\u2019Argenzio\u2019s aim of creating a space that takes you away from the city has been achieved. Sinking into the big blue couch, you\u2019ve got all the beauty of a well-designed photography set with the relaxed vibe of a beach shack.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-29T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>I hear it at least once a week: \u201cTo help our British wildlife we must focus on growing native plants.\u201d It\u2019s evangelised on gardening TV shows, in horticultural magazines and has even found its way into planning legislation. The one problem with this ubiquitous piece of science advice is that it really isn\u2019t very scientific, and may even hamper your attempts to support local biodiversity.</p> <p>The \u201cnative is best\u201d hypothesis rests on three basic premises: first, that British wildlife is somehow a clear-cut group that is dramatically different from wildlife abroad. Secondly, our native plants are equally unique, with highly specialised adaptations. Finally, that these highly specialised adaptations create a perfect ecological fit, which renders non-indigenous plants measurably worse sources of food and shelter for local animals.</p> <p>Yet in reality, the animals of the British Isles are all relatively recent exotic introductions. They are made up of the quick-footed invaders that managed to recolonise the area in the short geological window between the glaciers of the last ice age retreating and the melting ice caps flooding the English Channel, cutting us off from the continent. Rather than being highly specialised, these invaders are often generalists, capable of living in a huge range of habitats. Many of the most famous \u201cBritish\u201d animals have native ranges that span as far afield as the Canary Islands to Siberia and North Africa to East Asia. To many of these animals, an alpine meadow or subtropical swamp is just as \u201cnative\u201d as British oak woodland.</p> <p>A great irony is that much of the current advice recommends planting flowering plants of traditional cornfields. These might strike a nostalgic chord with gardeners, they might be beautiful and they might indeed be great for wildlife. But they are also invasive arable weed species that were only brought to our shores when the first farmers decimated native forest and replaced it with wheat fields. Because defining what is truly \u201cnative\u201d is notoriously complex and largely subjective, we simply apply the label to things we happen to find attractive and emotive, regardless of origin.</p> <p>Studies consistently show that the strictly native plants are not superior food sources for wildlife.

They held the Thunder to just one basket and three free-throws in those final five minutes.</p> <p>Now the Warriors go back to Oakland\u2019s Oracle Arena for Monday night\u2019s Game 7, where they will be heavily favored to earn their second-straight finals appearance.</p> <p>On the verge of elimination, Curry turned back into Curry. His struggles in the first games of the series disappeared on Saturday night when he hit two smooth, confident three-pointers in the final five minutes. The kind he used to make before the Thunder began knocking him around the court. He scored 10 points in that last burst, batted away Oklahoma City players\u2019 passes, and looked everything like the player who had been missing the last two weeks. Just when the Warriors needed him.</p> <p>\u201cAbout time we have a stretch where we opposed our will,\u201d he later said.</p> <p>The Thunder, though, collapsed. This has been all too familiar a script for Oklahoma City in recent years. But the Thunder thought those days had passed. Behind new coach Billy Donovan, they had transformed themselves into a rugged defensive team that crushed the league\u2019s most beautiful, free-flowing offense. Then it was gone.</p> <p>Oklahoma City began to miss the shots that had fallen earlier in the series. The Warriors became more aggressive defensively, and the Thunder\u2019s Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook tried to force passes and shots late. What should have been a celebration on the way to a meeting with Cleveland in the finals tuned into a panicked rush to save the series. Under pressure, Oklahoma City fell apart.</p> <p>\u201cWe missed some shots and they got hot from three,\u201d Durant said.</p> <p>But more than the Thunder\u2019s late-game tumble, Game 6 will be remembered for Thompson\u2019s three-pointers. \u201cHe was ridiculous,\u201d Golden State coach Steve Kerr said. \u201cHis shooting was some of the most incredible shooting I will ever see.\u201d He hit shots from the corner. He hit shots off passes from the side. He hit shots seemingly without even looking and he even hit a a shot just two steps in from center court \u2013 normally Curry\u2019s domain.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLYZMVzqTwk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WLYZMVzqTwk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>He has always been one of the best shooters in the league, but as the guard who plays beside Curry, he is a second option, overshadowed by the MVP. On Saturday, the Warriors needed him to be Curry until Curry could find his missing shot. Even Curry shook his head later and said: \u201cHe made some great shots.\u201d</p> <p>On the verge of elimination, Thompson, and then Curry, came through. The Warriors were the Warriors again, and now with a trip back to Oakland that the Thunder do not want to make, Golden State suddenly seem back on the path to the finals once again.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It is the morning after the nightmare before. Britain wakes up on 24 June to find that it has chosen to quit the European Union. Breathless reporters tell viewers of breakfast-time news that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/27/david-cameron-boris-johnson-contender-prime-minister\" title=\"\">David Cameron </a>is holed up at No 10 preparing a speech to parliament which is expected to include an announcement that he will be resigning as prime minister. Boris Johnson is already preparing his leadership bid. He has taken a call from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/05/donald-trump-brexit-uk-leaving-european-union\" title=\"\">Donald Trump</a> offering congratulations and campaign tips. Nigel Farage, his ambition achieved and needing a fresh purpose in life, is in talks about merging Ukip with a Borisovian Tory party. Vladimir Putin enjoys a celebratory vodka at the Kremlin. In France, Marine Le Pen tells her enthused supporters that Britain has sounded the death rattle of the EU and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/18/brexeunt-stage-left-europeans-hoping-britain-votes-brexit\" title=\"\">Frexit will follow</a>. In Berlin, a solemn Angela Merkel says...</p> <p>How would the German chancellor and other EU leaders respond? It is an important question. Arguably, there\u2019s no more crucial question in this referendum. Even the most ardent of the Outers have to acknowledge that a Brexiting Britain couldn\u2019t just cast off from its continent and drift into the mid-Atlantic. Britain would still want and need a relationship with our closest neighbours. It has even occasionally been the contention of some Outers that we\u2019d have a better relationship with the EU once we\u2019d self-ejected. So how the rest of the EU would react to Brexit and the impact that Brexit would have on the EU are crucial issues. I suppose it is because they are so crucial that they have barely featured during the referendum campaign.</p> <p>We will soon get some indication of how EU leaders would be likely to respond from the most influential actor among them. I hear that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2016/may/12/angela-merkel-suddenly-looking-politically-mortal\" title=\"\">Angela Merkel</a> is planning an intervention before Britain votes. The precise timing is not yet decided, and the content will require careful calibration to avoid the risk of being counterproductive for the In cause, but her previous statements on the subject allow us to have a jolly good guess about what she will be minded to say. The German chancellor believes that Brexit would be bad for Britain, for Germany and for Europe. She will express German hopes that Britain will choose to stay with the EU. She will stress that, of course, it is for Britain to decide, but she will also emphasise that we should not think that a vote to leave would be without consequences, some of which we might not like. The Outers will doubtless respond to her with their routine shriek of complaint: that excruciating howl they direct at anyone, whether it be the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/25/ifs-brexit-extend-austerity-budget-deficit-eu-referendum\" title=\"\">Institute for Fiscal Studies</a> or the president of the United States, the head of the NHS or the governor of the Bank of England, anyone who dares to express an opinion about the risks of Brexit that the Outers don\u2019t want to hear and don\u2019t want the public to hear. David Cameron and the In campaign will hope that fair-minded voters may think it useful to hear from the leader of the EU\u2019s most populous state whose attitude to Britain will matter whichever way the vote goes.</p> <p>Planning for an intervention by the German chancellor is one sign that Brexit is regarded as a serious threat in European capitals. So is the fact that EU leaders, their diplomats and Brussels officials are working on contingency plans for a coordinated response to a British decision to leave. While the official reaction to Brexit would be expressions of regret coupled with bravura declarations that the show will stay on the road, there could be no disguising that it would be the most severe reverse to the EU in its history. For the first time, the organisation would have lost a member \u2013 a very big member. That would diminish both the EU\u2019s sense of itself and its clout in the\u00a0world.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A post-Britain EU would be likely to drift in a protectionist direction. It could become more closed and parochial</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It would be a profound blow at any time and even more so when the EU is already severely stressed by the refugee crisis, the strains within the eurozone, the rise of anti-European nationalists of the hard right and Russian adventurism on its eastern border. It would also have lost a member which, though often a pain in the backside to other players in the EU, has brought a unique contribution to the mix. This is another element missing from the referendum campaign: an account of the positive and very British ways in which this country has influenced the development of the EU. Britain has been a force for extending the single market and striking free trade agreements with countries around the globe. Britain spearheaded the push for enlargement to the east that helped to bind the countries liberated from Soviet tyranny into democratic norms. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/21/obama-arrives-in-london-with-eu-referendum-high-on-the-agenda\" title=\"\">Barack Obama</a> put it rather brilliantly during his recent visit when he observed: \u201cYou should be proud that the EU has helped spread British values \u2013 democracy, the rule of law, open markets \u2013 across the continent and to its periphery. The European Union doesn\u2019t moderate British influence \u2013 it magnifies it.\u201d</p> <p>Britain is one of only two EU states \u2013 the other being France \u2013 with a fully global perspective. Britain with France established an EU defence policy that has undertaken more than 30 peace-keeping and humanitarian missions on three continents. The EU without Britain would be a shrunken player in global affairs.</p> <p>It is reasonable to forecast that a post-Britain EU would be more likely to drift in a protectionist direction. It would be likelier to become more closed and parochial. It would certainly be a weaker actor on the world stage and on its own continent, a prospect that would delight the Kremlin, not least because it would create distance between Europe and the United States. In the immediate aftermath of a British vote to leave, a lot of the EU\u2019s leaders would be very cross and pretty determined to make the terms of Brexit punitive as a deterrent to anyone else flirting with the idea of departure. There would certainly be no willingness to allow Britain to enjoy all the benefits of access to the single market from the outside.</p> <p>The Outers commonly respond that EU leaders would ultimately swallow their anger and cut a special sweetheart deal for Brexiting Britain because it would be in their self-interest to continue trading with one of the world\u2019s largest economies. However jilted the Germans felt, they\u2019d still want to sell us their cars. However infuriated the French might be, they\u2019d still want us to buy their cheese. This is a regular trope of Nigel Farage. Obviously, there\u2019s some truth in it. But it is eclipsed by a much larger truth about our economic relations with the EU. Britain would have a lot more to lose from the absence of a deal, and the party with the more to lose typically comes out worse from a negotiation. Around half of British exports go to buyers in the EU. Only about 10% of exports from the rest of the EU come to Britain. That would leave us with a pretty feeble hand in a Brexit negotiation. Only two countries, Germany and the Netherlands, regularly have substantial trade surpluses with the UK. So they are the only two with much incentive to do a deal. Any one of the 27, including those countries that run trade deficits with Britain, would have a veto. That is why all the detailed analysis of what Brexit would entail comes to the conclusion that divorce negotiations would be extremely difficult, very protracted, terrifically tortuous and not positive for the British economy.</p> <p>That is a relatively benign way of imagining the future relations between a Brexiting Britain and the EU. It assumes that there is still a functioning EU to have a relationship with. There is a more apocalyptic scenario and it is taken seriously by some serious people. They fear that the departure of Britain would set in train such destructive consequences that it would be the beginning of the end for the EU. Some of the Brexiters actively will that result. Their ambition is not confined to amputating Britain from the EU. The ultimate goal is to destroy the EU itself. Michael Gove has predicted that Brexit would trigger \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/19/brexit-could-spark-democratic-liberation-of-continent-says-gove\" title=\"\">the democratic liberation of a whole continent</a>\u201d, an event which he happily calls \u201ca contagion\u201d. It is surely most probable that the continental forces most energised by Brexit would be Le Pen\u2019s Front National and the likes of Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland and the contagion they would spread would be extreme nativism. For all its many faults, since its inception in the wake of the Second World War, the EU has generally been a positive force for liberalism, prosperity, stability, rule of law and tolerance in a continent that devoted many previous centuries to internecine and murderous conflict. In the doomsday scenario that would go into calamitous reverse as Europe fragmented into competing nationalisms. Field <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/09/war-veterans-brexit-risk-stability\" title=\"\">Marshal Lord Bramall</a>, our most senior soldier and no one\u2019s notion of a Euro fanatic, has to be right when he says that it would be catastrophic for Britain to be faced with \u201ca broken and demoralised Europe just across the Channel\u201d. Nightmare wouldn\u2019t begin to describe it.</p>",

They also pointed out Malloy and Frank had been elected in January pursuant to DNC rules.</p> <p>The letter comes less than a week after Democratic leaders signalled a major compromise and <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/05/dnc-bernie-sanders-convention-2016-223477\">agreed to give</a> Sanders increased influence over the party platform. In a deal reached by the DNC with the Sanders and Clinton campaigns, the Vermont senator was able to appoint five of the fifteen members of the party platform committee. One of Sanders\u2019 five appointees was Princeton professor Cornel West, who has repeatedly attacked President Barack Obama, calling him \u201ca Republican in blackface\u201d and trying to <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ralph-nader-cornel-west-lead-effort-to-mount-primary-against-obama/2011/09/17/gIQAB2LaaK_story.html\">organize a primary challenge</a> against him in 2012. West was a vocal supporter of Ralph Nader\u2019s third party candidacy in 2000.</p> <p>Sanders\u2019 attempt to unseat Malloy and Frank raises questions about how willing he would be to get in line behind Hillary Clinton if the former secretary of state clinches the Democratic nomination as is expected on 7 June when a number of states, including California, hold their primaries. Clinton has built up a commanding lead in delegates and is only 73 short of becoming the party\u2019s presumptive nominee. There are 913 delegates still available. </p>",
