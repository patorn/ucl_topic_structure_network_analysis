      "body": "<p>Any sense of a quiet follow-up to the events that marred Saturday\u2019s Scottish Cup final success for Hibernian has been swiftly removed by Rangers, who have berated a variety of groups, including the winners and the country\u2019s football association.</p> <p>Hibs\u2019 3-2 success, their first in the cup for 114 years, was instantly overshadowed by a pitch invasion, which triggered mass brawls as an element of the Rangers support responded to provocation. The Glasgow club have insisted several of their players and staff were also attacked.</p> <p>Police Scotland and the Scottish FA have launched investigations \u2013 11 arrests had been made by Sunday afternoon - but Rangers are furious with what they deem an unacceptable response.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/22/hibernian-condemn-crowd-trouble-cup-win-rangers\">Hibernian condemn crowd trouble which marred Cup win over Rangers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a statement, the club said: \u201cRangers finds it incomprehensible that no one, either from within the Scottish FA or Hibernian Football Club, has condemned Hibernian\u2019s supporters following the violent scenes at the end of [the] Scottish Cup final when Rangers players and members of our backroom staff were physically and verbally assaulted. We have not even had the courtesy of any contact whatsoever from Hibernian to ask after the wellbeing of those who were attacked by their club\u2019s supporters.</p> <p>\u201cThere must be a full independent investigation into the shameful scenes at Hampden. Rangers is also at a complete loss to understand why certain individuals have hastily attempted to gloss over the appalling events which unfolded at the end of Saturday\u2019s final.\u201d Rangers also cited \u201cinadequate\u201d and \u201cfailed\u201d safety procedures.</p> <p>Stewart Regan, the Scottish FA\u2019s chief executive, had described the affair as \u201cshocking and appalling\u201d. Meanwhile Rod Petrie, the Hibs chairman and a vice-president of that association, was widely criticised for putting the behaviour of his club\u2019s fans down to \u201coverexuberance.\u201d</p> <p>Hibs later released a statement, in which they promised to \u201cwork with the authorities to identify any supporter who may have taken part in any form of unacceptable behaviour which has tarnished the club\u2019s reputation\u201d.</p> <p>Alan Stubbs, the Hibs manager, hopes the club can be spared a football sanction. \u201cIt is going to be difficult,\u201d acknowledged Stubbs. \u201cThe players are not to blame. Obviously we are just going to have to wait and see what the ramifications are and the fall-out. Whatever it is we will have to take it on the chin or see if we can somehow get around it.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t condone that [players and staff being attacked] whatsoever. In fact, if that\u2019s the case then it is very poor. I will try to contact Rangers. Everything was cut short; even speaking to Mark Warburton, and commiserating the players, I never had the chance to do that and I always do.\u201d</p> <p>Hibs paraded the cup in Edinburgh on Sunday afternoon. Anthony Stokes sent Stubbs\u2019s men in front after just two minutes of a pulsating final, with Rangers equalising through Kenny Miller. As Andy Halliday edged Rangers ahead, the long Hibs wait looked like being extended. Instead, Stokes and Gray both scored with late headers.</p>",

From Essex to Essen and from Athens to Aarhus, the scale of the vote for the far right will be seen as a death sentence for familiar post-war, centrist politics-as-usual.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/22/austria-election-far-right-candidate-norbert-hofer-ahead-in-exit-poll\">Austria election: far-right candidate and rival tied at 50% in exit poll</a> </p> </aside>  <p> The Freedom party has come a long way since the days of the late J\u00f6rg Haider, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/oct/12/austria-thefarright\">knee-slapping neo-Nazi demagogue</a> from Carinthia who stormed his way into national government in 2000. But Hofer\u2019s smarmier, less confrontational mien does not mean the dilemmas posed by Haider have gone away. </p> <p>The EU took strong exception to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/sep/12/austria.ianblack\">Freedom party\u2019s inclusion in Austria\u2019s coalition government</a> 16 years ago, imposing a range of diplomatic sanctions and effectively placing the country in quarantine. But the measures were short-lived. Smaller EU members such as Denmark objected to what looked like big-boy bullying. </p> <p>Similar EU action is not on the cards this time. This may be because all 28 member states now have their own far-right populist or nationalist parties to contend with. Some, like the True Finns (or Finns) party in Finland, have made it into government. Others, such as the Alternative for Germany and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/19/denmark-kristian-thulesen-dahl-populist-tide\">Danish People\u2019s party</a>, have become influential power-brokers. </p> <p>In Poland, the rightwing nationalist Law and Justice party has used its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/10/poland-abortion-ban-petition-women-streets-law-justice\">autumn election victory</a> to challenge traditional liberal European shibboleths ranging from independence of the judiciary, the media and civil service to the legal right to an abortion. Brussels is understandably alarmed. <br /></p> <p> But Polish defiance of European norms is hardly groundbreaking. A more notorious precedent may be found down the road in Hungary, where the populist prime minister, Viktor Orban, has made a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/jan/20/hungary-eu-media-law\">fetish of bearding Brussels </a>with his anti-free trade, anti-immigrant, pro-Russia policies. So far, he has got away with it. </p> <p>In France, meanwhile, the <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/343715-eu-collapsing-france-lepen/\">far-right National Front of Marine Le Pen</a> is limbering up for next year\u2019s presidential and legislative elections, in which it will have a big say. The outcome there may in turn be influenced by Austria and by how the nationalist, anti-EU Brexit campaigners fare in next month\u2019s British in-out referendum.</p> <p> The motivating issues shared by these far-right and nationalist groupings include fears over the migrant influx from Syria and elsewhere, economic insecurity and lack of jobs, increased public disillusionment with the established centre-left and centre-right parties, distrust of an elitist, undemocratic EU, and a supposed crisis of identity \u2013 meaning the perceived loss of national, ethnic and cultural cohesion.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c3eefa5e8a8dc2737c6d5d44956e649b26957dff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c3eefa5e8a8dc2737c6d5d44956e649b26957dff/0_178_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Marine Le Pen\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marine Le Pen\u2019s far-right party is preparing for presidential and legislative elections in France in 2017.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philippe Lopez/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> What may be done about the resulting political and social upheavals, as witnessed in Austria, is harder to say. EU sanctions in 2000 did not work. Nor did the decision of the two main Austrian parties, the centre-left Social Democrats and the centre-right People\u2019s party, to gang up together to stop Norbert Hofer\u2019s advance.</p> <p> If ostracism is not the way, then either outright opposition or direct engagement (some will call it collaboration) with the far right seem to be the remaining alternatives.</p> <p>In Austria, unlike in Haider\u2019s time, mass street protests against the Freedom party have been noticeable by their absence. In Germany and other European countries, street-level resistance to the rise of the populist right has often been sporadic and disorganised.</p> <p> Britain, seen by some as showing the way by holding a free vote on continued EU membership, may also be leading by example in terms of a reviving hard-left party. The advent of Jeremy Corbyn and the accompanying big increase in Labour party membership can be seen as a direct response to the rise of the far right, including the UK Independence party.</p> <p> Unfortunately for Labour, its own research suggests it is out of touch with the concerns of many traditional supporters over immigration, crime and welfare, and that its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/21/poor-outlook-toxic-labour-jon-cruddas-report-welfare-immigration\">electoral prospects are \u201cvery poor\u201d</a>. </p> <p> Adverse economic conditions and the implosion of the political centre that appear to have encouraged far-right parties are also nurturing other forms of societal division, leading to polarisation. In Spain, Catalonia\u2019s desire to divorce itself from Castile steadily intensifies as the mainstream parties struggle to keep government on track after an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/26/spain-faces-new-elections-june-parties-fail-to-form-government\">inconclusive national election</a>. A similar phenomenon is to be found in Scotland.</p> <p> Another enervating factor is evident, widespread political apathy and alienation, especially among young voters who, oddly enough, have most to lose from long-term political dysfunction. Record low turnout in the last European parliament elections was a worrying case in point.</p> <p> The cumulative, corrosive results of these assaults on Europe\u2019s ailing body politic were plain to see in Austria on Sunday. It was not that the centre could not hold. The centre has all but disappeared.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Britain has passed another milestone on the path to a cashless society, with 2015 the first year that cash was used for less than half of all payments by consumers.</p> <p>Cash usage will be eclipsed by debit cards and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/contactless-payments\">contactless</a> payments by 2021, according to Payments UK, which represents the major banks, building societies and payment providers. </p> <p>In 2015 cash made up 45.1% of payments, compared with 64% in 2005, and is expected to fall to just a quarter by 2025. It will largely be replaced with payments by contactless cards, which have soared in popularity. </p> <p>Contactless payments grew threefold in 2015, with more than a billion \u201cwave and pay\u201d transactions over the year. Since the start of 2016 contactless use has gathered pace, particularly on the London Underground network. On the high street, one in six card purchases are now contactless, with Tesco leading the way.</p> <p>But Payments UK\u2019s annual review of how households pay for goods and services reveals that the death of the cheque has been much exaggerated. It said that 546m cheques were written in 2015, despite the fact most retailers now refuse to accept them. </p> <p>The Payments Council, the predecessor to Payments UK, provoked a storm of protest in 2009 when <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/dec/15/cheques-bounced-out-history\">it proposed a complete withdrawal of cheques</a> by 2018. Following a consumer revolt the plans were abandoned, and today the body says cheques remain a \u201cconvenient and secure method\u201d for making payments. </p> <p>Its annual report charts the changing nature of how British households choose to spend their money. The average adult makes a total of 648 payments a year, including cash, equal to 54 a month. Debit cards were used for 20 payments a month, with computers processing 19,276 debit card payments every minute in the UK in 2015.</p> <p>On average, individuals make six direct debit payments a month and use their credit cards four times, but standing orders are less popular at just 0.7 a month. <br /></p> <p>The amount of money now transferred through the direct debit system is vast. In 2015 debits to pay mortgages, rents, energy and other bills were worth \u00a31.22tn. </p> <p>Debit card use is up 10% in 2015 compared with 2014, while credit card usage was up 9%. In total, 38.2bn payments of all forms were made across the UK in 2015, including 1.5bn that were made between businesses.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/dec/19/contactless-payments-card-fraud-after-cancellation-bank-account\">Contactless payments mean card fraud now happens after cancellation</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Adrian Buckle, chief economist at Payments UK, said: \u201cThis year\u2019s<a href=\"http://www.paymentsuk.org.uk/industry-information/annual-statistical-publications\"> UK Payment Markets report</a> reveals a picture of consumers and businesses more ready than ever to reassess how they make payments and make the most of the convenient, cost-effective and innovative options that are available.\u201d</p> <p>Barclaycard said the biggest increase in contactless payments has been among Britain\u2019s over-60s, with the number of users up 116% over the past year \u2013 more than any other age group.</p> <p>But not everyone wants to join the contactless revolution. A survey last week by the security company Defender Note found that 30% of consumers want banks to ask them before issuing them with contactless cards. It suggested that customers with contactless cards are twice as likely to report being victims of financial fraud. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>However, banks say <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/dec/19/contactless-payments-card-fraud-after-cancellation-bank-account\">contactless fraud</a> is very low. Figures from the UK Cards Association show that in the first six months of 2015 there were \u00a3516,500 of fraudulent transactions on contactless cards \u2013 the equivalent of 2p for every \u00a3100 spent using the technology.</p> <p>This year payment by mobile phone is expected to increase dramatically. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/18/android-pay-apple-samsung-pay-google\">Android Pay</a> went live across most of Britain\u2019s banks and building societies last week, and is already accepted at 460,000 retail payment points. </p> <p><strong><br /></strong></p>",

The \u201cearly years gap\u201d between children from poorer and wealthier families is almost twice as large in the north as in London.</p> <p>And while northern primary schools perform well, secondary school attainment is a major cause for concern, particularly because of widening educational inequalities between disadvantaged pupils and their wealthier peers.</p> <p>In his annual report last December, the chief inspector of schools, Sir Michael Wilshaw warned of a \u201cdeeply troubling\u201d divide in England\u2019s secondary schools with children in the north and Midlands much less likely to attend a good or outstanding secondary school than their peers in the south.</p> <p>The IPPR report, entitled Northern Schools: putting education at the heart of the northern powerhouse, points out however that even in northern schools rated outstanding by Ofsted, there is an attainment gap of 22 percentage points between pupils on free school meals and their better off classmates.</p> <p>And while educational underachievement in deprived coastal towns and smaller satellite towns like Blackpool and Oldham has been highlighted, big cities like Liverpool, Sheffield and Leeds are also failing to raise attainment among disadvantaged pupils.</p> <p>In a speech to the IPPR in February, Wilshaw warned that the ambition to build a northern powerhouse would \u201csputter and die\u201d if youngsters being educated there lacked the skills to sustain it.</p> <p>The government subsequently announced a \u00a320m northern powerhouse schools strategy in the budget in March to address the educational divide, but Labour has described it as \u201cmore spin than substance\u201d.</p> <p>Education secretary Nicky Morgan, responding to the report, said: \u201cWe know great teachers are vital to raising standards in schools and are changing lives every day. That\u2019s why we are continuing to work with groups like Teach First who are helping to place those teachers where they are needed most, returning power back to the profession through our white paper reforms and introducing schemes like the National Teaching Service which will develop even more brilliant leaders.</p> <p>\u201cWe are also ensuring that all schools have the resources they need through the introduction of a historic new national funding formula that will ensure funding follows need rather than a historic formula and continuing to invest in the pupil premium [additional funding for disadvantaged pupils], worth \u00a32.5bn this year.\u201d</p> <p>Labour\u2019s shadow education secretary, Lucy Powell, said however that the government\u2019s rhetoric of a northern powerhouse would not match reality unless real action was taken to close the growing attainment gap between disadvantaged young people and their peers.</p> <p>\u201cRather than obsessing about the forced academisation of all schools against their wishes and failing to tackle the fundamental problems of teacher recruitment and retention and falling school budgets, ministers must redouble their efforts to tackle underachievement and disadvantage.\u201d</p> <p>Unions meanwhile are calling for increased funding for schools, rather than just a reorganisation of the funding that already exists.</p> <p>Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) said: \u201cThe success London has had in narrowing the attainment gap for disadvantaged pupils over the last decade proves that increased funding is important. Proper funding will enable schools in disadvantaged or remote areas to attract and retain high-quality teachers and leaders.</p> <p>\u201cIt is vital however that any future agreement on a national funding formula should result in a general uplift of the amount of funding received by all schools. The current government funding commitment is in cash terms only.</p> <p>\u201cInflation and extra costs will mean a real terms cut in the actual value of funding per pupil of 8% over the next four years. School budgets are at breaking point.\u201d</p>",

As elated and exhausted bodies piled up in the corner of the pitch, supporters in yellow, red and blue celebrated at the other, south end of the Vicente Calder\u00f3n. Their team were 1-0 up against Sevilla and on course to become the first side to win the double two years in a row for more than 60 years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/may/22/barcelona-v-sevilla-copa-del-rey-live\">Barcelona v Sevilla: Copa del Rey final \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There were still 23 minutes of extra time left and nervous moments ahead in a game so intense, so long, that even the referee got cramp but Barcelona were closer than ever now. And, when Messi slipped another gorgeous ball to Neymar to make it two in the last minute, they were there. For much of the night it had not looked as if they would get there. They had been down to 10 men for an hour and had to do it without Luis Su\u00e1rez.</p> <p>They had had to do it against a superb side too. Sevilla, winners of three consecutive Europa League titles, never know they are beaten. This was the first time in seven finals over the last decade. When the final whistle went, Sevilla\u2019s supporters gave their players a gigantic reception at one end while Barcelona\u2019s celebrated at the other.</p> <p>\u201cSince when does anyone win a final without suffering?\u201d Luis Enrique had asked before this game. He knew. They had suffered from the start and the more so from the 35th minute when Javier Mascherano was sent off for pulling down K\u00e9vin Gameiro. It was only Barcelona\u2019s second red card since Gerard Piqu\u00e9 was sent off in the Super Cup last August. Both have been shown to Mascherano and both by this referee, Carlos Del Cerro Grande.</p> <p>The Argentinian watched from by the tunnel as Ever Banega\u2019s free-kick was saved sharply by Marc Andr\u00e9 ter Stegen and an already difficult game seemed to shift further Sevilla\u2019s way.</p> <p>Until then this had been close but Sevilla might have been more satisfied, quick into the challenge and quicker to spring forward. The threat was clear when they broke and the first half\u2019s best opportunity had fallen to Coke Andujar, but he could not finish from 10 yards.</p> <p>The red card prompted Barcelona momentarily to shift Sergio Busquets to centre-back before, at half-time, putting on J\u00e9r\u00e9my Mathieu at centre-back and withdrawing Ivan Rakitic from midfield. The second period began with Banega striking the post, the ball travelling across the face of goal. Su\u00e1rez then pulled his right hamstring and withdrew. Down on the bench he was in tears, with his participation in the Copa Am\u00e9rica at risk. Uruguay\u2019s first game is only a fortnight away.</p> <p>Out on the pitch Sevilla kept coming. \u201cWhen you\u2019re playing for a title your legs no longer feel heavy,\u201d Vitolo had said before their 63rd game of the season. He was running at Barcelona, his team-mates too, and in two minutes Busquets blocked from both Gameiro and Gregorz Krychowiak. Piqu\u00e9 was everywhere, tackle after tackle after header. Sergio Escudero\u2019s looped ball hit the bar, Gameiro sprinted into the area on the right and again Piqu\u00e9 went to ground; again the tackle was impeccably timed.</p> <p>Yet it was not always desperate and at times it felt as if Barcelona were managing this well, notwithstanding being a man down. As the game went on that sensation grew. A Sevilla goal no longer seemed imminent and Neymar, Iniesta and Messi carried forward when they could, which was increasingly often. They took responsibility and occasionally took control too. Fleet of foot, the touch impressive, their runs usually ended with a tumble just as they threatened to get beyond Sevilla.</p> <p>Barcelona grew frustrated at how few were blown as fouls as Sevilla stopped them any way they could. From one that was, on Iniesta, Sergio Rico saved Messi\u2019s free-kick. Rico had to save another in the very last minute after Neymar had been brought down on the edge of the area by Banega who, like Mascherano, was then sent off.</p> <p>Extra time beckoned, 10 against 10. It began with Gameiro\u2019s shot blocked but then Messi saw Jordi Alba racing up the left. From near the centre circle he curled a wonderful delivery left-footed into the area; the ball bounced once and Alba put it beyond the reach of Sergio Rico.</p> <p>There was more and it was mostly from Barcelona now. A Messi free-kick was pushed away, Piqu\u00e9\u2019s header saved and Rico made a double stop from Dani Alves and Busquets. Another red card followed, too, as Daniel Carri\u00e7o was sent off for a wild challenge on Messi, who had been down often but never out. Messi then did it again, finding Neymar to score the second. The cup was heading back to Catalonia again.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/16/how-barcelona-lost-la-liga-title-then-won-it-again\">How Barcelona lost La Liga, then won it all over again | Sid Lowe</a> </p> </aside>",

      "headline": "Novak Djokovic is favourite for my French Open title, says Stan Wawrinka",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-23T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Stan Wawrinka, the French Open champion and owner of his first home title after beating Marin Cilic in Geneva on Saturday, should be striding into Roland Garros bursting with pride and confidence, but gardeners have made louder entrances here than did the Swiss on a rainy Sunday afternoon.</p> <p>All the talk has again been about the supposedly invincible Novak Djokovic, whom <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/07/french-open-2015-stanislas-wawrinka-novak-djokovic-win\" title=\"\">Wawrinka blew off the court in last year\u2019s final</a>, the revival of the nine-time king of Paris Rafael Nadal, the quiet Caledonian charge of Andy Murray \u2013 and the absence of Wawrinka\u2019s compatriot, Roger Federer.</p> <p>Wawrinka arrived in Paris on Saturday yet, because of the immovable structure of the draw, will be rushed into the first round on Monday against Lukas Rosol \u2013 something the tournament organisers might not have asked Federer or Nadal to do. They could have let their champion start on Tuesday, but he would have had to back up on Wednesday. And he immediately hit the self-deprecation button. \u201cNovak is the main favourite,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the case last year as well. I think, to beat him, it\u2019s going to be very difficult, and then there is Murray and Nadal on an equal footing, and I\u2019m just after them \u2026 just after.\u201d</p> <p>Murray also starts on Monday , against a familiar foe in Radek Stepanek. In only his second match at Wimbledon, in 2005, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2005/jun/23/wimbledon2005.wimbledon12\" title=\"\">the 18-year-old Scot won in straight sets</a> against the combative Czech, who had been on the Tour for nearly a decade. And here is back at 37, a survivor of neck surgery four years ago and three qualifying matches to get into the main draw.</p> <p>Stepanek, who has done more in doubles in recent years, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/03/andy-murray-radek-stepanek-madrid-open\" title=\"\">took a set off the world No2 in Madrid</a> recently but Murray, who has been in blinding form on clay, should have way too much for him.</p> <p>Three British men are in the tournament, but Aljaz Bedene and Kyle Edmund are not making much noise. Edmund, who is carrying an ankle strain, was due to start against the Georgian Nikoloz Basilashvili on Sunday evening before rain washed out the back end of the programme, and Bedene sounds unusually tentative going into his third campaign.</p> <p>Weighed down by psychosomatic baggage from his four-year attempt to play <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/23/aljaz-bedene-davis-cup-great-britain\" title=\"\">Davis Cup tennis for Great Britain</a>, he said before Tuesday\u2019s against his friend Gerald Melzer: \u201cThe body is great but the head not the best. I\u2019m mentally struggling a little.\u201d</p> <p>It is only two months since Bedene had to quit during a second-round match against Roberto Bautista Agut after playing through the pain of an injured right wrist. His fitness will be properly tested here \u2013 and he looked woefully out of sorts during practice with Edmund on Saturday. \u201cI\u2019m not winning much,\u201d Bedene said. \u201cI\u2019m playing well but confidence is not there. I\u2019m keeping up the hard work just hoping it will come. Hopefully this will be the week.\u201d</p> <p>His match against the Austrian qualifier might be a welcome distraction, so severe is the stress of trying to convince the International Tennis Federation that he should be able to play for his adopted country. While he says he is fully fit, Bedene said the case has preyed so heavily on his mind that his body started to break down.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a mental thing. All the disappointment, I felt it not only in my wrist but everywhere. It wasn\u2019t easy. When you can\u2019t sleep, when you\u2019re worried about something as important as this, everything comes to the body, especially with me. In Miami I had to retire. I don\u2019t like to retire, but it was difficult.\u201d</p> <p>He also quit in the third set of his match against Sam Querrey in Auckland during January, and, whatever his upbeat view of it, the bare words do not properly reflect his hangdog demeanour.</p> <p>\u201cConfidence is the issue now and it has a lot to do with this thing,\u201d he says. \u201cI think I will be confident in a few weeks because I am playing well.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever the rights and wrongs of his case, rarely can someone have tried so hard to wrap himself in the flag for so little result. He has the support of Andy Murray, the Great Britain captain Leon Smith, and Stephen Farrow, who has led his legal appeal with the financial backing of the Lawn Tennis Association. Bedene, raised in Slovenia but a British passport holder since March last year after living in Welwyn Garden City for nearly nine years, does not want for friends.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/22/nick-kyrgios-through-in-straight-sets-after-umpire-altercation-at-french-open\">Nick Kyrgios through in straight sets after umpire altercation at French Open</a> </p> </aside>  <p>None of them, however, seem to be in the ITF, where redrafted rules appear to disbar him from qualifying as a British player because he has played Davis Cup for Slovenia.</p> <p>Bedene, meanwhile, tries to get on with his career and his life. \u201cI stopped with my coach, James Davidson, after Miami. Leon has been helping me this week and in Rome a little bit. We will see what is going to happen after Wimbledon, but until then I have the LTA\u2019s help and Leon is there with me.\u201d</p>",

Despite Lensbury\u2019s objection, <a href=\"http://www.lensbury.com/about-us/our-policies/\">its environment policy</a> states: \u201cWe are looking into sustainable methods to produce a large proportion of our electricity.\u201d</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.hamhydro.org/\">Teddington and Ham hydro project</a> is run by a co-operative of local volunteers who have raised \u00a3700,000 so far from local residents. It would have three reverse Archimedes screws and generate enough electricity to power 600 houses.</p> <p>The site is by the bank of the Lensbury, which was formerly a staff club for Shell employees and is now a hotel and private leisure club. The Lensbury is wholly owned by Shell and its five named directors are all \u201coil company executives\u201d according to <a href=\"https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/03644400/officers\">filings to Companies House</a>, including <a href=\"http://www.leadershipdirectories.com/profiles/Mike-Napier-Executive-VP-External-Communications-Royal-Dutc.htm\">Mike Napier</a>, executive vice-president of external communications at Shell.</p> <p>\u201cShell needs to think very hard about what this is doing to its reputation,\u201d said Stephen Knight, Lib Dem councillor for Teddington ward and a member of the London assembly. \u201cAn international oil company is using its financial muscle to try to block a community hydropower scheme. This sends all the wrong messages about big oil companies trying to block the development of renewable power.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/shell_hydro-zip/giv-12515ZGBernCMefYB/\" data-alt=\"Hydro project\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/shell_hydro-zip/giv-12515ZGBernCMefYB/\">Hydro project</a> </figure>  <p>Jono Adams, one of the volunteer directors of the hydro project, said: \u201cIt is extremely frustrating that the planning process is being dragged out. There is a local and national will to get this sort of scheme up and running.\u201d The scheme must start operating by March 2018 to receive the green energy subsidy payments it has been awarded by the government.</p> <p>Adams said the scheme, which was granted planning permission by Richmond borough council in September, had addressed local concerns about noise, visual impact and flood risk. </p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful part of the world and people were very concerned that there would be something like an industrial generator on the site and it would be very noisy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut actually the noise created will be completely drowned out by the [existing] noise of the water.\u201d </p> <p>He said the scheme would be no larger than the existing weirs and would actually lower flood risk, because unlike the weirs, the hydro screws could be lifted entirely out of the waters when the Thames was running high.</p> <p>The Lensbury\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.lensbury.com/about-us/our-csr-policy/\">corporate and social responsibility policy</a> states: \u201cThe Lensbury is committed to reducing its carbon footprint in all areas of our operation.\u201d Adams pointed out that the hydro scheme could be used to power the club, saying: \u201cIf we did get a private wire into the Lensbury, it would get a great deal on energy and it would be supporting a local renewable energy scheme, so it would be great PR.\u201d</p> <p>Lacy Curtis-Ward, chief executive of the Lensbury, said: \u201cIt may be all too easy to paint the Lensbury as environmentally unfriendly Luddites [but] this could not be further from the truth.\u201d She said the Lensbury supported the development of a hydro scheme design that would \u201cwork for all stakeholders\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cIt is expected the development [approved by Richmond council] will impact the hotel and conference business, as well as member numbers,\u201d said Curtis-Ward. She said the noise assessments accepted by the council were \u201cincorrect\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"1cbb1ed3cb2a34a57859828f2aa8c9a1be45c2db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cbb1ed3cb2a34a57859828f2aa8c9a1be45c2db/0_0_1920_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"How the dam will look when completed.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The hydro project is based on the installation of three hydro power turbines on the River Thames at Teddington Lock and Weir.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy of THH</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Curtis-Ward said she would consider the offer of a private electricity line: \u201cYes, of course, if and when the developers come up with a plan for a hydro scheme that will not damage our business.\u201d</p> <p>A spokesman for Shell said: \u201cLensbury Ltd is a subsidiary of Shell Petroleum Company Limited, but its directors carry out their duties independently from Shell and act only in the interests of Lensbury Ltd.\u201d</p> <p>Knight said the legal costs being incurred by Richmond council in contesting the judicial review were also an issue. \u201cThis legal battle with is costing local taxpayers\u2019 money. This is because Shell is using rules designed to help communities challenge governments over environmental matters to limit its obligation to pay the council\u2019s legal costs in this battle. This is shameful.\u201d</p> <p>Curtis-Ward said the Lensbury\u2019s use of a \u201cprotective cost order\u201d was \u201cwhat any commercial company would do\u201d.</p>",

Again.<br /></p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re going in with the same team that last year got beaten 52-6, you\u2019re kidding yourself,\u201d Vautin tells Guardian Australia. \u201cIf NSW don\u2019t change up their side they\u2019ll get beaten again.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/22/gold-coast-capitalise-on-late-penrith-error-for-narrow-nrl-win\">Josh Reynolds stakes State of Origin claim in Bulldogs' win over Roosters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Granted, Vautin would not be the first person Laurie Daley turns to when casting about for advice on his best XVII. But Vautin isn\u2019t just a head-wobbling gag-man on The Footy Show. He knows the game, knows a footy player. He rings blokes today, offers advice. Blokes take it. They thank him. And in terms of who should don a blue jumper, his advice to NSW selectors is to pick men with speed, skill and fear-factor.<br /></p> <p> \u201cHere\u2019s the thing about Origin: when you run out onto the field, you\u2019re looking across at the players you don\u2019t want to play against. For me I\u2019d look at Peter Sterling, and think, \u2018Shit he\u2019s good, so strong, hate playing against Sterlo\u2019. Paul Sironen? \u2018Great player, Sirro, but I feel I can handle him\u2019. </p> <p> \u201cIf I\u2019m a Queenslander, I want to see NSW pick the incumbents. I don\u2019t want to play against Blake Austin because he\u2019s different, good speed, runs for himself. I don\u2019t want to play against Bryce Cartwright \u2013 skilful, tough, that offload.</p> <p> \u201cMate, when you\u2019ve won one series in 10 years, why wouldn\u2019t you change it up?\u201d</p> <p> Why not indeed, Fat Man. Why not indeed. And it seems that following the weekend\u2019s round 11 action that Daley and NSW selectors will unleash some crackerjack colts alongside the tried-and-tested. And as Fatty says, why wouldn\u2019t you? Why not pick blokes who\u2019d frighten the Canetoads? Who\u2019d be a good chance of, you know, scoring more points? (Made easier if you don\u2019t let Queensland score 52.) </p> <p> And so here we are, and with just the Eels and Storm to round out NRL round 11, the NSW Origin brains trust has leaked like a sieve and the team announcement will contain some surprises but no surprises. And we can safely say that the following Origin arguments have been settled (well, as much Origin arguments can be) after the weekend\u2019s big match action.</p> <h2>Mitchell Pearce v Adam Reynolds</h2> <p>Pearce <em>could</em> play and <em>could </em>perform well. He\u2019s slick, he\u2019s polished. He\u2019ll kick long and chase. He\u2019ll bomb. He\u2019ll play a quality if generic halfback\u2019s game of footy and when he\u2019s in your red zone he\u2019ll feed the speed men wide. But he wouldn\u2019t worry Queensland. Because you know what you\u2019re going to get. The Maroons know Pearce. They can defend Pearce. And on top of his well-documented spell in purgatory and ongoing issues \u2013 and stated desire that he doesn\u2019t want to play \u2013 then Blues fans will welcome a new halfback, Rabbitohs man Reynolds. Nippy, chunky, high-skill off the boot, Reynolds will cause angst for the Queensland forwards with his sharp darts off the mark and precision kicking. They\u2019ll fancy running big men at him but that\u2019s how it rolls for halves who don\u2019t give change from 85 kilograms. But his numbers are the best of all NRL No7\u2019s this year. He had a top game Thursday night. And he\u2019s due. It\u2019s his time.</p> <h2>The No6</h2> <p>The Blues toss five-eighths like bad poker hands. The list of pivots since 2010 reads: Jamie Lyon, Trent Barrett, Jamie Soward, Todd Carney, James Maloney, Josh Reynolds, Mitchell Pearce. This year it\u2019s Maloney again, probably, despite Josh Reynolds having a blinder against the Roosters Sunday, and showing off all his skill and nark, and very real human desire. He was five-eighth the last time NSW won and Daley often talks of loyalty to incumbents, which makes it surprising Reynolds was dropped. Following the Fat Man Method, Daley should\u2019ve picked Blake Austin in the No6, he frightened the poor hopeless Warriors Sunday more than The Amityville Horror. But Maloney is a big reason for the Sharks\u2019 eight straight wins and premiership ascension. I like Austin. And Fatty likes Austin. But neither of us selects five-eighths for NSW Blues and tells their mates.</p> <h2>The Gallen question</h2> <p>There\u2019s a clutch of props Daley could slot in who\u2019d do a job in the hard-charging-no-passing department. David Klemmer, Paul Gallen, Aaron Woods, Andrew Fifita, James Tamou. Ryan James and Aiden Tolman were part of the 2016 Emerging Blues, while Reagan Campbell-Gillard belted many men in City-Country. I like that kid, he\u2019s good. But Daley will likely start with Woods and Gallen, and start two of Tamou, Fifita and Klemmer from the pine. And they will do a good job and cart it up hard like angry automatons, and look to score the fantasy football numbers of Gallen who always makes many metres. But Gal? Well. I dunno. I like him. He\u2019s perhaps the gnarliest, hardest chunk of granite bopping about today. But when Peter Sterling \u2013 a legend of the game, for sure, but in terms of who\u2019ll be picked for NSW little more than a red-head-wobbler or Guardian gibber merchant \u2013 suggested Gallen wasn\u2019t in his NSW Origin team, Gallen tossed toys out the cot. Got the hump. But why would he care what Sterlo thinks? Is he that insecure? And if so why?</p> <h2>The rest</h2> <p>Robbie Farah is fit and will be the No9 because Daley is loyal except when he isn\u2019t, and for all Mick Ennis\u2019s good form and hustle-bustle, he isn\u2019t frightening. Josh Mansour will be on a wing and Blake Ferguson, they say, on the other one because Will Hopoate is on a prayer not a wing due to him not playing footy on Sundays and it\u2019s hard to pick a player on not playing footy form. Josh Dugan runs like a hairy goat and you\u2019ve got to have him in somewhere, which means right centre because Matt Moylan\u2019s a gun and you just want him in there, at fullback. He\u2019s a beauty, Moylan, the next Darren Lockyer. I\u2019d have had Jarrod Croker at left centre because he\u2019s a super defender, runner and support man, and he could kick goals from Caxton Street, an important quality in tight action. You and Fatty might plump for James Roberts. But word is \u201cJet Shoes\u201d Micky Jennings is the man to stop Greg Inglis from ripping off his crackerjack goanna action. Elsewhere Bryce Cartwright has the Fat Man\u2019s X-factor (but didn\u2019t get a gig), Josh Jackson has run and grunt (and did), and Boyd Cordner is back like he never went away. Trent Merrin and Wade Graham would have given the Blues plenty but will watch from wherever. Good mail says Dylan Walker has a seat on the bench after running hard in the centres against Cronulla and not setting Brookvale alight at five-eighth. Jack Bird\u2019s been good all year and plays centre and five-eighth. Which seems odd.</p> <h2>Queensland</h2> <p>Queensland? Oh, you mean the other team contesting this annual interstate series? The champion team of their generation? Perhaps the best team ever? Answer this: Does it even matter whom they fit around Inglis and their spine of Darius Boyd, Johnathan Thurston, Cooper Cronk and Cameron Smith? As long as they\u2019re big and hard and don\u2019t drop the ball, and wrestle for Albania \u2013 hello Corey Parker, Matt Gillett, Sam Thaiday, Matt Scott, Josh McGuire, Jacob Lillyman \u2013 then the wizards and Michael Morgan will do their thing, and all wingers have to do is catch, leap and slam. Better players, better team, better culture. Will win. </p>",

With all the things we had worked on and done, he hardly ever got in the box. And I do think that we would have seen that game out if it wasn\u2019t for that moment that he produced.</p> <p>\u201cHe drew everybody to him and then the cross really and truly is a very difficult skill, to get it to the back post. So of course he is a genius player and has been all his career, and he produced a moment today that in my view probably won them the Cup. Forget about the winning goal.</p> <p>\u201cThe two goals that United have come up with show the sort of level we are at. Their second goal, Jesse Lingard\u2019s hit, is an amazing goal.

      "body": "<p>So, how did it ever reach the stage where the manager of Manchester United can <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/21/crystal-palace-manchester-united-fa-cup-final-match-report\">win the FA Cup</a>, with all the glories it is supposed to bring, then be booed by considerable swaths of the club\u2019s supporters and carry the trophy into his press conference only to be informed the news wires were flashing up stories of his imminent sacking?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/22/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-marriage-of-convenience\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho to Manchester United not the best fit but unlikely to be dull</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For all Louis van Gaal\u2019s faults, it was certainly a low stunt for that kind of information to be leaked while his suit was still damp from the spray of champagne. Van Gaal\u2019s diminished popularity can probably be judged by the beery chants of \u201cJos\u00e9 Mourinho\u201d on Wembley Way, as well as various stops along the Metropolitan line, throughout Saturday night, but no manager deserves that kind of treatment. Two have now been in this position since Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s retirement three years ago and Van Gaal, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/22/david-moyes-sacking-manchester-united-manager-brutal\">like David Moyes</a>, found out through the people he called \u201cmy friends in the media\u201d. Except, of course, he didn\u2019t say it with any friendliness in his voice.</p> <p>He is entitled to feel it could have been handled with more dignity but, equally, it is difficult to argue with United\u2019s decision when Van Gaal\u2019s two-year reign has been synonymous with bland, prosaic football, featuring their worst scoring statistics for more than a quarter of a century and, within the dressing room, a scale of disillusionment that makes it absolutely clear there will be minimal sympathy among the players. Van Gaal has been described among those players as \u201chard work\u201d. His tactics have been so unpopular that various members of his squad have talked between themselves about openly defying him. It hasn\u2019t reached the point of mutiny, but it has been a close-run thing sometimes. The consensus has been that \u201cit can\u2019t get much worse than it is\u201d.</p> <p>A manager does not have to be popular but he needs to be respected and, though there were times when the players warmed to him and even found him good company, Van Gaal\u2019s often abrasive, almost schoolmasterly approach rubbed against the players like sandpaper. They found his methods restrictive. Why, they asked, was a man with his impressive background so devoted to such an unappealing style? Supporters longed for a return to the old United way \u2013 attacking, adventurous football, played at speed and with penetration \u2013 but so did the players, and it pained them that he refused to bend.</p> <p>Instead, there was always the gnawing sense they had to stick to Van Gaal\u2019s rigid system or risk being expelled from the team. United have scored one more goal than fourth-bottom Sunderland \u2013 a team who spent 237 days in the relegation zone \u2013 in his final season of talking about \u201cthe process\u201d or \u201cthe philosophy\u201d, and conveniently ignoring how he promised on his arrival that everything would click within three months. It is the least watchable United side in memory and there are numerous stories about how, collectively, the players\u2019 respect for Van Gaal eroded in the process.</p> <p>One example comes in the form of Van Gaal\u2019s \u201cevaluation sessions\u201d the day after every match when the Dutchman could be so outspoken in his criticisms \u2013 \u201che would crucify players in front of each other\u201d, according to one source \u2013 the two most senior players, Wayne Rooney and Michael Carrick, went to see him to air their concerns that it was damaging for morale and, in effect, a self-defeating exercise.</p> <p>Van Gaal, to give him his due, was always willing to listen to complaints and encouraged his players to speak up. But the bad feeling continued. From that point onwards, he started sending the players individual emails detailing their faults and submitting video clips to highlight his dissatisfaction. Except by that stage a lot of the players were so disillusioned many ignored the emails or redirected them straight to their trash. Van Gaal suspected as much and had a tracker fitted so he could check if the emails were opened and for how long. It became a game of cat and mouse. Some players opened the emails on their mobiles, then left their phones on the side and wandered off for 20 minutes.</p> <p>It reached the point where many players regarded international breaks as a welcome break and the chance to play in a relaxed atmosphere away from a manager they never fully understood and who, to borrow one description, was thought of as \u201cweird\u201d.</p> <p>David de Gea will certainly not be too despondent bearing in mind his relationship with Van Gaal had broken to the point the goalkeeper was giving serious consideration to pressing for a transfer this summer. De Gea has been United\u2019s player of the year for the last three seasons and, without him, it is tempting to think their fifth-placed finish, 15 points off the top, would have been significantly worse. Yet his outstanding form masked the fact there was no warmth between him and Van Gaal. The Spaniard had separate issues with Frans Hoek, the goalkeeping coach, but may now be dissuaded from making this his final season in Manchester.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/21/jose-mourinho-to-be-appointed-manchester-united-manager-next-week\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho set to be appointed Manchester United manager next week</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The idea of losing De Gea, presumably to Real Madrid, would have represented a devastating setback for United given that we are talking about one of the few players with genuine star quality. Otherwise, it is not just Paul Scholes, Rio Ferdinand, Gary Neville and all those other player-turned-pundits from the Ferguson era who insist there will have to be a massive clearout. Many at Old Trafford are saying the same. How many need to go? \u201cNinety per cent,\u201d says one important figure, after giving the question long consideration.</p> <p>More than anything, the players crave a return to what they consider normality. Ashley Young, for instance, was bemused and mildly horrified earlier this year to be informed he was being given a new role as a back-up centre-forward. Young was one of United\u2019s better performers last season when he moved from his customary place on the left wing to play as a full-back. What he has never purported to be is a striker, especially given the way Van Gaal sees the role. United\u2019s forwards were under orders to do the same thing virtually every time: control the ball, lay it off and then get in the penalty area and wait for it. Wide players were told that, rather than taking on their man, it was better to wait for the team\u2019s full\u2011backs to arrive in support.</p> <p>All of which might help to explain why Van Gaal had misgivings about whether Gareth Bale, a long-time target of the club\u2019s executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, was a natural fit for the team system. Van Gaal talked at Wembley about United needing \u201cfast, creative players\u201d but this was the manager who came out with a line in one of his first press conferences \u2013 \u201cI do not want players to be intuitive\u201d \u2013 that seemed so extraordinary the journalists in his company had to go over the tape to check they had not misheard.</p> <p>With that type of regimented structure, it should be no surprise \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda did not flourish at Old Trafford but has excelled for Paris Saint-Germain. Memphis Depay has struggled, too, and his cocksure attitude hardly goes hand in hand with what the \u00a325m signing has shown in his first season at the club. When Depay made a mistake that led to Chelsea\u2019s goal in a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/07/chelsea-manchester-united-premier-league-match-report\">1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge</a> in February he was ordered to play in the reserves the following day. Depay turned up to face Norwich City\u2019s second string in a Rolls-Royce and did not seem to care when it was pointed out to him that it might reflect badly on him. There is, however, a degree of sympathy for him behind the scenes and a desire to give him the benefit of the doubt in the hope that he might be reinvented under a different manager.</p> <p>Overall, though, there is no doubt Van Gaal\u2019s signings have, for the most part, been a significant disappointment. Anthony Martial is the obvious exception but Van Gaal has spent in excess of \u00a3250m and for that kind of outlay there has been little back.</p> <p>Bastian Schweinsteiger is a case in point after starting only 13 league games since moving from Bayern Munich and the last season has made it absolutely clear why the Bundesliga champions were willing to let him go. Schweinsteiger\u2019s form has seldom gone above the six-out-of-10 mark but regularly below and it is not just his ponderous performances that have surprised his team-mates. Schweinsteiger has spent large parts of the season injured and his tendency to return to Germany, flying in and out for United\u2019s matches, has gone down badly, to say the least.</p> <p>Van Gaal gave Schweinsteiger preferential treatment because he saw him as someone who will carry out his instructions to a tee. For similar reasons, he trusted Marouane Fellaini with a key role. Fellaini was often the player the Old Trafford crowd distrusted the most but Van Gaal appreciated the way he listened to orders when it was obvious other players wanted to use their own initiative.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/22/jose-mourinho-manchester-united-old-trafford\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho can mould an exciting, attacking Manchester United side | Michael Cox</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of Van Gaal\u2019s more bemusing instructions was for his strikers not to shoot first-time from balls coming across the penalty area. Instead they were under orders to take a touch in front of goal, even if the relevant players felt confident enough to go for goal straight away. One example goes back to the opening day of the season when Tottenham Hotspur were the opposition and Antonio Valencia sent in a low cross from the right to pick out Rooney, unmarked, in the middle of the penalty area. It seemed like a relatively straightforward finish but Rooney took an extra touch because that was what Van Gaal had drummed into his players. Kyle Walker made a saving tackle only to turn the ball into his own net and Rooney looked almost sheepish as he headed back to the centre circle.</p> <p>Over time, the players started ignoring the rule, complaining that they should be allowed to think for themselves (though the story of one player asking United\u2019s chef to hard-boil him a couple of eggs to take home, on the basis he did not know how to do it himself, suggests that maybe some members of the squad do need coddling).</p> <p>Other sources have revealed how players became so frustrated with Van Gaal\u2019s instructions they took matters into their own hands and told him they wanted to play their own way. In one case, that player is said to have improved markedly as a result.</p> <p>It has also become apparent that a lot of players wanted Ryan Giggs to take over on the basis that he has a better understanding of the club than Mourinho, as well as being less likely to fall out with everyone a couple of years down the line, and it will be intriguing to see whether the Welshman remains at Old Trafford or decides to break free now he has been overlooked for the role that Ferguson, among others, wanted him to inherit.</p> <p>Giggs\u2019s own thoughts about Van Gaal\u2019s managerial style are understood to fall roughly in line with those of Neville and Scholes, his close friends, and the last couple of years have been exceedingly awkward for him as assistant manager, brought up on the old United principles but having to adhere to a different way of thinking and not wanting to rock the boat.</p> <p>It partly explained why Giggs stopped doing interviews if it meant discussing the team and why his body language often looked so stifled on the bench. Every Thursday, United had an 11-versus-11 practice match and it was Giggs\u2019s role to set up one side in the formation of the team they were about to face and talk about set pieces. Beyond that, however, he did not have a significant say in tactics and was unable to convince Van Gaal to switch to a more entertaining style of football.</p> <p>As such, United managed 49 league goals this season; their previous average in the Premier League era was 76.4. They have not been so unproductive since the 1989-90 season when the infamous \u201cTara Fergie\u201d banner was held up and it sums up their deterioration that in the three years since Ferguson\u2019s retirement the team have managed a total of 175 goals \u2013 81 fewer than Manchester City and, even more embarrassingly, precisely the same number as Ferguson\u2019s side accumulated in his last two campaigns.</p> <p>At one stage United had more backward passes than any other Premier League club, the lowest percentage when it came to moving the ball forward and the joint second highest ratio sideways. United finished with the most 1-0 wins and the joint highest number of goalless draws. Their total number of shots on target, 430, was the 15th highest out of 20 clubs and Opta\u2019s number-crunchers have data that shows only three other teams \u2013 Watford, Aston Villa and West Brom \u2013 created fewer chances.</p> <p>This is the bottom line: Van Gaal gave a new meaning to the saying \u201cfootball, bloody hell\u201d. United also suffered their worst start to a season for 25 years in his first campaign, 2014-15, when the players privately blamed his pre-season arrangements on tour in Los Angeles for feeling like a five-star prison camp, with double training sessions, various meetings and an evening supper (a piece of toast) taking up every day from 8.30am to 10.30pm. It was a bad start and, even with an FA Cup to show, the difficult truth is that the Van Gaal years will not be remembered at Old Trafford with any fondness.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Good morning and welcome to week three of this never-ending election campaign. The first two weeks have been eventful \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/18/labors-david-feeney-i-racked-my-mind-about-forgetting-to-declare-23m-house\">property declaration</a> failures, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/20/labor-furious-that-nbn-staff-member-sent-photos-of-police-raid-to-colleagues\">office raids</a> and all. It\u2019s six more weeks until polling day. Welcome to quarter-time.</p> <h2>The big picture</h2> <p>Bill Shorten\u2019s standing with \u00advoters has jumped to a 12-month high, the <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/federal-election-2016/newspoll-malcolm-turnbull-in-danger-as-bill-shorten-lifts/news-story/3e31bcbf995e6299a13fada3321c9e42\">latest Newspoll</a> taken \u00adexclusively for the Australian shows. </p> <p>After the first two weeks of the election campaign the Labor maintains a two-party-preferred lead of 51% to the \u00adCoalition\u2019s 49%. But adding to the Coalition\u2019s woes this morning is prime minister <strong>Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s</strong> net satisfaction rating. The difference between those who are satisfied and those who are dissatisfied with his performance is now the same as for the opposition leader, <strong>Bill Shorten</strong>,<strong> </strong>at -12 points, the Australian reports. This is quite the crash from +38 points six months ago. </p> <p>The Newspoll also shows a two-party swing against the government of 4.5%. The Australian says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p> If \u00adrepeated on election day with a uniform swing, it would suggest about 23 Coalition seats would be lost and Mr Shorten would lead a Labor government with a narrow majority.<br /></p> <p>Voters still think the Coalition will win the July 2 election, \u00adalthough that expectation is also slipping. The survey of 1709 voters, taken from Thursday to yesterday, shows 44 per cent believe the Liberal and Nationals parties will win, a fall from 55 per cent when the question was last asked in mid-March. One-third of voters expect Labor will win, up from one-quarter.</p> <p>For the first time, 50 per cent of voters are dissatisfied with Mr Turnbull\u2019s performance as Prime Minister \u2014 a deterioration of 28 points since mid-November, when his ratings were highest. Satisfaction with Mr Turnbull has plunged from 60 per cent to 38 per cent over that period.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/7NewsPerth/status/734423380015751172\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">New Poll: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TurnbullMalcolm\">@TurnbullMalcolm</a> down, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/billshortenmp\">@billshortenmp</a> up <a href=\"https://t.co/WMCQPxMPYK\">https://t.co/WMCQPxMPYK</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ausvotes?src=hash\">#ausvotes</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/Ri0uI6UTCH\">pic.twitter.com/Ri0uI6UTCH</a></p>&mdash; 7 News Perth (@7NewsPerth) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/7NewsPerth/status/734423380015751172\">May 22, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p><strong>Scott Morrison</strong><strong> </strong>has sent out a statement which says Labor\u2019s housing tax will see the wealthy continuing to negatively-gear existing housing stock while still gaining a \u201cmassive\u201d tax advantage over low and middle income earners.</p> <p>According to the treasurer, Labor\u2019s negative gearing policy would see the wealthiest investors who earn over $100,000 continue to claim nearly 90% of their net rental losses against their investment income. Yet middle and low income earners only have enough investment income to claim less than one quarter, \u201cessentially locking them out of investment in existing housing,\u201d the statement says. It continues that an analysis of Australian Taxation Office data shows:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>A typical individual using negative gearing in the top 10% of income earners has enough investment income to allow them to offset almost 90% of their net rental losses. By contrast individuals using negative gearing in the bottom 90% of income earners typical have enough investment income to allow them to offset less than a quarter of their net rental losses.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <h2>On the campaign trail</h2> <p>Labor will launch a campaign in the marginal government-held seats of Bass in Tasmania and Dawson in Queensland this week.

Now she might just wonder about beating Serena Williams on Centre Court at Wimbledon.</p> <p>\u201cWomen\u2019s tennis at the moment is so wide open,\u201d Broady said before her first-round match at the French Open against Coco Vandeweghe.</p> <p>Were she to beat the young American, not only would her bank account be properly in the black for the first time in her career; she would continue in the tournament comfortable in the knowledge that Williams, Coco\u2019s esteemed compatriot and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/06/serena-williams-safarova-french-open-20th-grand-slam-title\" title=\"\">the defending champion</a>, is parked safely at the other end of the draw.

In Auckland [in January] everyone was saying, \u2018What are these results?\u2019 But it\u2019s just kept happening for the entire year,\u201d Broady said. \u201cI think it shows the depth women\u2019s tennis is starting to have and I\u2019d say the whole of the top 100 you\u2019re not getting many easy draws in slams. Serena\u2019s still a bit above everyone else but even when she has a bad day you never know.\u201d</p> <p>Laura Robson, the former British No1 returning slowly from injury, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/21/laura-robson-impact-french-open\" title=\"\">has no delusions</a> about the size of her task on Monday against 28th seed, Andrea Petkovic. And Heather Watson, top dog in Robson\u2019s absence for a while, will be back on court in the morning, a break down in the third set after recovering well in the second against her new doubles partner, Nicole Gibbs, who led 7-5, 2-6, 2-1 and 40-30 on serve when the rain struck again on Sunday evening.</p> <p>Broady could yet be mixing in that company. She is overjoyed to have broken into the top 100 and, inspired by the British No 1, Johanna Konta, she wants to go further. \u201cI want to be top 50,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s quite hard for me. You hear a lot of the players say they dreamed about playing tennis and winning Wimbledon. I never had those sort of dreams when I was little, so I\u2019m still trying to catch up with what I really want to do in this sport.\u201d</p> <p>As she recalled, \u201cI don\u2019t really think I had any [dreams]. Is that possible? I used to like supermarket checkouts, and now you can do it on your own in Tesco. So I\u2019m living the dream, really. I used to love the buttons, when they do all the clicky buttons when you\u2019re checking out. Used to love that ... obviously I\u2019m an over-achiever.\u201d</p> <p>Nobody ever said that of Konta, who is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/20/johanna-konta-french-open-roland-garros\" title=\"\">scheduled to start on Tuesday</a> against Julia G\u00f6rges. But, having finally tapped into her potential, she is seeded 20 and dangerous. There is no reason she could not go to the final weekend.</p> <p>\u201cJo\u2019s just had the most unbelievable year. I think a lot of it\u2019s mental. When you someone go on that sort of run, they\u2019ve always had the game but they\u2019ve just now started to believe in themselves more, or back their game up in those important moments. I think she\u2019s been working a lot in the gym.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s a great athlete, I think that shows on court with her movement. She\u2019s such a nice girl, Jo, as well off the court. But on the court she\u2019ll fight you for every point. I really like Jo, got a lot of time for Jo.\u201d</p> <p>Broady\u2019s strengths are her big serve, athleticism and strong ground strokes. She is an uncomplicated player with no pretensions but, with her career opening up for her at 26, one with refocused aims. It was not always so. She lost her Lawn Tennis Association funding when photographed hugging a condom machine in a nightclub.</p> <p>Nine years on she can laugh about it \u2013 and celebrate making her own way in the game, as well.</p> <p>\u201cYep, that\u2019s the way world turns, definitely,\u201d she said when reminded of the incident for which she might be most famous. \u201cTen years later, the highlight of my career was the press doing that bloody picture. At some point I\u2019ll do an amazing achievement on the tennis court and it will outshine it. But I think I\u2019ll have to beat Serena on Centre Court for that to happen.\u201d</p>",

It could be uncomfortable but it got you where you needed to go.\u201d</p> <p>If Labour is to rebuild its electoral fortunes between now and the next general election in 2020, it will need to find a way of appealing to its traditional working-class base, argues the book. To Hunt, this means reclaiming English patriotism.</p> <p>\u201cIf we are in any way serious about taking on anti-politics and reclaiming the cultural affinity of the working class then unnecessary metropolitan squeamishness is simply unacceptable \u2013 nurturing a civic English patriotism is now absolutely essential,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Cruddas, who was responsible for drafting Labour\u2019s manifesto, says Labour concentrated too much on \u201cinstrumentalised economics\u201d, using phrases such as the \u201ccost of living crisis\u201d, instead of appealing to cultural or regional identities. He calls for \u201ca Labour politics of recognition that there is a space for an English Labour party to represent the interests of the English people\u201d.</p> <p>Jeremy Corbyn is carrying out a \u201cconstitutional convention\u201d to consider whether changes to the make-up of British politics \u2013 perhaps including more radical devolution than that promised by the government\u2019s Northern Powerhouse \u2013 should be part of Labour\u2019s appeal to the electorate.</p> <p>But there are also concerns about the attitude of some senior Labour figures.

      "body": "<p>North London, Saturday evening. A tale of two events. At Wembley Tinie Tempah exhorts supporters to \u201cmake some noise\u201d, something they were merrily doing long before his jarring interjection. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/21/crystal-palace-manchester-united-fa-cup-final-match-report\" title=\"\">A sterile, sallow FA Cup final</a> follows: for once one cannot blame those in the corporate seats for being slow to return after half-time. Meanwhile, down the road on Hampstead Heath a couple of hours later, dozens of athletes are being roared on as they charge through a beer tent while trying to earn a spot in the British team for the Olympics. I know which one was more fun to watch.</p> <p>Track and field has taken a justifiable kicking in recent years. Too many of its administrators have been shown to be bent. Too many medal winners have been busted for drugs. Suspicion of anything extraordinary now lingers like smog. But being among the 3,000 or so crowd standing around the third lane of the Parliament Hill track at the British 10,000m trials \u2013 so close to the action, in fact, that an injudicious shoulder turn could have stiff-armed a world or European champion \u2013 was a reminder that this wounded sport still has the capacity to inspire and attract a new congregation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/21/jo-pavey-olympics-in-balance-10000-metres\">Jo Pavey\u2019s Olympics hopes in balance after missing out in 10,000m</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This crowd was noticeably younger than at most athletics meetings. Many nursed beers, others burgers. A live steel band thumped away in the background. There were even samba dancers, a nod to the forthcoming Olympics in Rio, and a hell of a lot of noise, especially when athletes zoomed under the snaking beer tent halfway round the track.</p> <p>Afterwards Ross Millington, the men\u2019s 10,000m winner, reckoned it was the best atmosphere he had ever raced in and suggested the night\u2019s organiser, Ben Pochee, deserved a knighthood for performing the kiss of life on the event, which has often been the unloved child of track running.</p> <p>Most would not have tried. Three years ago only nine men and one woman, Aly Dixon, turned up for the 10,000m at the British trials. It led to the women\u2019s race being cancelled and Dixon, at her suggestion, running with the men. It was a spirit-sapping spectacle, not only for Dixon, who was lapped several times, but for the few stragglers watching.</p> <p>Spool forward to 2016 and the change was dramatic. Pochee\u2019s energy, along with the City of London\u2019s help, ensured most of Britain\u2019s top distance runners \u2013 save for Mo Farah, who will get in the team automatically \u2013 turned up for a shot at the Olympics. As Pochee explained, there is no money or profit involved, as it is free entrance for spectators, and they rely on the goodwill of dozens of volunteers. \u201cWe are trying to tap into the good part of our sport,\u201d he said. \u201cPut a 12\u2011year\u2011old kid a metre away from Jo Pavey as she runs past and I bet she\u2019ll be more inspired than if they were sat in a sterile stadium.\u201d</p> <p>It was not Pavey\u2019s night. The 42-year-old, who was hoping to become the first British female track athlete to qualify for five Olympic Games, was weakened by a persistent chest infection and fell back after halfway. Instead it was the 23-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/21/jo-pavey-olympics-in-balance-10000-metres\" title=\"\">Jess Andrews whose star shone brightest</a> as she smashed her personal best by more than 80 seconds and beat the Kenyan 2009 world champion, Linet Masai, to book her spot for Rio.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/20/greg-rutherford-manchester-win-kim-collins-greatcity-games\">Greg Rutherford keeps up winning habit with victory in Manchester</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For most people it was a fantastic feelgood story. In 2013 Andrews was good enough to beat Laura Muir, who was fifth in the 1500m at the World Championships last year, and Gesa Felicitas Krause, who took bronze in the steeplechase, at the European under-23 cross-country championships. However, by her own admission she had fallen out of love with the sport and taken a year off before deciding to give it another go.</p> <p>The results were dramatic, to some on Twitter too dramatic. Even though Andrews\u2019 time of 31min 58sec was more than a minute behind the fastest 10,000m in the world last year and 1,208th on the all-time list, they narrowed their eyes. That is the age we live in. As the Olympic long jump champion, Greg Rutherford, says: \u201cI hate having to always be that guy who is saying: \u2018No, no, there are people who are doing it right,\u2019 because people\u2019s opinions are changing and that\u2019s a problem.\u201d</p> <p>Yet build it and they will come. When Rutherford competed at the Great CityGames in Manchester on Friday night, a free event in the city\u2019s centre, thousands crowded round a sandpit to gawp, clap and admire as he leapt 8.20 metres. \u201cYou need to think outside the box and appeal to a new audience,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause the system has been the same for such a long time. Of those fans who were massively into athletics in the 80s and early 90s, some are dead and others haven\u2019t passed on the enjoyment to their kids.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, such events will not bring back the glory days of track and field. Its problems are deep and football\u2019s dominance asphyxiating. Yet as sport becomes even more super-corporate and expensive for spectators, guerrilla events such as the Night of the 10K PBs and the Great CityGames, which evangelically bring athletes closer to people who would not necessarily pay to watch a Diamond League meeting, might just help slow down the death rattle.</p>",

      "headline": "Saracens\u2019 intense focus on completing double delights Chris Ashton",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-23T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Saracens\u2019 fifth Premiership final in seven seasons, their third in a row, their fifth final out of six in the past three years \u2013 whichever way you dress it up, their qualification for Saturday\u2019s season finale is an impressive feat. They are reaching levels of consistency to compare to those over the years of the club they beat here. It is only a matter of time before someone mentions the word \u201cdynasty\u201d.</p> <p>Beat Exeter and they will join an elite of clubs. Only Leicester, Wasps, Toulon and Toulouse have completed the domestic and European double, and Toulouse\u2019s was achieved in 1996, the first year of the Heineken Cup, when Europe was little more than an interesting experiment.</p> <p>Chris Ashton scored a brace <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/21/saracens-leicester-premiership-play-off\" title=\"\">in a five-try demolition of Leicester</a> and harked back to the arrival of Brendan Venter as director of rugby in 2009 (or maybe it was the arrival of himself three years later), which is often pointed to as the genesis of their current run of success. \u201cSaracens had a massive change five or six years ago,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has been building since then, adding players each year. The number of players we have near a hundred caps is phenomenal from where the club was a few years ago.\u201d</p> <p>As is the emotional maturity of a squad that, for all that experience, is surprisingly young. Had they struggled to rise to the occasion after the catharsis of their <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/14/saracens-racing-92-european-rugby-champions-cup-final-match-report\" title=\"\">European triumph</a> the weekend before \u2013 or even lost \u2013 no one would have condemned them. Instead, they inflicted such a hideous half-time scoreline on the erstwhile champions of everything in England that the Tigers were reduced to playing for pride, which they did to some effect \u2013 for 10 minutes of the second half, anyway.</p> <p>\u201cComing off the back of last week,\u201d Ashton said, \u201cit was exactly what we wanted to do. We just needed to win. Last week was a massive high for us but you work all year for the Premiership. If we\u2019d lost today, we\u2019d have been very disappointed with the way our season ended.\u201d</p> <p>This ferocious hunger is what marks them out nowadays. They have long been an efficient side, adept at finding the path of least resistance to the accumulation of points, but now there is a twist of intensity. There was a bit of a hangover from the weekend before but it lasted all of 41 seconds, the time it took for Manu Tuilagi to cross the whitewash for Leicester. Tuilagi\u2019s afternoon looked promising at that point but he was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/21/manu-tuilagi-england-doubtful-hamstring-injury-australia\" title=\"\">to limp off with his hamstring injury</a> only 20 minutes later.</p> <p>And his try was disallowed for some handling on the floor. So Saracens clicked into gear. Three minutes later, a symphony of offloading had Will Fraser striding clear for the first try. By the break the score read 31-0. \u201cHalf-time was just about not worrying about the result,\u201d said a phlegmatic Richard Cockerill, Leicester\u2019s director of rugby. \u201cThe result was past us, if you\u2019re being realistic. They\u2019re a very good side, and we\u2019re disappointed how we let them get away. But I\u2019m pleased the boys got themselves back into it.\u201d</p> <p>That they did \u2013 sort of \u2013 with two tries and a penalty within 11 minutes of the restart, pulling them back to 31-17. But to win would have required a miracle too outlandish even for a team called Leicester. Saracens regained control of the match in the final quarter, when Charlie Hodgson slotted two penalties, before Ashton showed great pace to finish his second, much as he had his first.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/16/saracens-european-champions-manchester-united-class-of-92\">Saracens chairman says young team are like Manchester United\u2019s class of \u201892</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was Hodgson\u2019s last home appearance of a record-breaking career as a points scorer and playmaker. There may yet be one full 80 for him to play before he retires, though.

      "body": "<p>The annual Devon county show took place over the weekend and its oval-ball equivalent will be held at Twickenham on Saturday. Not since the massed ranks of <a href=\"http://www.trelawnysarmy.org/\" title=\"\">Trelawny\u2019s army</a> poured up from the far west to cheer on Cornwall in the 1991 County Championship final has there been a more eagerly awaited pilgrimage up the A30 and A303.</p> <p>With Cornwall also featuring in this year\u2019s county rugby final next Sunday and Plymouth Argyle in the League Two play-off at Wembley on bank holiday Monday, could the last London-bound person turn out the harbour lights? Short of Jack Nowell\u2019s father leading a flotilla of Newlyn fishing trawlers up the Thames, the West Country invasion of the metropolis could hardly be more coordinated.</p> <p>Good luck, then, to anyone within the M25 looking to advise Exeter that one of sport\u2019s more feelgood recent journeys is bound to end in defeat by Saracens in the Premiership final. \u201cThe boys like a challenge,\u201d murmured Henry Slade, one of the clutch of home-reared players helping to make their region proud. \u201cIt\u2019s the Premiership final; you win that, you are champions of England. You don\u2019t need much more motivation. If we make the most of the occasion we\u2019ll be right on it.\u201d</p> <p>Given the Chiefs\u2019 last appearance in a Twickenham final was the low-profile <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/apr/14/rugbyunion.sport\" title=\"\">EDF National Trophy</a> final in 2008, when they lost 24-13 to Northampton on the undercard to the Anglo-Welsh Cup final between Leicester and Ospreys, it is impossible to overstate how much this grand return means to those with an emotional stake in their adventure. They are long past the point, however, of being content to make up the numbers and wave Saracens through to an inevitable domestic and European double.</p> <p>Not everyone seems to have noticed but there are two Exeters: the image of a bunch of cider drinkers on a fairytale odyssey is wonderfully romantic but this is primarily a hard-headed posse of sportsmen with the glint of history in their eyes. The last club from somewhere other than the east Midlands or the south-east to conquer the English game were <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/may/29/rugbyunion.sport\" title=\"\">Sale in 2006</a> and the Chiefs see no reason why they cannot rattle Sarries until their fillings ache.</p> <p>They have scored more points and 11 more tries than the European champions during the regular season, backing up the view of the Wasps director of rugby, Dai Young, that \u201cthe two best teams all season\u201d have reached the final. Add the incentive of knowing Nowell has pledged to cut off his trademark rat\u2019s tail should the Chiefs lift the trophy and Slade insists he and his team-mates will fully embrace their big day.</p> <p>\u201cI know they have done the double on us this year but we did the double on them last year,\u201d Slade said. \u201cWe definitely know we can beat them. Maybe we are surprising other people but, internally, there is a massive expectation and we have a lot of confidence in our ability.\u201d</p> <p>For that alone, Rob Baxter and his fellow coaches deserve huge credit. In the six years since the intricately plotted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/may/26/exeter-chiefs-bristol-rugby-playoff\" title=\"\">heist at Bristol\u2019s expense</a> that earned promotion from the Championship they have built a team and a following that are the envy of their Premiership rivals, not least across the border in Somerset. While Bath have shown that big money does not necessarily ensure lasting success, Exeter have demonstrated the flipside: that people ultimately make great rugby clubs and that good things rarely happen overnight.</p> <p>Baxter highlighted that truth again in his moment of triumph, the tension of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/21/saracens-leicester-premiership-play-off\" title=\"\">a gripping, atmospheric semi-final against a gallant Wasps team</a> having finally eased. Asked if he planned to celebrate he gazed at his inquisitor with incredulity. \u201cWe\u2019re Exeter,\u201d he retorted. \u201cWe\u2019re not machines, we\u2019re human beings.\u201d That sentence perfectly captures the essence of the Chiefs and explains why the fervent strains of the tomahawk chop could already be heard drifting on the wind fully a mile from the stadium two hours before Saturday\u2019s kick-off.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/21/saracens-leicester-premiership-play-off\">Saracens outclass Leicester to reach Premiership final and put double in sight</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If that buzz faded slightly as Exeter tightened up in the third quarter, a second penalty try in the closing seconds ultimately ensured a proper job done, with the power to add. \u201cThis is not a flash in the pan \u2026 it is the culmination of a lot of people\u2019s hard work over a long time,\u201d Baxter said. The unsung Don Armand, Will Chudley, Ian Whitten, Ben Moon and their ilk will head for the bright lights with nothing to lose and Saracens would be mad to underestimate them.</p> <p><strong>Exeter Chiefs</strong> Dollman; Nowell, Slade, Whitten (S Hill, 61), Woodburn; Steenson (capt), Chudley; Moon (Hepburn, 53), Cowan-Dickie (Yeandle, 53), Williams (Francis, 53), Lees, Parling, Ewers (Waldrom, 61), Salvi, Armand. <strong>Tries</strong> Whitten, penalty 2, Ewers. <strong>Cons</strong> Steenson 4. <strong>Pens</strong> Steenson 2.</p> <p><strong>Wasps</strong> C Piutau; Wade, Daly, S Piutau, Halai; Gopperth, Robson (Simpson, 68); Mullan (McIntyre, 60), Festuccia (Johnson, 50), Cooper-Woolley, Launchbury, Davies, Haskell (capt), Smith, Hughes (Jones, 68). <strong>Tries</strong> Festuccia, Robson. <strong>Cons</strong> Gopperth 2. <strong>Pens</strong> Gopperth 3. <strong>Sin-bin</strong> Festuccia, 39.</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> G Garner (RFU). <strong>Att</strong> 12,604.</p>",

      "body": "<p>A Conservative minister has accused remain campaigners of attempting to silence the debate on immigration, warning that failure to address people\u2019s concerns would simply fuel the emergence of a \u201cnasty politics\u201d on the far-right.</p> <p>In an interview with the Guardian, Dominic Raab hit out at Tory colleagues including Lord Michael Heseltine and Sir John Major, who he said were starting to sound like \u201cthe elite saying we can\u2019t talk about immigration\u201d. </p> <p>In response to Major\u2019s claim that Tories campaigning for Brexit were morphing into Ukip, Raab said: \u201cI\u2019m proud in this country we\u2019ve virtually eliminated the BNP. The risk if we don\u2019t take people\u2019s concerns seriously is not that we start to look like Ukip, the risk is that the really nasty politics emerges.\u201d</p> <p>The intervention intensifies the clash between the remain and out camps on the issue of immigration, as the referendum campaign enters its final month. On Sunday David Cameron <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/22/david-cameron-defence-minister-penny-mordaunt-lying-turkey-joining-eu\">accused his own defence minister</a> Penny Mordaunt of misleading the public about the prospect of Turkey joining the EU. </p> <p>The prime minister said Mordaunt was \u201cabsolutely wrong\u201d to suggest that Britain had no veto over the accession of new countries. \u201cLet me be clear, Britain and every other country in the EU has a veto on another country joining. That is a fact,\u201d Cameron said in an interview on ITV\u2019s Peston on Sunday.</p> <p>Earlier during a BBC interview, Andrew Marr asked Mordaunt whether Britain had a veto, and she replied: \u201cNo it doesn\u2019t.\u201d She then argued: \u201cI do not think that the EU is going to keep Turkey out. I think it is going to join. I think the migrant crisis is pushing it more that way.\u201d</p> <p>Mordaunt told the Guardian that her intention had been to highlight the prime minister\u2019s own support for Turkey joining the EU, and to point out that the British public would not be given a referendum if the decision was taken in the future.</p> <p>Campaigners on both sides of the arguments jumped on the interviews to highlight past records of their opponents. Brexiters pointed to Cameron\u2019s statement in 2010 that he wanted to \u201cpave the road from Ankara to Brussels\u201d, while Remainers pointed to Boris Johnson\u2019s claim that Turkey\u2019s accession was not likely to happen.</p> <p>Raab said he was determined not to enter into \u201ctit for tat\u201d. On immigration, he said he was the son of a refugee and married to a woman from Latin America. \u201cI\u2019m not a little Englander, but I want the British people to have confidence in our immigration system.\u201d</p> <p>He said that wasn\u2019t possible while the UK was in the EU because there was no control of numbers, no way to make sure immigrants were self-sufficient and no ability to remove people who had committed serious offences. He talked about the emergence of the far right in France, Austria and the Netherlands, and said the same could happen in the UK.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/21/vote-leave-prejudice-turkey-eu-security-threat\">Vote Leave embroiled in race row over Turkey security threat claims</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The justice minister also said it was difficult to stop convicted criminals entering Britain. \u201cYou are importing risk, and the EU has forced us to import risk, and tied our hands in trying to deal with that risk. There is no doubt that that is the case. You can take a view that that is a price worth paying. I don\u2019t think it is,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The result, according to Raab, is that the terror risk to Britain is higher than it might be post-Brexit. The prime minister has made the opposite argument, saying that cross border co-operation within the EU keeps Britain safer. </p> <p>The question of immigration is at the heart of the Vote Leave campaign, and the subject of part of its referendum broadcast to be shown on Monday. It has a mother and daughter going to A&amp;E and waiting frustratedly to be seen because of pressures resulting from immigration. The video then shows an alternative picture in which the smiling pair leave the hospital quickly in a post-Brexit world.</p> <p>An internal Labour report by Jon Cruddas has said the party risks becoming \u201cirrelevant\u201d to working people if it fails to tackle their concerns on immigration. Cruddas has also contributed to a book being edited by the backbencher Tristram Hunt on why Labour lost the last election. </p>",

Nothing for Maren Ade\u2019s brilliant comedy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/13/toni-erdmann-review-long-german-comedy-is-slight-biting-little-miracle\">Toni Erdmann</a>. Nothing for Jim Jarmusch\u2019s wonderful <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/16/paterson-review-adam-drivers-poetic-bus-driver-proves-safe-pair-of-hands\">Paterson</a> and nothing for Paul Verhoeven\u2019s outrageously enjoyable thriller <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/21/elle-review-paul-verhoevens-brazen-revenge-comedy-is-a-dangerous-delight\">Elle</a>. And it was incidentally exasperating to see that film\u2019s star Isabelle Huppert overlooked for the best actress award \u2014 along with Kristen Stewart, Ruth Negga and Sonia Braga \u2014 in favour of Jaclyn Jose as the Manila drug-dealer in Brillante Mendoza\u2019s Ma\u2019Rosa. A good performance, but not exceptional.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7193f81f0aa35570b95f404c4f08a6431d200bf9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7193f81f0aa35570b95f404c4f08a6431d200bf9/156_0_3285_1973/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Snubbed? ...

It was the only film of the festival which moved me to tears; the heart-wrenching and frightening scene in the food bank itself has enormous power. This was a film of almost radical plainness, with a great performance from Dave Johns (as so often in the past, Loach has got great serious work from a comic \u2014 he has cast John Bishop and George Lopez in the past). Loach is, as I have written before, the John Bunyan of contemporary cinema. Or to use another comparison, he has directed a film which repudiates frills and nuances as firmly as a medieval mystery play. It may well be that his heartfelt idealism and Amish simplicity became a sort of Esperanto for the international jury. It was something they could all understand and endorse in each other\u2019s company.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/12/i-daniel-blake-ken-loachs-welfare-state-polemic-is-blunt-dignified-and-brutally-moving\">I, Daniel Blake review: Ken Loach's welfare state polemic is blunt, dignified and brutally moving</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So: to the decision which outraged almost everyone, but which caused me to rise briefly from my laptop and shout: \u201cHa! Yes!\u201d and then subside chuckling to my seat. The grand prix went to Xavier Dolan\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/19/its-only-the-end-of-the-world-review-xavier-dolans-nightmarish-homecoming-is-a-dream\">It\u2019s Only the End of the World</a>. Now, there were films I liked better at Cannes, sure, and films which I thought more deserving of this particular award. But it was really good, a provocation made with uncompromising attack and flair, a film driven with authorial personality and a film which has been mocked and misunderstood by the majority of critics. It is an absurdist drama of confrontation and hysteria, which conveys in stylised and dreamlike form the horror experienced by a young man who must return to his hometown and tell his family he is dying. (He is a successful dramatist: the movie is based on an autobiographical play by Jean-Luc Lagarce, who died of Aids in 1995.) The result is a non-stop screaming match: a cinematic death-metal opera. It\u2019s not for everyone, but it is fascinatingly created and intended. Perhaps this prize will persuade the detractors to give it another go.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a405585fda357bf842cfa7fa220c6da9486a53d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a405585fda357bf842cfa7fa220c6da9486a53d/380_14_3527_2115/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Emo ...

In my view, Cristian Mungui\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/19/graduation-review-cristian-mungiu-romania-cannes-2016\">Graduation</a> and Olivier Assayas\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/16/personal-shopper-review-kristen-stewarts-psychic-spooker-is-a-must-have\">Personal Shopper</a> were the two best films in competition. Graduation was my (incorrect) tip for the Palme. As it turned out, Mungiu and Assayas shared the director\u2019s prize, and that will have to do. Graduation is an utterly absorbing film of masterly compositional flair which is a very persuasive character-study of a doctor whose muddy moral choices infect his daughter\u2019s worldview \u2014 and also a resoundingly authoritative picture of Romania and the Eastern Europe which now has a generational perspective on the escape from communism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/16/personal-shopper-review-kristen-stewarts-psychic-spooker-is-a-must-have\">Personal Shopper review: Kristen Stewart's psychic spooker is a must-have</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Personal Shopper is a tremendously exciting and bizarre picture which mischievously messes with genre. Along with Paul Verhoeven\u2019s Elle and Nicolas Winding Refn\u2019s LA horror-shocker The Neon Demon (both ignored), it was a film which caused festival-goers to become slightly delirious and skittish. This was down partly to a really excellent, downbeat performance from Kristen Stewart whose contribution to this festival was very substantial. She plays a troubled young woman who has two things to do: she is a personal assistant to a demanding fashionista, but she is also a medium, trying to contact the spirit of her dead twin brother. It was utterly intriguing, with audacious flourishes of suspense. And it was very well directed.</p> <p>Asghar Farhadi\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/21/the-salesman-review-asghar-farhadi-cannes\">The Salesman</a> was a serious and valuable movie, though its pattern of opaque implications were beginning to look like a mannerism for this director and not as subtle as his previous movies. But it was widely admired at the festival and now gets both the screenplay prize (a valid award, I concede, considering the subtle intricacy of its structure) but also the best actor prize for Shahab Hosseini, as a teacher and actor in a semi-professional theatre group, playing Willy Loman in a production of Death of a Salesman. As the run begins, his wife is attacked in mysterious circumstances. Hosseini does a perfectly good job in the role and his underplaying is exactly right. But to return to the scandalous neglect of Maren Ade\u2019s comedy Toni Erdmann, I would have much preferred to see the prize go its star, Peter Simonischek, or indeed to Adam Driver for his wonderfully sympathetic, humble performance in Jarmusch\u2019s Paterson as the poet who drives a bus.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8cd9c850000ae78dbb25c524516446ad4f776a61\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8cd9c850000ae78dbb25c524516446ad4f776a61/0_38_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sweet ...

Grand Prix-winner American Honey</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR Image</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The jury prize for Andrea Arnold\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/14/american-honey-review-andrea-arnold-mislays-map-but-us-roadtrip-still-sweetly-intriguing\">American Honey</a> is pleasing: an American-realist study in the style of Van Sant and Korine, with something of Malick\u2019s reverence for epiphanic detail, all about a bunch of kids on a bus touring around the US, selling magazine subscriptions door-to-door and living and partying in hotel rooms at night. It was a film which I felt did not have the brilliance and natural idiom of her other films, and I also felt that Shia LaBeouf could have been directed and controlled more. But it had Arnold\u2019s habitual, superb confidence in her own ability to create ambient cinema, to summon up the mood and moment. She just puts you on the tour bus, or in the hotels, or in the K-Marts, or the streets around which the kids were trudging, and lets you stay there. We talk about films being immersive. You were marinaded in this one. I was always keen to see this a second time, and the Jury Prize has only whetted my appetite more.</p> <p>Cannes 2016 was an exceptionally good year, and the competition list was a virtually uninterrupted hot streak of talent, only rarely interrupted by disappointments. The prize list being an anticlimax is becoming a bit of a tradition, but need not lessen any satisfaction at this festival. 2016 is a great vintage.</p>",

New findings suggest that the act of water splashing on to ploughed fields throws up millions of microscopic particles \u2013 the remains of dead plants and animals. And it turns out that this special dust often helps to seed clouds and generate localised rainstorms. </p> <p>Dust is well known for helping to trigger cloud formation, but not all clouds produce rain. Evidence is now emerging that organic dust (the remains of living things) is especially good at creating rain-bearing clouds, by <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg23030690-400-rain-makers-how-highflying-bacteria-could-control-the-clouds/\">helping water to freeze and encouraging raindrops</a> to grow quickly. And now, Alexander Laskin and his colleagues, from the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Washington, have discovered one way in which organic dust becomes airborne.</p> <p>During 2014 they collected airborne particles above <a href=\"http://www.evs.anl.gov/user-facilities/sgp/\">Oklahoma\u2019s southern great plains</a> \u2013 a vast agricultural region. They found that at least one third of the dust was organic, and was most likely flung into the air by recent rainfall. \u201cSplashing of raindrops into puddles creates air bubbles, which rise upwards and burst, ejecting a fine mist of organic matter,\u201d Laskin says, whose findings were published in the <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo2705.html\">Nature Geoscience</a> journal. Meanwhile, irrigation of topsoil with a garden hose did the same trick.</p> <p>Previous studies in southern Australia and California have shown that, over agricultural land, the probability of rainfall <a href=\"http://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/15/2313/2015/\">increases following a rainstorm</a>, suggesting that this is nature\u2019s way of generating its own rain. The big question now is whether we can mimic nature\u2019s clever trick, using organic dust to squeeze water from the sky, bringing rainfall to parched lands.</p> <p><br /></p>",

And on Saturday afternoon, like trade winds blowing communities together, Japan and Australia united in Brisbane to bear witness to the Sunwolves\u2019 Australian debut and, ultimately, the final chapter of a Japanese hero\u2019s intriguing adventure.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/22/ayumu-goromarus-queensland-reds-career-ended-by-shoulder-injury\">Ayumu Goromaru's Queensland Reds career ended by shoulder injury</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Before kick-off outside a sunny Suncorp Stadium, the fan precinct is alive with the energy of human exchange as giddy Japanese locals merge with thousands of travelling fans to celebrate the Sunwolves and their cult hero, the Queensland Reds fullback, Ayumu Goromaru. \u201cGoro-san\u201d has lived the dream since he scored 24 points to lead Japan\u2019s Brave Blossoms to a mind boggling victory over South Africa in the 2015 World Cup \u2013 for many <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/sep/19/south-africa-japan-rugby-world-cup-2015-match-report\">the greatest upset in rugby history</a>. </p> <p>For his efforts, Goromaru had a giraffe named after him and was made a certified Master of Ninjas by the Japan Ninja Council, joining the order of ancient spies. Through endorsements in Japan he is reportedly the world\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/rugby-union/reds/reds-and-japan-fullback-ayumu-goromaru-becomes-world-rugbys-highest-paid-player-20160215-gmug79.html\">highest paid rugby player</a> and on Saturday he presented Japanese fans with a unique dilemma \u2013 to support their nation\u2019s new Super Rugby team or their hero\u2019s club side.</p> <p>Despite his stature and the hype surrounding his progress back in his homeland, Goromaru\u2019s introduction to Super Rugby with the Reds has not been easy though, and chances to start games have been hard to come by with Karmichael Hunt ahead of him in the pecking order.</p> <p>But a lack of game time has done little to dent Japanese fans\u2019 interest and when Hunt withdrew due to a groin injury prior to the weekend\u2019s game, Goromaru was a late and celebrated selection at fullback. With J Sports beaming the game live to Japan, the perfect stage was set.</p> <p> </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"38a57723e0b329c91553a7f00b97b6304e867ec8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38a57723e0b329c91553a7f00b97b6304e867ec8/0_0_4164_2664/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Goromaru warms up at Suncorp Stadium before kick-off against the Sunwolves.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"640\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Goromaru warms up at Suncorp Stadium before kick-off against the Sunwolves.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jason O'Brien/Getty Images for Japan Sunwolves</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Things start well enough, with the Japanese contingent vocal in their support of Goromaru, who converts the first penalty of the game. Up in the media box loyalties are divided. Conventional wisdom and the bookmakers had prophesied a lop-sided encounter but the Sunwolves clearly have other ideas. They\u2019ve suffered some heavy defeats during the season but nevertheless improved dramatically. Plans fail but missions survive.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/13/the-first-step-japans-ayumu-goromaru-blazing-a-trail-for-super-rugbys-reds\">'The first step': Japan's Ayumu Goromaru blazing a trail for Super Rugby's Reds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Japanese journalist Taka Uematsu credits Australia and in particular the former Japan coach, Eddie Jones, with the resurgence of Japanese rugby. Uematsu says Jones reduced the number of foreign players and developed a unique Japanese style. His strategy bore fruit in the 2015 World Cup where their speed and movement delivered three wins. </p> <p>Jones\u2019 Japanese heritage and language skills gave him cultural nuance and he was able to link Japan\u2019s ancient traditions with his mission of \u201cmodern bushido\u201d, a nod to the ancient Japanese philosophy of honour, loyalty, respect and bravery. Japan has never lost touch with its ancient values and traditions and the ethos lives on today. Uematsu agrees: \u201cRugby is one for all and all for one.\u201d He screams with joy as the Sunwolves score a try and at half-time the Sunwolves are four points behind the Reds, who lead 17-13.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>The Reds go over again after the break before the Sunwolves\u2019 animal spirit breaks loose with two further brilliant tries thrilling the crowd to tie things up at 25-all. The second proves a watershed moment for Goromaru, who, facing the Sunwolves\u2019 rampaging 114 kilogram flanker, Liaki Moli, and with the scent of combat in his nostrils, attempts an ambitious shoulder charge. The contact is huge and his shoulder is smashed, his AC joint separated and his season with the Reds over. Uematsu called it \u201ckamikaze brave\u201d. Later in the press conference Goromaru explained his strategy: \u201cI am the last line of defence, I don\u2019t want to lose, I don\u2019t want to give up.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8757f79475506ad77506e389d33774a25906d7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8757f79475506ad77506e389d33774a25906d7d/0_0_4000_2667/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Goromaru receives attention after injuring his shoulder at Suncorp Stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Goromaru receives attention after injuring his shoulder at Suncorp Stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Hamilton/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s a bitter pill to swallow on this, of all nights. But luck is a frail commodity and the Sunwolves\u2019 woes are compounded. Uematsu\u2019s screams of \u201chashire\u201d (run) fill the media box but fail to prevent another Reds try and the hosts run out 35-25 winners.</p> <p>After the game Japanese fans pour onto the field to get their hero\u2019s autograph and female fans\u2019 screams pierce the night. Reds media manager Philip Pope says the 19,073 crowd was their biggest of the year, and the game was covered by 25 Japanese media and 12 camera crews. \u201cIt\u2019s been a pleasure to deal with Ayumu \u2013 he\u2019s an exceptionally respectful man,\u201d he says.</p> <p> With just three games left in the season, by the time the post-match press conference arrives, Goromaru appears to know his time at the Reds is over and he deadpans questions, staring into the distance like a man beyond the white noise. His poker face lasts until the final question before he bursts into laughter with the Japanese journalists. Like a r\u014dnin, the masterless Samurai who wandered the land with the ancient skill of bow and sword, Goromaru\u2019s next stop is rumoured to be the French super club, Toulon. His journey continues.</p> <p>Sunwolves coach and the former All Black, Mark Hammett, has the final word. He says his team will turn up to training, ready to learn more with no negativity. Regardless of results he says the Sunwolves\u2019 attitude \u201cis always right\u201d.</p> <p>His team and Goromaru have shown the beauty of an ancient culture embracing a modern ritual and Super Rugby is richer for their involvement. They have tasted success but as the bearers of bushido, an important cultural asset that goes beyond sport, they understand that failure can be the best teacher. </p>",

Chris Yarran would be the distributor Richmond craved to propel them from finals regulars to flag fancies. Neither featured when the Dockers hosted the Tigers on Saturday night. Neither are expected to feature at all this season.<br /></p> <p>It was a weekend of absences. A round shaped as much by who wasn\u2019t on the ground as who was.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/22/melbourne-ease-to-big-afl-win-over-dismal-brisbane\">GWS tame Western Bulldogs to take third place on AFL ladder</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The most obvious example was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/20/inside-50-jarryd-rougheads-illness-puts-afl-results-in-perspective\">also the most challenging</a>. Jarryd Roughead was in the coaches box as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/20/afl-friday-swans-hawks-report\">his side slipped to defeat against Sydney</a>. How the Hawks could have done with his versatility, taking advantage of Ted Richards\u2019 early departure and adding some much needed bulk around stoppages. </p> <p>Until last week, concern over Hawthorn\u2019s slow start to 2016 was tempered by the expectation their four-time premiership winning forward would be up and about when the whips started to crack. Coping without him, and with the senior bodies that left the club in the last offseason, means a fifth flag for Alastair Clarkson could prove his greatest achievement yet.</p> <p>Even the round\u2019s good news story could be told through the eyes of a man outside the 22. By the time Travis Cloke had pulled on his VFL stripes at the Holden Centre he would have witnessed his replacement astound the footy community on the MCG. </p> <p>It was Collingwood\u2019s collective intensity that drove them to victory but the signature moments belonged to Mason Cox. His third-quarter lead, mark and goal was timed to the footstep with all the nous of a veteran centre half-forward, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/masonsixtencox/status/734199320409317376\">not a self-deprecating neophyte</a>. The sight of a seven foot Texan bouncing a Sherrin and slotting the sealer in the final term will feature on season-end highlight packages. Perhaps Cloke\u2019s form slump is a blessing in disguise for Nathan Buckley?</p> <p>There is no silver lining to Gary Ablett\u2019s unavailability for Gold Coast. The Suns skipper was again missing for another humbling, leading to calls for him to be traded. They should be taken seriously. When Ablett was lured to the Suns he was unquestionably the game\u2019s best player and deserving of a king\u2019s ransom. With the Gold Coast needing to renovate before the original building work has been completed, Ablett\u2019s future has to come into consideration.</p> <p>Ignore the sunk costs of the original investment and consider the value a beaten up 32-year old can provide a list still years from maturing. If extra dollars are required to secure the long-term services of Dion Prestia, Jaeger O\u2019Meara and others, reallocating portions of one of the largest salaries in the game stands to reason. Despite spirited defences of his leadership, the evidence available to outsiders suggests there isn\u2019t the added value expected of him in that regard either.</p> <p>An absence of leadership is wreaking havoc further north too. Daniel Merrett is the only player on Brisbane\u2019s list to have played more than 130 games, meaning the loss of captain Tom Rockliff and his vice Dayne Beams has left a chasm in the Lions midfield. Melbourne were poor on Sunday yet still managed to send Brisbane packing by 10 goals. </p> <p>The absentee narrative occurred on a micro scale at the Adelaide Oval. Tom Jonas\u2019s crude elbow to the back of Andrew Gaff\u2019s head ruled the Eagle out of the final third of West Coast\u2019s win over Port Adelaide. The active consecutive games record holder is now at risk of having his 112 match streak broken while Jonas can expect a significant lay-off of his own. </p> <p>The incident reinvigorated the debate of the continued absence of any send off policy in the AFL. The <a href=\"http://s.afl.com.au/staticfile/AFL%20Tenant/AFL/Files/Images/2016%20Laws%20of%20Australian%20Football.pdf\">Laws of Australian Football</a> contain the prerogative for administrators to include one should they wish but Law 20 explicitly states that it \u201capplies to all competitions other than the AFL competition.\u201d With an interchange cap, no substitute rule, and an increasingly cautionary approach towards concussion, the prospect of a team at a significant disadvantage because of an opponent\u2019s misdeeds is obvious. It is manifestly unjust that the team on the receiving end of this disadvantage receives nothing by way of recompense. There are challenges to the implementation of such a policy, but it should at least be debated, preferably with arguments more sophisticated than \u201cit\u2019s not soccer\u201d used to justify the existing unfairness.</p> <p>In brighter news, absence need not always make the heart grow fonder. North Melbourne\u2019s impressive start to 2016 has owed much to an improved outside game, led by the polish of Daniel Wells. With Wells, as well as Shaun Higgins and Jed Anderson all missing from Saturday\u2019s match against in-form Carlton, there was a concern North\u2019s forward movement could have been sluggish. There was no need to worry. One of the round\u2019s highest scores was kicked, despite only one Roo accumulating more than 22 disposals. </p>",

      "body": "<p>Sometimes birds appear when you least expect them. One evening towards the end of April I was driving my son to football training when the <a href=\"https://www.bto.org/science/migration/tracking-studies/swifts\">first swifts of the year</a> zoomed past \u2013 low as fighter jets, heading due north.</p> <p>On the way back, I thought I\u2019d stop to see if there were any more. No swifts, but a real surprise, heralded by a flash of orange, as a small brown bird flew into a hawthorn. A lift of the binoculars confirmed my hunch \u2013 a female <a href=\"http://www.bto.org/about-birds/nnbw/nesting-birds/redstart\">redstart</a>, flicking her russet tail before plunging deep into the foliage, never to be seen again.</p> <p>Like the swifts, this little bird had just returned from Africa. Every time I see a long-distance migrant, I try to imagine where it has spent the winter. In the redstart\u2019s case, that\u2019s a world away from our rural parish, in a forest south of the vast Sahara desert, somewhere in the heart of that even vaster continent.</p> <p>These migrants\u2019 return is what makes this time of year so exciting. This spring, thanks to persistent northerly winds, their appearance has been, at times, as slow as treacle. But finally they have arrived: the <a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/s/swallow/\">swallows</a> hawking for insects above our neighbours\u2019 barn; the <a href=\"http://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/w/whitethroat/\">whitethroat</a> launching itself into the air as I cycle past; the <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/s/sedgewarbler/\">sedge warblers</a> turning up <em>en masse</em> on my local patch, where the singing males are competing with one another to win a mate.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/jun/17/birdwatch-cuckoo-insects-environment\">Birdwatch: Cuckoo</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I save my greatest joy for three very special birds. The <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/c/cuckoo/\">cuckoo</a>: that traditional herald of spring; usually out of sight, but occasionally streaking across the Somerset sky, its hawk-like silhouette causing momentary panic amongst the smaller birds. The swift: whose annual return, as Ted Hughes famously wrote, shows that \u201cthe globe\u2019s still working\u201d. And a local speciality: the <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/discoverandlearn/birdguide/name/h/hobby/index.aspx\">hobby</a>, a lithe, streamlined, slate-grey falcon whose name comes from an Old French word meaning \u201cto jump about\u201d.</p> <p>On the May Day bank holiday, after heavy rain, a group of us ventured out onto the <a href=\"http://www.avalonmarshes.org\">Avalon Marshes</a> to welcome back these aerial predators. From the plush new hide at the <a href=\"https://www.rspb.org.uk/discoverandenjoynature/seenature/reserves/guide/h/hamwall/\">RSPB\u2019s Ham Wall reserve</a> we had a grandstand view of four hunting hobbies as they sped to and fro. Every now and then one would stop momentarily in mid-air, grab an unseen insect, and, after transferring its catch from talons to beak, fly on.</p> <p>As the rain stopped and the sun emerged, illuminating this vast expanse of wetland, more birds appeared on cue.

We\u2019re not the finished article, there\u2019s work to be done.\u201d</p> <p>Happily for Hodgson the opposition also had few answers to Vardy\u2019s change of pace and goalscoring incision. When asked if the striker was wasted on the wing when he could have been alongside Kane, Hodgson replied emphatically: \u201cWe need to be able to play both systems \u2013 asking him to play on the left or right side shouldn\u2019t cause him any problems. We can\u2019t leave ourselves hamstrung and say Jamie Vardy is only going to play in one system. I spoke to Jamie before the game and he was more than happy to play in a wider system. I think it was a success.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/22/jack-wilshere-hit-and-miss-england-turkey-roy-hodgson-football\">Jack Wilshere hit and miss but does enough to join England at Euro 2016 | Louise Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With Vardy now temporarily departing in order to get married this week it means he will not be available at Sunderland, where Wayne Rooney and his fellow Manchester United players \u2013 possibly except the injured Marcus Rashford \u2013 are due to join up with England on Monday following their FA Cup final victory against Crystal Palace.</p> <p>\u201cYes, the public might think it odd,\u201d conceded Hodgson of Vardy\u2019s absence, before explaining why he had allowed it. \u201cThe major reason was he had to cancel his wedding last year when I called him up. So it was more difficult for me than it would have been otherwise to complain about this week\u2019s date. We also changed the time of our meeting-up. When Jamie planned the wedding he thought he\u2019d get a week or 10 days off at the end of the season.</p> <p>\u201cYou\u2019d have to ask him about the wedding but we know Jamie, we\u2019re satisfied with him. I don\u2019t think his place in the team, or the squad, is under enormous threat. And in some ways the competition for places has perked up because the Manchester United players join us.\u201d</p> <p>This party includes Chris Smalling, who Hodgson said would strengthen a suspect defence on the second stage of a mini roadshow as they take a brief tour of the north before returning to Wembley. By then the squad will have been whittled down to 23 from 26, so this proved very much part of an audition process for, among others, Jack Wilshere, who played 66 minutes on his return to international action after a year out with a broken leg.</p>",

The mother is so upset with the London ambulance service that, three and a half years later, she has still not buried her daughter.</p> <p>\u201cThe day before Sabrina died was like any other close to Christmas. She went shopping with her grandmother, had a drink with friends, but by the next evening she was dead. A ruptured ectopic pregnancy meant that she bled to death in hypovolaemic shock \u2013 very heavy internal blood loss \u2013 and it is likely Sabrina never even knew she was pregnant. One of her fallopian tubes had split.</p> <p>\u201cWhen the gynaecologist gave evidence <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Stevenson-2015-0126b.pdf\">at the inquest [.pdf]</a> into her death, she said that if Sabrina had arrived at A&amp;E before she went into cardiac arrest, she probably would have survived. Sabrina waited two hours for an ambulance to come to her home that evening. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/22/ambulance-delays-linked-to-35-deaths-in-past-five-years\">Ambulance delays linked to 35 deaths in past five years</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cMy daughter did not have to die. It was the weekend before Christmas, after what emergency services call \u2018Black Friday\u2019. I understand that she was asked if she had been drinking and I do not believe that she was taken seriously. She woke up with stomach pain, nausea and diarrhoea, and had absolutely no idea what was wrong with her. At about 6pm her flatmate called for an ambulance, but it didn\u2019t arrive until around 8pm. She was still in the flat at 10.30pm and died an hour later in hospital. </p> <p>\u201cI have gone through every \u2018what if?\u2019 question there is to ask. It is hard to accept the delays of the ambulance service and the failures of the paramedics who were meant to help her.</p> <p>\u201cThree times I got ready, went to court, only for the inquest to be postponed. I eventually got the verdict on honeymoon, two years after Sabrina\u2019s death, at which point my legal costs amounted to over \u00a330,000. Her ashes are still with the undertaker. </p> <p>\u201cI have never previously criticised paramedics or the NHS in general. One in 80 pregnancies is ectopic, and a simple operation could have saved her life. I\u2019m never going to be the mother of the bride. I am never going to be a grandmother. When you go through this process, it demoralises you. You realise you are just a file. If I had not pushed it, the ambulance delays would have been ignored, and there would never have been an inquest into her death.\u201d</p> <p><em>As told to Patrick Greenfield</em><br /></p>",

Other reported embarking on school runs lasting up to two hours.</p> <p>Despite official guidance requiring councils to place families where practical in the borough in which they are resident, Shelter says authorities in London are now moving households out of area \u201cas a matter of course\u201d.</p> <p>Campbell Robb, chief executive of Shelter, said: \u201cFaced with severe budget cuts and overwhelming numbers of homeless families coming to them for help, it\u2019s sadly not surprising that overstretched councils in London are failing to meet their current legal responsibilities.\u201d</p> <p>The charity warns that the government\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/10/low-income-families-private-housing-rent-benefit-freeze\">four-year freeze on housing benefit rate</a>s, coupled with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jul/20/benefit-cuts-to-hit-huge-number-of-children-government-figures-show\">extended benefit cap</a> and rising rents, will trigger more out-of-area moves, as councils across the south of England compete for dwindling stocks of private-rented sector homes that are affordable within housing benefit limits.</p> <p>One London council told Shelter that Luton was \u201cfull\u201d \u2013 had no more temporary accommodation \u2013 and it was now looking to house its homeless families in other boroughs. Luton council itself was last year <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3184227/Disabled-couple-daughter-four-stranded-motorway-service-station-hotel-council-home-them.html\">forced to put up a homeless family</a> in a \u00a365-a-night Travelodge because no temporary homes were available locally, partly because landlords had leased them to councils in the capital.</p> <p>Latest official figures show that 17,150 households were temporarily housed out of area in 2015, up from 5,330 in 2010. Over 90% of placements were made by London authorities, who say their hand is forced by high rents, housing benefit caps and affordable housing shortages. </p> <p>Based on Freedom of Information requests, Shelter estimates that almost half of all homeless families <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/davehillblog/2016/may/19/london-housing-the-rising-costs-of-temporary-accommodation?CMP=share_btn_tw\">placed in temporary accommodation</a> by London councils in the year to June 2015 were sent out of area. </p> <p>Although most went to a neighbouring borough, 26% were placed in the capital but \u201cbeyond a reasonable travelling distance of their local services, neighbourhood support networks and schools\u201d. One in 10 were rehoused outside London.</p> <p>Although many out-of-area placements were lawful, Shelter says there is evidence of \u201csharp practices\u201d whereby vulnerable homeless families are unlawfully pressured by councils into accepting unsuitable temporary accommodation. They include:</p> <ul> <li>Homeless families being leaned on by council officials to make on-the-spot decisions on whether to accept an out-of-area placement, including in one case being threatened with having their children taken into care if they turned it down.<br /></li> <li>A meeting of homeless families being told by a housing officer at an unnamed London council that unless they were \u201cprepared to move to the West Midlands\u201d they should leave the room now.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></li> <li>One homeless family was told they had no option to take an out-of-area placement and they were given just minutes to accept. When they challenged it they were subsequently found accommodation locally.<br /></li> </ul> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/may/20/family-reunited-housing-battle-separation-benefits-cap\">landmark court judgement</a> last year emphasised that while out-of-area placements are not in themselves unlawful, councils have a legal duty to ensure that they ensure the relocation is suitable and appropriate for the family\u2019s circumstances, taking into account any potential disruption to education, medical needs, caring responsibilities and employment.<br /></p> <p>But Shelter found that one year on, a third of London boroughs had not complied with the judge\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.uk/decided-cases/docs/UKSC_2014_0275_Judgment.pdf\">ruling</a> that councils must revise and clarify their out-of-area policies in line with the judgement, including several that have made extensive use of out-of-area placements.</p> <p>Some London councils argue that they are struggling to cope with a <a href=\"http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/communities-and-local-government-committee/homelessness/written/28603.html\">\u201cperfect storm\u201d</a> of homelessness pressures and have lobbied ministers for changes in the law to make it easier for them to send families outside the capital. </p> <p>It is understood that the Department for Work and Pensions is sympathetic to this view. But local government ministers are resistant to legal changes and want councils to ensure existing guidance works more effectively.</p> <p>A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government said: \u201cThe government is clear that councils have a legal duty to ensure that any temporary accommodation they offer is safe and suitable for the family concerned.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>\u201cThe vast majority of out-of-borough placements are still within London, often in the neighbouring borough, and the number of households in temporary accommodation is well below the 2004 peak.\u201d</p> <p><br /></p>",

Under the stewardship of EU officials, the body will oversee the sale of about 71,500 pieces of prime public property in what will amount to collateral for the \u20ac250bn in bailout loans Greece has received since 2010.</p> <p>\u201cThey are with the exception of the Acropolis selling everything under the sun,\u201d said Anna Asimakopoulou, the shadow minister for development and competitiveness. \u201cWe are giving up everything.\u201d </p> <p>The multi-bill, which also foresees VAT being raised from 23% to 24%, is part of a package of increases in tax and excise duties expected to yield an extra \u20ac1.8bn in revenue. Earlier this month, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/08/rioters-take-to-the-streets-ahead-of-greek-austerity-vote\">Tsipras\u2019s leftist-led coalition endorsed pension cuts</a> that were similarly part of an array reforms amounting to \u20ac5.4bn, or 3% of GDP.</p> <p>At the behest of the EU and International Monetary Fund, the government has agreed to adopt tighter austerity in the form of an automatic fiscal brake \u2013 referred to as \u201cthe cutter\u201d in the Greek media \u2013 if fiscal targets are missed. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Despite official claims that goals will be achieved, there is a high degree of scepticism as to whether this is feasible. The Greek economy has seen a depression-era contraction of more than 25% since the outbreak of the debt crisis in late 2009, and with high taxes likely to repulse investment, economic fundamentals are also unlikely to improve.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/09/the-choice-for-europe-rescue-greece-or-create-a-failed-state\">The choice for Europe: rescue Greece or create a failed state | Paul Mason</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cWe are talking about indirect taxes, property taxes and income taxes all going up,\u201d Asimakopoulou said. \u201cNobody will be able to pay them, targets will be missed, more austerity will be imposed and of course public rage will have to be vented. People will not only feel angry, they will feel conned.\u201d<br /></p> <p>The measures \u2013 the ultimate U-turn for a government that once pledged to eradicate austerity \u2013 are the latest in a set of \u201cprior actions\u201d Athens must take to complete an economic review that will unlock desperately needed bailout funds to avert default. The country has to meet \u20ac3.5bn in debt repayments this summer, starting with a \u20ac300m loan instalment to the IMF on 7 June \u2013 money the country simply does not have. </p> <p>Eager to avoid more drama before next month\u2019s in/out EU referendum in the UK, general elections in Spain and regional polls in Germany, lenders have indicated they will disburse the loans at Tuesday\u2019s Eurogroup meeting. Berlin, which has provided the bulk of Greece\u2019s emergency aid, signalled the instalment could be as much as \u20ac11bn \u2013 more than twice the original \u20ac5.4bn, according to the German financial daily Handelsblatt.</p> <p>But creditors are still fiercely divided over the red-button issue of tackling Athens\u2019 staggering \u20ac321bn mountain of debt. Although the EU and IMF now both concede the load is unsustainable, member states reject outright the prospect of a debt writedown for fear of losses on bailout loans. Euro finance ministers insist that if it is ever to recover, Greece has to achieve a primary budget surplus of 3.5%, excluding debt repayments. They have hinted that at most, they will agree to discuss debt relief when the country\u2019s current - and third \u2013 bailout programme expires in 2018. </p> <p>The quarrel deepened last week when the Washington-based IMF, which has openly questioned Athens\u2019 ability to achieve such a high surplus, proposed that Greece defer all debt repayments until 2040 and extend its repayment period with maturities that would run through 2080 on a capped interest rate of 1.5%. The standoff is expected to intensify on Tuesday. </p> <p>Addressing parliament on Sunday, Tsipras insisted it was a huge achievement that Greece had finally succeeded in putting the debt issue on the table.

      "body": "<h2>1<strong>) </strong>Classic three does not suit Hodgson\u2019s terrific two</h2> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re starting off with a more classic three [in attack] but there\u2019s no reason why we can\u2019t play with two wide forwards and a more diamond-like formation,\u201d said Roy Hodgson before the game. \u201cThe good thing is with those players we can change things around in the game without changing personnel.\u201d Well, yes, kind of. Hodgson did indeed change things around after an hour but only after the starting lineup \u2013 which always looked best suited to a 4-4-2 \u2013 had demonstrated why the initial formation did not suit them in the first place. England flourished in qualifying using a 4-3-3 with Danny Welbeck, now injured, normally on the left of the attacking trident, but playing Jamie Vardy there denies him the chance to demonstrate his finest qualities \u2013 particularly in front of goal \u2013 and focuses on his weaknesses. This friendly, and the win over Germany, showed a diamond suits the squad far better than Hodgson\u2019s first-choice formation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/22/england-turkey-friendly-international-match-report\">Jamie Vardy pounces to give England win against Turkey in friendly</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>2<strong>) </strong>England fail to gain from Kane\u2019s set-piece pain </h2> <p>If the decision to play Vardy on the left looked unwise, Harry Kane\u2019s appointment as set-piece taker-in-chief was similarly regrettable. Though Kane is capable of scoring from them \u2013 he got a 90th-minute match-winner for Spurs with one against Aston Villa in November 2014, though to be fair it was deflected \u2013 at Tottenham he plays alongside Christian Eriksen, one of the division\u2019s better set-piece takers, and thus most of his dead-ball experience has come on the training ground. On this evidence that is probably where it should remain \u2013 two early shots flew off target and the problem with his crosses was that, even when they were good, he was not there to score from them. His corner did lead to England\u2019s late winner, though had Volkan Babacan, the Turkey goalkeeper, not decided to impede Ismail Koybasi, it would have brought only a straightforward goal-line clearance.</p> <h2>3<strong>) </strong>Calhanoglu highlights defensive disarray</h2> <p>It was not just in attack that England disappointed from set pieces. In Hakan Calhanoglu, one of a group of talented young German-born players in the Turkey squad, Fatih Terim has a player who offers excellent delivery and in the second half \u2013 the Turks not having won a corner in the first \u2013 he repeatedly caused problems. Twice he found team-mates in space, with Cenk Tosun heading wide of the near post and Hakan Balta heading wide of the far. On both occasions Dele Alli was stationed on the near corner of the six-yard box, ostensibly a free man, but failed either to attack the ball or to impede his opponent. Hodgson has nearly three weeks to work on his team\u2019s defensive positioning before their first game of Euro 2016, and will need every moment.</p> <h2>4<strong>) </strong>Vardy still up for going down despite suspension</h2> <p>England\u2019s historical supremacy over Turkey is such that even opening the scoring within the first 150 seconds fell well short of breaking their record in this fixture, John Barnes having needed only 62 to score the first in an 8-0 win at Wembley in 1987. If England looked once again en route to a rout when Kane turned in Alli\u2019s pass, it did not turn out that way. Indeed without a howler from a linesman \u2013 Kane was so offside Terim felt compelled to show the fourth official a replay on a mobile phone \u2013 and another from Babacan, England would not have scored at all. Between times Vardy proved that his contentious yellow card for diving against West Ham in April, in nearly identical circumstances to his successful penalty claim here, has not put him off the practice of running in front of defenders and deliberately falling over them.</p> <h2>5<strong>) </strong>Team profits from club connections</h2> <p>Only five Tottenham players were selected for England in the entire 1970s, with Glenn Hoddle only making that list courtesy of a goalscoring debut against Bulgaria five weeks from the end of that decade. Here there were five in a single starting XI, evidence of the team\u2019s current elevated status. It was not a unique achievement \u2013 since 2000 Arsenal and both Manchester clubs have had at least as many players on the pitch together in England shirts \u2013 but it is nevertheless an impressive one. Club team-mates can bring a depth of understanding that is hard to achieve at international level and there were a couple of glimpses of that here, once very early and again towards the end. In the better of them Alli created a goal for Kane \u2013 he had done so seven times in the league this season, making them the most destructive combination in Europe\u2019s top five leagues \u2013 while later Vardy was released by an early pass from the substitute Danny Drinkwater, leading to another chance for Kane. Alli\u2019s position in the starting XI, despite the number of free-kicks he concedes, looks fairly secure but Drinkwater also has a case. He provides an intuitive link with Vardy and was more effective than Jack Wilshere at protecting a defence which, on this evidence, will need quite a bit of assistance in France.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-23T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>This was some way for Halifax Town to overcome the crippling disappointment of relegation. Three weeks after dropping out of the National League Premier due to a final-day draw with Macclesfield, Jim Harvey\u2019s team put their frustration to good use by beating Grimsby 1-0 to win the FA Trophy on their first visit to Wembley.</p> <p>Understandably Grimsby had prioritised returning to the Football League after a six-year absence by beating Forest Green here in a play-off last week, and looked quite lethargic against their fresher opponents. There would be no second dose of success in eight days for Paul Hurst\u2019s team as Scott McManus\u2019s stunning effort three minutes after half-time looped over the head of James McKeown.</p> <p>McKeown had done well to push away a Richard Peniket cross but Grimsby\u2019s defence were slow to react and after failing to clear, McManus arrived to loop the ball over the keeper and into the net from 25 yards.</p> <p>McManus departed with a suspected torn cruciate ligament 20 minutes from the end but a Grimsby onslaught never materialised, a couple of corners and a tame shot from Nathan Arnold aside.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s a massive result,\u201d Harvey, the Halifax manager, said. \u201cWe\u2019re only part-time, I\u2019m only here five months and I\u2019ve had to adjust to what they can offer me. We\u2019ve had to be rigid with the formation, basically defend and counter.\u201d</p> <p>When Harvey took over at Christmas, Halifax were 10 points from safety. In the end they were a point away from staying up. This was the last game of the Northern Irishman\u2019s contract; he is expected to learn on Monday if he will be offered a new deal.</p> <p>Grimsby\u2019s dynamic forward pairing, Padraig Amond and Omar Bogle, could find no time nor space against Halifax\u2019s five-man defence and with Nicky Wroe dominating in midfield, the Shaymen were a tad stronger throughout.</p> <p>All of Grimsby\u2019s best chances came from set pieces but Amond, in the first half, and Shaun Pearson, in the 90th minute, could only direct their headers into the arms of Sam Johnson.</p> <p>Indeed McKeown kept Grimsby in the game for a time, with Wroe and Jordan Burrow both going close. Connor Hughes could have put the game beyond doubt in added time when played through by Burrow but Aristote Nsiala recovered well to block his goalbound effort.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a bit of a learning curve,\u201d Hurst said. \u201cDid one or two enjoy last weekend too much? A combination of that and the efforts put in over the last two weeks has taken its toll. We didn\u2019t have energy. It was a bit pedestrian for me.\u201d</p> <p>The Grimsby manager also warned that the team to begin League Two in August will be significantly different to the promotion-winning side. \u201cI would be foolish to rip it up altogether,\u201d Hurst added. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to keep some to maintain the spirit and togetherness to kickstart next year but at the same time we need to add quality. We are moving up a level. We need quite a few players in.\u201d</p>",

      "headline": "Magic Weekend roundup: Hull FC go clear at top with late derby fightback",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-23T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p><strong>Hull FC</strong> succeeded where their title rivals failed at Magic Weekend, beating <strong>Hull KR</strong> in the final game of the event to move top of Super League for the first time this season.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/21/leeds-rhinos-wigan-warriors-super-league-match-report\">Sam Tomkins inspires Wigan to handsome win over Leeds</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Trailing 16-10 midway through the second half, it looked as though Hull would follow in the footsteps of their fellow top-four sides Warrington, Catalans Dragons and St Helens, all of whom lost over the course of the weekend. But late tries from Mahe Fonua and Jamie Shaul gave a final scoreline of 28-16 \u2013 a ninth win in 10 games for Lee Radford\u2019s side, who moved outright clear at the top with only eight regular-season games left until the split for the Super 8s.</p> <p>Played in front of a record attendance of 68,276, the highest two-day crowd in the event\u2019s history, Hull ensured they took full advantage of the earlier slip-ups from the leading pack across the course of the weekend. Rovers had threatened an upset when they scored 16 unanswered points to turn a 10-0 deficit into a 16-10 lead, but Hull\u2019s double salvo late-on secured what could turn out to be a priceless victory in the context of their season.</p> <p><strong>Wakefield</strong>\u2019s incredible renaissance under the stewardship of Chris Chester continues at pace as they secured a ninth win in 10 games with a dramatic win against Catalans.</p> <p>Expected to struggle again in 2016 after just three wins in 23 regular season games in 2015, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/16/chris-chester-head-coach-wakefield-hull-kr\" title=\"\">arrival of Chester as coach of his hometown club earlier this year</a> has coincided with an incredible upturn in form that has moved them within four points of the top four.</p> <p>Both Wakefield\u2019s and Catalans\u2019 form suggested this would be the standout fixture of the weekend and both sides produced a classic. However, they were only split courtesy of a remarkable drop goal from Jacob Miller, the Australian half-back calmly steering the ball over from halfway with three minutes remaining.</p> <p>\u201cWhen he got the ball on halfway I wondered what he was doing,\u201d said Chester afterwards. \u201cI thought he had no chance, but I\u2019m pleased that he got it through the posts. There\u2019s still eight games left and we need another three wins to consolidate that place in the top eight: we\u2019re not getting carried away.\u201d</p> <p>Wakefield fought back magnificently from 14-0 to lead 18-14, and with both sides scoring three tries apiece, the errant goal-kicking of Pat Richards already began to look key. However, it seemed like it would not matter when the Dragons, who were hunting down top spot after a number of upsets elsewhere at Magic Weekend, went back in front courtesy of tries from Vincent Duport and Jodie Broughton \u2013 but again, Richards was off target in converting the latter.</p> <p>A key element of Chester\u2019s Wakefield is their never-say-die spirit and while better teams could have folded in the closing minutes, Trinity would level it up when Micka\u00ebl Simon crashed over against his former side. Simon would turn from hero to villain though, conceding an easily kickable penalty for Richards five minutes from time \u2013 but the former Wigan winger would strike a post. It allowed Miller to snatch a 25-24 victory three minutes from time, kicking arguably the most remarkable one-pointer in Super League history, sparking wild celebrations and enhancing the dreams of Trinity fans who might just be starting to believe something incredible can happen in 2016.</p> <p>There was another upset in the second game of day two as <strong>Huddersfield</strong> ensured the defending champions, Leeds, would finish the weekend cut adrift at the bottom of the table after hammering <strong>St Helens</strong>. The Giants scored eight tries during the 48-20 mauling of Saints, another side who had a chance of ending the weekend on top of the table. It means the Giants, who were bottom earlier in the season themselves, are now just four points adrift of the top eight.</p>",

In fact that was the HSJ survey\u2019s estimate for the total deficit for NHS providers in England for the whole of the last financial year, 2015-16.

      "body": "<p>The final stages of the journey to the stadium contained sufficient bag searches and scanning procedures to make one wonder whether one was about to board an aeroplane rather than watch a football match. Once finally installed in one\u2019s seat there was no restorative gin and tonic but consolation came in the recently all too rare sight of Jack Wilshere back in the heart of England\u2019s midfield.</p> <p>After spending the best part of a year out injured he was auditioning for one of the final remaining tickets for the flight to France for next month\u2019s European Championship. On the basis of a slightly underwhelming, at best decidedly mixed, 66 minutes before his replacement by a fellow convalescent, Jordan Henderson, it is hard to believe Roy Hodgson will not offer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/20/jack-wilshere-history-roy-hodgson-england-turkey\" title=\"\">Wilshere</a>, right, the benefit of the doubt.</p> <p>For all that one of Arsenal\u2019s finest may have been thoroughly eclipsed by Tottenham\u2019s Dele Alli on an afternoon when he exerted minimal impact on the game, Wilshere still offered tantalising glimpses of a very special talent.</p> <p>The problem with far too many so-called \u201ccomplete\u201d modern midfielders is that they are a bit formulaic \u2013 or \u201cclones\u201d as Roy Hodgson has been known to brand them. England\u2019s coach has not always been entirely synonymous with imaginative, improvisational, football but he has always relished a bit of technically assured lateral thinking in the playmaking department \u2013 which is why he once, briefly, took <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/dec/04/what-is-your-most-impressive-piece-of-football-trivia\" title=\"\">Jari Litmanen</a> to Fulham.</p> <p>Sadly, by then, the wonderful Finland creator was struggling for full fitness and things did not quite work out as intended. Undeterred, Hodgson has continued hankering after a Litmanen-esque figure somewhere in his teams and, though Wilshere is in some respects a very different footballer, one senses he sees something of the Finn in him.</p> <p>Capable of playing between the lines in a manner that Henderson, for instance, cannot, a properly fit Wilshere could yet bring out the best in Harry Kane and Jamie Vardy at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/ng-interactive/2015/dec/12/euro-2016-interactive-wallchart-groups-fixtures-venues-and-more\" title=\"\">Euro 2016</a> but possibly, just possibly, also help camouflage the defensive deficiencies that Turkey helped expose here.</p> <p>In France he will surely be half a yard sharper and significantly less ring rusty than he looked in Manchester. There were certainly some sharp, slick cameos that served as welcome reminders of his quick brain and quicker feet but for long periods Wilshere\u2019s movement proved not nearly good enough to shrug off the assiduously close attentions of Oguzhan Ozyakup. Indeed when England attacked, Ozyakup seemed to be performing the sort of man-marking role the 24-year-old may have to contend with on the other side of the Channel.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/22/england-turkey-friendly-international-match-report\">Jamie Vardy pounces to give England win against Turkey in friendly</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On the odd occasions Ozyakup was given the slip, Selcuk Inan or Ozan Tufan invariably seemed on hand to second guess a midfielder who spent the first part of the opening half in all but anonymous mode.</p> <p>Almost imperceptibly Wilshere then began seeing more of the ball. His first influential moment saw him pull out to the right before cutting back inside, dropping a shoulder and then unleashing a shot which properly tested Volcan Babacan\u2019s reflexes.</p> <p>While Manchester\u2019s contrary weather veered sharply between bright, balmy sunshine and torrential rain, between bright blue and slate-grey skies, his game appeared similarly hit and miss. Even on top form he is rarely brilliant out of possession and, in that respect, he merely reconfirmed he is no Roy Keane.</p> <p>Conversely he can do things others would not even think of attempting. There was the gorgeous, distinctly Hoddle-esque, defence-bisecting long, diagonal ball which picked Raheem Sterling out on the right and allowed the winger to deliver a cross which provoked a panicked Turkish clearance that could have been deflected anywhere. Then there was Wilshere\u2019s exquisite early through-pass which set Jamie Vardy racing goalwards and seemed strangely reminiscent of so many dispatches from the striker\u2019s Leicester team-mate Danny Drinkwater.</p> <p>Admittedly there was also a wayward attempted cross which sailed embarrassingly out of play when Harry Kane was well placed to connect but the suspicion is that, right now, Hodgson may be more concerned by Wilshere\u2019s physical robustness than his actual input.</p> <p>What probably mattered more was that he emerged unscathed and, apparently, unruffled from a series of fully committed Turkish sliding tackles of the sort Ars\u00e8ne Wenger would have winced at. The moment when Caner Erkin went straight through the back of such a historically fragile physique was most definitely not for the Arsenal manager\u2019s eyes.</p> <p>The fractured left fibula which prevented Wilshere from kicking a football for months on end may have been deemed fully healed by early April but, in one sense, that was the easy part over. The next, continuing, phase is about rediscovering his old self and that will not happen overnight.</p> <p>After all, his belated spring return meant that last season he played only 141 minutes of first-team football for Wenger\u2019s side, making 81 passes.</p> <p>Such skinny statistics mean considerable catching up remains to be done \u2013 but Wilshere\u2019s late dash for England\u2019s departure gate is most definitely under way.</p>",

Juan Mata, though, scorer of the equaliser in Saturday\u2019s FA Cup final, could leave, as Mourinho sold the Spaniard to United in January 2014 when he was in charge of Chelsea.</p> <p>Mourinho is understood to retain an interest in Stones, who is valued at more than \u00a340m and whom he tried to sign for Chelsea from Everton last summer, and faces a fight for the England international with Manchester City. United have also made inquiries to Juventus about Morata\u2019s team-mates Alex Sandro, a left-back, and Paul Pogba, the former United midfielder. However the club was quoted \u00a3116m (\u20ac150m) for each, a price designed to end United\u2019s interest.</p> <p>It would constitute a major surprise if United were not to confirm Van Gaal\u2019s departure on Monday and swiftly install Mourinho.</p> <p>Despite Mourinho being out of work since December and having no formal contact with Ed Woodward until this month, when the executive vice\u2011chairman finally made a move for him, the Portuguese has been drawing up a list of potential acquisitions in the expectation of being offered the job.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/may/22/jose-mourinho-special-one-manchester-united-louis-van-gaal-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4jf7m\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2510887\"            data-video-name=\"Jos\u00e9 Mourinho: how would the Special One fare at Manchester United? \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5741cd48e4b0d7feade1ca61\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/22/160522JoseMourinhoUtd_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/22/160522JoseMourinhoUtd_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/22/160522JoseMourinhoUtd_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/22/160522JoseMourinhoUtd_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/22/160522JoseMourinhoUtd.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/video/2016/may/22/jose-mourinho-special-one-manchester-united-louis-van-gaal-video\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho: how would the Special One fare at Manchester United?</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Mourinho has been aided in this by Jorge Mendes, his representative and one of the world\u2019s most powerful agents, with an extensive network of contacts. Many\u00a0players who are Mendes clients are of interest to the incoming United manager.</p> <p>Valencia\u2019s Portugal midfielder Gomes, 22, would cost around \u00a340m, has five caps, and won the Primeira Liga with Benfica in 2014.</p> <p>Jo\u00e3o M\u00e1rio, 23, also a Portugal midfielder, plays for Sporting. He has eight caps and he would cost at least \u00a327m. His father, Jo\u00e3o M\u00e1rio Eduardo, has previously said that Jo\u00e3o M\u00e1rio would be priced at more than the \u00a326.7m Bayern Munch recently paid Benfica for Renato Sanches to join them next season.</p> <p>Mourinho\u2019s interest in Gomes and J\u00f5ao M\u00e1rio suggests Bastian Schweinsteiger, who has suffered an injury-plagued first season at United and who is 32 in August, may be under threat. Carrick is now minded to stay at the club but he is 35 in July and can no longer be relied upon to play twice a week.</p> <p>Zenit St Petersburg\u2019s Garay previously played under Mourinho at Real Madrid and is a 29-year-old centre-back who is a seasoned Argentina international with 32 caps. However, as Mourinho sold him to Benfica in 2011, Garay may be a second choice after Stones.</p> <p>Icardi is a 23-year-old Argentinian striker who captains Internazionale and is on Mourinho\u2019s list as a fall-back option for Morata should one be required.</p> <p>Javier Zanetti, Inter\u2019s vice-president, has signalled that the club would be resistant to his sale. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see [about who we might have to sell], but we\u2019ve got to talk to Roberto Mancini [the coach] about it first\u00a0to make plans for next season,\u201d he told La Gazzetta dello Sport. \u201cIn any case, Icardi is certainly going to stay. He\u2019s our captain and even he\u2019s said that he\u2019s\u00a0staying.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/22/louis-van-gaal-iron-tulip-muddled-thinker-manchester-united-jesse-lingard-fa-cup-final\">Louis van Gaal: from Iron Tulip to muddled thinker at Manchester United</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Morata would cost around \u00a340m as Real Madrid are expected to activate their \u00a323.6m buyback clause from Juve and listen to offers in this region for him. The Spanish striker is thought to a favour a move to United over a host of other clubs because of Mourinho\u2019s likely appointment at Old Trafford.</p> <p>Despite De Gea enjoying another superb season for United, being voted the player of the year by fans for a record third consecutive campaign, he was minded to depart should Van Gaal be granted the final season of his contract.</p> <p>Van Gaal\u2019s awkward style of management has caused widespread disquiet among his players. Despite Carrick being the vice-captain and a regular pick under the 64-year-old Dutchman, the veteran, who is out of contract in the close season, was also seriously contemplating leaving if Van Gaal remained.</p> <p>However the arrival of Mourinho has changed the view of Carrick and De Gea, and this is also reflected among many of the rest of the squad.</p> <p>Herrera is another player who has struggled to enjoy a concerted run in the side under Van Gaal and is now hopeful of a fresh start under Mourinho.</p> <p>If De Gea does stay it would represent a sizeable coup as the Spanish international goalkeeper nearly joined Real Madrid at the end of last August\u2019s transfer window.</p>",

Fletcher is more girthy and urgent, bustling in, knock-kneed and elbows everywhere. Here, on a day wrecked by rain, the pair combined to fine effect \u2013 each finding movement in the air and off the seam \u2013 to share four Hampshire wickets.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/may/22/county-cricket-live\">County cricket \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At both ends of the day Nottinghamshire met a doughty pair of foes; Michael Carberry and Jimmy Adams put on 45 across a devilish first hour having been invited to bat, while Sean Ervine and Tom Alsop shared a more stylish undefeated 65 as the truncated day drew to a close. Hampshire are not for lying down.</p> <p>From the first ball, by which Carberry was beaten outside off-stump, Ball \u2013 who will leave this fixture to be replaced after two days if selected for the second Test by England \u2013 looked in sync. He and Fletcher found enough movement to have Chris Read at his athletic best behind the stumps. After swapping ends, Ball\u2019s probing line was rewarded and Carberry edged to third slip. Not long after, Fletcher brilliantly caught and bowled Adams and pinned Liam Dawson in front next ball.</p> <p>Rain meant the players returned from lunch at 4.15pm, and Ball trapped Will Smith lbw to bring Ervine and Alsop together. Alsop, scorer of two second XI 150s in the past week, looked classy on the cut \u2013 both in front and behind point, and off his legs. Neither Ball nor Fletcher bowled in the 13 overs after another rain delay, however, and the batsmen made it to stumps increasingly at ease.</p> <p>Elsewhere in Division One, Chris Rogers made his 74th first-class century \u2013 and first for <strong>Somerset</strong> \u2013 and against his former side <strong>Middlesex</strong>. After Toby Roland-Jones picked up the wickets of Marcus Trescothick, lbw for eight, then Tom Abell \u2013 with whom Rogers shared 85 \u2013 caught behind driving loosely for 41, Rogers put on an undefeated 125 with James Hildreth for the third wicket. Rogers reached his century two overs before the new ball was due, however bad light prevented it being taken and they were 219 for two at stumps.</p> <p>At Old Trafford, <strong>Lancashire</strong>\u2019s Kyle Jarvis ripped through <strong>Surrey</strong>\u2019s top order to take six for 70 as the visitors were bowled out for 191. This was something of a success, however, as Surrey \u2013 having opted to bat \u2013 had been 40 for five; the opener Rory Burns, last man out for 92, led the rebuild, sharing 64 with James Burke and 68 with Gareth Batty before Neil Wagner cleaned up the tail.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/21/somerset-sign-chris-gayle-sexism-interview\">Somerset to sign Chris Gayle despite \u2018inappropriate\u2019 remarks to reporter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Earlier, Jarvis found a swinging brute to dismiss Arun Harinath, before Kumar Sangakkara was pinned in front and Steven Davies caught behind, both for ducks. Jason Roy soon followed, miscuing to mid-on, then Ben Foakes left one that nipped back. Burns stood firm before being pinned in front by Wagner.

This is not hyperbole.\u201d</p> <p>If Hillary Clinton is elected, Perry said, she will nominate a supreme court justice willing to overturn the court\u2019s landmark 5-4 decision in <a href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/07-290.pdf\">District of Columbia v Heller</a>, from 2008. In that case, the court ruled that Americans have an individual right to own firearms in the home for self-defense. </p> <p>On Friday, Maya Harris, an adviser to Clinton, said the candidate believed the Heller decision was \u201c<a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-20/hillary-clinton-believes-pivotal-gun-rights-ruling-was-wrong-adviser-says\">wrongly decided</a>\u201d, as it undermined the ability of cities and states \u201cto craft commonsense laws to keep their residents safe\u201d.</p> <p>Supreme court justice Antonin Scalia, the author of the Heller decision, died suddenly in February. Republican leaders immediately pledged to delay the nomination of a replacement until after the 2016 election. </p> <p>In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/20/nra-endorses-donald-trump-convention\">endorsing presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump</a> on Friday, NRA leaders told members: \u201cThe second amendment is on the ballot in November.\u201d Trump <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/08/trump-accuses-clinton-of-wanting-to-abolish-the-second-amendment\">once again</a> turned the charge against Clinton.</p> <p>Perry, who ended his bid for the Republican nomination <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/sep/11/rick-perry-drops-out-republican-presidential-election\">in September</a>, has been a fierce critic of Trump. But he told CNN on Friday that he would be willing to be his vice-president. </p> <p>\u201cI suspect I\u2019m going to be helping him in myriad ways,\u201d Perry said. </p> <p>Asked to comment on Sunday on what he thought about Trump\u2019s endorsement by the NRA, Perry was lukewarm. </p> <p>\u201cGreat, yeah, good, good show,\u201d he said. </p> <p>He said he was very concerned about the future of gun rights in America. If Clinton and \u201cthe anti-gun people\u201d succeed in overturning Heller, he said, \u201cthat would jeopardize gun rights\u201d. </p> <p>Any justice nominated by Clinton, Perry added, \u201cshe will give a test to, about whether or not they\u2019re going to be supporting gun rights\u201d.</p> <p>Though it was a huge symbolic victory for gun rights advocates, the Heller decision did not radically transform gun laws in most of America. Local handgun bans were extremely rare, thanks to the political power of the NRA and other advocates. </p> <p>Since Heller, courts have left other gun control laws in place, including state bans on \u201cassault weapons\u201d.</p> <p>Perry said overturning Heller would still have serious implications for gun owners.</p> <p>\u201cWe consider that to be the nose under the camel\u2019s tent,\u201d he said. \u201cThose of us who have been in this business for a long time understand that you ratchet things one way or the other a little bit at a time. </p> <p>\u201cThis is a ratcheting away from [the] second amendment right to carry freely wherever we should be able to.\u201d</p> <p>Asked what he thought Clinton would realistically be able to do to restrict gun rights in her first term in the White House, Perry said: \u201cNothing, because she won\u2019t be there.\u201d </p> <ul> <li><em>The NRA refused to issue Guardian US with accreditation for its annual convention.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-23T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>It was only going to be a matter of time before <a href=\"http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2016/03/18-eu-turkey-statement/\" title=\"\">the deal between the EU and Turkey</a> aimed at\u00a0putting an end to perilous refugee journeys across the Aegean sea was put to the test, both in its effectiveness in stemming the flow and in its political consequences. As to the first, the numbers have spectacularly come down since the agreement was made in March, which can only be a good thing. But the political and legal difficulties of the arrangement have been exposed even as the numbers fall.</p> <p>The renewed tensions between Brussels and Ankara are quite serious. The EU\u2019s uneasiness with what it has negotiated with the Turkish government is evident, as is Turkish irritation. How each side manages those tensions will determine a great deal, but the underlying difficulty is that Europeans have limited sway over Turkey\u2019s leadership because they are in a state of dependence on Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.</p> <p>Recent events suggest the deal is quite fragile. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the EU commission, <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/eus-juncker-warns-turkey-over-terror-law-reform-1463057368\" title=\"\">has made it plain the agreement would be void</a> if Turkey does not rescind its anti-terror law. Cancelling that legislation is one of the conditions Turkey has to meet for visa-free travel to be granted to its citizens within the European Schengen zone. Free travel is one of the key incentives (along with important financial aid) offered to Turkey in exchange for taking back both migrants who do not qualify for asylum in Europe and Syrians who find themselves blocked in Greece.</p> <p>Last week, another potential stumbling block appeared when the EU took exception to a constitutional amendment being pushed through the Turkish parliament under which MPs would be stripped of their immunity to prosecution, a move likely to lead to the ousting of Kurdish lawmakers. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Sunday that she would <a href=\"http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0YD0DR\" title=\"\">raise the issue</a> when she meets President Erdo\u011fan on Monday.</p> <p>Another came when <a href=\"http://www.express.co.uk/news/world/672360/EU-migrant-deal-Greek-court-refugee-Turkey-Aegean-Sea-Migrants\" title=\"\">a Greek court ruled</a> that sending back migrants to Turkey violated fundamental principles contained in the 1951 refugee convention because that country cannot be considered safe. This came after human rights organisations had criticised Turkey for blocking refugees attempting to enter the country from Syria, <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/turkish-border-forces-fire-live-rounds-at-syrian-refugees-fleeing-isis-fighting-a6986771.html\" title=\"\">even opening fire on them</a> (five deaths have been alleged). Turkish authorities deny having a policy of pushing Syrians back \u2013 and it is unclear whether Turkish border guards fired knowingly at refugees or whether they acted for security reasons in a region where Isis has tried to gain a foothold.</p> <p>Not the least of the problems is that Mr Erdo\u011fan has been concentrating more power into his hands since the resignation of prime minister Ahmet Davuto\u011flu. Mr Davuto\u011flu\u2019s replacement, Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, is a long-time Erdo\u011fan loyalist who many believe will help push through constitutional changes aimed at creating an all-powerful presidential system. All this is happening in the run-up to a large international gathering this week in Turkey, the first ever <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/21/world-humanitarian-summit-in-istanbul-what-is-it-and-what-will-i/\" title=\"\">World Humanitarian Summit</a>, spearheaded by the UN.</p> <p>The thinking behind the EU-Turkey deal was that it was needed not only to alleviate a desperate humanitarian situation, but to reduce populist and xenophobic reactions throughout Europe. Time was of the essence. With the warm weather approaching, the refugee flow was threatening to take on even larger dimensions than in 2015, when more than a million people arrived in Europe.</p> <p>Time was also short politically, with important votes due in several European countries, including the British referendum. But the Brexit camp\u2019s use of the Turkish issue has been mendacious. The deal does not promise EU accession for Turkey, it only reactivates negotiations that have been going on for over a decade. Nor would visa-free travel for Turks mean that huge numbers would start settling in Europe.</p> <p>It appears unlikely Turkey will meet the end-of-June deadline for all conditions to be filled for visa-free travel. The hope among European officials is that Erdo\u011fan will nevertheless avoid cancelling the deal, because of the political benefit he has drawn from it so far. Both sides, in spite of their obvious differences, need this arrangement to continue. A repetition of last year\u2019s tragedies does not bear thinking about.</p>",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://longitudeprize.org/\">The Longitude Prize</a> is a very smart idea. The prize is a handsome \u00a38m and it awaits the first individual or (more probably) team that develops a quick, cheap and reliable way of stopping overuse or misuse of antibiotics. The diagnostic \u2013 it might be a strip of sensitised paper or it might be a mobile phone app \u2013 must be capable of being used anywhere in the world. Next week another round of assessment of ideas begins from the 138 teams so far registered.</p> <p>A prize is smart economics to encourage smart science. It counters the lack of a strong market incentive to develop a diagnostic for which there is an overwhelming need \u2013 while reminding the rest of us to remember, next time we see the doctor, the urgency of the crisis. Antibiotics, it is reckoned, add 20 years to life expectancy; resistance is growing so fast that already 700,000 people die each year from untreatable infections. From the exotic, like typhoid, to the all too domestic <em>Clostridium difficile</em>, the pathogens that once succumbed swiftly to penicillin and other antibiotics now fight back. They are becoming killers again.</p> <p>Finding a diagnostic that can be made universally available isn\u2019t going to save the world. But as the economist Jim O\u2019Neill argued in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/19/no-antibiotics-without-a-test-says-report-on-rising-antimicrobial-resistance\">his report</a> on antimicrobial resistance published last week, when more than half of all prescriptions for antibiotics may be unnecessary, developing a globally available test is going to be part of the solution to keeping them viable for another generation. Antibiotic resistance arises when a drug wipes out the weediest organisms in a population, leaving hardier ones behind that pass on their genes. Then, when this next generation is hit with drugs, the weediest of those are killed off, leaving a bunch behind that are hardier still. Simply <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21699115-evolution-pathogens-making-many-medical-problems-worse-time-take-drug-resistance\">reducing the number of times a type of bacteria is challenged</a> might, counter-intuitively, stop it growing more resistant. Walk softly and carry a big stick.</p> <p>Economics isn\u2019t working here. That\u2019s partly why new generations of antibiotics emerge so infrequently. Earlier generations are now cheap and plentiful and increasingly ineffective. New ones are very hard to develop, and might never be licensed for mass distribution but instead reserved as a weapon of last resort. There\u2019s not much profit in either. Lord O\u2019Neill proposed a \u201cplay or pay\u201d levy on big pharmaceutical companies; the ones that didn\u2019t invest in research and development would be required to help those that did. The industry reaction was negative.</p> <p>The problem of antibiotic resistance is about science and economics, and it faces society itself, locally and globally, with hard questions, too. It pits individual benefit against the common good: your sore throat, our ability to survive a hospital stay. It demands recognition that a personal benefit may at a distance have a much greater cost.</p> <p>If that was the extent of the problem, it would be challenge enough. But it is much worse than that. The EU has banned the use of antibiotics in farm animals. In the US and China and many other countries, they are a commonplace growth enhancer. They deliver fatter pigs and bigger profits to farmers, more cheap food to swelling populations. All the cheap and effective diagnostic kits in the world will be futile if there is no agreement to end this rival abuse of scientific knowledge. Like climate change, there is only one big way to meet the threat. Together.</p>",

Only Jonny Bairstow and Alex Hales were able to cope with the Sri Lanka attack, with the rest of the top order, Nick Compton excepted, needing to understand that the way to cope with a ball that is swinging and often seaming, from a fullish length, is not to try and tee off.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/22/england-ben-stokes-second-test-chris-woakes-sri-lanka-squad-chris-woakes-cricket\">England\u2019s Ben Stokes set to miss second Test with Chris Woakes pencilled in</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hales was excellent, facing more deliveries than the entire Sri Lanka team combined managed in either innings, and should appreciate that his 86, however it ended, was worth plenty more on a flat pitch. Bairstow benefited early on from bowling plans that appeared to have been discovered with the Dead Sea Scrolls: trying to bounce him out is so old hat. Once he was away, aside from the caught-and-bowled chance missed when he had 70, there was no stopping him. Only Matt Prior, twice, has scored a Test match century for England and taken five catches in an innings before this one.</p> <p>For Sri Lanka there was just no answer to Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad, England\u2019s most successful ever pairing. The key to a great bowler such as Anderson is that when everything is in his favour, as it was at Headingley, he can get the job done with clinical efficiency where some might strain too hard for success. Only five men in Test history have taken 10 or more wickets in a match for fewer runs than his 10 for 45. Sri Lanka might feel aggrieved at the lack of preparation they were accorded or indeed the time of year they have been compelled to play, such is the commercial imperative to place other teams in the mid-summer, but <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2015/aug/06/england-stuart-broad-zone-australia-ashes\" title=\"\">as Australia found last season</a>, teams can soon discover that things are beyond them. This England side, in their own conditions, are a tough prospect.</p> <p>They will further understand, though, because Trevor Bayliss will have hammered it home, that better teams will have made them suffer for their fielding lapses. Indeed it was the coach who abandoned the anonymous back seat and led the team huddle before the final session of the match. Having bowled Sri Lanka out so cheaply, they may have just released the pressure second time round.</p> <p>So, as pleasing as it was to watch a young batsman such as Kusal Mendis score a maiden half century, he was gifted opportunities galore and will not find such benevolence in future. James Vince, who arrived with glowing references with bat and as a close catcher, did little to enhance his reputation with either. Two of the chances that went his way were difficult but of a kind that England have become used to taking, and one was as simple as they get. And while his keeping overall is generally improving by the match, Bairstow missed one low to his right that he ought to have taken.</p> <p>England did not emerge physically unscathed, with the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/21/ben-stokes-england-test-sri-lanka\" title=\"\">knee injury to Ben Stokes</a> a concern. The results of his scan will be known soon but, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/21/england-alastair-cook-sri-lnaka-jimmy-anderson-headingley\" title=\"\">as Alastair Cook said</a>, the chances of him being risked in the second Test, which begins on Friday at his home ground of Chester-le-Street, are slender. In any case there will be an addition to the 12-man squad, and it is going to be difficult even to come close to a like-for-like replacement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/may/22/england-innings-win-sri-lanka-headingley-talking-points\">England\u2019s innings win against Sri Lanka: five Headingley talking points | Vic Marks</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Given this, there are several options. One is to select another batsman (in fact Stokes, if the injury affects him strictly when he bowls, and would not otherwise be exacerbated or its recovery inconvenienced, could just play as a batsman and invaluable close catcher). A second option would be to pick someone such as Chris Woakes, who can act as a fourth seamer and who has a first-class century to his name this summer as, incidentally, has his Warwickshire team-mate Keith Barker, a fine cricketer, although his value is as a new-ball specialist, not a priority now.</p> <p>This would all be a bit belt-and-braces. The simplest option would be to play Jake Ball, and move Bairstow up a place, not ideal (his county coach, Jason Gillespie, is adamant that England have it spot-on in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/may/20/jonny-bairstow-england-sri-lanka-ted-dexter\" title=\"\">batting him at No7</a>), but more than justifiable as a one-off.</p> <p>It was good to see England enforce the follow-on, a strategy that has largely gone out of fashion. Only once, at Chandigarh in 1990, when India, who made 288 and then dismissed Sri Lanka for 82 and 198, has a side enforced it with fewer runs on the board. But if ever there was a time to do it, it was in this Test, where the bowlers had hardly broken sweat in dismissing Sri Lanka first time round, the opposition appeared totally inadequate in coping, and the conditions remained in the bowlers\u2019 favour.</p> <p>The prospect of rain would not have entered the equation this time. England last enforced the follow-on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/mar/18/england-test-draw-new-zealand\" title=\"\">at Wellington in 2013</a>, although that was strictly in the knowledge that the remnants of Cyclone Sandy heading down the Tasman Sea was going to wash the game out anyway. But three times before that they have come unstuck. At Durban in 1999, Nasser Hussain asked South Africa to follow on and then had to watch for more than 14 and a half hours as Gary Kirsten made 275.</p> <p>Then, at Lord\u2019s, against Sri Lanka in 2006 and two years later against South Africa, England saw the pitch get flatter and flatter as both opponents brought the bowling to its knees. In the first, Andrew Flintoff bowled himself into the deck and possibly the infirmary, and in the second, England got through three new balls and still could not get through the batting.</p> <p>Those matches, and the facts that pitches generally have shown a disinclination to deteriorate rather than just get flatter, and that most series now, with back-to-back Tests, allow little time for bowlers to recuperate, have more to do with the reluctance now than any Kolkata-2001-Australia-type fear of embarrassing defeat.</p>",

      "body": "<p>\u2018Is it OK to use the black emojis if you\u2019re not black?\u201d<strong> </strong>As conversation starters about identity politics go, few seem more juvenile and current than this one. (FYI, to avoid the tedium of this real-life chat I had recently, it\u2019s easier to stick with your own skin tone.) And yet, here we are, at the frontier of <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/24/magazine/earning-the-woke-badge.html?_r=0\">\u201cbeing woke\u201d</a>. On one hand, this means being socially aware about issues such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/black-lives-matter-movement\">#blacklivesmatter</a>, racial profiling, privilege, Islamophobia etc \u2013 all the big guns. On the other? Not every battle is worth having. To clarify, this isn\u2019t a discussion about the very real and very insensitive cases of cultural appropriation in recent years \u2013 the most obvious being <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/jul/30/why-the-fashion-headdress-must-be-stopped\">native American headdresses \u2013 a sacred tradition regurgitated as cheap and crass festival costume fodder</a> (so two summers ago, keep up). No, what we\u2019re seeing more and more of now are the minority voices within minorities who are policing communities and culture to the point of ridicule.</p> <p>Take, for example, the <a href=\"https://i-d.vice.com/en_gb/article/five-things-the-founder-of-reclaimthebindi-needs-you-to-know\">#reclaimthebindi movement</a>. I understand the frustration: having been embarrassed about your heritage and made fun of when you were younger for your mum\u2019s funny clothes and accent, it\u2019s jarring then to see Becky at Latitude co-opting sari tops and henna for that ethnic festival look a decade later. It\u2019s not necessarily racist, but it is definitely high on the scale of Dumb, Annoying Shit People Do. To be ranked in that same file: <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2013/jul/14/the-color-run-in-pictures\">colour runs</a> (the Hindu spring festival <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holi\">Holi</a> reconfigured as an Instagram opportunity in Hyde Park); the fact that Black Twitter is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/zola-tells-all-the-real-story-behind-the-greatest-stripper-saga-ever-tweeted-20151117\">rarely credited for setting the agenda for contemporary pop culture</a>; Coldplay\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/01/coldplay-beyonce-hymn-for-the-weekend-cultural-appropriation-india\">cringe discovery of India</a> on their last album. However, to claim that Beyonc\u00e9 committed a heinous, culturally insensitive crime by wearing <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://youtu.be/YykjpeuMNEk?t=2m25s\">south Asian-style gold and henna</a> in the video for Coldplay\u2019s Hymn for the Weekend, or that only African American women can truly appreciate <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/24/beyonce-lemonade-review-a-woman-not-to-be-messed-with\">Lemonade</a>, segregates culture in an aggressively retro way. It\u2019s a parody of earnestness that does us no favours. How did we even get here?</p> <p>Tribally marking off permission rights on who can and who cannot enjoy certain music and certain fashion \u2013 both industries where creativity and innovation depend so much on borrowing from so-called \u201cother\u201d cultures \u2013 is inane. It also distracts from bigger-picture arguments: say, the disproportionately high numbers of non-white deaths in police custody, or the rights of Bangladeshi factory workers, still stitching your H&amp;M vests for <a href=\"http://www.retailgazette.co.uk/blog/2016/02/m-and-s-and-h-and-m-risk-ethical-status-as-foreign-workers-earn-less-than-half-of-a-living-wage\">less than a living wage</a>.</p> <p>See <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/05/19/blake-lively-needs-to-get-woke-and-fast.html\">the energy expended on Blake Lively</a> last week. A relatively innocuous actor slash lifestyle brand \u2013 the B-side to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/gwynethpaltrow\">Gwyneth Paltrow</a>, if you will \u2013 Lively was called out as a racist for posting a picture of her arse on Instagram with the caption: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BFhx9lGR4Jj/?hl=en\">LA face with an Oakland booty</a>.\u201d Which is, for clarity\u2019s sake, a lyric from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JphDdGV2TU\">Baby Got Back</a> by the connoisseur of big butts, <a href=\"http://www.laineygossip.com/Sir-Mix-a-Lot-weighs-in-on-Blake-Livelys-Oakland-Booty-Instagram-post-in-new-interview-with-The-Hollywood-Reporter/43949\">Sir Mix-A-Lot</a>. Lively may well be dim to sensitivities around race and privilege (she did, after all, host her 2012 wedding to Ryan Reynolds at <a href=\"http://gawker.com/blake-livelys-fall-fashion-inspiration-is-slaveowners-1645661587\">a plantation in South Carolina</a>), but that\u2019s by the by. The alleged furore she sparked in this instance was because, <a href=\"http://jezebel.com/blake-lively-says-that-she-has-an-l-a-face-with-an-oak-1777246470\">to quote women\u2019s website Jezebel</a>, she \u201ctouts a diametrical opposition: that Los Angeles can equated to elegance and/or beauty (read: whiteness) and that Oakland is its foil (read: blackness)\u201d.</p> <p>Sure, yes, I get it. But is this the hill we want to die on? The Daily Mail <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3597054/Blake-Lively-stirs-controversy-labels-derriere-Oakland-booty-Instagram.html\">would like its readers to think so</a>. Like many sections of the press, it will routinely, hysterically, report on tiny corners of the internet shrieking racism at every minor outrage \u2013 arguably, because it\u2019s easier then to undermine social justice warriors as sensitive keyboard ninnies even when they\u2019re battling legitimate prejudice.</p> <p>Should we really be wearing out moral outrage and energy in pretending that Sir Mix-A-Lot belongs not to those coming of age in the 90s, but exclusively to the African American experience? And, if so, where do we stop When Cultural Appropriation Goes Bad? Once you put down dodgy markers, where only people of colour have the right to write about race, only black people can rap, only my mum can make authentic <a href=\"http://www.vahrehvah.com/indianfood/palak-gosht/\">palak gosht</a> (that last one is true, actually), where do you draw the line? And at what point do we admit that the argument becomes less to do with being respectful of \u201cother\u201d cultures and more about your own ego as a minority voice? While it\u2019s one thing to stick it to white privilege and remind the mainstream that not everything is made for and about white people, it\u2019s quite another to cordon off culture into ever tinier boxes, where the right to enjoy and be influenced by what you consume is narrow and prescriptive.</p> <p>Suddenly, that utopian optimism about embracing, sharing and celebrating one another\u2019s differences seems so quaint. The struggle isn\u2019t about one-upmanship. Nor is it about the racial politics of your emoji.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The proposals for prison reform which have been outlined in the Queen\u2019s speech are certainly welcome \u2013 as far as they go. Simon Jenkins is absolutely right (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/18/unless-michael-gove-cuts-prison-numbers-doomed-fail\" title=\"\">Unless Gove cuts prison numbers, he\u2019s doomed to fail</a>, 19 May). The issue of sentencing is crucial \u2013 but there is a more fundamental problem which is rarely addressed. As a society, we seem to have lost our way in agreeing what prison is for. Punishment? Retribution? Vengeance? Rehabilitation? Education? With a rightwing press clamouring for a lock-them-up-and-throw-away-the-key mentality, the philosophy of out of sight and out of mind will come to haunt us. With the doubling of prisoner numbers over the past 25 years, and a 50% recidivism rate, something is clearly wrong. As an official prison visitor, I see at first hand the consequences of incarcerating young men within a regime that struggles to deal with their complex problems and needs. I can only hope that the justice secretary will promote a wider and deeper approach, otherwise the spinning of the reforms as \u201can agenda for a revolution\u201d will be nothing more than that \u2013 spin in order to appease his backbenchers.<br /><strong>Malcolm Goldring</strong><br /><em>Markfield, Leicestershire</em></p> <p>\u2022 The government fails to recognise that high imprisonment rates are one of the many costs of inequality. Not only is there a close relationship internationally and among US states between income inequality and the proportion of the population imprisoned, but the doubling of numbers in UK prisons since 1990 took off after the biggest sustained rise in UK inequality for a century.</p> <p>The correlation between inequality and imprisonment is not driven mainly by more crime: most of it is harsher sentencing in more unequal countries. More punitive attitudes are also evidenced by the younger ages at which children are tried as adults in more unequal countries, by the more brutal prison regimes, and by the greater tendency for more equal US states to abandon the death penalty.</p> <p>Whether more punitive penal systems reflect more fear or less empathy in more unequal societies is not clear. But studies show that people trust each other less in more unequal societies and are less willing to help each other. In addition, the rich in more unequal societies seem to have a greater sense of entitlement and to behave more antisocially than the less well off. <br /><strong>Richard Wilkinson</strong><em> Emeritus professor of social epidemiology, University of Nottingham </em><br /><strong>Kate Pickett</strong> <em>Professor of epidemiology, University of York</em></p> <p>\u2022 In 1993 the then home secretary Michael Howard claimed that \u201cprison works\u201d. He was absolutely right. Prison does indeed grimly work. It works to dehumanise and brutalise prisoners, and to increase their risk of suicide. It works to allow the widespread use of drugs and their trading in prisons. It works to deny most prisoners decent education and rehabilitation opportunities, so that half of them reoffend within a year of discharge. It works to deprive prisoners of basic human rights, including the right to NHS treatment on the same terms as in the community and the right to vote. It works to undermine the lives of the innocent families of prisoners.</p> <p>It is good that David Cameron and Michael Gove have belatedly recognised the need for radical prison reform, but the present situation is the direct result of the hardline penal policies pursued by Howard and his successors (with the notable exception of Kenneth Clarke), and the resulting steep rise in the prison population on their watch, together with obverse drastic reductions in prison staff.<br /><strong>Robin Wendt</strong> <br /><em>Chester</em></p> <p>\u2022 Three cheers for Simon Jenkins. He could not have described the situation more starkly. Yet another prisons bill will set out plans to reduce reoffending by released prisoners. But this latest \u201cinitiative\u201d comes too late for many locally based charities with a track record of successful resettlement work. Our trained volunteer mentors work with people before release and meet them at the gate, thus avoiding the pub, the drug dealer and almost inevitable homelessness. But the so-called \u201c<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/transforming-rehabilitation-a-strategy-for-reform\" title=\"\">transforming rehabilitation</a>\u201d movement has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/feb/23/privatisation-probation-service-stressed-job-cuts\" title=\"\">contracted out</a> crucial areas of work to big companies, many of which have little or no experience of working with offenders and see very little value in work that can\u2019t easily be measured. Independent research confirms a reduction in reoffending for people who have had a mentor. Need I say more?<br /><strong>Margaret Carey JP</strong><br /><em>Chair of board, Sussex Pathways</em></p> <p>\u2022 We hear fine words in the Queen\u2019s speech about prison reform and rehabilitation, but must assume that little has changed since the time when I had oversight of the development of prison education in six prisons as adult education adviser in Lancashire for 20 years. It took me several years to get a literacy assessment included in the prison induction programme and then they got a shock. Daytime literacy programmes were offered at the request of the prisons but take-up was low because the prisoners lost pay. Most of the education provision therefore took place in the evening, but prisoners were moved around the prison system at short notice and it took up to a month for their education papers outlining their needs to follow them. The public exams that some prisoners wished to take could only be taken at fixed times and releases took place, often at short notice, at any time, and prison education officers were forbidden to contact a college in the release area to help in the continuation of study. In conjunction with the Lancashire probation service we set up education liaison posts to assist in this process and I was asked to speak about them at a national conference which included the then prisons minister but they have long since disappeared. In my experience whenever there were cuts \u2013 and there were several \u2013 education was the first to be affected. The prison system appeared to me to have a built-in inertia and it is not clear whether the increase in the private companies running prisons, with their emphasis on profit and the outsourcing of the education provision, has improved the situation. The prison system should be built around rehabilitation; the\u00a0punishment is being there.<br /><strong>David Selby</strong><br /><em>South Wonston, Winchester</em></p> <p>\u2022 It is not just patients with terminal health problems who should be encouraged to spend more time outside (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/17/doctors-should-prescribe-gardening-for-patients-more-often-says-report\" title=\"\">GPs are urged to prescribe gardening</a>, 18 May). We should be setting up gardens in our youth offending institutions and prisons too.</p> <p>A ground-breaking scheme in the San Francisco county jail in the 1990s was so successful in turning lives around that prisoners who had been discharged reoffended purely so that they could rejoin the garden project. This led to a further project being set up in the community as a halfway house to help those leaving prison adapt to life on the outside.</p> <p>Instead of the iPads being suggested by the justice secretary, Michael Gove, prison gardens would provide prisoners with valuable skills, contribute to healthy diets within the jail and raise prisoners\u2019 sense of self-worth by giving them something meaningful to do. Gardening has the power to transform lives and should be part of a panoply of measures needed to bring our prisons into the 21st century.<br /><strong>Fiona Carnie</strong><br /><em>Isle of Coll, Argyll</em></p> <p>\u2022 The Coates review (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/17/skype-ipads-in-cell-education-prison-legislation-queens-speech\" title=\"\">Give prisoners iPads and Skype, review to urge</a>, 18 May) proposes more in-cell technology for prisoner education. Their use should also be explored for enhancing family contacts, to expand the email scheme introduced last year at the suggestion of a prisoner. The evidence is that recidivism is dramatically reduced where prisoners and families are enabled to keep in touch, and this could lead to substantial financial savings.<br /><strong>Tommy Gee</strong><br /><em>Wingfield, Suffolk </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

Since 2000, when it was handed statutory obligations to place children in custodial institutions, monitor their care and investigate complaints, 17 children have died, thousands have been unlawfully restrained, and children have suffered broken bones and lost consciousness while being forcibly held down. Officers were given a password, \u201cOxo\u201d, to shout out during restraint training, if they couldn\u2019t breathe. Not so for children: 15-year-old Gareth Myatt cried that he couldn\u2019t breathe, but as three G4S officers held him down he was told \u201cif you\u2019re shouting, you can breathe\u201d, before he died of positional asphyxia. Restraint trainers called themselves Mauler, Breaker and Crusher. Recent reports reveal breathless children were handed their asthma inhalers but kept under restraint. Self-harming children are held in appalling conditions, stripped of all their possessions and dignity. Add to this children being hungry, terrified and lonely. Then there is the sexual abuse, the scale of which it is impossible to assess from the outside.</p> <p>The YJB has been close to children\u2019s suffering for many years, just like civil servants working in the Ministry of Justice and the Home Office before. It has front-row seats to the harm caused by officers empowered to inflict severe pain on children during restraint, yet has never publicly condemned the practice. Fourteen-year-old <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2011/jan/13/adam-rickwood-inquest-custody-death\" title=\"\">Adam Rickwood</a> took his own life after the use of unlawful and painful restraint. A body truly championing children would not watch in silence \u2013 it would speak up, and loudly.</p> <p>Michael Gove has already announced he intends to remove children from penal institutions. There is a strong case for a national safeguarding body that has the power and autonomy to properly defend the rights of children, but we also need an\u00a0independent inquiry to retrieve, collate and publish material that the YJB, the multinationals and others possess in respect of child abuse across all prisons, not just Medway STC. Adult society forever communicates to children the virtues of telling the truth and owning up, as a precursor to making things better.

Now they must pay the price</a>, 17 May). Secure training centres were established after scandals relating to deaths and suicides in young offender institutions managed at the time by the Home Office. They were to offer the same advantages as secure children\u2019s homes, which had not had any such occurrences. I was manager of a secure children\u2019s home at the time and attended many meetings with both the YJB and Home Office officials, where it was evident that the macho prison culture dominated. Chair at the time was Lord Warner, a civil servant who had previously been appointed director of social services in Kent, and it was clear that the government wanted the quality of care found in secure children\u2019s homes but nearer the price of the cheaper but less effective options.</p> <p>When Lord Warner resigned, he was replaced by Rod Morgan, a recognised expert in youth justice, who saw the YJB role as influencing as well as implementing policy. For example, he pointed out how the YJB business plan target of reducing juvenile custody levels was being undermined by government policies that encouraged a rise. The New Labour government decided not to renew his contract, so he resigned to highlight the level of political interference preventing the development of effective practice.</p> <p>The contracts forced by the privatisation agenda do not protect young people because the records that determine whether a company can be fined for non-compliance are easily manipulated, as we have seen.<br /><strong>Roy Grimwood</strong><br /><em>Market Drayton, Shropshire </em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

      "body": "<p>Francis Bown\u2019s claim that the sacrament of holy orders in the Roman Catholic church has always been confined to men (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/18/the-limits-of-liberality-for-christians-female-deacons-and-buddhists\" title=\"\">Letters</a>, 19 May) is contradicted by the research of Cipriano Vagaggini in 1974. Pope Paul VI invited Fr Vagaggini, as a member of the official International Theological Commission, to research this matter, and the resulting work showed clearly that women were ordained to the diaconate as a sacrament of the church throughout the first millennium and beyond. Among those whose work confirms this, Professor Gary Macy of Santa Clara University reports that the shocking reason for the gradual decline in the office of women deacons in the early centuries of the second millennium was prejudicial male attitudes to menstruation. The 12th-century canonist Theodore Balsamon wrote that \u201cthe monthly affliction banished them from the divine and holy sanctuary\u201d. What the pope is playing with is surely the fire of the spirit sending gifts not on selected groups but on all and for all.<br /><strong>Cathy Wattebot</strong><br /><em>Coventry</em></p> <p>\u2022 Francis Bown thinks Pope Francis is playing with fire as he sets up a commission to consider the ordination of women as deacons. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s the fire of the holy spirit, the one which promised to guide \u201call who are far off, all whom God will call\u201d. I believe that offers some freedom from the necessity to adhere to the social constraints of first-century Palestine and to constantly rebuild a church fit for purpose rather than a historical re-enactment society.</p> <p>I have noticed that, when deciding \u201cin obedience to the example of our Lord\u201d who is, and who is not, acceptable to lead or to join us in worship, we are tempted to choose those parts of His example which coincide with our own prejudices. Early discipleship was not just confined to men (possibly), it also appears to have been confined to Palestinians, predominantly fishermen and tax collectors, probably all wearing beards. Obedience to the example clearly offers some flexibility. Perhaps we might start to consider for ourselves where the spirit is leading us today?<br /><strong>Keith Penn</strong><br /><em>Sutton in the Isle, Cambridgeshire</em></p> <p>\u2022 I need to confess to a feeling of schadenfreude on reading Mr Bown\u2019s letter concerning possible moves to ordain women deacons in the Roman Catholic church.

      "body": "<p>By the end, there was a narrative that will no doubt fuel the debate about whether Wayne Rooney deserves to start in Euro 2016 or whether Roy Hodgson should be emboldened enough to place his trust in the new generation. With the captain missing, Harry Kane and Jamie Vardy both scored in England\u2019s new-look attack and, at the very least, it served as a reminder that Hodgson\u2019s team are no longer as reliant on their leading scorer as once might have been the case.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/22/roy-hodgson-defends-jamie-vardy-skipping-england-game-to-get-married\">Roy Hodgson defends Jamie Vardy skipping England game to get married</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How much that will sway Hodgson\u2019s opinion remains to be seen after a weekend in which Rooney excelled for Manchester United to help them <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/21/crystal-palace-manchester-united-fa-cup-final-match-report\">win the FA Cup</a>. Yet it was certainly a satisfying way for Kane and Vardy to reiterate their own credentials and, in the process, an England side featuring five Tottenham Hotspur players in the starting lineup ought to be encouraged by the way they inflicted Turkey\u2019s first defeat since November 2014.</p> <p>It did not even matter too greatly that Kane, having opened the scoring in the third minute, squandered a second-half penalty with the score at 1-1 because, that aside, Hodgson must have been impressed by the confidence the Tottenham striker has clearly taken from winning the Golden Boot as the Premier League\u2019s most prodigious scorer. Kane\u2019s willingness to take aim from all sorts of distances and angles did sometimes stray towards being overly indulgent but he scored with a neat finish and, on this form, he will clearly trouble defences in next month\u2019s tournament. He might, however, have to sharpen up his penalty-taking skills.</p> <p>Vardy, who will be excused from Friday\u2019s game against Australia because he is getting married in midweek, is another one who looks completely at ease in England\u2019s colours and, as well as scoring the 82nd-minute winner with a typically predatory piece of penalty-box finishing, it was the speed and direct running of the Leicester City striker that also led to the penalty. Kane is better missing them now than in the tournament itself, and there was certainly more good than bad for Hodgson to ponder after Joe Hart\u2019s brilliant stoppage-time save from Olcay Sahan secured the win and made amends for the goalkeeper\u2019s misjudgment preceding Turkey\u2019s equaliser.</p> <p>That is not to say it was a flawless performance when, defensively, there was further evidence of England\u2019s imperfections. Turkey had a 20-minute period at the start of the second half when they looked the more rounded side and, though Danny Rose won the official man-of-the-match award, England\u2019s new left-back was also at fault when Hakan Calhanoglu levelled the scores in the 13th minute. Rose was caught out positionally and Hart made a poor decision to dash off his goalline to try to charge down the cross from Volkan Sen. The goal was left exposed and Calhanoglu was in the centre to turn in Sen\u2019s right-sided delivery.</p> <p>The equaliser came as a jolt bearing in mind the impressive way England started the match, with Raheem Sterling running at defenders, Kane immediately making it clear he intended to leave a favourable impression on the match and the home team opening the scoring from a quick, flowing move that also served as another reminder of Dele Alli\u2019s penetrative gifts.</p> <p>Sterling had quickened the tempo with a darting run towards the penalty area but it was Alli\u2019s nutmeg on the Turkish captain, Mehmet Topal, that did most of the damage. Kane was anticipating the pass from his Spurs team-mate and calmly steered the ball into the bottom left-hand corner of Volkan Babacan\u2019s net.</p> <p>By that stage Kane had already created the first chance of the match for Vardy and, in those early moments, Turkey did not look like a side that had gone so long without losing. Eric Dier, another impressive performer, headed one corner against the side netting and a difficult start for Turkey also comprised an awkward moment for their coach, Fatih Terim, when the officials ordered him to hand over a mobile phone that he had been using to watch video replays.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/may/22/england-turkey-live\">England v Turkey: Euro 2016 warm-up \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Early in the second half, however, Turkey started to gain the upper hand and there were two opportunities when their striker, Cenk Tosun, came close to giving them the lead. England had started to look a little scruffy in possession and just before the hour Hodgson, no doubt wanting Vardy to be more involved, switched to a midfield diamond in which the Leicester striker came in from the left to form a more orthodox partnership with Kane. Jack Wilshere was taken off shortly afterwards and, though he still looks short of match sharpness, he should be better for having played another game.</p> <p>Likewise, John Stones\u2019s confidence should be soothed by playing a full match without making any of the mistakes that have undermined his previous performances. England started to trouble their opponents again and were awarded their penalty after Vardy had stolen the ball from Topal, then raced clear and went to ground amid the strong suspicion he had deliberately waited for the contact in a way that has become familiar to regular Leicester watchers. It was probably the right decision, albeit a classic piece of Vardy opportunism, but Kane\u2019s effort flicked off the outside of the post for England\u2019s first penalty miss, barring shootouts, since Frank Lampard could not convert one in a friendly against Japan in May 2010.</p> <p>Hodgson\u2019s team kept pressing and the winning goal came from a corner Kane swung over from the right. Gary Cahill\u2019s header came back off Ismail Koybasi, guarding his near post, but the Turkish substitute also managed to impede his goalkeeper in the process and Vardy turned in the rebound from close range.</p>",

And that is bad for the process.\u201d</p> <p>The Democratic contenders need to secure 2,383 delegates to clinch the nomination. Clinton leads Sanders by 2,293 delegates to 1,533, according to numbers compiled by the Associated Press. She has the support of 525 superdelegates, to 39 for Sanders.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/03/2016-primary-delegates-embed/?party=Dem\" data-alt=\"Democratic delegate tracker\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/2016/03/2016-primary-delegates-embed/?party=Dem\">Democratic delegate tracker</a> </figure>  <p>The mathematical challenges facing Sanders have prompted some Democrats to suggest he should bow out of the race, rather than risk inflicting harm on Clinton\u2019s prospects of winning the White House <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/22/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-trayvon-martin-nra\">against Donald Trump in November</a>. </p> <p>But Sanders defended both his presence and the tenor of his campaign, telling Tapper he and the former secretary of state had \u201clegitimate issues\u201d to debate, such as climate change, healthcare, the minimum wage and military intervention. </p> <p>\u201cWhat we are trying to do is bring more people into the political process,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Clinton, in an appearance on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press, opted to take a more conciliatory tone. Asked if Sanders was helping Trump by continuing his campaign, she said: \u201cI don\u2019t think so. </p> <p>\u201cI think that Senator Sanders has every right to finish off his campaign however he chooses.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton nonetheless said she had received 3m more votes than Sanders, who she suggested had yet to be vetted at the national level.</p> <p>\u201cLet me say that I don\u2019t think he\u2019s had a single negative ad ever run against him,\u201d Clinton said, rebutting, in essence, Sanders\u2019 reliance on polling that shows him standing a better chance against Trump than Clinton. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I\u2019m not saying she cannot beat Donald Trump \u2026 I think there\u2019s a good chance she can.

She also rejected his criticism of the party\u2019s primary rules, noting they were adopted nationwide in 2014.</p> <p>Sanders <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/21/bernie-sanders-debbie-wasserman-schultz-dnc-primary\">took matters a step further in his CNN interview</a>, saying that if elected president, he would not reappoint Wasserman Schultz to her role. He also endorsed Tim Canova, a law professor who is challenging Wasserman Schultz from the left for her congressional seat in south Florida.</p> <p>\u201cClearly, I favor her opponent,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cHis views are much closer to mine.\u201d</p> <p>On Sunday, his campaign issued a fundraising email for Canova, stating: \u201cThe political revolution is not just about electing a president, sisters and brothers. We need a Congress with members who believe, like Bernie, that we cannot change a corrupt system by taking its money.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/22/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-trayvon-martin-nra\">Hillary Clinton: Trump presidency will put 'kids at risk of violence and bigotry'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Wasserman Schultz chose not to engage, issuing a brief statement in response.<br /></p> <p>\u201cEven though Senator Sanders has endorsed my opponent, I remain, as I have been from the beginning, neutral in the presidential Democratic primary,\u201d she said. </p> <p>\u201cI look forward to working together with him for Democratic victories in the fall.\u201d</p> <p>Not everyone in the Democratic establishment is concerned about the effects of Sanders\u2019 persistence.</p> <p>Dick Durbin, <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-20/sanders-defiant-on-the-stump-quietly-reassures-democrats-on-unity\">the second-ranking Democrat in the Senate</a>, said this week he was convinced after a conversation with Sanders that the senator would ultimately join forces with the party to defeat Trump.</p> <p>The Ohio senator Sherrod Brown, seen by some as a potential Clinton vice-presidential pick, expressed a similar view during an appearance in his home state with vice-president Joe Biden this week.<br /></p> <p>\u201cBernie will do the right thing in the end and will campaign aggressively [for the nominee],\u201d Brown told reporters. \u201cHe finds a Trump presidency abhorrent.

But the party he once led is not yet fully engaged.</p> <p>In unhealthy contrast, Conservatives cannot get enough of the EU row. If Toryland were an independent state, then \u201cbanging on about Europe\u201d would be its national sport. Why so? As a proxy argument about the future trajectory of the party, it does not fit precisely. Not all Tories who want to leave the EU are reactionaries, followers of <a href=\"https://www.aynrand.org/\">Ayn Rand</a> or doctrinally hostile to public services: Michael Portillo, the godfather of Conservative social liberalism and modernisation, is also a spirited Brexiteer.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If Toryland were an independent state, then \u2018banging on about Europe' would be its national sport</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So the correspondence is not exact. But the split over the EU is still the biggest, boldest bifurcation of the inner Tory map, dividing one vision of the party\u2019s future from another. Put it this way: when one thinks of the many members of the Tory right who have opposed Cameron\u2019s reforms of the party and his campaign to make Conservatives shake hands with modernity \u2013 while enjoying the electoral benefits of this strategy, naturally \u2013 one struggles to think of even a handful now supporting him in the greatest trial of his 11 years as leader.</p> <p>Cameron, at any rate, is in no doubt that he is engaged in a battle for the soul of the party. Last week\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/queens-speech\">Queen\u2019s speech</a> asserted his preoccupation with social reform as never before, explicitly reclaiming the \u201cone nation\u201d terrain that Ed Miliband tried to colonise but Jeremy Corbyn has so helpfully vacated. In his Peston interview, as in private, the PM made clear his intention to serve a full second term. When he first revealed this objective in an interview with me in January 2013, he insisted that the words \u201cfull term\u201d were not euphemistic as they were in the case of Tony Blair \u2013 who left No 10 only two years after the 2005 election. Cameron will not quit voluntarily unless he is confident the party has put down deep roots in the centre ground.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/apr/15/boris-johnson-last-chance-leave-eu-brexit-referendum-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4tdv9\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2489544\"            data-video-name=\"Boris Johnson: 'last chance' to leave the EU \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-571143a4e4b075be331961de\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/04/15/160415bojobrexit_1_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/04/15/160415bojobrexit_1_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/04/15/160415bojobrexit_1_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/04/15/160415bojobrexit_1.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/04/15/160415bojobrexit_1_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/video/2016/apr/15/boris-johnson-last-chance-leave-eu-brexit-referendum-video\">Boris Johnson: \u2018last chance\u2019 to leave the EU</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In his <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/400622/\">book Free Speech</a>, Timothy Garton Ash describes Europe as \u201cthe second biggest dog in the west \u2026 not really a single dog but rather an intercanine league\u201d. For the electorate, this referendum is a decision that will shape the nation\u2019s prospects for decades. For the dissenting rump of the Tory party, it is a means of getting rid of Cameron. The Treasury\u2019s final estimates of the cost of Brexit, published this week, are an opportunity for thoughtful voters to assess the remain case. For Brexiteers, the document will be another chance to call George Osborne \u201cPinocchio\u201d, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/21/george-osborne-pinocchio-house-prices-iain-duncan-smith\">as Iain Duncan Smith did at the weekend</a>.</p> <p>Notice that attacks on Osborne are central to the leave strategy. In a recent Spectator interview Boris Johnson <a href=\"http://www.spectator.co.uk/2016/05/boris-to-dave-somehow-or-other-weve-got-to-have-debates/\">spoke thus </a>of Osborne: \u201cI am delighted to hear he\u2019s principled \u2026 That is a major, major development.\u201d Do you remember the days when Boris and George were supposed to have sealed a great and durable friendship? Not so durable, it transpires. The Brexiteers have decided that Osborne should be destroyed, that this most resilient of politicians must be removed from Johnson\u2019s path for good: <em>Georgius delendus est</em>.</p> <p>Will Cameron let them get away with treating his closest ally like that? He is a natural conciliator, a self-styled broker of agreements within his party, rather than a Thatcher, content to divide and rule. The joint announcement of prison reform by the PM and Michael Gove on the eve of the Queen\u2019s speech suggested powerfully that the lord chancellor, though a passionate Brexiteer, is safe in his job. Cameron\u2019s allies do not dismiss the possibility of a \u201creconciliation reshuffle\u201d after the vote, though they emphasise that Cameron is not taking victory for granted \u2013 a wise position in these volatile times.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/21/tory-vote-mobile-online-polls-remain-ahead-leave\">Polls show Tory voters are pushing Britain towards staying in EU</a> </p> </aside>  <p>What has certainly not been decided is who gets what \u2013 the widely disseminated speculation that Gove will be made deputy prime minister and Johnson appointed home secretary being premature at best. Still: it frames a dilemma that Cameron should be thinking about. There is a difference between magnanimity and surrender. Where would the sense be in moving Theresa May, who has remained loyal, and replacing her at the Home Office with a politician who vacillated until the very last moment, accused the PM of \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/may/11/pmqs-corbyn-cameron-osborne-boris-johnson-interview-politics-live?page=with%3Ablock-5732f564e4b01a6abab1c0a3\">demented scaremongering</a>\u201d, and then invoked the spectre of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/16/tories-divided-by-boris-johnsons-eu-hitler-comparison\">Hitler</a> himself?</p> <p>My conversations suggest that there is no consensus in Cameron\u2019s circle about what to do with the former London mayor if remain prevails. As one senior source puts it carefully: \u201cThere will have to be an extent to which people are held to account for what they\u2019ve done.\u201d Another Cameron ally sees different priorities: \u201cThe quote about the rebel being better inside the tent rather than outside is such a cliche, but in Boris\u2019s case it may be depressingly true.\u201d This adviser, in fact, is angrier with Gove.</p> <p>The correct answer to these questions will be found by doing what clubbable Tories like least: forgetting the ties of friendship and the blisters of resentment, and acting dispassionately. Assume for the sake of argument that Cameron wins on 23 June. If he wants to govern successfully for more than three years with only a small Commons majority, he must show an almost unleadable party that actions have consequences. No post-referendum purge, therefore. But no universal amnesty either. So, prime minister: who\u2019s for the chop?</p>",

And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee.\u201d </p> <p>In a separate email, Caruso vowed to crush enemies of the project.</p> <p>\u201cI am enlivened by [the] opportunity to grind all resistance to my presence and the presence of MRC \u2026 into the animals [sic] of history as a failed campaign,\u201d he said.</p> <p>In March this year, Rhadebe was shot eight times in the head by men posing as policemen. Several other anti-mining activists have also been killed or injured.</p> <p>The Amadiba community member Sinegugu Zukulu said: \u201cMRC is determined to disrupt our way of life.

Graham Edwards must do an honorable thing tell MRC to leave us alone.\u201d</p> <p>Edwards has taken to Facebook to take issue with objections to the mine, after activists staged a protest outside the London offices of Telereal Trillium.</p> <p>\u201cAs I understand it, the mining process here involves taking sand, filtering it with water and magnetism and then replacing the sand,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt is difficult to understand the ecological damage that this is purported to cause. I would have thought that the economic benefits to the local community would be welcomed, but obviously that is for the local community to decide.</p> <p>\u201cI am surprised that your group feel that they have better information as to who committed this horrible crime than the authorities, but if you really do have evidence as to the guilty party then please do share it \u2013 particularly with the police.\u201d</p> <p>He also shared details of a survey, conducted by an independent firm, into local attitudes to the project.</p> <p>But sources said that while he was still in favour of the project, he was alarmed by the rhetoric employed by Caruso and planned to make his displeasure known.</p> <p>Edwards declined to comment.</p> <p>MRC said a poll of 200 locals showed that 77% either supported the mine unconditionally or wanted it to build local infrastructure.</p> <p>The company declined to comment on Caruso\u2019s biblical quotation.</p> <p>\u201cHistory shows not only have we invested substantially in mining development in South Africa but we have also done so working within the law in discharging our obligations under our prospecting and mining permits,\u201d the company said.</p> <p>\u201cWe believe that it is possible for responsible mining development to co-exist with environmental, social, and cultural purviews and this is what results in sustainable economic development.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Compensation claims for torture, rape, wrongful detention and forced labour brought by 40,000 Kenyans who allege they were mistreated by British officials during the Mau Mau insurgency are due to be heard in the high court in London on Monday.<br /></p> <p>The lawsuit against the Foreign Office is far larger than a previous class action brought by survivors of the 1950s colonial-era independence campaign. The oldest claimant is aged 91. </p> <p>Lawyers for the government are expected to make a last-minute application to delay the long-running case in a dispute over translation of witness statements. Approximately 1,500 claimants have died since the case was launched.</p> <p>Three years ago the then foreign secretary, William Hague, announced the UK was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/06/uk-compensate-kenya-mau-mau-torture\">paying out \u00a319.9m</a> in costs and compensation to more than 5,228 elderly Kenyans who suffered torture and abuse during the Mau Mau uprising. </p> <p>The admission came at the end of a test case brought by the law firm Leigh Day which established that UK courts did have jurisdiction to hear historical claims brought by those detained in military camps.</p> <p>While regretting the \u201cabhorrent violations of human dignity\u201d that took place in Kenya, Hague did not admit government liability and indicated it would defend future claims for compensation. The latest class action is being coordinated by Tandem Law, a Manchester-based law firm. The claimants will be represented in court by Simon Myerson QC.</p> <p>The judge, Mr Justice Stewart, will initially consider 27 test claims \u2013 including those of two people who have died \u2013 to assess the range of allegations made by the entire group. Later this summer some of the survivors are due to give evidence to the court via video-link from Nairobi.</p> <p>The allegations relate chiefly to injuries sustained by claimants between 1952 and 1961 during the state of emergency declared by the colonial administration in the face of African resistance to British rule. Most of the assaults are said to have taken place in screening centres, prisons, detention camps and under a programme known as \u201cvillagisation\u201d in Kenya\u2019s central province. </p> <p>Most of the claimants are from the Kikuyu, Embu and Meru tribes. The Kenyan government is not involved in the case. </p> <p>One test claim involves a mother whose daughter allegedly had her fingers cut off in front of her. Beatings are said to have been inflicted regularly on those detained in Manyani, Langata, Embaffaki and Athi River military camps . </p> <p>Kenya was finally granted independence in 1963. The Foreign Office has in the past argued that the Kenyan government, as the successor authority, should be liable for the claims. </p> <p>Unlike the first Mau Mau case, these new claims are not restricted to those who endured extreme physical violence. Over the emergency period, an estimated 90,000 Kenyans were killed or injured.</p> <p>Evidence of colonial brutality has emerged belatedly from files that were kept out of the National Archives for decades. In June 1957, one letter records, Eric Griffith-Jones, the attorney general of the British administration in Kenya, wrote to the governor, Sir Evelyn Baring, detailing the way the regime of abuse at the colony\u2019s detention camps was being refined. </p> <p>For the abuse to remain legal, Griffith-Jones wrote, Mau Mau suspects must be beaten mainly on their upper body. \u201cIf we are going to sin,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwe must sin quietly.\u201d</p> <p>The lead solicitor at Tandem Law, Freddie Cosgrove-Gibson, said: \u201cWe are disappointed that the British government continue to dispute the claims on all fronts, especially when they settled similar claims three years ago. </p> <p>\u201cDuring this time at least 1,500 of our clients have sadly passed away, denying them the opportunity to see justice being done for the truly awful treatment they suffered during the 1952 Kenyan emergency. Every day this number continues to increase.\u201d</p> <p>The Foreign Office declined to comment before the opening of the trial, which is expected to run on into next year. </p>",

She cited as examples Barclays\u2019 monthly cap of \u00a335 and bailed-out Royal Bank of Scotland\u2019s \u00a390.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5d1633192ebc4cd258a4e81aed7945a3fd79a40f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5d1633192ebc4cd258a4e81aed7945a3fd79a40f/0_166_1945_2431/800.jpg\" alt=\"Rachel Reeves\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rachel Reeves questions the effectiveness of the banks\u2019 current cap on overdraft fees.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: REX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Writing to Tracey McDermott, interim chief executive of the FCA, Reeves said: \u201cThe CMA\u2019s monthly maximum charge remedy has been portrayed as a cap on unarranged overdrafts, yet it is difficult to see it as such when banks are allowed to set the level of their own cap.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIndeed, as you will be aware, some banks already limit what they charge customers ... It is therefore hard to see how what the CMA proposed will bring about any fundamental change,\u201d she added.</p> <p>\u201cThe CMA has recommended that the FCA should undertake work to assess the effectiveness of the maximum monthly charge remedy and consider whether further measures could be taken to enhance its effectiveness. However, I ask that the FCA take this opportunity to go further and cap the unarranged overdraft charges,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The FCA declined to comment.<br /></p> <p> The competition watchdog, which must publish its final report by 12 August, said last week that its aim was to halve the \u00a31.2bn customers pay in unauthorised overdraft fees each year. It has been looking at ways to boost competition in the current account and small business banking sectors, through which the industry generated \u00a314bn of revenue in 2014. <br /></p> <p>Despite the arrival of new entrants, the big four of Lloyds Banking Group, Royal Bank of Scotland, HSBC and Barclays have a 77% market share of current accounts. The CMA wants to encourage customers to switch providers through the creation of price comparison websites \u2013 but it is regarded as particularly difficult for customers with overdrafts to shop around.<br /></p> <p>Reeves said in her letter: \u201cSome banks continue to rip off their customers with exorbitant charges for what are often minor account problems ... These charges unfairly penalise account holders who are struggling to stay on top of their finances. It is unjust that banks should push them into further financial hardship just because they are keen to make a quick buck.\u201d</p>",

McGregor believed that his publicity duties ahead of UFC 200 were getting in the way of his training schedule. McGregor was due to fight Nate Diaz, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/06/conor-mcgregor-nate-diaz-holly-holm-miesha-tate-ufc-196\">who he had lost to at UFC 196</a>. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, [the retirement announcement on Twitter] blew up,\u201d McGregor told ESPN. \u201cI was kind of having fun to start, half-hearted. Then all of a sudden it\u2019s, \u2018you\u2019re off 200!\u2019 I was like, \u2018alright, well fuck you too, then.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cAll said and done, there were times [I thought], \u2018I should have just jumped on the damn flight [and done the publicity tour].\u2019 But sometimes you\u2019ve got to do what\u2019s right for you and not what\u2019s right for everybody else, especially if you\u2019ve done what\u2019s right for everyone else a million times over.\u201d</p> <p>McGregor has since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/21/conor-mcgregor-not-retired-ufc-mma\">rowed back on his retirement announcement</a> and said he has held talks with the UFC president, Dana White. He added that his relationship with the organization is \u201cgood\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/apr/29/ufc-200-conor-mcgregor-jon-jones-mma\">Will Conor McGregor's absence hurt UFC 200? It's debatable</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m committed to the fight game,\u201d McGregor said. \u201cI enjoy competition. I enjoy challenges. If a challenge is in front of me and it appeals to me, I will go ahead and conquer it.</p> <p>\u201cDid I do all the media? Did I dance like a monkey? No. Am I still here? Am I still fighting? Am I still collecting? Yeah. So, [UFC] saved face, I saved face \u2013 there was no loser. We all won in a way. I had them realistically, but they couldn\u2019t bow down, so there was no loser. I was over here, they were there and now we\u2019re in the middle. We\u2019re in a good spot.\u201d</p> <p>McGregor added that his reluctance to go on the publicity tour in April had been influenced by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/12/mma-fighter-joao-carvalho-dies-dublin-tko\">the death of MMA fighter Joao Carvalho</a> at a fight in Ireland. Carvalho\u2019s death came a week before his retirement tweet and McGregor said the death had affected him.</p> <p>\u201cI had fucking journalists knocking down my mother\u2019s door, you know what I mean?\u201d McGregor said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I signed up to do \u2013 have people knocking on my mother\u2019s door, talking about a kid dying. It\u2019s not nice to see a kid die like that. It does something to you. And there\u2019s been show after show canceled in Ireland since that. It\u2019s fucked up to be a part of it, and I didn\u2019t want to bring it back up and put it more on a public scale.</p> <p>\u201cAfter all that, I did not want to be put in front of a camera and made to dance. I just wasn\u2019t feeling it.\u201d</p> <p>In the ESPN interview McGregor also dismissed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/may/09/floyd-mayweather-conor-mcgregor-fight-boxing-ufc\">rumors of a fight with retired boxing legend Floyd Mayweather</a>, saying the sums involved were beneath him. </p> <p>\u201cI hear [Mayweather] talking. The leak came out, it was him that leaked the rumor and it said he gets $100m and I get $7m \u2013 that\u2019s a pay cut to me. I don\u2019t take pay cuts. I thought boxing was where the money was at. The $7m is absolutely laughable. He\u2019s talking $100m \u2013 I\u2019m also talking $100m,\u201d McGregor said. \u201cI\u2019m 27 years of age and I\u2019m just about halfway through a $100m contract. At 27 years of age, Floyd Mayweather was on Oscar De La Hoya\u2019s undercard.</p> <p>\u201cWho doesn\u2019t want to conquer both worlds? He\u2019s getting old now. He needs me, I don\u2019t need him. Who else can he fight?\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/lygo-lifts-lid-on-itv-masterplan/5104155.article?blocktitle=Most-popular&amp;contentID=-1\">Unveiling his plans</a> for ITV after replacing Peter \u201cPinch \u2018em\u201d Fincham as director of television, ever-quotable Kevin Lygo made headlines by complaining that the BBC was too prone to fill its schedule with long runs of series such Casualty. \u201cYou could argue the BBC need not be quite so focused on that consistent delivery,\u201d he said, \u201cand could try new and interesting things with new and interesting people.\u201d New and interesting people, perhaps, like gifted debut playwright Ruby Solomon, author of BBC1 pilot cop show Walter, which was revealed before transmission in 2014 to have been penned and submitted by Lygo using Ruby as his pen name. Nothing has been heard since of it getting a green light as a series, but no doubt that\u2019s due to all that long-run landfill leaving scant scope for blazing emerging talent.</p> <p>\u2022 Also fascinating was Lygo\u2019s signal that he wanted documentaries about crime (\u201ceveryday hideousness\u201d) but wasn\u2019t content with the network\u2019s current offerings in the genre. \u201cWhat is the modern way of doing that for ITV?\u201d he wondered. \u201cIs it through Trevor McDonald or Piers Morgan?\u201d \u2013 a question that would seem to presuppose the answer \u201cno!\u201d and spell curtains for the pampered pair\u2019s crook-hunting trips to America. Next week, hopefully, he\u2019ll similarly ask aloud: \u201cwhat\u2019s the modern way for us to do a chatshow \u2013 is it through Jonathan Ross?\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 The way online titans assert their supremacy over waning old media can take subtle forms, as evinced by Amazon\u2019s party last week to mark the new availability of its Amazon Prime Music streaming service on Sonos. Guests throwing shapes at Sonos Studios in east London were informed that the floor there had come from the BBC Maida Vale studios across town \u2013 yes, they were literally trampling at Amazon\u2019s invitation on part of the BBC, sacred territory where the Beatles played for the Beeb, hundreds of classical concerts were recorded, and John Peel gave bands such as Nirvana, Pulp and the Smiths early breaks in his Peel Sessions.</p> <p>\u2022 Who knew that Jim Naughtie was ratings gold? As Press Gazette points out, the <a href=\"http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/rajar-radio-laudience-round-radio-4s-today-loses-300000-listeners-following-departure-jim-naughtie\">latest Rajar figures</a> show that the Today programme had an average reach of 6.8 million listeners in post-Naughtie Q1 2016 compared with 7.1 million in Q1 2015 when he was still on board \u2013 a hefty year-on-year drop of 300,000 listeners. Possible takes on the Scot\u2019s pulling power would be that listeners tuned in in the hope of catching his occasional gaffes and trademark multi-clause questions, or that the long-running Jim \u2019n\u2019 John combo offered a comfortable familiarity that\u2019s now gone with ever-shifting pairings, often involving recently arrived presenters; another might be that with Naughtie departed all the breakfast hosts except John Humphrys are English.</p> <p>\u2022 \u201cSuccess has many parents, but failure is an orphan\u201d is the TV industry\u2019s truest saying, and the latest Radio Times\u2019 letters column entertainingly sees the continuation of a paternity dispute going back to the Swinging Sixties. \u201cWithout wishing to rain on my friend Sir David Attenborough\u2019s parade in [BBC1\u2019s] Attenborough At 90,\u201d chunters former BBC1 controller Paul Fox, who is also 90, \u201cMonty Python\u2019s Flying Circus did not begin on BBC2 [of which Attenborough was controller]. It began \u2026 on BBC1. In 1969. I commissioned it.\u201d In a response in italics, the magazine concedes it debuted on BBC1, but says Attenborough was by then director of programmes and so \u201cinvolved in the show\u2019s conception\u201d. Let\u2019s hope both nonagenarians will still be around in three years\u2019 time when the 50th anniversary will give them a chance to properly sort out who the father was.</p> <p>\u2022 Although the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/18/itv-news-in-talks-with-noreena-hertz-over-economics-editor-role\">appointment</a> as economics editor (an \u201cexplainer\u201d job often filled by non-journalists) of the academic Noreena Hertz has come under fire in the rightwing press, having read her book of tips on decision-making Monkey can see nothing but advantages for her new ITV colleagues. They too can now benefit from advice on how to prepare for making big calls and deals previously available to Hertz\u2019s husband Danny Cohen, which at the time of Eyes Wide Open\u2019s publication Monkey noted include: sport noise-reducing headphones; use a meditation app to gauge your feelings; always wear the same clothes and eat the same meals; ensure you\u2019re neither sex- nor sleep-starved; and only take decisions on a full stomach and bladder. The last tip does mean of course that serial decision-makers will have to drink water constantly, while avoiding running to the loo until a decision has been made or the pain of holding themselves in check (without betraying their peak bladder condition to meeting-mates) becomes too much to bear.</p> <p></p> <p>\u2022 In devoting a four-page investigation to the ordeal of four students at Cirencester agricultural college - they were accused of rape but cleared at trial when the Crown\u2019s case collapsed - the Mail on Sunday chiefly had the detective who headed the botched investigation in its sights. But its giant sub-headline seemed to spread the blame more widely (\u201cAccused of gang rape at a top royal college. Publicly shamed. Then exonerated only after shocking police abuses \u2026 \u201d), implicitly condemning those who \u201cpublicly shamed\u201d the innocent students before and during the trial \u2013 as illustrated by a \u201crag-out\u201d from one newspaper (with photos of them arriving at court above a headline saying \u201cfour students \u2026 \u2018raped woman at ball\u2019\u201d) to show \u201chow the case was reported\u201d. But which paper was being publicly shamed, albeit unnamed, for this public shaming? Few MoS readers will have failed to spot the typeface of its sister title, and an archive check confirms that the ragged-out report appeared on 30 March this year in the Daily Mail.</p>",

Commander Simon Bray, the National Police Chiefs\u2019 Council\u2019s lead on NPSs, said: \u201cThere are all sorts of options around problem-solving in a proportionate way, so the ban is not too heavy-handed on the more social end.\u201d</p> <p>On the other hand, he expected overt sales of the drugs \u2013 also known as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/legal-highs\">legal highs</a> \u2013 to end quite literally overnight, with a significant impact on the high street businesses that stock them.</p> <p>Bray said: \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/08/legal-highs-ban-closure-head-shops\">Head shops</a> are not always exclusively NPS, of course. Some are going to be selling other stuff so some may continue trading. But those which have built their business around psychoactive substances will reduce in number or cease to be.\u201d </p> <p>However, with NPSs still flooding into the country, indications are that it may take some time for the current supply to be exhausted. And some retailers are apparently moving towards less visible markets. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/05/blanket-ban-on-legal-highs-england-wales-begin-26-may\">Blanket ban on legal highs in England and Wales to begin on 26 May</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Bray said: \u201cThere have been some fairly large seizures of some psychoactive substances at ports which [is] potentially surprising considering how close it is to the implementation of the act. We always thought there would be some element of stockpiling amongst people who want to use these items and a bit of a fire sale towards the end. </p> <p>\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen an awful lot of that but there has been some and there has been some move from the clearnet on to the dark web. If you look at some of the retailers, you will see some of them have moved into <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/bitcoin\">bitcoin</a> as well as sterling, which suggests they might be heading that way.\u201d</p> <p>The Psychoactive Substances Act, a ban on the trade in any substance that can stimulate or depress a person\u2019s nervous system, is due to come into force on 26 May. Substances including caffeine, nicotine and alcohol are excluded.</p> <p>While possession of psychoactive substances will not be a crime, those convicted of dealing or possession with intent to supply could face a potential seven years in jail. However, Bray said that police had a wide discretion over how they chose to deal with those caught breaking the law. </p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve always got discretion about whether to prosecute or not to prosecute,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that\u2019s one of the reasons right from the outset that the government have included the notices section. </p> <p>\u201cThe notices bit is quite wide \u2013 it doesn\u2019t have a sanction attached to it per se \u2013 but it\u2019s a notice that can say to someone: \u2018You mustn\u2019t do this under these circumstances that we\u2019ve set out for x amount of time.\u2019 And it\u2019s pretty open-ended in most cases.\u201d</p> <p>NPSs first appeared in the UK a decade ago as \u201cresearch chemicals\u201d with similar effects to banned drugs but sufficiently different at a molecular level to dodge the Misuse of Drugs Act. </p> <p>The first big scare emerged around <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/mephedrone\">mephedrone</a>, a chemical that mimicked the euphoric and stimulant effect of ecstasy, which was banned in 2010. But the rapid proliferation of the chemicals reached a point where legislators were unable to keep up, prompting a catch-all ban. </p> <p>Bray said he expected the law to stop some NPS users who experimented with the drugs because they were more freely available than banned equivalents. However, he admitted that many NPS users were already users of controlled drugs who might turn to alternative suppliers once the ban came in. </p> <p>He said: \u201cThis [ban] will get rid of some of the public manifestations of supply: shops, glossy packets, internet supplies. It will also mean that where our intelligence identified other forms of supply \u2013 whereas in the past we\u2019ve been a bit hamstrung \u2013 now we can say actually it\u2019s a problem we\u2019ve got and some legislation that can solve it.\u201d</p> <p>But Steve Rolles, a senior policy analyst with the Transform Drugs Policy Foundation, which campaigns for drug law reform, said the ban would mask the potential harms of continued NPS use. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/30/risks-of-legal-highs-drive-bereaved-mother-to-campaign-for-uk-ban\">Is Irish ban on legal highs driving markets underground?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He said: \u201cThe markets will simply shift to street and unregulated online sales, actually increasing public health risks and crime. Similar bans haven\u2019t worked in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/jun/30/risks-of-legal-highs-drive-bereaved-mother-to-campaign-for-uk-ban\">Ireland</a>, where use has risen to the highest in Europe, and in Poland, where NPS poisonings have increased.

      "headline": "The BBC\u2019s recipe fudge shows its uncertainty about the future",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-23T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Delia\u2019s Steaming Fudge recipe: take one Broadcasting Corporation (British if you can, source locally), place in pressure cooker. Raise political temperature over several years. Open once steam starts shooting from the top. At this point it will look like a horrible mess, but don\u2019t worry, presentation isn\u2019t important. Serve immediately. Turn your phone off.</p> <p>BBC Recipes were being granted their own \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d within the white paper, \u201cA BBC for the Future\u201d. The paper itself sets out the basis for the operation of the BBC over the next decade or more, and a case for continued funding. The controversial plan was to shut one of the two BBC food-oriented websites (a sensible idea to rationalise too many replicative services), and then to allow the recipes to essentially still be available but sink into the \u201cdeep web\u201d of unfindable content, like pennies into Christmas pudding.</p> <p>In briefings the BBC had been clear that this was to lessen the impact of its food service on competitors. After a 100,000-strong petition protesting the decision and some fumbling the BBC revised its decision to make all the recipes just as findable on its remaining website, BBC Good Food, which just for good measure actually carries advertising.</p> <p>When pressed about the change on the BBC\u2019s own The Media Show on Radio 4, BBC News director James Harding responded to the assertion that this would make the BBC \u201cmore competitive with commercial players rather than less\u201d by saying \u201cbut that\u2019s not how we explained it\u201d. Indeed, nothing seemed to be quite how the BBC explained it.</p> <p>The storm in a tea urn over what the BBC does with its recipes is on one level a delightfully British affair, best thought of like a particularly good episode of W1A, the satire about the corporation. On another level though, the recipe imbroglio provides a useful breadcrumb trail right to the heart of what is wrong with the way public service media is viewed in a digital context.</p> <p>First of all, the opportunity of continual publishing via the web raises the issue for the BBC of what to do with the archive. Essentially the BBC will over time become a number of \u201cplayer\u201d services, sitting atop a giant archive, so the intellectual reasoning about what happens to material paid for by the public and wholly owned by the BBC is crucial. Obscuring all, or part, of a public archive because of commercial concerns is an indefensible step. This issue is so problematic for the BBC because on-demand services, open archives and other digital paths to audiences are the antithesis of what it has been \u2013 a broadcaster.</p> <p>We are moving into a post-broadcast world more rapidly than most of us care to comprehend. The fact that the BBC recipe service functions so well, and that so many people are outraged about losing some of it, is rooted in the fact it was built as a robust online service replying to the question \u201cwhat is the right digital manifestation of the BBC?\u201d. This question\u2019s answer is still unclear as the BBC is going to be pulled for some time by the gravitational force of broadcast.</p> <p>Its role in a digital ecosystem leads on to the other persistent canard, that this is about commercial competition. The argument that the BBC\u2019s presence underlies the broken nature of newspapers in the UK is demonstrably wrong. There is no BBC in the US yet the American regional press has suffered as great a decline in fortunes, if not greater, than its counterpart in the UK. Local news has no advertising model on the internet, and most local news groups have been focused so relentlessly on cutting back actual coverage to centralised hubs, that they no longer produce news that their local audiences can or want to pay for.</p> <p>The single most successful commercial vertical on the often digitally lauded BuzzFeed is a food channel, Tasty, which does not seem unduly bothered by the presence of static pages full of cranberry sauce.</p> <p>Oddly the veneration of commercial interests over public interests has resulted in a commercial digital world which has entirely consumed the public sphere. This seems to exercise almost no one in either British politics of broadcasting.</p> <p>BBC executives and politicians all know the commercial competition argument is built on shaky ground; there is plenty of available material which explains the economics of advertising on the web. Even paying lip service to commercial concerns in this climate is a dangerous game.</p> <p>Last week in the US the MacArthur Foundation (disclosure, my work at Columbia also receives support from MacArthur) announced an unprecedented $25m gift to a group of non-profit journalism centers and enterprises, reflecting the deep concern in the US about the lack of a viable model for serious journalism. A decade ago, even this type of low level support would have been thought extraordinary. It is conceivable that many more institutions in journalism and broadcast will not survive the decade, before we have really taken stock of what is at stake.</p> <p>What the BBC should be in a digital realm, and how it should relate to commercial competitors are both critically important issues. But the scope of debate has been confined in the public arena to which services are for the chop. Yes, the BBC\u2019s size as a domestic broadcaster is pretty astonishing. However, alongside the \u201cGafa\u201d world of Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon, it is trivial in scale. The BBC created a mess with recipes because it does not know what it is or, more worryingly, what it will be.</p> <ul> <li><em>This article originally stated that BBC Food will be the corporation\u2019s surviving recipe website. This has been corrected to BBC Good Food.</em><br /></li> </ul>",

      "body": "<p>Sir Philip Green, who <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/25/bhs-pension-regulator-sir-philip-green-analysis\">offloaded BHS for \u00a31 leaving a \u00a3571m deficit in its pension fund</a>, could work with MPs on drafting new laws to ensure pensioners are protected in future, the MP Frank Field has suggested. </p> <p>Field, a co-chair of the parliamentary inquiry into the controversial sale of the stricken retailer, which has left around 13,000 employees facing pension losses, said Green could advise on new legislation regarding occupational schemes. </p> <p>As MPs prepared to question advisers and directors of Green\u2019s businesses involved in the sale, Field said there needed to be a new framework to guard against schemes being left underfunded.</p> <p>\u201cThe question is: what is the duty of these companies to these wonderful, magnificent but beached whales of occupational pension schemes that promised the earth in the days when we had high returns on capital?\u201d</p> <p>Field said MPs wanted Green\u2019s help in shaping a \u201cmega pension bill\u201d. He said: \u201cI mean that quite seriously. He\u2019s an intelligent man. He can be a key player in telling us what is the best deal we can get for many of the thousands of occupational pension schemes remaining \u2013 many of which are in big trouble.\u201d</p> <p>His words appear to represent something of an olive branch after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/05/sir-philip-green-frank-field-work-pensions-committee-chair-step-down\">Field had earlier suggested Green should be stripped of his knighthood</a> unless he contributed sufficiently towards plugging the BHS pension fund deficit. Green and his family <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/bhs-philip-green-family-millions-administration-arcadia\">took a total of \u00a3586m in dividends, rental payments and interest on loans from BHS</a> during the 15 years he owned the high street chain. The pensions regulator is investigating whether Green\u2019s Arcadia group avoided financial obligations to the pension schemes.</p> <p>A spokesman for Green declined to comment.</p> <p>BHS was sold in March 2015 to Retail Acquisitions and went into administration at the end of last month, putting 11,000 high street jobs at risk. On Monday the parliamentary inquiry, conducted jointly between Field\u2019s work and pensions committee and the business, innovation and skills committee, will hold the second of five sessions of evidence, questioning advisers from banks and law firms behind the deal and unpicking how its <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/06/bhs-owner-dominic-chappell-olivia-petroleum\">buyer was considered to be suitable</a>.</p> <p>Field said the inquiry would be trying to understand what advice was provided by the Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs and on what basis: \u201cWe\u2019ve got this strange business where we\u2019ve got Lord Grabiner [a non-executive board member of Goldman Sachs International and chairman of Green\u2019s Taveta Investments vehicle] saying we didn\u2019t charge for our advice. What does that mean? Does that mean that the quality of advice is better with a fee, or is this the Pontius Pilate way out of trouble?\u201d </p> <p>Directors involved in the sale, including the chief executive of Arcadia Group, Ian Grabiner, a second cousin of Lord Grabiner, will be questioned in a separate panel. </p> <p>Lord Grabiner, who had attempted to avoid attending the committee, wrote in a statement that Green and the board had come to the conclusion in early 2015 that BHS should be sold: \u201cThe deterioration in the BHS business was such that the only practical alternative was to place the company into administration.\u201d</p> <p>However, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/25/bhs-owner-retail-acquisitions-25m-administration\">more than \u00a325m was then paid out from the department store to its new owner Retail Acquisitions</a> in its 13-month tenure before BHS collapsed into administration. </p> <p>The inquiry will hear from BHS pension trustees later in the week, before grilling Retail Acquisitions directors early next month. The hearings will culminate with Green facing MPs on 15 June.</p>",

Excuses are hardly needed, since the winner is a known mud-lover who relished the soft conditions and the pair pulled 10 lengths clear of the rest \u2013 but there certainly may have been an excuse because evidence later emerged that Minding had given the starting stalls a hefty clout with her head.</p> <p>The initial response from her trainer, Aidan O\u2019Brien, was: \u201cShe ran a very good race. I wouldn\u2019t like to be making any excuses to anybody.\u201d But when he happened to be in the winner\u2019s enclosure after the following race, he produced his phone and showed reporters pictures of Minding which had been taken in the racecourse stables moments before.</p> <p>These showed what seemed a nasty mark along Minding\u2019s right cheek, extending to perhaps six inches, as well as blood all round her muzzle from a cut between her nostrils. O\u2019Brien said the horse had burst a sinus in the incident.</p> <p>What impact that may have had on her effort in the race is a matter for conjecture. The trainer limited himself to saying: \u201cThe poor thing had a headache anyway.\u201d</p> <p>The question now is whether <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/01/minding-1000-guineas-derby-aidan-obrien-ryan-moore-newmarket-horse-racing\" title=\"\">Minding</a> can recover quickly enough to line up in the Oaks at Epsom a week on Friday, in which context this defeat after a protracted duel on soft ground is very far from being the ideal preparation. Still, O\u2019Brien confirmed the Oaks as the target if the horse is well. Bookmakers pushed her out to 11-8 from 4-6, while her stablemate Ballydoyle, who missed this race with an unsatisfactory blood count, is 5-1 from 8s.</p> <p>While this must count as a disappointing weekend for O\u2019Brien, Adrian Keatley was having a better one. The trainer of Jet Setting is in only his second full season with a licence and moved his string to a stable by this racecourse as recently as February. Up to now he has been known to punters, if at all, for a series of successful raids on low-profile races at Ayr, where he will have another interesting couple of runners on Monday.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a dream, really,\u201d Keatley said. \u201cMiracles happen. She was a cheap purchase and she\u2019s done the business.\u201d He intimated that Jet Setting would not be stepped up in distance for the Oaks. \u201cIf it\u2019s soft ground and a mile, we\u2019ll be there.\u201d</p> <p>Seven months ago, Jet Setting was sold at public auction in Newmarket, fetching just 12,000 guineas after four defeats for Richard Hannon. At least Hannon can console himself with that well-worn line, \u201cIf you never sell any good ones, no one will buy from you.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Brien maintained an affable demeanour and was grace personified as he congratulated the weekend\u2019s winners but he may also have been in need of some cheering-up by the end of the card, having also seen <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/02/aidan-obrien-found-epsom-curragh-coronation-cup-us-army-ranger-chester\" title=\"\">Found</a> beaten by Dermot Weld\u2019s Fascinating Rock in the Tattersalls Gold Cup. It is the first time since 2007 that O\u2019Brien has failed to win any of the three Group Ones staged over these two days.</p> <p>Found would have preferred a better surface, though this result was close to a repeat of Ascot\u2019s Champion Stakes in October, when the same horses finished first and second. O\u2019Brien begged for time to consider plans, while Weld nominated an August race back here as Fascinating Rock\u2019s next run, a prep for the Irish Champion Stakes and a busy autumn campaign.</p> <p>O\u2019Brien\u2019s only Group winner of the day was Beacon Rock, who justified his odds-on status by pulling clear of his rivals in the Gallinule, a Group Three. The chestnut holds a Derby entry but is not thought likely to be ready for that test, his trainer suggesting Ascot\u2019s King Edward VII might be more his thing.</p> <p>Pressed as to Derby plans, O\u2019Brien said his nine that remain entered are \u201call possibles\u201d and that he will start to make decisions over the next week. However, he indicated once more, as he had on Saturday, that The Gurkha is now more likely to be kept at a mile for Ascot\u2019s St James\u2019s Palace Stakes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/09/aidan-obrien-defends-derby-hope-us-army-ranger\">Aidan O\u2019Brien defends his chief Coolmore Derby hope US Army Ranger</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That is a consequence of O\u2019Brien\u2019s employer, Coolmore, needing a top-class miler now that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/21/kevin-prendergast-awtaad-irish-2000-guineas-aidan-obrien-curragh-derby-the-gurkha-horse-racing\" title=\"\">Air Force Blue</a> no longer seems to belong in that bracket. The latter colt, beaten in Saturday\u2019s 2,000 Guineas here, is to be trained as a sprinter, with O\u2019Brien pointing towards Ascot\u2019s Commonwealth Cup as a probable target.</p>",

Not only did he replace the movement\u2019s founder, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/30/mullah-omar\">Mullah Omar</a>, whose myth alone united thousands of militants, even after his death, but Mansoor also embodied a decade-long transformation of the Taliban.</p> <p>Since its inception in 1994, the Taliban had morphed from a movement founded on fanaticism, austerity and piety to a multibillion-dollar criminal organisation. Mansoor\u2019s role was less that of a preacher than a cartel boss. Said to profit personally, and abundantly, from drug trafficking, he bought loyalty with stacks of cash and treated opponents with brute force.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/22/death-of-mullah-akhtar-mansoor-likely-to-enrage-pakistan\">Death of Mullah Akhtar Mansoor likely to enrage Pakistan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Believed to have been born in 1965, Mansoor grew up as part of the Ishaqzai tribe in Kandahar province, which was to become the spiritual home of the Taliban. In the 1980s, he fought the Soviet Union alongside Omar, and was included in the Taliban\u2019s inner circle from the beginning. Still, his rise to the top was anything but swift. Biographical details are scarce but depict a hard-working bureaucrat for whom survival and power were stronger guiding forces than lofty ideology. This led some to label him a moderate, though \u201cpragmatist\u201d might be more accurate.</p> <p>During the Taliban rule of the 90s, Mansoor was chief of aviation and had the almost oxymoronic task, in a largely sealed-off regime, of being in charge of tourism. After the US-led intervention of 2001, he and other Taliban commanders tried to surrender on condition of amnesty, but were rebutted. Instead, Mansoor fled into exile where he worked his way up the ranks, seemingly aided by connections in the Pakistani intelligence agency, ISI.</p> <p>In reality, Mansoor ran the Taliban for years before he became globally known as its official figurehead. Omar had been dead for two years before his demise was confirmed in 2015. Mansoor, as second in command, had helped cover up the leader\u2019s fate, including by sending out written decrees in his name. This ruse inevitably aroused suspicion. Omar rarely showed himself in public, and rumours of his death swirled for a long time. So when the truth came out, years of pent-up bitterness boiled over.</p> <p>It did not help Mansoor that he never had the same spiritual authority as Omar. He attained his predecessor\u2019s title as Commander of the Faithful for hierarchical purposes, not because of stature. Many high-level leaders simply <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/16/taliban-declare-end-to-leadership-rift\">refused to follow him</a>. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/03/taliban-leader-mullah-mansoor-wounded-gunfight-pakistan-renegade-commander\">Some even took up arms</a>, forcing Mansoor to spend some of his strength fighting not just the Kabul government but also internal challengers.</p> <p>In the months leading up to Mansoor\u2019s takeover, some life was breathed into the dormant peace process, but it soon collapsed after the leadership change. As the glue that held the Taliban together was dissolving, Mansoor\u2019s main aim became preserving unity. Gambling what little political capital he had left on reconciliation was not on the cards.</p> <p>In his first audio message last year, Mansoor said: \u201cWe should not concentrate on peace talks or anything related to that.\u201d Instead he chose war. Initially, that seemed to pay off. While Mansoor may have triggered the Taliban\u2019s worst internal crisis, he also led it to its greatest military victory of the war, when it <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/28/taliban-attempt-to-invade-key-afghan-city-kunduz\">briefly captured the northern city of Kunduz</a> in September 2015.</p> <p>However, while war helped Mansoor unite the Taliban, it seems to have led ultimately to his undoing. On Sunday, the Pentagon said they had targeted Mansoor because he was \u201can obstacle to peace and reconciliation\u201d.</p> <p>\u2022 Akhtar Mansoor, mullah and Taliban leader, born c1965; died 21 May 2016</p>",

      "body": "<p>A series of terrorist attacks, geopolitical unrest and an unabating migration crisis have dealt a severe blow to the tourist economies of north Africa and the near east, figures suggest. </p> <p>Office for National Statistics (ONS) data released on Friday show that the numbers of British nationals travelling to past holiday hot spots such as Egypt, Tunisia and Turkey are in sharp decline. </p> <p>That picture is backed up by figures from the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC), which show those countries\u2019 tourism economies collapsing amid a sense that they have become no-go areas for foreign tourists. </p> <p>The as yet unexplained <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/22/egyptair-crash-search-teams-hunt-flight-ms804-black-box-recorder\">crash of a Cairo-bound EgyptAir passenger jet</a> on Thursday with 66 people on board, months after the downing of a Russian jet in Sinai was claimed by Islamic State, is likely to cement that impression.</p> <p>Amanda Diboll from Leicestershire has previously holidayed in Egypt, Tunisia and Turkey. But she told the Guardian: \u201cObviously in all these areas there have been a number of major incidents that have made us feel that the risk has become too great for a return visit.\u201d</p> <p>Since Egypt\u2019s 2011 revolution, subsequent counter-revolution and the emergence of its own incipient Islamic State franchise, travel by UK nationals to the country has plummeted by nearly 50%, the ONS figures show.</p> <p>Tourists spent 4% less in Egypt last year compared with the year before, according to the WTTC, which forecasts a further 4% fall in 2016. Curiously, the ONS figures show a 2% rise in British nationals travelling to the country in 2015, but that came from a historic low in 2014.</p> <p>Sean Tipton, a spokesman for the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta), said a fall in bookings with Abta members to Egypt could partly be explained by continuing doubts over the safety of Sharm el-Sheikh airport, the departure point for the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/31/russian-plane-crashes-in-sinai-egyptian-pm-says\">Russian airliner that crashed over Sinai last October</a>, and the gateway to the country\u2019s most popular tourist area. A Department for Transport edict still bans travel there from UK airports, Tipton said.</p> <p>While Egypt has suffered, the most dramatic impact of terrorism on tourism has been in Tunisia. The country where the Arab spring began in 2010 had seemed to have gained the most from revolution, with a quick transition from dictatorship to liberal democracy. By 2014 the country\u2019s tourist economy was booming again, with 417,000 visits to the country by British nationals. </p> <p>Then Seiffeddine Rezgui walked on to a beach last June and gunned down 38 people, mostly tourists enjoying the blazing Mediterranean sun. The attack, coming three months after the massacre of 22 people \u2013 again mainly foreigners \u2013 in a Tunis museum, prompted the British Foreign Office and many of its equivalents across Europe to advise against all but essential travel to the country.</p> <p>That warning remains in place and is part of the reason for the collapse of Tunisia\u2019s tourism industry. Visits by British nationals fell by nearly 40% in 2015 and, according to the WTTC, overall foreign spending in Tunisia fell by 37%.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2016-05-20T14:06:39/embed.html\" data-alt=\"Travel figures\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/charts/embed/may/2016-05-20T14:06:39/embed.html\">Travel figures</a> </figure>  <p>The picture in Turkey, long a European package tour favourite, is more nuanced. On the eastern frontier of Europe, with a bitter civil war playing out over its border with Syria, visits by British nationals fell 21% between 2011 and 2013. But since then, numbers have been on the rise. </p> <p>Now, with an increasingly visible role in the refugee crisis, strident international criticism of the government of Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, and a growing conflict with Turkey\u2019s Kurdish minority, the jitters are setting in again. Tipton said bookings for Turkish holidays were down a third, while the WTTC predicts a fall in tourist revenue of 2% in 2016.</p> <p>Amid an overall rise in holiday bookings in the past year, these countries\u2019 losses have been western Europe\u2019s gain. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a marked shift [in package holiday bookings] towards the western Mediterranean,\u201d said Tipton. \u201cThat\u2019s been the case since December really, that\u2019s what the booking patterns have shown.\u201d</p> <p>Portugal has seen the greatest benefit, according to Abta data, with an increase of almost a third in the number of package holiday bookings to the country, while its neighbour Spain has seen rises of more than a quarter. With sunseekers swarming to the costas, Tipton advised booking early before resorts fill up.</p> <p>The ONS data, which gives a wider picture of holiday habits but is less up to date, also reflects changing tastes \u2013 with a few surprises. It shows big gains between 2011 and 2015 for, among others, Barbados, Mexico and Morocco, as well as old favourites such as Italy, Portugal and Spain.</p> <p>Andrew Russell from Wimbledon, London said he would be happy to take his partner and their teenage children to Turkey, \u201cas the tourist destinations are nowhere near the trouble zones and I believe the terrorist threat is low\u201d.</p> <p>While mindful of the security situation in north Africa, he saw the fears over some other destinations as an opportunity for a less crowded break. \u201cApparently Spain is booming as the safe summer option, but I believe it would be a good time to go to Greece [or the] Greek islands,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t believe they are no-go areas due to the refugee crisis. It should also be easier to get decent accommodation with less competition for places.\u201d</p>",

Pemba Sherpa, of the Seven Summit Treks agency in Kathmandu, also said one Indian climber had been unable to move due to advanced frostbite and had been carried to a lower camp, where attempts were being made to rescue her by helicopter. </p> <p>A Norwegian climber has been rescued by sherpas after suffering snow blindness, a painful loss of vision after overexposure to UV rays.</p> <p>The deaths of the two climbers, the motivational speaker Eric Arnold, 36, and finance lecturer Dr Maria Strydom, 34 \u2013 whose husband was also injured on the climb down, came as the tourism industry on Everest began to show signs of recovery after two years of devastating natural disasters. </p> <p>Eighteen people were killed last year when a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/28/everest-climbers-stranded-above-base-camp-after-avalanches-rescued\">7.8-magnitude earthquake struck Nepal and triggered an avalanche</a> that left the Everest Base Camp in ruins. The toll from the quake surpassed 2014, which had previously been the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/apr/22/nepal-everest-talks-sherpa-strike-avalanche\">deadliest year on record</a> after icefall killed 16 Nepalese guides and cut the climbing season short.</p> <p>This year\u2019s climbing season, which runs from March until the end of May, has so far seen good weather, allowing hundreds of climbers to reach the summit. </p> <p>Arnold had tweeted earlier that he had made it to the summit, but he is said to have complained of feeling weak as he descended, despite having bottled oxygen, and he died on Friday night. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/EricArnold8850/status/733654737464098816\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"nl\" dir=\"ltr\">Bergbeklimmer Eric Arnold bereikt top Mount Everest bij vijfde\u00a0poging <a href=\"https://t.co/oeswLrfXyd\">https://t.co/oeswLrfXyd</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/991NvMg6Op\">pic.twitter.com/991NvMg6Op</a></p>&mdash; Eric Arnold (@EricArnold8850) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EricArnold8850/status/733654737464098816\">May 20, 2016</a></blockquote>  </figure>  <p>Arnold had survived <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/climbers-trapped-on-mount-everest-are-getting-desperate/2015/04/26/68ec0765-9303-4aec-b7ec-f031cdae42fc_story.html\">the avalanche at base camp</a> last year, which left <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/27/climbers-at-everest-base-camp-face-race-against-time-after-nepal-earthquake\">many people trapped for days</a>.<br /></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/a-year-after-nepals-devastating-earthquake-everest-climbers-return/2016/04/15/a58e5f3f-ff65-4906-9c91-e7a7d4df621e_story.html?tid=a_inl\">Speaking to the Washington Post</a> before his attempt, Arnold said climbing Everest was his \u201cbig childhood dream\u201d. He said he had been traumatised by the avalanche but wanted to return. \u201cI didn\u2019t decide immediately to go back. I waited until my emotions were more stable.\u201d</p> <p>Strydom, who is also reported to have suffered altitude sickness, died less than 24 hours later. Her husband Rob Gropel is also said to have been injured on the trek, needing assistance back down the mountain. </p> <p>The couple were attempting to reach seven summits, and had already reached the peaks of Denali in Alaska, Aconcagua in Argentina, Ararat in Turkey and Kilimanjaro in Tanzania.</p> <p>Strydom\u2019s sister Aletta Newman said she had heard the news from a Google alert with a story from the Himalayan Times.</p> <p>\u201cThat is the absolute first I\u2019d heard of it,\u201d Newman told the Australian Associated Press. She said she did not yet know the exact cause of Strydom\u2019s death. \u201cWe just don\u2019t have answers and we would really like to have some.\u201d</p> <p>The bodies, which are at 8,000 metres (26,240 feet), had yet to be retrieved on Sunday. \u201cWe are waiting for the expedition leader and other climbers of the group to come down to base camp,\u201d said Pasang Phurba of Seven Summit Treks.</p> <p>\u201cWe will then discuss her body. It cannot be left to lie as it is there,\u201d he told Reuters.</p> <p>Among the 350 climbers who have reached the summit this year are 19-year-old Alyssa Azar, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/22/australian-woman-and-dutch-man-die-on-everest-as-queensland-teen-reaches-summit\">who became the youngest Australian to reach the peak</a>, and Lhakpa Sherpa, who <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/20/mount-everest-nepalese-woman-lhakpa-sherpa-breaks-record-summit-seventh-time\">set a record for female climbers</a> with her seventh ascent. </p>",

      "body": "<p>Ben Stokes looks likely to be ruled out of the second Test with Sri Lanka at Chester-le-Street, with the result of his knee scan and a revised England squad, which includes Chris Woakes, both due to be published on Monday morning.</p> <p>Stokes, who would miss the last Test to be played on his home ground for four years, reported a locked left knee during the innings and 88-run victory at Headingley and was due in hospital for tests on Sunday night.</p> <p>The 24-year-old all-rounder\u2019s injury is most commonly associated with torn cartilage, which may result in an operation and up to six weeks\u2019 recovery time. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/may/21/england-v-sri-lanka-first-test-day-three-live\" title=\"\">While his England team-mates were celebrating their victory</a> on Saturday night, Stokes was laid up with his leg in a cold compression pack and was still struggling to walk on Sunday morning.</p> <p>Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live on Sunday, before the scan, the England director of cricket, Andrew Strauss, described Stokes as \u201ctouch and go\u201d for Friday\u2019s second Test. However the team management are privately pessimistic about his chances of being fit and are unlikely to take any chances.</p> <p>Strauss said: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/14/ben-stokes-cricket-world-cup-test-series-simon-hattenstone\" title=\"\">\u201cWe know what Ben is like</a> \u2013 you have to drag him off the pitch kicking and screaming. But we\u2019re mindful of a busy summer ahead as well so we will have a look, see how he pulls up, and make a decision after that.\u201d</p> <p>Stokes initially suffered the problem on the second day at Headingley and while the fact he returned from lengthy on-field treatment to bowl four more overs offered some encouragement, a spell at slip on the third morning was aborted early and no further part was taken in the match.</p> <p>Woakes, a Warwickshire all-rounder, will be called up as cover, meaning he will pull out of his county\u2019s continuing game at home to Durham after Monday and vie with Nottinghamshire\u2019s Jake Ball, the unused member from the 12-man squad for Headingley, for a place.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/08/chris-woakes-relishing-return-england-hong-kong\">Chris Woakes relishing his return to England colours after injury</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Woakes is the better batsman, with nine first-class centuries and an average of 61 this season, and Ball a genuine tailender, but either option would likely see Jonny Bairstow and Moeen Ali move up the batting order from their current positions below Stokes, who bats at No6.</p> <p>Moeen, who was out for an eight-ball duck in Leeds, would welcome any sort of promotion with England\u2019s assistant coach, Paul Farbrace, admitting the left-hander is struggling with something of an identity crisis at No8 given his top-order status at his county, Worcestershire.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThe difficult thing for Mo when you bat at No8 is it is very easy to bat like a bowler rather than a quality batsman. It\u2019s tough on him but the thing for him is to keep reminding himself he is a top-quality batter and keep thinking like one. He gets a bit frustrated at times.\u201d</p> <p>Farbrace also spoke glowingly of the performance of Alex Hales following the three-day victory over Sri Lanka, with the opener\u2019s 86 spanning 72.3 overs at the crease, two balls more than the tourists lasted in their two innings combined.</p> <p>He said: \u201cThis innings will convince him he can play Test cricket. It\u2019s a shame he did not get a hundred but in the situation, 86 on that surface was a fantastic innings. It showed a real sense of responsibility and showed he knew where his off stump was.\u201d</p> <p>While Hales dug in for his best Test score, Jonny Bairstow transcended the seaming conditions for his 140 and having held nine catches behind the stumps, was rightly named man of the match.</p> <p>The 26-year-old has worked hard on his wicketkeeping since the tour of South Africa, including a recent session with the Newcastle United goalkeeping coach, Simon Smith, to improve his balance and body shape.</p> <p>Along with praising Bairstow, Farbrace offered words of encouragement for Nick Compton, who suffered a third-ball duck in England\u2019s solitary innings, saying: \u201cWe felt in South Africa he showed enough to suggest he can score runs in international cricket. \u201cHe did not necessarily cement his position through weight of runs but equally he did not have a tour that left you saying you could not pick him for the next Test.</p> <p>\u201cNick knows his job is to score runs but he is extremely committed to working hard at his game. I would say his state of mind has been very good and if he gets a score in Durham he will be up and running.</p> <p>\u201cWe showed him faith by picking him. We were very clear in South Africa we are not bothered about him scoring runs. He is not a difficult bloke. He is an easy bloke to work with and he is passionate about scoring runs and he has everything you need from a top quality batter.\u201d</p>",

The recorders emit a constant signal pointing to their location, but this only continues for four to five weeks in the water before their power runs out.<br /></p> <p>Egypt\u2019s president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, making his first public comments since the plane crashed on Thursday while flying from Paris to Cairo, said it would take time to determine the cause. \u201cAll the theories are possible,\u201d he said in a televised address. \u201cThere is no particular theory we can affirm right now.\u201d</p> <p>He said the Egyptian submarine could operate at a depth of 3,000 metres. </p> <p>A French patrol vessel carrying specialist equipment for sea searches and retrieval has left the French port of Toulon to assist in the search.</p> <p>Smoke was detected on board the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/egyptair-flight-ms804\">EgyptAir flight MS804</a> minutes before it crashed, French investigators have confirmed. Signs of smoke were picked up in a lavatory and in the aircraft\u2019s electronics, according to data from the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (Acars), which routinely transmits data to airlines about the condition of their planes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/19/qa-key-questions-about-egyptair-ms-804\">Q&amp;A: key questions about EgyptAir flight MS804</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Experts have said that until the flight recorders are found, it is too early to speculate on the smoke on board or whether it indicated a bomb. It is unclear whether the plane\u2019s sudden drop in altitude was controlled or not, or whether there had been technical malfunctions and what might have caused them. </p> <p>Greece\u2019s lead air accident investigator, Athanasios Binis, said that in addition to the submarine, ships equipped with scanners were scouring the seabed. While searchers were now focused on a 900-sq-mile area, approximately 180 miles north of Alexandria, they would \u201cenlarge it, if necessary, as the operation progressed\u201d. He said a little more wreckage had been found since Egyptian military released pictures on Friday of the first debris, including lifejackets, parts of the plane\u2019s chairs and other wreckage. But he told the Guardian that progress had been \u201climited\u201d. </p> <p>He said the cockpit flight recorder and flight data recorder had underwater locator beacons that could effectively emit signals in water at a depth of 6,000 metres and for often longer than 30 days. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/debris-confirmed/giv-12515yhRDxbG9LwgM/\" data-alt=\"map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/debris-confirmed/giv-12515yhRDxbG9LwgM/\">map</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cIn that sense we are lucky,\u201d Binis said. \u201cWe are only in day four of the search but in operations like this you need luck. The waters there are deep but we know from experience signals will be emitted in deep waters. In 1978, the recorders of South Africa airlines flight 295 were found at a depth of 4,900 metres off the island of Mauritius.\u201d </p> <p>Strong winds over the Mediterranean could hamper investigations but wreckage was not expected to be dispersed beyond the area where the search was now focused. </p> <p>The passengers included 30 Egyptians, 15 French citizens, two Iraqis, two Canadians, the Briton <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/19/sole-briton-on-flight-ms804-had-just-become-father-for-second-time\">Richard Osman</a>, and citizens from Algeria, Belgium, Chad, Portugal, Saudi Arabia and Sudan.

I don\u2019t agree with that.\u201d </p> <p>A hall full of NRA members gave the clip a smattering of applause. To laughter, Chris Cox, head of the NRA\u2019s Institute for Legislative Action, said: \u201cI don\u2019t say this often \u2026 OK, fine, I\u2019ve never said it. But Bernie\u2019s right. </p> <p>\u201cHolding gun manufacturers liable for the acts of madmen and terrorists will put them out of business overnight.\u201d</p> <p>Cox said Clinton\u2019s support of lawsuits against gun companies was a \u201cbackdoor\u201d attempt to ban guns by \u201csuing gun manufacturers into bankruptcy\u201d.</p> <p>Earlier this year, Sanders suggested that a lawsuit against the companies that sold a gun used in the 2012 Newtown school shooting was \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nydailynews.com/opinion/transcript-bernie-sanders-meets-news-editorial-board-article-1.2588306\">a backdoor way</a>\u201d to ban assault weapons. </p> <p>Family members of the 20 children and six adults who died at Sandy Hook elementary school are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/20/newtown-sandy-hook-shooting-lawsuit-gun-control-election\">suing the manufacturer, distributor and dealer</a> of the military-style Bushmaster rifle that was used. Lawyers for the families argue the companies were negligent in selling a dangerous weapon to the general public, and that macho advertising may be designed to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/20/newtown-sandy-hook-shooting-lawsuit-gun-control-election\">target insecure, powerless young men</a>. </p> <p>The gun companies in the suit say that they are protected by the 2005 federal shield law that Sanders supported, and that the Sandy Hook tragedy had nothing to do with the type of weapon used, which was legally purchased by the gunman\u2019s mother. </p> <p>The Clinton campaign has <a href=\"https://www.hillaryclinton.com/feed/how-congress-gave-gun-industry-immunity-lawsuits/\">highlighted the case</a>, and she has won endorsement from some family members of victims from Sandy Hook victims and other mass shootings. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"934f7eda52f709e3a7de37b05ba9c2165e36aff3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/934f7eda52f709e3a7de37b05ba9c2165e36aff3/0_39_3249_1949/1000.jpg\" alt=\"chris cox nra\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Chris Cox: \u2018Bernie\u2019s right.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Humphrey/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The Sandy Hook families have won a series of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/05/sandy-hook-victims-families-gun-manufacturer-records\">small technical victories</a> in recent months, with a Connecticut judge ruling in early May that gun companies should begin the discovery process. Whether the case can move forward despite the federal shield law will be decided in October. </p> <p>Sanders backed off from his support of the 2005 shield law earlier this year, with his campaign saying he would now support a repeal. But as Clinton and some family members of Sandy Hook victims have criticized his stance on the gun industry, he has repeated his support for the central tenet of the law: that gun companies should not be held responsible if they sell a gun lawfully and it is later used in a crime. </p> <p>Cox told NRA members that Clinton\u2019s support for lawsuits against gun companies had nothing to do with safety \u201cand everything to do with banning your guns\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWhen a criminal knocks out a convenience store clerk with a baseball bat, you don\u2019t sue Louisville Slugger,\u201d he said. </p> <p>\u201cWhen a terrorist shoots dozens of people in San Bernardino, or a deranged monster slaughters school children, well \u2013 according to Hillary, that\u2019s the gun manufacturer\u2019s fault and they ought to be sued for it. This has absolutely nothing to do with keeping anyone safer, anywhere, and everything to do with banning your guns. <br /></p> <p>\u201cThey want to create an illusion that they\u2019re keeping us safe.\u201d</p> <p>The Obama administration should simply \u201ctake every felon with a gun, drug dealer with a gun and criminal gang member with a gun off the streets right this minute and lock them up for five years or more\u201d, Cox said. </p> <p>Instead, he said, Obama \u201csits back and does nothing so he can exploit the carnage\u201d. </p> <p>After the March debate, in a tweet that Clinton supporters shared gleefully, the NRA <a href=\"http://thehill.com/regulation/272029-nra-tweets-support-for-bernie-sanders\">expressed its support</a> for Sanders\u2019 claim that lawsuits would bankrupt the gun industry. </p> <p>In response to criticism, Sanders\u2019 campaign has repeatedly touted the candidate\u2019s \u201cwell-deserved D-minus rating from the NRA\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/20/nra-endorses-donald-trump-convention\">Donald Trump endorsed by NRA despite history of gun control support</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On Friday, as he accepted the NRA\u2019s endorsement, Trump encouraged Sanders to run as an independent if he lost the Democratic nomination to Clinton. </p> <p>\u201cI think Bernie should run as an independent,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI want him to run as an independent. Then it would be the three of us on stage. I would love that.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cBernie Sanders is a good man,\u201d Arnald Harrison, 51, an NRA member from Schererville, Indiana, said on Sunday. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad that he\u2019s a liberal.\u201d </p> <p>In a speech to members on Saturday, the NRA\u2019s executive vice-president echoed a different strain of Sanders\u2019 criticisms of Clinton \u2013 her \u201csix-figure speeches\u201d to Goldman Sachs. </p> <p>Wayne LaPierre said: \u201cWhen the political elites paved our way for Wall Street get-rich schemes and crashed our economy and there\u2019s nowhere for you to work [and] there\u2019s no money for police and the schools in our country are a disaster, they tell you: you\u2019re on your own.\u201d</p> <ul> <li><em>The NRA refused to issue Guardian US with accreditation for its annual convention.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-23T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>In a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/30/pollution-food-poisoning-health-safety-deaths-thinktank\">highly critical report last month</a>, the British government came under fire for what the <a href=\"http://www.crimeandjustice.org.uk/\">Centre for Crime and Justice Studies</a> said was a failure to tackle the problem of food poisoning, which results in 20,000 people being hospitalised and 500 deaths every year.</p> <p>The thinktank blamed the worsening situation on a substantial fall in the number of food standards and environmental inspections between 2004 and 2013. The lack of inspections resulted in a cut in prosecutions, the thinktank said, and allowed sloppy procedures in the food industry to go unchecked.</p> <p> Now scientists in South Korea have developed a laser that can spot the presence of bacteria on the surface of food. The device could be used as an early warning system for consumers in the home and in restaurants, takeaways and grocery shops.</p> <p>The researchers from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) envisage that their laser could eventually be used in a dongle attached to a mobile phone so that when people are shopping, they will be able to scan a piece of meat to see if harmful bacteria are present.</p> <p>Prof Paul Park, the principle investigator on the project, said the unit could also be installed as part of a \u201csmart\u201d fridge that would notify users when their food was dangerous to eat, or on the production line in a factory when meat was being processed.</p> <p>The laser works by recognising the movement of bacteria across the surface of food.</p> <p>It is cheap and can, in theory at least, be retrofitted to equipment. Since the laser can read through packaging and works on cooked and uncooked food, its use could be relatively widespread. </p> <p>When the red laser beam hits the food, the reaction of the light to the surface \u2013 the scatter pattern \u2013 can be read. If bacteria are present, this affects the reaction of the light and produces a different scatter pattern as they move around. A camera that takes images at a rate of 30 times a second is used to spot the differences.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"363e012bcb25cb30c6d0f5159141ef3080ce946e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/363e012bcb25cb30c6d0f5159141ef3080ce946e/0_0_1947_2200/885.jpg\" alt=\"E coli bacteria\" width=\"885\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">E coli bacteria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This means the laser can recognise when harmful bacteria are present, and warn the user of the phone, fridge or any other device in which it is housed.</p> <p>\u201cYou can install this technique into your refrigerator because it can use very tiny laser diodes and image sensors which can be found in your smartphone, and those are the only two important parts that you have to consider putting in,\u201d said Park, who specialises in diagnosing disease using lasers.</p> <p>So far, the technology has been able to detect the presence of <em>Bacillus cereus</em> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/e-coli\"><em>E coli</em></a>. <em>Bacillus cereus</em> is a bacteria which causes food poisoning resulting in diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting. Feed infected with <em>Bacillus cereus</em> <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/sep/12/contaminated-feed-police-investigate-deaths-three-babies-ith-pharma\">caused the death of three babies</a> in 2014. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/02/e-coli-outbreak-chipotle-closes-stores-pacific-northwest\">Last November</a>, the Chipotle chain temporarily shut 43 of its locations in the United States after an <em>E coli</em> outbreak.</p> <p>The tests carried out by the Korean scientists started on chicken breasts, which were infected and then examined using the laser and camera apparatus. While the laser can detect the presence of both of the types of bacteria, it cannot distinguish between them in the early tests.</p> <p>Because the equipment involved is relatively simple, it leaves a wide scope for how it can be used, Park said. This could extend from an attachable dongle for a smartphone, which could be pointed at food by a shopper in a supermarket, to one on a production line that scans food as it goes past.</p> <p>\u201cWe can simply implement this technology into [the] smartphone. You only need the small laser diodes which means that when you go to the restaurant and you order the food and you are not sure this is safe, you can just tap. You can go to the grocery market and see the chickens and other food and you can [test] by yourself.\u201d</p> <p>Park and his colleagues now aim to commercialise the technology and have suggested that it could be part of a \u201csmart\u201d fridge within the next two years. A prototype device is currently being developed, which will then be put through trials. \u201cI hope that within two years, we will see the smart refrigerator with this feature,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u2022 You can read our archive of The innovators columns <a href=\"http://www.biginnovationcentre.com/the-innovators-column\">on the Big Innovation Centre website</a> where you will find more information on how the Big Innovation Centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally.</p> <p></p> <p><br /></p>",

The singer touched her hand to her ear before eventually joining in after the crowds, footballers and Prince William had already been singing for around 30 seconds.<br /></p> <p>Immediately following the performance, she blamed the delay on technical difficulties. She tweeted: \u201cOh My God. Biggest audience of my life and I get technical difficulties! Argh so sorry Guys!!!\u201d She later added: \u201cMortified!! I don\u2019t know what happened.\u201d<br /></p> <p>With millions more people watching around the world, fans and commentators on social media were unforgiving. Oscar Quaye tweeted: \u201cShe had ONE job and flopped ... how embarrassing\u201d, while Piers Morgan quipped: \u201cDid Louis van Gaal advise that female singer for the anthem? \u2018Do nothing for the first half\u2026\u2019\u201d<br /></p> <p>Others were slightly kinder, with fan Natasha Henry tweeting: \u201cPoor girl.\u201d Meanwhile, BBC presenter Gary Lineker, who was hosting the television coverage, merely said: \u201cWell that all went according to plan\u201d.<br /></p> <p>Prior to her performance at Wembley as Manchester United beat Crystal Palace 2-1 to win the famous trophy, the singer described the event as a \u201conce-in-a-lifetime chance\u201d, and added nervously: \u201cThe main thing is not being able to hear myself ... there\u2019s going to be so many people singing it back.\u201d<br /></p> <p>After the mishap, BBC commentator Guy Mowbray defended Harding, saying: \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of noise around the place, it\u2019s easy to miss your cue.\u201d </p> <p>Harding, a former Eurovision contestant, had followed the performance of rapper Tinie Tempah. Tempah\u2019s performance was also criticised. Fans mocked his outfit and viewers were also unhappy that he seemed to be checking his phone while walking towards the stage. The pre-match entertainment was also likened to the Super Bowl \u2013 the American Football end-of-season spectacle.</p> <p>Another commentator on the final, Alan Green, said on BBC Radio 5 Live: \u201cWhoever was responsible for the [pre-match show], an utter shambles, should go away now and lock themselves in a darkened room.\u201d</p> <p>In 2010, Harding competed to represent the UK in the Eurovision Song contest, with Your Country Needs You, but was beaten by <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2015/oct/01/the-public-is-going-to-choose-britains-eurovision-entry-what-could-possibly-go-wrong\">Josh Dubovie with his song That Sounds Good to Me</a>. She went on to appear on The X Factor in 2013, but was replaced during the show\u2019s six-chairs challenge stage by mentor Nicole Scherzinger, with Melanie McCabe taking her seat.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>In January 2015 she released her own single, Say Something, which went to No 7 in the UK\u2019s singles chart.</p>",

      "body": "<p>From the fifth-floor putting green of <a href=\"http://www.nbbj.com/work/samsung-america-headquarters/\">Samsung\u2019s Silicon Valley headquarters</a>, looking out at a rolling horizon of sun-scorched mountains, it\u2019s quite easy to forget you\u2019re at work. An executive is practising tai chi by the cactus garden, while another jiggles in a robotic massage chair nearby. A volleyball match is in full swing in the lush-planted courtyard below, while raucous shrieks of table football emerge from the Chill Zone, next to a row of space-age nap pods. \u201cMeet by the ping-pong tables,\u201d reads a sign stuck on the window. \u201cToday\u2019s spinning class will be on the terrace! :)\u201d</p> <p>With its new $300m office block, which stands like a stack of gleaming white hard drives at an intersection north of San Jose, the South Korean electronics giant is plunging headlong into the holiday camp workplace culture of the Bay Area tech scene.</p> <p>\u201cWe wanted to introduce more of a startup vibe to the company,\u201d says Jim Elliott, Samsung\u2019s vice-president of memory marketing, a job title as otherworldly as the building he works in. \u201cWe were all separated in our different departmental islands before, but this building is about bringing people together and encouraging chance encounters. We want to get people out of the boardroom.\u201d</p> <p>Samsung has had a base here for 30 years, housed in a cluster of nondescript sheds, but this 10-storey beacon is designed to shift its brand image in North America from purveyor of fridges and washing machines to powerhouse of cutting-edge semiconductor innovation.<br /></p> <p>Designed by <a href=\"http://www.nbbj.com/\">NBBJ</a>, an architecture firm that is conjuring futuristic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2013/dec/20/amazon-futuristic-greenhouse-headquarters-seattle\">jungle-filled biospheres for Amazon</a> in Seattle and a handful of <a href=\"http://www.nbbj.com/work/tencent/\">vast tech offices across China</a>, the building is the product of research into behavioural psychology and the neuroscience of work.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9c99e8fe3bc6226fcd43ab04ce15c896d9379632\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c99e8fe3bc6226fcd43ab04ce15c896d9379632/0_100_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Techie jungle \u2026 lianas of cables and stuffed leopards adorn the Facebook HQ.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Techie jungle \u2026 liana-like cables and stuffed leopards at Facebook\u2019s HQ, the biggest continuous office floor in the world.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oliver Wainwright for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s all about mobility,\u201d says architect Scott Wyatt, who heads NBBJ\u2019s corporate workplace division. \u201cIf you sit down for more than 20 minutes, you get dumber.\u201d Walking outdoors, he says, is when your brain achieves optimum cognitive function, so the Samsung office is configured to get people out of their chairs as much as possible. With pairs of floors separated by an outdoor terrace, employees are never more than a floor away from stepping outside. The cafeteria, meanwhile, is housed in a separate star-shaped building, so they have to walk out to lunch \u2013 where 10 kinds of global cuisine are on offer in a food court worthy of an upscale mall.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you sit down for more than 20 minutes, you get dumber</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Samsung\u2019s fun-filled office-cum-wellness-centre is just the latest in a wave of new flagship headquarters in the San Francisco Bay Area that mark a radical departure for the tech industry, which has never much cared for its surroundings before now. Norman Foster is busy erecting a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/nov/15/norman-foster-apple-hq-mothership-spaceship-architecture\">doughnut-shaped flying saucer for Apple</a>, set in a 150-acre park in Cupertino, where 3.7 miles of curved glass will soon encase a continuous tube of offices, built to the precision of an iPhone. Not to be outdone, Google has hired two of the most fashionable designers of the moment, Bjarke Ingels and Thomas Heatherwick, to concoct a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/feb/27/googles-new-headquarters-upgradable-futuristic-greenhouse\">retro-futuristic fantasyland of plug-in work pods beneath swooping glass tents</a>. Such dreamy visions mark a recent and radical shift from the tech world\u2019s default setting of the generic suburban business park.</p> <p>\u201cMicrosoft always said the buildings don\u2019t matter,\u201d says Wyatt, who has worked on countless projects for the Bill Gates empire. \u201cThe tech attitude was: \u2018Just give me a garage.\u2019\u201d All that has changed. With increasing competition to attract the best young minds, the silicon giants are now racing to outdo each other with ever more elaborate facilities (filled with ever more bountiful snacks).</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2015/apr/08/facebook-hq-mark-zuckerberg-frank-gehry-new\">The mother of all pimped-up garages</a> now rambles along the highway in Menlo Park, 15 miles west of Samsung\u2019s HQ, standing like a line of conjoined aircraft hangars piled up in a car crash. With walls jutting out at odd angles and zig-zagging staircases casually bolted on as if at random, it bears the unmistakable hand of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/frank-gehry\">Frank Gehry</a>. Stretching across 40,000 square metres, his Facebook headquarters is a hymn to the beloved startup foundation myth of the loose-fit inventor\u2019s shed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b124c50007ac1931deeabc4500777ffa09b746c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b124c50007ac1931deeabc4500777ffa09b746c/0_195_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sleeping on the job \u2026 a nap pod at Samsung HQ.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sleeping on the job \u2026 a nap pod at Samsung HQ.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tim Griffith</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Housing the biggest continuous office floor in the world, seating around 3,000 workers in an open-plan jumble, it is a suitably gargantuan home for a social network that now counts one fifth of the world\u2019s population in its membership.

Google has rearranged its snack counters so you have to pass fresh fruit before you reach the candy, while in the cornucopic cafeteria of <a href=\"http://222second.com/building/\">LinkedIn\u2019s new San Francisco HQ</a>, a wall lists all the local suppliers, beneath the slogan: \u201cKnow your farms, know your food.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI like to start my day with a kimchi rice bowl, or maybe some sushi,\u201d says one LinkedIn employee, as we stroll around the never-ending buffet. \u201cWe have an in-house pastry chef whose cakes are to die for and eight flavours of homemade ice cream.\u201d</p> <p>Sheathed in a sinister cloak of faceted black glass, somehow befitting the professional networking site, LinkedIn\u2019s new 26-storey tower is a vertical promenade of tech office cliches.

Leaving the offices, we pass through a corridor where a distorted trompe-l\u2019oeil mural makes a slogan appear to float in thin air, filling your field of vision with bold capital letters: \u201cFOCUS ON WHAT MATTERS.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76c6caa518098848676cb7ac8e03bce1f21b1e84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76c6caa518098848676cb7ac8e03bce1f21b1e84/0_161_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Airbnb\u2019s bedouin tent meeting rooms.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Airbnb\u2019s bedouin tent meeting rooms.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Mahaney/Mark Maheny</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A few blocks away, one of the region\u2019s fastest growing companies is rapidly filling the floors of a former paper factory, where it has converted the industrial spaces into a theatrical playground of themed work zones. At <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/airbnb\">Airbnb</a>, you can have your meetings in a log cabin or a Milanese loft apartment, a bedouin tent or a replica ramen cafe \u2013 each space meticulously recreated from the website\u2019s holiday rental listings.</p> <p>According to the company\u2019s in-house Environments team, it\u2019s about \u201chow we can create spaces that are home-like, but highly effective, functional spaces that allow people to do great work, but hopefully in ways that surprise us.\u201d</p> <p>Some people nestle in bean bags, hunched over their laptops on a stepped seating terrace, others meet in an Airstream caravan, while studious types can squirrel themselves away in leather armchairs in a dimly lit study. At the centre of it all, in a defining moment of startup nostalgia, is a meeting room modelled on the apartment down the road where the company first began.</p> <p>If the office is trying to be a physical manifestation of the company\u2019s motto \u2013 \u201cBelong anywhere\u201d \u2013 it all feels a bit like a budget version of the Crystal Maze, each set decorated with props sourced from eBay or Etsy, and built with the longevity of a shop-window display.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ec3c9c05959fc3f6a3316088b18921555ee95802\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec3c9c05959fc3f6a3316088b18921555ee95802/0_0_3648_5472/667.jpg\" alt=\"Ramen cafe-themed meeting room in Airbnb HQ\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Time to noodle \u2026 ramen cafe-themed meeting room at Airbnb\u2019s HQ.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Oliver Wainwright for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Out on the street, leaving the living wall-lined lobby, you\u2019re confronted with a stark symbol of one of the symptoms of the success of this room-letting behemoth, in the form of a type of enclosure that doesn\u2019t make it into the themed office landscape: the tents of a homeless encampment, huddled beneath the flyover.</p> <p>It is a reminder of the side-effects that the booming tech industry is having on the immediate context outside its hermetically sealed, candy-coated walls. The recent influx of companies from the valley to the city, lured here by considerable tax incentives, is not only increasing rents but bringing other unexpected consequences.</p> <p>\u201cTech offices can have a kind of deadening effect on the city,\u201d says Allison Arieff of <a href=\"http://www.spur.org/\">SPUR</a>, a non-profit urban research centre. \u201cBecause they now provide their employees with everything on site for free \u2013 from coffee to dry-cleaning to haircuts \u2013 local businesses are often forced to close down when they move in.\u201d</p> <p>For all their talk of community and the commons, the dotcoms are proving to be some of the least civic-minded businesses around. As a gesture of public goodwill, LinkedIn\u2019s tower gives a vast chunk of its ground floor over to an airy \u201cpublic room\u201d, where you may sit and have your lunch and use the Wi-Fi, but San Franciscans won\u2019t be so easily persuaded.</p> <p>\u201cNobody cares about your tech job,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BEtnjetxD2b/?taken-by=ollywainwright\">reads a poster on a nearby lamppost</a>. \u201cBe courteous to others when in public and keep the feral careerism of your collegial banter on mute. Or get mugged. We can hear you.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.josephphibbs.com\">Joseph Phibbs</a>\u2019s new work for the BBC Symphony Orchestra is called Partita \u2013 and yes, it has six movements whose names broadly fit with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partitas_for_keyboard_(Bach)\">the old-style dance suite</a>, perfected by JS Bach, that it\u2019s named after. But those movements run together with only one break to form a substantial, 25-minute work. The whole thing feels more like a concerto for orchestra in the way it revels in the orchestra\u2019s sonorities and gives solo instruments \u2013 clarinet, trumpet, cello, cor anglais \u2013 their moment in the sun.</p> <p>The tugging string harmonies of the opening section, titled Notturno, give way to a scurrying Courante, lightly dispatched here by the BBCSO violins under the sure direction of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/sakari-oramo\">Sakari Oramo</a>. But it\u2019s the Sarabande that follows on from this that finds Phibbs at his most distinctive: the stately old-style dance is made to morph into a kind of tango, punctuated by woody percussion, with an acerbic sound halfway between Britten-esque eeriness and a cabaret band. Under Oramo\u2019s baton it sounded almost witty, and it certainly leavened the lushness and forcefulness found elsewhere in the work \u2013 but it was perhaps gone too soon.</p> <p>Partita formed part of a meaty programme alongside two works responding to the uneasiness of the 1930s. In Bart\u00f3k\u2019s turbulent Violin Concerto No 2, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/oct/18/alina-ibragimova-violinist-rawness-energy\">Alina Ibragimova</a> gave a solo performance of powerful and unflagging intensity. In Vaughan Williams\u2019s Dona Nobis Pacem, soprano Sarah Fox and baritone Duncan Rock sang out <a href=\"http://www.classical-music.com/feature/world-music/vaughan-williams-dona-nobis-pacem\">the Latin text and Walt Whitman\u2019s poetry</a>, but it was the BBC Symphony Chorus whose well-enunciated, insistent singing really hit home.</p> <ul> <li> On BBC Radio 3 at 7.30pm on 25 May.<br /></li> </ul>",

      "body": "<p>Stewart Hosie has stepped down as deputy leader of the Scottish National party a week after revelations emerged about his private life, and will no longer lead a fresh drive for independence.</p> <p>Hosie apologised to the party leader, Nicola Sturgeon, for the \u201churt and upset\u201d he had caused his friends, family and colleagues after having an affair with a journalist, which has led to him separating from his wife, Shona Robison, one of Sturgeon\u2019s closest friends.</p> <p>His resignation letter was released by the SNP on Sunday, the day before Hosie was due to meet Sturgeon in London when she addresses her party\u2019s Westminster group in the Commons.</p> <p>Party sources had predicted before his resignation was announced that the meeting was likely to be very frosty. The event is due to feature a group photograph of the 54-strong SNP group outside the Commons.</p> <p>Sturgeon <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/18/nicola-sturgeons-reshuffle-sees-very-few-new-faces-join-cabinet\">reappointed Robison last week as cabinet secretary for health and sport</a>, three days after Hosie and Robison announced they had separated.</p> <p>The SNP had initially shown every sign of trying to tough out the controversy, which marred Sturgeon\u2019s high-profile reforms of the party to promote far greater sexual equality and gender balance in her cabinet and public life in Scotland.</p> <p>The day the scandal broke, Hosie\u2019s Westminister colleagues unanimously re-elected him as their depute group leader \u2013 a role he will keep despite standing down as overall SNP deputy leader.</p> <p>In the published extracts of his resignation letter, the text of which had been agreed in advance with Robison, with whom he has a daughter, Hosie announced that he would not seek re-election at this year\u2019s party conference, due to be held this autumn.</p> <p>\u201cI am writing to you firstly to apologise for any hurt and upset I have caused to friends, family and colleagues. That was never my intention,\u201d Hosie said. Party sources said Hosie had been left a \u201cbroken man\u201d by the scandal.</p> <p>\u201cAs you know I have been admitted to hospital on three occasions in the past few years with very high blood pressure. In that regard, the stress of the intense scrutiny of my private life has been very difficult.\u201d</p> <p>In reply, Sturgeon said she had enjoyed working with Hosie as her deputy and commended him for writing two successful election manifestos \u2013 for the 2015 general election, where the SNP won a landslide in Scotland, and for the 2016 Holyrood election.</p> <p>\u201cThese are achievements you should be very proud of,\u201d she said. \u201cAs you step down as depute leader, I know you will continue to make a valuable contribution to the party in many ways and, in particular, through your work in your constituency and as part of the Westminster group.\u201d</p> <p>Hosie has long been part of a powerful inner circle of senior SNP figures. He and Robison represented the same coterminous constituencies of Dundee East and Dundee City East in the two parliaments. He was elected as the party\u2019s deputy leader at the same time as Sturgeon stood unopposed to be party leader.</p> <p>Robison was Sturgeon\u2019s campaign manager during the leadership contest. Hosie had been due to take charge of the first minister\u2019s summer campaign to revitalise their case for independence, by attempting to reassure no voters of its viability. He is now thought to have lost that job.</p> <p>The disclosure of Hosie\u2019s affair with Serena Cowdy, who had previously had an affair with another SNP MP, Angus MacNeil, stunned the party and his colleagues. There were allegations \u2013 denied by the party \u2013 that the two men had come to blows in a bar over the affair.</p> <p>The controversy escalated further last week after allegations emerged that MacNeil had conducted his affair with Cowdy while staying in a London hotel on parliamentary expenses. This is not thought to be a breach of Westminster\u2019s expenses rules since the hotel costs were in line with those rules, and have been authorised.</p> <p>This is the third scandal to hit the SNP Westminster group. Two of its MPs, Michelle Thomson and Natalie McGarry, have resigned the SNP whip after coming separately under police investigation for alleged financial impropriety.</p> <p>Ian Murray, the shadow Scottish secretary for Labour, said Hosie had made the right decision, but added: \u201cThis incident exposes something more significant about the SNP at Westminster. Instead of attacking each other, SNP MPs should be focused on delivering for their constituents.</p> <p>\u201cLast year the SNP told us their MPs would be stronger for Scotland, but just 12 months on, many have been a source of real embarrassment. This incident hasn\u2019t just seen them let down their party, but they are letting down the people of Scotland who voted for them and expect much better behaviour.\u201d</p> <p>John Lamont, the Scottish Conservative chief whip at Holyrood, said: \u201cStewart Hosie\u2019s decision was inevitable given the circumstances. This episode has been another embarrassment to the SNP MPs group and people who voted for them last year have every right to question what has happened since.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Magnetic North\u2019s first album \u2013 <em>Orkney: Symphony of the Magnetic North</em> \u2013 was inspired by the Orcadian childhood of one of the band\u2019s members, Erland Cooper. If you grow up on Orkney your memory will be blessed with folk tunes and tales, seascapes, selkies and strathspeys. And your concept album will be \u2013 as it says on the cover \u2013 symphonic. The idea for that album came to Cooper in a dream. Of course it did. So it made sense for the band to make a new album about the childhood of one of its other members \u2013 Simon Tong. Except that Tong grew up in Skelmersdale.</p> <p>Skem as it is universally known.</p> <p>If you\u2019ve heard Skem mentioned recently it\u2019ll be because Grayson Perry went there for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/may/04/grayson-perry-all-man-boys-breaking-man-contract-if-they-cry\">his TV series <em>All Man</em></a>, interviewed some violent, dysfunctional young gang members and upset the local council. When I tell anyone that I\u2019m listening to a concept album about Skem, the reaction is always the same. First they laugh and then they share some piece of Skem arcana. Did you know the planners included a vast sandpit in the town centre without realising that dogs would go in it and that therefore it ended up with the highest incidence of enteritis in Europe? Skem has no traffic lights \u2013 just a lot of roundabouts. Conspiracy theorists will tell you that in the 1960s a secret government experiment called Mind Reader involved placing an \u201cAspiration Dispersal Field\u201d generator in a mineshaft near Skem. The generator transmitted a subliminal hum via a network of stone monoliths placed around the town, the purpose of which was to drain the citizens of any kind of material aspiration.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The problem with utopias is that one person imagines them and everyone else has to live in them</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And then of course there\u2019s the fact that Skem was chosen by the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi as the location of the first Golden Temple of the Age of Enlightenment, the European Sidhaland. Which is why Tong\u2019s dad moved his family there from Bolton in 1984. \u201cMy dad wanted to be a part of the TM [transcendental meditation] movement in the town,\u201d says Tong. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t ever a hippie; he\u2019d been more of a beatnik in the \u201960s. Growing up in Skem as a teenager, I hated the whole TM thing. But when I got to 16 and started practising it for a few years, it worked. I became a lot less miserable and angry.\u201d</p> <p>The Maharishi chose Skem because it was roughly in the middle of the country and he believed they could send good vibes out from there to the whole nation. I like to think of the invisible battle raging in the Lancashire sky as the positive transcendental meditation vibes try to drown out the negative aspiration hum. Skem\u2019s Fortean reputation has grown partly because no one ever goes there to see for themselves. It\u2019s one of the largest towns in the UK without a railway station. This is because the planners, who designed it in the early 60s, wanted to cut the umbilical cord that joined the new town to the old city from which its inhabitants had been drawn \u2013 Liverpool.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"809bf1021b0f902ee7d03dbd34ed817fab16e54b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/809bf1021b0f902ee7d03dbd34ed817fab16e54b/0_0_5669_4370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Skelmersdale in 1984: \u2018an almost comically perfect example of failed utopia\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"771\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Skelmersdale in 1984: \u2018an almost comically perfect example of failed utopia\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen McCoy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By isolating it they hoped it would develop its own identity. Skem is somewhere between Wigan and Southport, but try getting there on public transport. It makes Orkney look convenient. Skem is an almost comically perfect example of a story that has become as ingrained in the culture as those folk tales \u2013 the story of failed utopia, the planner\u2019s pipe dream that turned out to be a waking nightmare.</p> <p>The problem with utopias is that one person imagines them and everyone else has to live in them. The waymarked footpaths and bridges that were supposed to encourage walking felt terrifying and empty when you had to walk them. The cloughs that were left untouched so as to provide green corridors instead filled up with shopping trolleys and needles. As Paul Farley put it in his poem Brutalist: \u201cOne by one the shopkeepers will shut/their doors for good. A newsagent will draw/the line at buttered steps. The final straws/will fill the fields beyond. Now live in it.\u201d</p> <p>So I was expecting Magnetic North\u2019s album, <em><a href=\"http://fulltimehobby.sandbaghq.com/the-magnetic-north-prospect-of-skelmersdale.html\">Prospect of Skelmersdale</a></em>, to throb with the percussion of stolen vehicles crashing, played out over the subliminal hum of aspiration dispersing, with a horn section inspired by enteritis. Instead this is a lyrical, sunny album. There are washes of flutes and strings that seem to hint at forgotten Ronnie Hazlehurst <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/organgrinder/2007/oct/02/ronniehazlehursthisgreatest1\">sitcom themes</a>, easing you into a reverie of nostalgia, then yanking you out again with mutterings of depression and isolation.</p> <p>Hannah Peel, as well as being a great singer, is a kind of latter-day Delia Derbyshire, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jetzY-W78gg\">creating loops and rhythms</a> that capture the hypnotic, circuitous road system. Part of the function of art is to put a frame around something that you haven\u2019t noticed before, and make you look closer. This album made me look not just at Skem, and at my own childhood, which was also spent on an estate, though a much more successful one, near St Helens. I had almost forgotten \u2013 until I heard the whispered, prayer-like Pennylands \u2013 the thrill of arriving. I spent my early childhood in a block of flats in the middle of Liverpool. One evening my mother took my brother and me to Lime Street station and we all got on a train. I now know we were on that train for 35 minutes. In memory, the journey was trans-Siberian. We walked over a footbridge and along an unfamiliar road until we came to a housing estate. My mother steered us left, then right, then left, then right and knocked on the front door of an unfamiliar house.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"1acd7bf083483cd3159b852e8d31a351611a1825\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1acd7bf083483cd3159b852e8d31a351611a1825/0_0_5789_3824/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The band Magnetic North (from left, Gawain Erland Cooper, Hannah Peel and Simon Tong).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"661\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The band Magnetic North (from left, Gawain Erland Cooper, Hannah Peel and Simon Tong).</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My father answered the door. What was he doing there? He took us inside. There was a fire burning in the grate, some sticks of furniture. Our voices echoed in a way I\u2019d never heard voices echo indoors before. I never hear an echo like that \u2013 or smell fresh putty and raw timber \u2013 without feeling a knot of excitement. It felt like the frontier. The roads weren\u2019t finished. We walked on duckboards. The nervous system of the estate \u2013 the pipes and wires \u2013 were still open to view when we moved in.</p> <p>I remember the day that the gardens were delivered. A pile of topsoil was dumped at the gate of each house and we all rushed out to shovel it over the raw clay. Men and women who had never had gardens before stood around testing the pH of the soil and discussing what they might grow. It was like something out of <em>The Big Country</em>. It was like the beginning of the world. Everyone was young. There were hundreds of children. Our gardens were separated by tiny flimsy fences which we clambered over, turning them all into one big secret park.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We lived through a utopian project and we saw utopia crumble. But that doesn\u2019t mean the idea of utopia is not useful</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Two roads over, there were empty fields. I thought it was the Serengeti. The slag heap of Bold Colliery that lumped into the sky beyond the railway line, I assumed that was Vesuvius. I felt so rich, that when people in costume dramas on the Sunday night TV discussed their estates, I thought they were talking about a field of semis. Though obviously Mr Darcy lived in the showhome.</p> <p>We were part of a generation that had to be rehoused, ultimately because of the blitz that destroyed almost a third of the city\u2019s housing stock. The need for new places to live was urgent. We were bits of shrapnel showered out into the greenbelt in a slow-motion explosion. We lived with a thrill of optimism, but also with a constant, nagging nostalgia, a sense that our real homes were back in the city. We went back to my gran\u2019s nearly every weekend. Any Lancashire-ising of our accents was met with disapproval. I once used the word \u201ctown\u201d to refer to St Helens. It was as though I had punched a pope.</p> <p>We were like migrants clinging to the culture of the old country, even though we had only moved eight miles up the road. So we grew up thinking that our geographical location was somehow wrong. That the place we lived in would not be worth remembering.</p> <p>I\u2019m sure the same is true of Skem. So part of the beauty of Magnetic North\u2019s album is just the fact that it notices. The band made themselves answerable to Skem, playing the material live at the E Rooms. After the gig a woman came over to the singer, Peel, and said: \u201cI live in Sandy Lane. I\u2019ve told my son that someone has written a song about us.\u201d Being noticed is important. Noticing is the best thing an artist can do.</p> <p>There\u2019s a song on the album called Cergy-Pontoise (the name of Skem\u2019s twin town) which made me catch my breath. The lyrics are simply \u201cGet down/I won\u2019t get down\u201d \u2013 a call and response that I\u2019d forgotten completely but was a constant refrain when you were growing up in a work-in-progress. There was always something to climb on. It was always possibly dangerous. But the mantra like feel of it comes out of Tong\u2019s experience of TM. \u201cI never got fully involved with the community,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I did benefit from learning the basic meditation technique aged 16. You can see why the Beatles were attracted to it. The mantra is a powerful tool.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"07f7da0a75fcef0007ce3c62d67f1358d71322cc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/07f7da0a75fcef0007ce3c62d67f1358d71322cc/0_0_5669_4370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018There was always something to climb on.

There\u2019s a song that takes you through the stages of yogic flying. There are also clips from a promotional video made when the new town was just filling up. There\u2019s talk of its \u201csylvan setting\u201d and its rational layout. So we can trace the path of two separate attempts at utopia in one small Lancashire town. It\u2019s a chilling moment when one of the planners says: \u201cIf we come back in 30 years and they\u2019re happy we will have done our job.\u201d The videos and the album also make use of the stark, revealing photos Stephen McCoy took of the town in the 1980s, when the jobs had already gone.</p> <p>But <em>Prospect of Skelmersdale</em> makes you question whether we have dismissed these failed utopias too easily. There\u2019s something moving about the planners in that video enthusing about their communal TV masts and play streets. It\u2019s not the planners\u2019 fault \u2013 or the fault of the residents \u2013 that the firms who moved there disappeared as soon as they\u2019d trousered the subsidies. It\u2019s salutary to remember that this nation once saw the housing crisis as a problem that could be solved not only by building houses but by improving people\u2019s living conditions. Remembering this allows you to be properly shocked by the current notion that the housing shortage is merely an opportunity for one generation to fleece the next. We lived through a utopian project and we saw utopia crumble. But that doesn\u2019t mean the idea of utopia is not useful.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXMLZvjCWcM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZXMLZvjCWcM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXMLZvjCWcM\">Watch the video for Signs by the Magnetic North.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>There\u2019s a tourist attraction in Hamburg called Miniatur Wunderland. One room contains a series of scenes of one street through time. From the bronze age, through the middle ages, the Enlightenment, the Nazis (\u201cin the far corner we can see Rosa Luxemburg being murdered\u2026\u201d), the Berlin wall and the collapse of the wall and then\u2026 it doesn\u2019t stop. Because the next few cases show visions of what the same street might be in the future. Each of those cases has been put together by a different political party. Each party was asked to show what their vision of the future would look like at street level. It was revelatory and oddly moving to see that politicians dream too. More importantly it makes them show us their idea of what good looks like.</p> <p>The discipline of dreaming has all but vanished from British politics. I have no idea what Cameron, or for that matter Corbyn, would like my street to look like. Those who have been campaigning for their entire lifetime to disconnect us from that utopian project \u2013 the European Union \u2013 seem to have only the sketchiest idea of what they want next. Maybe that\u2019s the function of utopia \u2013 to be an idea to which reality is answerable. Utopia asks questions we have allowed our politics to ignore.</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://fulltimehobby.sandbaghq.com/the-magnetic-north-prospect-of-skelmersdale.html\">Prospect of Skelmersdale by Magnetic North</a> is available on Full Time Hobby records, \u00a310; the single Pennylands is released next month.

Nick Menza was the nicest and most sincere guy you should ever hope to meet. He would take the shirt off his back to help you if you needed it. He had a passion for artwork, not just metal music. His tastes were far wider than that genre, which always irked his manager.\u201d</p> <p>Menza, son of a jazz musician, played with Megadeth on several of its most successful albums in the early 1990s, including Rust in Peace, Countdown to Extinction and Youthanasia. He left the band when he had to have knee surgery during a tour for the 1997 album Cryptic Writings.</p> <p>He had been playing regular sessions at the Baked Potato club with OHM, founded in 2002 by another Megadeth veteran, the guitarist Chris Poland. </p>",

      "body": "<p><br tabindex=\"-1\" />In October 1886 the committee of the Leeds festival secured the services of Anton\u00edn Dvo\u0159\u00e1k to present a major new choral work. What they asked for was a grand oratorio on a familiar Biblical theme. What they got was an arcane, three-part study of the development of Christianity in ninth century Bohemia.</p> <p>Nonetheless the people of Leeds seemed to like it. \u201cThey were so enthusiastic, in that truly English way\u201d Dvo\u0159\u00e1k reported to a correspondent. Yet those initial waves of enthusiasm subsided into deafening silence. The last significant performance heard in Britain was given by Ji\u0159\u00ed B\u011blohl\u00e1vek <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2002/sep/03/classicalmusicandopera.artsfeatures\">at the Edinburgh Festival 14 years ago</a>. Mark Elder does not believe that the piece has been performed by the Hall\u00e9 since it was presented a month after the Leeds premiere. </p> <p>It came as a suitably grandiose conclusion to <a href=\"http://www.halle.co.uk/dvorak-festival/\">the Hall\u00e9\u2019s month-long Dvo\u0159\u00e1k festival</a>, which has thrown up curiosities such as the fairytale tone-poem the Golden Spinning Wheel and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2014/apr/12/henry-goodman-self-image\">actor Henry Goodman</a> appearing in the guise of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k himself. And there are few things guaranteed to fire Mark Elder\u2019s enthusiasm than a massive dramatic oratorio that few within the audience will have heard before. </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/21/david-pountney-arts-funding-bad-for-our-cultural-health\">David Pountney</a>\u2019s lucid new translation helped to make the subject matter feel slightly less intractable. Yet for a non-Czech audience there is very little to set the pulses racing about the baptism of the <a href=\"http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=824\">Bohemian princess Ludmila</a> and her marriage to an opportunistic nobleman named Bo\u0159ivoj, beyond the fact that the dynasty resulted in the birth of Good King Wenceslas. Nor does it help that the religious hermit responsible for effecting the conversion is a sanctimonious bore who puts a stop to the paganism just as you suspect Dvo\u0159\u00e1k was beginning to enjoy it. But the grand choruses are on a truly Handelian scale, and the waves of sound produced by the Hall\u00e9 choir instilled a sense of uplift that can only be produced by an exceptional chorus at the peak of its form. </p> <p>The initial episodes had the rustic charm of a country dance led by a jolly farmer, effortlessly sung by tenor Stuart Jackson, who could have breezed in from the opening scenes of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/19/the-bartered-bride-review-opera-north\">the Bartered Bride</a>. Yet all turned to chaos following the intervention of the hermit, imperiously characterised by bass James Creswell, who smites the heathen idols with bolts of lightning before finishing the job with an axe. </p> <p>The response of Emma Bell\u2019s Ludmila was genuinely luminous; her tone was pristine, heroic and swelled with the exultation of one who has genuinely seen the light. The conversion of her future husband felt slightly less convincing as Nicky Spence\u2019s jaunty Prince Bo\u0159ivoj was obviously more passionate about hunting than praying. In the lady-in-waiting role of Svatava, mezzo Christine Rice waited a long time for something to do but did it well. The work concluded with an otherworldly fugue based on the archaic harmonies of an 11th century mass. Edward Elgar, who played violin under Dvo\u0159\u00e1k at the Three Choirs festival, was surely taking notes. </p>",

      "body": "<p>Louis van Gaal arrived at Manchester United as the \u201cIron Tulip\u201d and departs as the \u201cMuddled Thinker\u201d. The confusion that swirled around his tactics, team selection and man-management is why Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/21/jose-mourinho-to-be-appointed-manchester-united-manager-next-week\" title=\"\">set to take over </a> and it was again evident in the XI the Dutchman sent out for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/may/21/crystal-palace-manchester-united-fa-cup-final-live\" title=\"\">the FA Cup final</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/22/louis-van-gaal-its-over-manchester-united\">Louis van Gaal says \u2018it\u2019s over\u2019 as his Manchester United reign is set to end</a> </p> </aside>  <p>One of Van Gaal\u2019s persistent moans this season has been the lack of pacy wingers. Step forward, then, Jesse Lingard, who is precisely this and who before Saturday\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/21/crystal-palace-manchester-united-fa-cup-final-match-report\" title=\"\">2-1 victory</a> against Crystal Palace had made 39 appearances in a breakthrough year. He was in the starting lineup that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/17/manchester-united-bournemouth-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">beat Bournemouth 3-1</a> on Tuesday night at Old Trafford but despite Van Gaal\u2019s pointing to the need for speed along the flanks, Lingard was dropped against Crystal Palace.</p> <p>A head-scratcher \u2013 but Van Gaal <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/21/louis-van-gaal-manchester-united-sack\" title=\"\">has made this a prime occupation</a> for those who have regularly watched his United these past two seasons. Attempting to solve the puzzle of what the former Holland manager was up to whenever his players kicked off became the side-game to the match.</p> <p>After Lingard\u2019s relegation to the bench the next conundrum was in the United engine room. Van Gaal sent out a team to beat Palace that again had Wayne Rooney in a deep-lying midfield position. The issue is not the England captain\u2019s ability to operate there \u2013 he can \u2013 but in how the Dutchman lined up the rest of his men. Michael Carrick operated alongside Rooney, as did Marouane Fellaini, these last two perhaps told by the manager to rove forward when they could. The lack of clarity over their roles arises because to observe United was to see them too often clogged up across midfield.</p> <p>With Rooney and Fellaini playing a game of should I stay or should I go, United had a man too many \u2013 and this slowed them. The last thing this Van Gaal side requires is further hindrance to any attacking with zest. The 64-year-old\u2019s insistence that passing into submission is the way forward has proved only a sideways move.</p> <p>So United were even stodgier than usual \u2013 some feat \u2013 and would advance to territory near Palace\u2019s area and no further. It meant that at half-time they dominated but were held at 0-0. It meant they were vulnerable to the kind of smash-and-grab goal they have too often suffered under Van Gaal.</p> <p>On 78 minutes it occurred. Palace had been subdued, then up popped Jason Puncheon with a volley that beat David de Gea from close in on an angle. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/21/crystal-palace-miss-big-chance-alan-pardew-jason-puncheon-fa-cup-final-manchester-united\" title=\"\">Alan Pardew\u2019s side</a> were in dreamland and Van Gaal\u2019s were in the nightmare of being responsible for United\u2019s third consecutive FA Cup final loss, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/may/20/match.chelsea\" title=\"\">to follow 2007</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2005/may/22/match.sport1\" title=\"\">2005</a>.</p> <p>Rooney, however, was about to step up to illustrate he can still be United\u2019s X-factor. His mazy run from near the centre circle to the right edge of Palace\u2019s area acted as a magnet, pulling them out of shape. The cross Rooney sent over as his weight took him in the opposite direction impressed, as did the way it dropped on to Fellaini, whose chest-down was finished by a grateful Juan Mata.</p> <p>Cue a mightily relieved United. This was nine minutes from the end and then in extra-time Chris Smalling was dismissed for a second yellow card on 105 minutes. By the 110th United were ahead. Lingard had eventually been sent on by Van Gaal, just before the 90-minute mark.</p> <p>Now he showed his class and what United had been missing, letting fly with a rocket of a volley that gave Wayne Hennessey no chance in the Palace goal.</p> <p>Of his Boy\u2019s Own moment, Lingard said: \u201cIt was a massive feeling. To win it is great, and ending the season on a high with my family and friends watching in the crowd. It fell nicely for me to hit; I knew I had to catch it right and luckily I did.\u201d</p> <p>United deserved the victory and glory of a 12th FA Cup triumph that puts them alongside Arsenal as the competition\u2019s most successful club. It was a win of bloody-mindedness \u2013 as if the players wanted to prevail despite, and not because of, Van Gaal.</p> <p>Lingard said: \u201cIt\u2019s the United way \u2013 we showed great team spirit. We had the older lads in midfield and youth up front to guide us through.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/22/louis-van-gaal-fa-cup-win-not-enough-manchester-united\">FA Cup win on its own was never enough to save Louis van Gaal | Paul Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Van Gaal, who on Sunday <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/22/louis-van-gaal-its-over-manchester-united\" title=\"\">indicated that his time at United was \u201cover\u201d</a>, at least ended two muddled years as a winner. Being the first man to secure a trophy in the post-Sir Alex Ferguson era, after three years, is no small achievement.</p> <p>Van Gaal outlined what this means to him. \u201cA lot, because that was my aim. My aim was the experience of English football, English culture and to bring a title to Manchester United in spite of the transition that we have to make. I\u2019m very happy because I\u2019ve done it [won the Cup] in four countries and I don\u2019t think many other managers can say this. It feels unbelievable.\u201d</p> <p>Of Lingard\u2019s winner, he added: \u201cIt was a fantastic goal and a special moment. You don\u2019t see them too much. I had a lucky hand, I believe.\u201d Luck is a red herring. Too often Van Gaal\u2019s United have not been good enough.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Jesse Lingard (Manchester United)</p>",

The Northern Football League Division One team should probably have been out of contention before they equalised through the veteran defender Chris Swailes, with Hereford wasting numerous brilliant opportunities, but they were far more clinical and ultimately the deserved winner. The Vase has been won by clubs based in the North-east in seven of the past eight years.</p> <p>It took 92 years for the people of Hereford to see their football team play at the national stadium but once the action got under way they needed only 75 seconds to celebrate a goal. And what a goal it was, too, from Purdie. Fed by Joe Tumelty, who had cut in from the left, the midfielder took a touch and, nearly 30 yards from goal, picked his spot. Karl Dryden, the Morpeth keeper, got a hand to it but could not keep the powerful drive from nestling in his bottom-right corner.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"127d5f9996358aca039439599263b83ba7659c3d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/127d5f9996358aca039439599263b83ba7659c3d/0_223_3000_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ronaldo the bull\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hereford\u2019s mascot, Ronaldo the bull, is paraded at Wembley.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Hoskins/The FA via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the time Hereford\u2019s fans rose to applaud in recognition of their former striker Adam Stansfield, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/aug/11/adam-stansfield-exeter-city-dies\">who passed away in 2010 from colorectal cancer</a>, they should have been three goals clear. The Ghana-born winger Sirdic Grant, playing perhaps his final game for the club because his student visa does not permit him to play above the fifth level of non-league football, was a menacing force on the right. He was denied twice by Dryden, while Mike Symons and Pablo Haysham spurned excellent chances to extend the lead.</p> <p>Morpeth were living dangerously but they shook off their nerves and slowly began to gain a foothold, with Sean Taylor and Ben Sayer firing narrowly over from distance. There was, however, an element of fortune about their equaliser, scored by the 45-year-old Swailes. A corner from the left in the 34th minute was flapped at by the Hereford goalkeeper, Martin Horsell, the ball came off the centre-half\u2019s chest and crept over the line.</p> <p>Swailes has endured such a long career that he made his Football League debut for Doncaster against Hereford United at Edgar Street in 1993, three years before Grant, the Bulls\u2019 best player, was born. Once that equaliser went in, Morpeth took control. Michael Chilton should have given the Northumberland team the lead but inexplicably scuffed his attempt from six yards after Luke Carr played him in.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/21/hereford-reborn-quadruple-fa-vase-final\">How Hereford FC have risen from the dead to arrive at Wembley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Within 40 seconds of the restart, though, they were ahead. Hereford failed to deal with a Sayer cross from the right and Taylor sent the ball back across goal. Carr was left unmarked and he calmly sent the ball past Horsell. Hereford did their best to find an equaliser but a tireless Taylor made it 3-1 just 12 minutes later after latching on to Chilton\u2019s clever through ball and finishing low past Horsell.</p> <p>The Bulls\u2019 best chance of pulling a goal back fell to the substitute John Mills. With only Dryden to beat after a neat flick from Mustapha Bundu, he could only shin the ball wide. And their torment increased when Shaun Bell, only on the pitch two minutes as a substitute, found the net in injury time via a deflection after Steven Anderson\u2019s pass.</p> <p><strong>Hereford FC</strong> Horsell; Oates, Green, Willets (Mills, 70), Edwards; Tumelty (Bundu, 55), Birch, Purdie, Grant; Haysham; Symons. <strong>Subs not used</strong> Summers, Bonella, Staley.</p> <p><strong>Morpeth Town</strong> Dryden; Forster, Swailes, Hall, Novak; Sayer, Graydon, Fry; Carr (Bell, 89), Chilton (Anderson, 69), Taylor (Mullen, 79). <strong>Subs not used</strong> Pearson, Harrison.</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> S Attwell.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Swailes (Morpeth Town).</p>",

      "body": "<p>As a 22-year-old reporter on the Northern Echo in 1965, I was lucky enough to meet <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/thebeatles\">the Beatles</a> backstage at a gig in Newcastle. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/paulmccartney\">Paul McCartney</a> threw me his violin bass and told me he was a skinflint, before turning left out of the dressing room to go and play before hordes of screaming fans. Not quite believing my luck at having landed such a scoop, I immediately decided to devote the rest of my life to cataloguing everything to do with the Beatles in obsessive detail.</p> <p>In 1981, I published <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/12/george-martin-appreciation-philip-norman-beatles\">Shout!</a>, which most sensible people agree is the most definitive account of the Beatles ever written. In that book \u2013 and indeed in my later biography of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/johnlennon\">John Lennon</a> \u2013 I may have given the impression that Paul was the least talented member of the Beatles, a musician who had piggybacked on the talent of John and whose later career with Wings was an abject failure. I want to state firmly now that I have always thought that Paul was a total genius and at least the equal of John. If I sounded somewhat scathing about Paul, it was because I was jealous of his talent and couldn\u2019t come to terms with the fact that he was better looking than me.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/video/2016/apr/26/never-before-seen-footage-of-the-beatles-backstage-in-1965-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4tjad\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2494192\"            data-video-name=\"Never before seen footage of the Beatles backstage in 1965 \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"National Film and Sound Archive of Australia\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-571ec542e4b0a57b991f62cc\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/04/26/160426beatles_h264_publish.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11263523&amp;format=video/webm\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11263523&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;maxwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11263523&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11263523&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/video/2016/apr/26/never-before-seen-footage-of-the-beatles-backstage-in-1965-video\">Newly released footage of the Beatles backstage in 1965</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>While watching <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cCANKXEKtY\">Paul headline the Olympics closing ceremony</a> in front of the Queen in 2012, it occurred to me that he might be quite grateful if I was to write an 800-page book about him. So I asked his publicist if he would speak to me. Unfortunately, Paul said he would be quite busy for the next 25 years, but that I was free to talk to every single person who had ever met him, and to scour the cuttings library for detail.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/16/paul-mccartney-the-biography-philip-norman-linda-beatles-lennon-wings\">Paul McCartney: The Biography by Philip Norman \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Paul was born in a much more run-down area of Liverpool than John, which leads me to speculate that when John wrote the line \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsmQhbd1KWE\">a working-class hero is something to be</a>\u201d he was subconsciously paying homage to Paul. Certainly, Paul\u2019s early life was not easy, and he has never got over the death of his mother, but he was by far the cleverest person in his class at school, winning a prize for his essay on William the Conqueror that contained no spelling mistakes whatsoever.</p> <p>When he was 16, Paul became friends with George Harrison, and they both began playing with John, who was older. John was very impressed with Paul\u2019s musical talent and they later went on play together in Hamburg and at the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2016/feb/26/the-beatles-legacy-in-liverpool-in-pictures\">Cavern Club</a> in Liverpool. While in Germany, Paul bought a cheap watch and wrote a letter to his father to tell him about it.</p> <p> Paul did not find it easy that all of his compositions were accredited to Lennon-McCartney, and it psychologically scarred him that not enough people know he wrote <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/video/2016/mar/09/producer-george-martin-beatles-yesterday-archive-video\">Yesterday</a> all by himself, in the gents\u2019 toilets of Abbey Road Studios when he was a bit stoned. There can be no doubt that Paul has always been a bit vain and, for the last 50 years, has employed a woman called Vi to comb his legs for him. Paul\u2019s legs are unnaturally hirsute and can get terribly matted if not given daily attention.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"378c9cd4cc6733941edd7b57c1c406484d590e77\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/378c9cd4cc6733941edd7b57c1c406484d590e77/0_0_300_456/300.jpg\" alt=\"Paul McCartney The Biography by Philip Norman\" width=\"300\" height=\"456\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The breakup of the Beatles, which was brilliantly described in my book Shout!, was very difficult for Paul and he went off to live in Scotland with Linda, whom nobody liked but him. After a brief period of seclusion while the couple devoted themselves to their wonderful children, Paul decided to form <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2014/jul/29/paul-mccartney-wings-in-pictures\">Wings</a>. Some people have been critical of the fact that he paid other members of the band next to nothing but, after much soul-searching, I now find that he paid them exactly the right amount. And I\u2019ve always thought that Linda had a lovely singing voice. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcZVRiB9AQk\">Mull of Kintyre</a> is my favourite song ever.</p> <p>Paul was very sad when Linda died, and his grief may have unbalanced his mind and made him marry the delusional <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/jul/17/heather-mills-my-family-values\">Heather Mills</a>. Much to his children\u2019s relief, that marriage ended acrimoniously and Paul is now very happy with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/gallery/2011/oct/09/mccartney-wedding-london-in-pictures\">Nancy Shevell</a>. Two years ago, I was lucky enough to meet Paul for a second time at a gig in Liverpool. \u201cHello, Phil,\u201d he said, before turning right to go on stage. Which was nice.</p> <p><strong>Digested read, digested:</strong> Help!<br /></p>",

But being sponsored by an entire country isn\u2019t the weirdest thing Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s players have had on their shirts.

It\u2019s fantastic. I\u2019ve seen it \u2026 Boxing Day, it\u2019s out on Boxing Day\u201d). </p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mpxb-vgQzUU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mpxb-vgQzUU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>As Duvall explained his love of legendary Celtic winger Jimmy Johnstone, the Cruiser suggested that \u2013 despite not having seen a game in England \u2013 he had been following the sport since the 80s. We can, then, only assume he had chosen this fixture to pay his respects to the spirits of 80s City legends such as Imre Varadi and Paul Power \u2013 and not because it was in his contract.</p> <h2><strong>Everton and Creed</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec52a130d426b7020633137da6466e51db04938d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec52a130d426b7020633137da6466e51db04938d/0_173_1725_1724/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sylvester Stallone brandishes his Everton scarf in 2007.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sylvester Stallone brandishes his Everton scarf in 2007.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Steele/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If any Hollywood character summed up Everton\u2019s 2015/16 season, it probably wouldn\u2019t be the never-say-die, grit-over-glamour spirit of Rocky Balboa. The way they defended at times was more Rocky and Bullwinkle (\u201cJohn Stones stars as Bullwinkle J Moose!\u201d). In fact, their fans\u2019 highlight of their season was probably playing a cameo role in this year\u2019s Creed. Toffees fan Stallone (who fell in love with the team after watching them draw 1-1 with Reading in 2007) filmed the crowd during an early 2015 0-0 draw with West Brom for the movie\u2019s final scene \u2013 a fight between Michael B Jordan\u2019s Adonis Creed and real-life Scouse boxer Tony Bellew. Everton fans wouldn\u2019t be this animated again until a plane with a banner calling for manager Roberto Martinez\u2019s sacking flew over Goodison Park in April.</p>",

Not only did Pentagon officials provide Drake\u2019s name to criminal investigators, Crane told the Guardian, they destroyed documents relevant to his defence. </p> <p>Snowden, responding to Crane\u2019s revelations, said he had tried to raise his concerns with colleagues, supervisors and lawyers and been told by all of them: \u201cYou\u2019re playing with fire.\u201d<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4215acb9ae81e05640f6ac824f4e7754daa95c58\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4215acb9ae81e05640f6ac824f4e7754daa95c58/671_388_1856_1113/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Edward Snowden is calling for \u2018iron-clad\u2019 protections for whistleblowers.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Edward Snowden is calling for \u2018iron-clad\u2019 protections for whistleblowers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lotta Hardelin/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He told the Guardian: \u201cWe need iron-clad, enforceable protections for whistleblowers, and we need a public record of success stories. Protect the people who go to members of Congress with oversight roles, and if their efforts lead to a positive change in policy \u2013 recognize them for their efforts. There are no incentives for people to stand up against an agency on the wrong side of the law today, and that\u2019s got to change.\u201d</p> <p>Snowden continued: \u201cThe sad reality of today\u2019s policies is that going to the inspector general with evidence of truly serious wrongdoing is often a mistake. Going to the press involves serious risks, but at least you\u2019ve got a chance.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <h2>Financially ruined</h2> <p>Thomas Drake\u2019s legal ordeal ruined him financially and ended in 2011 with all serious accusations against him dropped.

Now Crane\u2019s account has led to a new investigation at the US justice department into whistleblower retaliation at the Pentagon that may serve as an epilogue \u2013 one Crane hopes will make the Pentagon a safe place for insiders to expose wrongdoing and illegality. </p> <p>\u201cIf we have situations where we have whistleblowers investigated because they\u2019re whistleblowers to the inspector general\u2019s office, that will simply shut down the whole whistleblower system,\u201d Crane told the Guardian.</p> <p>Crane, who has not previously given interviews, has told his explosive story in a new book, Bravehearts: Whistle Blowing In The Age of Snowden by Mark Hertsgaard, from which the Guardian is running extracts. The Guardian has partnered with <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/ex-us-official-reveals-risks-faced-by-internal-govt-critics-a-1093360.html\">Der Spiegel </a>and Newsweek Japan on Crane\u2019s story.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"77185399a22341f6502371be3718f6ab0700cf9d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/77185399a22341f6502371be3718f6ab0700cf9d/77_113_1409_845/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thomas Drake\u2019s legal ordeal ruined him financially.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thomas Drake\u2019s legal ordeal ruined him financially.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Larry Busacca/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhen someone becomes a whistleblower, they\u2019re making a serious, conscious decision,\u201d Crane said. </p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re making a decision that can change their lives, change their futures, impact family life, too. There needs to be this certain unbreakable trust. Confidentiality is that trust and that can\u2019t ever be violated.\u201d</p> <p>Snowden cited Drake\u2019s case as a reason for his lack of faith in the government\u2019s official whistleblower channels. </p> <p>\u201cWhen I was at NSA, everybody knew that for anything more serious than workplace harassment, going through the official process was a career-ender at best. It\u2019s part of the culture,\u201d Snowden told the Guardian.</p> <p>\u201cIf your boss in the mailroom lies on his timesheets, the IG might look into it. But if you\u2019re Thomas Drake, and you find out the president of the United States ordered the warrantless wiretapping of everyone in the country, what\u2019s the IG going to do? They\u2019re going to flush it, and you with it.\u201d</p> <p>While Drake\u2019s case is well known in US national security circles, its internal history is not. </p> <h2>Major source</h2> <p>In 2002, Drake and NSA colleagues contacted the Pentagon inspector general to blow the whistle on an expensive and poorly performing tool, Trailblazer, for mass-data analysis. Crane, head of the office\u2019s whistleblower unit, assigned investigators. For over two years, with Drake as a major source, they acquired thousands of pages of documents, classified and unclassified, and prepared a lengthy secret report in December 2004 criticizing Trailblazer, eventually helping to kill the program. As far as Crane was concerned, the whistleblower system was working.</p> <p>But after an aspect of the NSA\u2019s warrantless mass surveillance leaked to the New York Times, Drake himself came under investigation and eventually indictment. Drake was suspected of hoarding documentation \u2013 exactly what inspector-general investigators tell their whistleblowers to do. </p> <p>\u201cThey made it clear to keep [documents] wherever possible, and obviously properly handle anything that was classified,\u201d Drake remembered.</p> <p>Crane feared that his own colleagues had told the FBI about Drake. He suspected the Pentagon inspector general\u2019s lead attorney, Henry Shelley, whom Crane said had earlier suggested working with the justice department about the leak, had done so. A confrontation yielded what Crane considered to be evasions. </p> <p>\u201cThe top lawyer would not reveal to me whether or not Drake\u2019s confidentiality had been compromised or not. That was a concern \u2026 Normally I expect direct answers,\u201d Crane said. </p> <p>When Drake\u2019s attorneys sought potentially exculpatory information from the inspector general\u2019s office, they learned that much of it had been \u201cdestroyed before the defendant was charged, pursuant to a standard document destruction policy\u201d, according to a 2011 letter from prosecutors. </p> <p>Crane was livid. All relevant regulations mandated keeping the documents, not destroying them. But a high-ranking colleague, Lynne Halbrooks, prevented Crane from investigating the document destruction. He suspected Shelley and Halbrooks of sacrificing a whistleblower and misleading the justice department and a federal judge, all in a case centering around the cover-up of NSA bulk surveillance.</p> <h2>Forced out</h2> <p>Crane\u2019s relationship with his superiors spiraled downward until they forced him out in 2013, months before Snowden\u2019s revelations. The next year, he filed a complaint with a federal agency that works with whistleblowers, the Office of Special Counsel. In March this year, it found a \u201csubstantial likelihood\u201d that the Pentagon inspector general\u2019s office improperly destroyed the Drake documents and arranged, with Pentagon consent, for the justice department inspector general to investigate.</p> <p>Shelley, still the Pentagon inspector general\u2019s senior counsel, declined to answer questions but said he was \u201ccertain my name will be cleared\u201d by the new investigation.</p> <p>Halbrooks, the Office of Special Counsel and the justice department inspector general declined to comment for this story.</p> <p>Bridget Serchak, a spokeswoman for the Pentagon inspector general, noted that her office and the Office of Special Counsel jointly requested the justice department investigation. </p> <p>\u201cIt is important to point out that there has been no determination on the allegations, and it is unfair to characterize the allegations otherwise at this point. DoD OIG will cooperate fully with the DoJ OIG\u2019s investigation of this matter and looks forward to the results of that investigation,\u201d Serchak said. </p> <p>Crane considers this latest inquiry a bellwether for whether the whistleblower system can reform itself in a post-Snowden era.</p> <p>\u201cSnowden responded to the way Drake was handled. The Office of Special Council investigation regarding destruction of possibly exculpatory documents regarding Drake might be the end of this saga,\u201d Crane said. </p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-23T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Claims by the UK justice secretary, Michael Gove, and the Vote Leave campaign that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/20/eu-immigrant-influx-michael-gove-nhs-unsustainable\">Turkey could achieve full membership of the EU by 2020</a> will come as a big surprise to the Turkish government and people. </p> <p>Turkey\u2019s application has been languishing since 1987, when Ankara first asked Brussels to consider its case for joining. It was not officially recognised as a candidate until 1999. That was 17 years ago. Since then, things have not gone well. Formal negotiations did not begin for a further six years, and when they did they rapidly got bogged down \u2013 which is how matters broadly stand now. </p> <p>Aspiring members must adopt existing EU rules and standards. They do so in stages, a process that involves agreeing separately to each of 35 chapters. After nearly 30 years, only one negotiating chapter has been agreed with Turkey. Fifteen are, in theory, open for discussion, while talks about the remainder \u2013 the most difficult bits, such as freedom of movement \u2013 have not even begun.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2016/may/20/staying-in-eu-migration-influx-scottish-population-reality-check\">Will staying in EU really lead to an influx equal to Scottish population?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The main reason why matters have proceeded so slowly is that the EU\u2019s big beasts, France and Germany, do not want Turkey to join. Hardly anything happens in the EU without the agreement of these two founding members. Nicolas Sarkozy, the former French president and now tipped to return to the \u00c9lys\u00e9e next spring, was first to put the boot in, and others followed. Almost the first thing Sarkozy did after he was elected in 2007 was <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/25/world/europe/25iht-union.5.6325879.html?_r=0\">block talks with Turkey</a> on the key area of economic and monetary policy.</p> <p>Sarkozy argued that Turkey was geographically not part of Europe and had no place in the EU. Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, Sarkozy\u2019s successor, is similarly unsympathetic. More importantly, perhaps, Angela Merkel, Germany\u2019s long-serving chancellor, also opposes Turkish membership. She repeated this view in a <a href=\"https://euobserver.com/enlargement/130735\">television interview</a> in October last year. \u201cErdo\u011fan knows this,\u201d she said, referring to the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan.</p> <p>Merkel has used the carrot of accelerated negotiations to facilitate a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/18/refugees-will-be-sent-back-across-aegean-in-eu-turkey-deal\">deal with Turkey on returning Syrian migrants</a>. But her basic position, backed by large cross-party majorities in Germany, is that Turkey should not be granted full membership. So, in short, even if David Cameron\u2019s government enthusiastically advocated swift Turkish accession, which it does not, it would certainly be blocked, for the foreseeable future, by the EU\u2019s two most powerful states, backed by other influential members such as Poland. </p> <p>And even if, despite all this, Turkey were somehow allowed in, the EU\u2019s freedom of movement rules would almost certainly not apply in the first instance. Like Romania and Bulgaria after they joined in 2007, Turkish workers would not be allowed simply to move en masse to the UK or other EU states. Britain\u2019s non-membership of the Schengen area creates another specific barrier in this respect.</p> <p>Similar obstacles face other current EU applicants \u2013 Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania. Apart from specific concerns about immigration and jobs, the EU is suffering what is known as \u201cenlargement fatigue\u201d.</p> <p>Many European politicians feel 28 member states is more than enough. New members are not welcome from any quarter \u2013 and all 28 national parliaments have a right of veto. This reluctance, incidentally, would affect any future membership bid by an independent Scotland.</p> <p>Turkey\u2019s leaders know all this only too well, as does the Turkish public \u2013 even if Gove and the Brexiters do not. Support for EU membership has dropped in Turkey in recent years, part of a backlash against perceived discriminatory treatment by what Erdo\u011fan calls a \u201cChristian club\u201d.</p> <p>Turkey under Erdo\u011fan has turned eastwards, away from Europe, looking to wield influence in the lands of the old Ottoman empire. It has cultivated closer ties with Middle Eastern powers such as Saudi Arabia.</p> <p>Stung by European criticism of human rights abuses and a crackdown on press freedom, Erdo\u011fan has sometimes given the impression that he would like to scrap the EU talks altogether.</p> <p>Sunday\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-36352526\">appointment of a party loyalist</a>, Binali Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m, as prime minister, who is expected to follow the president\u2019s line in all main policy areas, means Erdo\u011fan\u2019s Europhobia may develop unchecked and become more extreme.</p> <p>Vote Leave\u2019s argument that millions of Turks would move to the UK if they could is borderline fantasy for other reasons. Although Turkey\u2019s economy has faltered of late, its record of expansive GDP growth since the 1990s is impressive. Living standards have risen for most Turks amid rapid urbanisation. </p> <p>In other words, Britain is a less attractive destination for Turkish economic migrants than it might think. Against this backdrop, Gove\u2019s claim that more than 5 million people \u2013 exceeding the population of Scotland \u2013 could move to the UK from the EU by 2030 reveals a surprising ignorance of European realities. Truth be told, it\u2019s a load of old kebab. </p>",

      "body": "<p>A council <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/31/lambeth-library-plans-london-budget-cuts-close\">that temporarily closed two libraries</a> just before the exam revision season as a supposed money-saving measure has spent up to three times as much per day on private guards to secure the buildings as it would have cost to keep them open, it has emerged.</p> <p>Details of the security costs at the libraries, run by Lambeth council in south London, were given to the Guardian following a freedom of information request. </p> <p>The money spent on guards at one of the libraries was inflated as it was <a href=\"http://www.brixtonbuzz.com/2016/04/photos-carnegie-library-campaigners-march-to-brixton-windrush-square/\">occupied for 10 days by local people</a> protesting at the temporary closure plans. However, the figures show that even at another library not similarly targeted, the money paid for private security was almost twice the usual running costs.</p> <p>The two sites \u2013 the Carnegie library in Herne Hill, south-east London, and the Minet library nearby \u2013 closed their doors on 31 March before planned works to turn each one into a \u201ccommunity hub\u201d, a combination of a largely unstaffed library and a private gym. The Labour-run council said this was the only option to keep both libraries open amid massive central government cuts to local authority budgets.</p> <p>When the libraries were closed no work was scheduled to begin for months. Opponents of the plans questioned why the sites could not remain open for longer, allowing students to use them for revision for summer exams. At the time the Lambeth cabinet member whose brief covers libraries, Jane Edbrooke, said this was impossible because the council needed to save money before the start of the new financial year.</p> <p>The freedom of information response shows that from 31 March, when the libraries closed, until 15 April, when the request was made, Lambeth spent \u00a335,392.68 on guards to secure both sites, a fraction over \u00a32,212 a day. In contrast, the council\u2019s 2014-15 budget gives a combined running cost for both of \u00a3874 a day. This excludes spending on books and computer services, but those are paid for centrally for all of Lambeth\u2019s 10 libraries, and the council has said it has no plans to cut them.</p> <p>Of the security costs, just under \u00a325,000 was spent at the Carnegie, a figure made bigger by the occupation by several dozen local residents, which lasted from 31 March to 9 April. But even when this was over, the average daily security cost at the library was \u00a31,382, nearly three times the daily running costs.</p> <p>At the Minet library, which was not occupied, security costs averaged \u00a3677 a day over the 16-day period, almost double the \u00a3386 daily running costs.</p> <p>The Guardian contacted Lambeth council on Friday morning to seek its reaction, and to ask about current security costs at the libraries. The council has yet to provide its promised response.</p> <p>Laura Swaffield, chair of the Friends of Lambeth Libraries, which opposes the library-gym hybrid model, said the group had long predicted the early closure would not save any money.</p> <p>\u201cIt has been apparent from the very start that wrecking the library service would cost more than preserving it,\u201d she said. \u201cNow all the flaws in their plan are showing up, the council is panicking. It seems prepared to spend any amount of money trying to make this turkey fly.\u201d</p> <p>Under the plans, sections of both libraries are being handed to the social enterprise Greenwich Leisure Limited so they can be turned into private gyms. The council is promising that both libraries will reopen in early 2017, but building work has yet to begin at either.</p> <p>The occupation of the Carnegie won the <a href=\"http://www.thebookseller.com/news/rosen-mitchell-and-smith-back-carnegie-protestors-326046\">support of 220 writers and illustrators</a>, among them Stella Duffy and Toby Litt, who organised an open letter, David Mitchell, David Nicholls, Francesca Simon, Sandi Toksvig, Ian Rankin, Will Self and Val McDermid.</p>",

      "body": "<h2><strong>1)</strong> Five-star Anderson shows no sign of stopping</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/21/england-alastair-cook-sri-lnaka-jimmy-anderson-headingley\">Alastair Cook hails Jimmy Anderson and Jonny Bairstow as England bury demons</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Jimmy Anderson, a couple of months from his 34th birthday, looks fitter and hungrier than ever. Recognition that the end is not so far away can spur a sportsman to even greater effort. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/21/england-sri-lanka-first-test\" title=\"\">He now has 443 Test wickets</a> \u2013 he glided past Kapil Dev at Headingley \u2013 and he is sixth on the all-time list. However, there is a lot of hard yakka to be done to reach the top five. Courtney Walsh is in the middle distance and barely visible with 519. Meanwhile, behind Anderson, the other member of England\u2019s latest old firm, Stuart Broad, has 338. They help one another wonderfully and share each other\u2019s triumphs but they can still compete. Anderson averages 28.62, Broad 28.47. Both will be eager to grab the captain\u2019s eye when the Sri Lanka tailenders come into view in this series.</p> <h2><strong>2)</strong> Sri Lanka\u2019s reptilian tail</h2> <p>The Sri Lanka tail may be as long as a crocodile\u2019s but it is nowhere near as strong. It rivals some of England\u2019s worst, though the Caddick, Mullally, Tufnell, Giddins combination of <a href=\"http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63844.html\" title=\"\">the Oval Test against New Zealand in 1999</a> takes some beating. It is not a good sign when the 38-year-old Rangana Herath, albeit the pluckiest of cricketers, potters out at No8. At Headingley, Sri Lanka\u2019s last five batsmen mustered 14 runs in their 10 innings. The conditions were undoubtedly hostile; Dasun Shanaka was making his debut and by all accounts has great potential at No7 but the rest are unlikely to score runs even on a good day for batting. Hence the pressure mounts on a callow top order.</p> <h2>3)<strong> </strong>Bairstow the big difference but others less secure</h2> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>While Sri Lanka had Shanaka at No7, England had Jonny Bairstow. But England\u2019s batting lineup is not set in cement. There were no runs from Nick Compton and nine from James Vince on his debut (plus a couple of dropped catches). It would be callous to draw conclusions from one innings but slowly the pressure mounts. Compton surely needs runs by the end of the Sri Lanka series (and there may not be two innings per game) to be sure of his place; Vince may have a little longer. Alex Hales can feel more secure. His 86 grew in significance as the match progressed and batting became ever more tricky.</p> <h2><strong>4) </strong>No big green monster</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/may/21/england-v-sri-lanka-first-test-day-three-live\">England beat Sri Lanka by innings and 88 runs in the first Test \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Headingley pitch would have had county bowlers salivating. The new toss regulations have meant that there has been a dearth of green grass this summer in the County Championship. Better pitches? Not necessarily. Blander ones? Most certainly. Despite the scorecard, this surface was not one of those Headingley monsters of the 90s. However, the clouds rolled over and those wine-dark Dukes \u2013 England seem to have procured a box of balls that delivered the Duke Ellington philosophy \u201cIt don\u2019t mean a thing if it ain\u2019t got swing\u201d \u2013 were at their most mischievous in Anderson\u2019s delicate fingers. It was a good cricket pitch. But the batsmen could not cope without sunshine.</p> <h2>5)<strong> </strong>Roll up, roll up \u2026 for a one-sided Test with no Stokes</h2> <p>The Headingley Test has not done strapped-for-cash Durham CCC many favours. Ticket sales have been modest: 26,000 sold for a five-day match is a disappointment. The match at Leeds was never dull but the outcome was decided once Sri Lanka failed to avoid the follow-on. An Angelo Mathews century at Chester-le-Street or maybe one from Kusal Mendis, impressively impish in the second innings, might enhance the contest and get the locals walking up. So might a bit of sunshine. The bookies now have England at odds-on to win all three games. To cap it all, Ben Stokes, poster boy not just in the north but all around the nation, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/21/ben-stokes-england-test-sri-lanka\" title=\"\">collected a knee injury</a> which jeopardises his chances of playing on his home ground. It\u2019s a bit late to recall Paul Collingwood now.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-23T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Last week, a man in California streamed the birth of his son on Facebook, allowing hundreds of thousands of viewers around the world to watch the very first moments of a human\u2019s life in real time.</p> <p>The broadcast made a prediction from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg just a month earlier - that \u201cin a decade, video will look like as big of a shift in the way we all share and communicate as mobile has been\u201d - look distinctly conservative.</p> <p>That shift towards video is receiving its biggest push from Facebook, which is aggressively promoting its streaming platform called, imaginatively, Facebook Live. But it is not alone: Twitter recently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/05/twitter-stream-nfl-thursday-night-football\" title=\"\">bought live video streaming rights</a> for Thursday night NFL games (after going up against Facebook), while the company\u2019s Periscope (which has just hired former CNET and Wired journalist Evan Hansen as its first editor in chief) and Meerkat kicked off the live video streaming trend via mobile in early 2015.</p> <p>Generally, in fact, video is hot for social media companies in 2016 as online consumption moves to mobile. Snapchat users are now watching 10bn videos a day, according to Bloomberg, Instagram announced plans in March to allow users to post longer videos (up to 60 seconds), while Vine has helped to make stars out of the likes of King Bach and Brittany Furlan.</p> <p>\u201cMobile video is the format that works best [for social media],\u201d says Matti Littunen, research analyst at Enders Analysis. \u201cIt is engaging, immersive and gets shared a lot. By extension that makes it valuable.\u201d Now this video gold rush is starting to move the media world, which has scented an opportunity to make money and engage their audiences in new ways.</p> <p>\u201cWhen \u2018the web\u2019 first got into TV it was all about, \u2018How do we get people back to TV?\u2019\u201d says Steve Noviello, a journalist for Fox4 in Dallas whose \u201cMermaid Pillow\u201d video was a huge viral success. \u201cThat ideology has since changed. Now it\u2019s all about understanding where people go to look for information and being there waiting when they arrive.\u201d</p> <p>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o-Sz8dDwIY\" title=\"\">Mermaid Pillow</a>\u201d, in which Noviello showed viewers a colour-changing pillow range discovered in a furniture store, was an early hit on Facebook Live. Initially only available to celebrity and media users, the company opened up Live to most users in January and it is now key to its expansion into video.</p> <p>Live has already found a receptive audience among publishers: the Live homepage includes videos (which remain archived after transmission) from the likes of BuzzFeed and Al Jazeera\u2019s AJ+. But Facebook is ramping this up considerably by paying certain media companies a fee (around $250,000 for 20 posts per month over a three-month period according to BuzzFeed) to post videos to Live. BuzzFeed is one of these media partners, with the New York Times, the Huffington Post, Gawker Media, Vox Media and Sky reported to be among the others.</p> <p>The appeal of video for Facebook is simple: Zuckerberg revealed in the company\u2019s first quarter 2016 earnings call that the average Facebook user already spends more than 50 minutes a day using Facebook, Instagram and Messenger. But video can boost engagement even further and that plays well with advertisers. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing that people love engaging with live video,\u201d a Facebook spokesperson says. \u201cFrom initial data, we\u2019ve seen that people comment more than 10 times more on Facebook Live videos than on regular videos.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s not to say there isn\u2019t a downside to this technology: the recent case of a US teenager accused of using Periscope to live stream her friend\u2019s alleged rape shows the difficulties of opening up live video streaming for public use. That the new father in California, Kali Kanongata\u2019a, <a href=\"http://www.people.com/article/facebook-live-birth-dad-who-streamed-sons-entire-birth-didnt-know-he-shared-with-world\" title=\"\">has since said</a> he didn\u2019t realise the video could be seen around the world also raises questions about what responsibility both Facebook and the media outlets that promoted the stream have towards the person filming and those in the video.</p> <p>But for media companies, working with the new live video platforms also creates dilemmas around control, and in the case of Facebook Live, handing even more of it to Facebook. \u201cThere is a danger for publishers if they lose some control over how they monetise their content,\u201d says Littunen. \u201cIn many cases there is nothing to stop Facebook from re-setting any revenue sharing agreement they may have or of tweaking their algorithm to promote different content.\u201d</p> <p>For media companies \u2013 like BuzzFeed \u2013 which specialise in sponsored content, where total video views count wherever they come from, this is not such a problem. And some Live videos are already enjoying the kind of audiences that may prove hard to resist, thanks to Facebook\u2019s 1.65 billion active users.</p> <p>BuzzFeed has said that a Live video <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeed.com/tasneemnashrulla/we-blew-up-a-watermelon-and-everyone-lost-their-freaking-min?utm_term=.tbr0o1kbDR#.ueM43ZJ5pA\" title=\"\">in which it blew up a watermelon </a>attracted 800,000 live viewers (although viewers may have only watched for a short time)while Sky UK is using Live across news and sports, with around 100,000 people watching Mark Stone\u2019s live report on the migrant crisis in Calais.</p> <p>Andy Dangerfield, BuzzFeed UK news social media editor, says interactivity is key to Live\u2019s appeal. \u201cYou can reach out to your audience and ask them questions,\u201d he explains. \u201cOr you can ask for direction as well. We were live in a square in Brussels after the attacks there and the audience was asking questions about what was happening.\u201d</p> <p>Live videos can also attract huge audiences when archived: around 1,000 people watched the \u201cMermaid Pillow\u201d live stream but its real success came later when the clip went viral. The video has now passed 35m total views, while Noviello\u2019s following on social media doubled in a week.</p> <p>But making compelling video content is not easy. The question now is whether media companies will be able to follow Noviello\u2019s viral success with Facebook Live \u2013 and even make some money with it \u2013 or whether \u201cpremium content\u201d such as live NFL proves more of a pull to social audiences. A great deal of money and effort could depend on it.</p> <p>And then there are the ethical challenges presented by such an immediate and quick way to broadcast. Noviello says it\u2019s important to avoid thinking \u201cthat because this is a more casual format, the same rules don\u2019t apply\u201d as on TV. Dangerfield says the same, adding that it is crucial to avoid endangering either reporters or anyone else in breaking news situations, and guard against \u201cunplanned events that could be viewed as inappropriate or offensive \u2026 The key is to think before pressing the live button.\u201d</p>",

And although Bond\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/feb/24/bingo-review\">Bingo</a> is probably the best biographical play about Shakespeare, it failed to feature in the epic death quadricentennial commemorations by the Royal Shakespeare Company and the BBC.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2016/may/13/torture-baby-stonings-why-we-need-shock-theatre\">Torture and baby-stonings: why we need shock theatre ... in small doses</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So is Bond bitter about his treatment by British theatre? \u201cNo!\u201d he insists. \u201cI\u2019m far too busy.\u201d</p> <p>In Rome, there is a new production of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2005/mar/17/theatre1\">Lear</a>, his 1971 variation on Shakespeare, and another work from the same period, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/jan/24/theatre2\">The Sea</a> \u2013 a weird comedy of beachside goings-on \u2013 has become a hit at the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise in Paris. Currently, Bond is working with the composer <a href=\"http://www.laurajbowler.co.uk/\">Laura Jayne Bowler</a> on an opera based on his play <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2006/sep/09/theatre.stage\">Early Morning</a><em> \u2013 </em>censored<em> </em>in 1968 for depicting Queen Victoria as a cannibal lesbian in love with Florence Nightingale \u2013 and is directing <a href=\"http://suttontheatres.co.uk/\">Dea at the Secombe theatre</a> in Sutton, his first play (apart from pieces for teenagers) to be premiered in the UK for two decades.</p> <p>There might be some surprise at this work turning up in a suburban theatre named after the comedian and religious broadcaster Sir Harry Secombe, but Bond claims not to be craving the facilities of his earlier patrons, the National Theatre, the RSC and the Royal Court. \u201cIf they did one of my plays, it would be rubbish,\u201d he says. Why? \u201cBecause they wouldn\u2019t understand it.\u201d The problem with British theatre, says Bond, is that \u201cat the moment, we don\u2019t have any drama. That\u2019s really frightening. It\u2019s all been taken over by the Hollywood entertainment industry.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6d3bc0791009b02c927fcd877b2a8fd80c92777\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6d3bc0791009b02c927fcd877b2a8fd80c92777/0_0_1600_1115/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Early Morning at the Royal Court in 1968\" width=\"1000\" height=\"697\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Marianne Faithfull and Moira Redmond in Bond\u2019s Early Morning at the Royal Court in 1968</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But wouldn\u2019t the NT, RSC, Royal Court and West End say that we do have quite a lot of drama? \u201cNo. Not for one second.

That was an obscenity. Black Beauty goes to war. What is wrong with our society? That is obscene! And it goes around the world.\u201d Why is it obscene? \u201cWar makes bodies. It\u2019s hard on the horses, of course. But it\u2019s harder on human beings.\u201d</p> <p>Apart from his open contempt for its repertoire, British theatre may also be put off by Bond\u2019s reputation as a testing collaborator. After some of the anecdotes that circulate \u2013 more Blofeld than Bond \u2013 it\u2019s a surprise not to find him sinisterly stroking a white cat as he sits in the Secombe\u2019s bar.</p> <p>\u201cLook,\u201d he politely protests, \u201cI have this reputation of getting very angry in rehearsals. I promise you that I never ever do, really. What I may do, when a director is working on one of my plays, is say: \u2018But that doesn\u2019t make any sense!\u2019 And then it\u2019s the director who gets very, very angry.\u201d</p> <p>Bond admits to having walked out of two London revivals of The Sea because \u201cthey were so boring. It\u2019s supposed to be a funny play. So I got in my car and went.\u201d The director of one spurned interpretation pursued Bond up the A1 to his home in Cambridge, in a sort of dramaturgical car chase, but the playwright refused to return.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f9038f30e980bb61dafbd3114e4156a70e0bd192\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f9038f30e980bb61dafbd3114e4156a70e0bd192/0_161_8688_5213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Edward Bond, centre, with actors Edward Avison-Scott and Helen Bang at rehearsals for Dea.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Drama has to push things to extremes\u2019 \u2026 Bond, centre, with Edward Avison-Scott and Helen Bang at rehearsals for Dea.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There can be no such disagreement at Sutton, because Bond himself is directing Dea. The play is named after a central character who shares three of the letters and much of the biography of <a href=\"http://www.britannica.com/topic/Medea-Greek-mythology\">Medea</a> \u2013 who, in the Greek tragedy by Euripides, murders her children as an act of revenge against her adulterous husband, Jason.</p> <p>Bond\u2019s version deals more directly than the original with the pursuit of power \u2013 \u201cThe play is very concerned with political ambitions. Jason wants to get to No 10\u201d \u2013 but he is also keen that audiences should not be able to dismiss the infanticide as something that happened once in ancient Greece.</p> <p>\u201cPeople see Medea as shocking because a woman kills her children. But we\u2019re quite happy to send our children off to war,\u201d he argues. \u201cAnd a child is killed in a home once a week in England. I think I read that, but can that be really be right?\u201d (I checked later. The most recent figures from the government\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/444788/SFR23-2015.pdf\">Child Death Oversight Panel attributed 60 fatalities</a> a year to \u201cdeliberate harm, abuse or neglect\u201d.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"90a58effd29728391b206c876408a7f1ecd31b2a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/90a58effd29728391b206c876408a7f1ecd31b2a/0_0_3251_1951/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The infamous stoning scene in Saved, at the Royal Court in 1969.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The stoning scene in Saved at the Royal Court in 1969.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Donald Cooper/Photostage</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Five decades after the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/oct/09/edward-bond-saved-original-cast\">simulated stoning to death of a baby in a pram</a> caused scandalised reaction at the Royal Court, Sutton may also be in for some fuss. Apart from the Euripidean child-killing, Dea includes two brutal rape scenes, one of them necrophiliac, and a mother giving fellatio to her son.</p> <p>Bond, though, is shocked at the suggestion that he sets out to challenge or appalaudiences. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t occur to me for one moment as I write that a scene is shocking. I\u2019m just pursuing the logic of a situation \u2013 only ever that. I think drama has to push things to extremes so that we can understand what we are doing in our society.\u201d</p> <p>Scenes in Greek tragedies that were once regarded as unimaginable now seem increasingly recognisable to our era, Bond feels. He thinks that Antigone by Sophocles \u201cwas the key play for the last century. Because it\u2019s all to do with dictators and obedience to orders. But our play for this century is Medea. It involves much more profound questions for us: what does it mean to be human and how do we build a society?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"57855470ca4d5f08951193ef71c8308c38224462\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/57855470ca4d5f08951193ef71c8308c38224462/0_47_2835_1701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Spitefully patronising\u2019 \u2026 Bond on Downtown Abbey.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Spitefully patronising\u2019 \u2026 Bond on Downtown Abbey.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Briggs/ITV Plc</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some people believe that the best drama is now on TV.

These titles seem to spark no recognition, although he then unexpectedly offers: \u201cI\u2019ve watched <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/downton-abbey\">Downton Abbey</a>. I watched one and was so fascinated that I had to watch another.\u201d What drew him back? \u201cTo be exact: it was spitefully patronising, and I found that fascinating. No, I don\u2019t think TV is the place for drama. If you were really writing about the times we live in, they wouldn\u2019t put it on television.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/arts/gallery/2008/jan/21/edwardbond\">Best of Bond</a> </p> </aside>  <p>If the writer\u2019s views on War Horse and Downton Abbey are what might be expected from a theatrical radical, his attitude on one issue is surprising. Asked about his personal ideology, Bond replies: \u201cI regard myself as a socialist. I have always voted for Labour.\u201d Including three times for Tony Blair? \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d So Bond, a lifelong pacifist, voted for Blair, even after the Iraq war? \u201cYes. I don\u2019t think we understand the Iraq war yet. Harold Pinter thought Blair should be tried as a war criminal. Whatever the situation is in the Middle East now, it was an inevitable crisis then. The real war criminals were probably in the 18th and 19th century, colonists taking over these places. To blame Blair for everything that happened is not to understand the seriousness of politics.\u201d</p> <p>After Sutton, Dea will be seen in France, where Bond is as hymned as he is ignored in Britain, and he is already working on a play that addresses what he feels to be \u201cunanswered questions\u201d in Shakespeare\u2019s tragedies. He expects it to be savagely satirical. Returning to rehearsal, he says: \u201cOur society is so absurd that I sometimes feel I haven\u2019t got enough legs to be pulled.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"http://suttontheatres.co.uk/events/edward-bonds-dea-world-premiere/\">Dea</a> is at the Secombe theatre from 24 May until 11 June.</p>",

      "body": "<p>To be remembered principally for playing straight man to a talking horse may not seem the greatest of show-business legacies, but it was one that Alan Young, who has died aged 96, was very happy to live with. For five years, between 1961 and 1966, Young starred in the extremely popular television sitcom Mister Ed opposite the titular horse. Part of the jaunty opening jingle ran: \u201cA horse is a horse, of course, of course / And no one can talk to a horse of course / That is, of course, unless the horse is the famous Mister Ed.\u201d</p> <p>The programme\u2019s unvarying format was established in the first episode, in which an absent-minded architect, Wilbur Post (Young), and his wife, Carol (<a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2009/dec/22/local/la-me-connie-hines22-2009dec22\" title=\"\">Connie Hines</a>), buy a home in the country. The previous tenants have left their horse behind. Carol wants to get rid of it, but Wilbur is delighted. Alone with the horse, he wistfully recalls how, as a young boy, he had longed for a pony. \u201cAh,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it\u2019s been a long time since I was a boy.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time since I was a pony,\u201d says the horse.</p> <p>Mister Ed, the horse, refuses to talk to anyone but Wilbur, which results in endless gags of the \u201cWilbur, who are you talking to?\u201d variety. However, the deft comic timing and charm of the two principals, Young and the horse (Bamboo Harvester, voiced in a deep, caustic manner by Allan \u201cRocky\u201d Lane), and some witty lines, made the show immensely enjoyable.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=czsNX9agMxc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/czsNX9agMxc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Mister Ed, season three</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Young had other important confrontations with animals in his career. In Androcles and the Lion (1952), the film version of George Bernard Shaw\u2019s philosophical comedy on religion, he played the gentle Christian fleeing persecution in Rome, who befriends a lion after pulling a painful thorn from its paw. The soft-spoken Young replaced Harpo Marx, who was to have played it in mime, but was fired by the producer, Howard Hughes, after a few weeks shooting.</p> <p>In 1983, Young became the voice of the Walt Disney cartoon character Scrooge McDuck in <a href=\"http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xmq7ql_1983-mickey-s-christmas-carol_shortfilms\" title=\"\">Mickey\u2019s Christmas Carol</a>, and continued to voice Donald Duck\u2019s miserly billionaire uncle in the television series DuckTales from 1987, and dozens more of the incarnations of \u201cthe richest duck in the world\u201d, using a broad Scottish accent.</p> <p>This came easily to him because he was the son of a Scots mine worker and English mother. He was born Angus Young in North Shields, Tyne and Wear, but the family moved to Edinburgh when Young was a baby, and then to Canada about six years later. As a boy, he suffered from severe asthma, which kept him bedridden for long periods of time but encouraged his love of radio. By the age of 13, he had become a radio performer, and at 17, he was writing and performing in his own radio show for the <a href=\"http://www.cbc.radio-canada.ca/en/explore/our-history/\" title=\"\">Canadian Broadcasting Corporation</a>, before serving in the Canadian navy during the second world war.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa27954c733d6219be6b9781bafd5bdf0665795b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa27954c733d6219be6b9781bafd5bdf0665795b/0_354_2700_1619/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alan Young reads from the racing form as the minister at a wedding between Bamboo Harvester and Rosita in the episode Ed the Bridegroom in 1965.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alan Young reads from the racing form as the minister at a wedding between Bamboo Harvester and Rosita in the episode Ed the Bridegroom in 1965.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CBS Photo Archive/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In New York, he broadcast the popular Alan Young Radio Show from 1944 to 1949. In 1950, he moved into television with The Alan Young Show, which ran for three years, earning a couple of Emmy awards. The show was a bland mixture of musical numbers \u2013 Young had a pleasant singing voice \u2013 and comic sketches, which utilised the star\u2019s rather wimpish, daydreaming persona, carried over into the films he made.</p> <p>He began his Hollywood career appearing in three delightful divertissements at 20th Century Fox, starting with Margie (1946), in which he played the nerdy teenage boyfriend of a schoolgirl (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/dec/16/guardianobituaries2\" title=\"\">Jeanne Crain</a>). Young, who was 27 at the time, continued to play characters much younger than himself, something his fair, clean-cut boyish features enabled him to do.</p> <p>Two years later, he was a snobbish student in Mr Belvedere Goes to College and, in the charming period piece Chicken Every Sunday, he played an asthmatic bachelor courting the pretty daughter of Dan Dailey and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jul/15/celeste-holm\" title=\"\">Celeste Holm</a>. He then got top billing for the first time at Paramount in the musical <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUcxPONRDyM\" title=\"\">Aaron Slick from Punkin Crick</a> (1952), in which he played a shy country bumpkin, who outwits some city slickers, opposite <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-dinah-shore-1426256.html\" title=\"\">Dinah Shore</a> as a farm girl. Another musical was the lame Gentlemen Marry Brunettes (1955), where he was an odd-job man who on marrying a showgirl (Crain) turns out to be a millionaire.</p> <p>George Pal, the Hungarian animator and special effects expert cast, Young in the first two of the five films he directed, Tom Thumb (1958) and The Time Machine (1960). In the former, Young was the rather soppy romantic lead, but the latter provided him with his favourite film role. Young, with a Scottish accent, played David Filby, best friend to the Victorian scientist George Wells (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jan/09/rod-taylor\" title=\"\">Rod Taylor</a>), who tries to dissuade him from moving through the fourth dimension. The 40-year-old Young also appeared as the 18-year-old son of David Filby.</p> <p>After Mister Ed finished its run, Young headed the film and broadcasting unit of the Christian Science church, of which he was a member.

The England tour party heading for Australia certainly falls into that category, containing as it does a couple of totally fresh names and more than one notable omission. This is a group picked less on reputation than a potential willingness to get up Wallaby noses.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/21/eddie-jones-england-kyle-sinckler-rugby-union-tour-australia-harlequins\">Eddie Jones singles out Kyle Sinckler for England tour to Australia</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The strong streak of feisty aggression running through the marbled heart of Jones\u2019s selections includes the lively uncapped Northampton back-row forward Teimana Harrison as well as Ellis Genge, who is 21, and Kyle Sinckler, both young props in whom Jones sees the belligerent edge he loves in his Test forwards. It is the same with Ben Te\u2019o, the latest rugby league \u00e9migr\u00e9 to try his luck at the top level of the 15-a-side code.</p> <p>The inclusion of the Harlequins winger Marland Yarde is also based largely upon what he might be capable of doing rather than any recent compelling evidence. It will be a heavy blow to the unfortunate Chris Ashton, currently the form winger in the country, while Kieran Brookes, Matt Kvesic, Danny Cipriani and Dave Attwood have also been deemed surplus to tour requirements.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/21/saracens-leicester-premiership-play-off\">Saturday\u2019s hamstring injury to Manu Tuilagi</a> may yet grant a reprieve for Luther Burrell unless the Leicester centre makes a miracle recovery but, otherwise, Jones has made it very clear where he stands on a number of individuals. Unlike previous England coaches he positively delights in throwing an entire cattery among the pigeons whenever the opportunity arises.</p> <p>No matter that Ashton has been performing splendidly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/14/saracens-racing-92-european-rugby-champions-cup-final-match-report\">for the European champions</a> while Yarde has been toiling with Harlequins; in the back of Jones\u2019s mind is the try <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jun/21/new-zealand-england-third-test-match-report\">the latter scored past New Zealand\u2019s</a> Richie McCaw on tour in New Zealand two years ago. \u201cMarland has got a lot of growth in him. He wants to portray a gangster image but I think he can do things in our team that will really add to us,\u201d Jones said. \u201cI showed the players a photo of the team meeting before the Wales triple crown game in 2014. We had about eight players circled in red who are no longer part of the England setup. Why? They haven\u2019t worked hard enough to improve their game.\u201d</p> <p>Ashton, consequently, has been told to tighten his defence even more if he wishes to resume a Test career he had hoped might shortly be resurrected. \u201cAshton is unlucky. He\u2019s a great finisher, but I want a bit more than that \u2026 in my eyes he\u2019s not in the top three wings in England.\u201d</p> <p>There was a similar blunt message for Brookes, who shared <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/13/england-win-six-nations-scotland-france\">in his country\u2019s Six Nations grand slam triumph</a> only two months ago. \u201cWith front-rowers you need guys who want to put their body on the line,\u201d he said, clearly hopeful the no-nonsense Genge, on loan with Leicester from Bristol, fits that category. \u201cRichard Cockerill says he\u2019s a bit of a lad but he\u2019s a guy who wants to improve. He\u2019s a bit like Sinckler. Both of them had difficult backgrounds and now have a fantastic opportunity to make their mark in the world through rugby.\u201d</p> <p>The 29-year-old Te\u2019o is a slightly different case, having already made his mark in league with South Sydney and represented Samoa in the 13-man code. The shadow of Sam Burgess inevitably hangs over his rapid rise from Leinster\u2019s midfield to England\u2019s squad \u2013 he is eligible through an English mother and his imminent move to Worcester \u2013 but Tuilagi\u2019s probable withdrawal leaves him close to a Test debut in the first Test in Brisbane on 11 June. \u201cFrom what I\u2019ve seen of him playing for Leinster he could be a very valuable player for us,\u201d Jones said. \u201cHe can play through the line, he can play before the line and he\u2019s a great hitter.\u201d</p> <p>Taking a third scrum-half such as Dan Robson might also have been useful and both Kvesic and Will Fraser have reason to be disappointed, but Jones remains adamant that pandering to public opinion is always an error. \u201cOne of the best pieces of advice I ever got was that if you listen to the fans you\u2019ll end up in the grandstand with them.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/apr/14/eddie-jones-england-australia-tour\">Eddie Jones has little leeway for England changes on Australia tour | Dean Ryan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nor is he impressed by the argument his players will be tired. \u201cThe average number of games our EPS players have played is 20 games. If anyone is going to sit there and tell me 20 games of rugby is too much then it\u2019s not a serious argument.\u201d</p> <p>He also has his sights set on upsetting Wales at Twickenham on Sunday. \u201cWe have the chance to beat them again. There is nothing better than that. Wales have got an enormous amount of pressure on them \u2026 they go into the game as red-hot favourites.\u201d</p> <p>As with his selections, Jones rarely resists the temptation to give the pot a vigorous stir.</p> <h2>England\u2019s 32-man squad for three-Test tour of Australia</h2> <p><strong>Backs</strong> Brown (Harlequins), Goode (Saracens), Nowell (Exeter Chiefs), Watson (Bath), Yarde (Harlequins), Daly (Wasps), Joseph (Bath), Slade (Exeter), Tuilagi (Leicester Tigers), Te\u2019o (Leinster), Farrell (Saracens), Ford (Bath), Care (Harlequins), B Youngs (Leicester).</p> <p><strong>Forwards</strong> Cowan-Dickie (Exeter Chiefs), George (Saracens), Hartley (Northampton, capt), Cole (Leicester), Genge (Leicester), Hill (Northampton), Mullan (Wasps), Sinckler (Harlequins), M Vunipola (Saracens), Itoje (Saracens), Kruis (Saracens), Launchbury (Wasps), Lawes (Northampton Saints), Harrison (Northampton), Haskell (Wasps), Robshaw (Harlequins), Clifford (Harlequins), B Vunipola (Saracens).</p> <p><strong>Also named in training squad for Sunday\u2019s Test v Wales</strong> Attwood (Bath), Burrell (Northampton), Devoto (Bath), Kvesic (Gloucester), Taylor (Sale).</p> <h2><br /></h2> <h2><br /></h2> <h2><br /></h2> <h2><br /></h2>",

      "body": "<p>This is a perfect novel about life\u2019s imperfection. Gustav is a mother\u2019s boy growing up during the second world war in Switzerland. He has had to learn to have a stiff upper lip. Yet neutrality, in Rose Tremain\u2019s hands, is never neutral. Gustav\u2019s late father, Erich, a policeman, knows what is expected of him but cannot subdue his feelings. It is his distinction and downfall: he helps Jewish refugees into the country when they are no longer legally welcome, is discovered and sacked from his post. He dies when Gustav is still a child. Gustav\u2019s mother, Emilie, refers to her late husband as a \u201chero\u201d but cannot forgive him for showing the moral courage that wrecked her family\u2019s fortunes. Emilie\u2019s indifference to the plight of the Jews extends to an ignorance about how ignorant she is. She is self-pitying, discouraged and discouraging (especially of Gustav\u2019s friendship with his classmate, Anton, a precocious Jewish pianist from a wealthy family).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/nov/02/rose-tremain-fear-teaching-not-being-able-to-write\">Rose Tremain: \u2018The fear, when I was teaching, was that I would wind up not being able to write anything\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>At every turn, Tremain knows when and how to let us read between the lines and see beneath the Swiss surfaces. What Gustav is not permitted to express or fully admit to himself, we feel for him. The narrative skill and subtlety are exemplary. Tremain does not judge \u2013 so we, inevitably, do: Emilie has not earned her son\u2019s unfailing love. And yet, at the same time, we see that everything that happens is beyond blame; it could hardly have been otherwise.</p> <p>What Rose Tremain understands, above all, is the tragedy of temperament and the way it plays havoc with choice. Emilie won her handsome husband by boldly asking him to kiss her at a local fete to stop him paying attention to her prettier friend \u2013 a snog that became a marriage. It was a chance encounter, a random swipe, an unlucky dip. And the marriage could not hope to prosper because Emilie was not born with the temperament to rally in adversity, the stoicism to rise above circumstances, nor is her intelligence equal to her husband\u2019s.</p> <p>Erich\u2019s saturated unhappiness seems unavoidable. The \u201csonata\u201d title is apt, too, in that, like the great classical composers, Tremain shows happiness and sorrow can collide \u2013 there are moments when the two are interchangeable. When Emilie and Erich go to Davos, in an attempt to repair their marriage and take to the dancefloor together, Emilie thinks: \u201cIf we could just go on like this, in this slow, formal dance, go on and on like this, without the need to speak, without the need to pause, then in the end \u2013 if an end had to come \u2013 all might be well.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bdd1bb7433777aa17d740bb179f5d79b1046cb0b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bdd1bb7433777aa17d740bb179f5d79b1046cb0b/0_101_2944_1767/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rose Tremain: \u2018writing at the height of her inimitable powers\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rose Tremain: \u2018writing at the height of her inimitable powers\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Kirkham</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The central relationship of the novel is less predictable. It is between Gustav and Anton. Anton is an only child whose parents are ambitious for him to become a concert pianist. He plays like a dream, but international competitions are a torment \u2013 his nerve repeatedly fails him. Anton invites Gustav on holiday to Davos where the two boys discover an abandoned sanatorium with 30 beds and invent their own version of Thomas Mann\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/sep/07/fromthearchives.thomasmann\"><em>The Magic Mountain</em></a>. In the sanatorium, they can speak freely. Anton refers slightingly to his parents having sex and poor, prim Gustav replies wonderingly: \u201cI don\u2019t think my mother\u2019s ever done that. She just goes to bed and reads magazines.\u201d The boys invent 30 imaginary patients and their game includes an ambiguous kiss of life administered by Gustav to Anton, at Anton\u2019s request.</p> <p>When Anton seems \u2013 in middle age \u2013 to be succeeding as a pianist, Gustav finds it hard to celebrate; he knows that success will remove Gustav from his orbit. Tremain is penetrating in describing the way in which one person\u2019s happiness is sometimes another\u2019s discomfiture \u2013 jealousy love\u2019s neighbour. It is a bleak novel and inspires pity for its characters \u2013 that most uncomfortable but nonetheless interesting emotion. But Tremain is anything but an indulgent writer and is, here, writing at the height of her inimitable powers. Without giving away the ending, she has the most merciful, believable and uplifting surprise in store. And what ultimately matters here \u2013 the heart of this remarkable and moving novel \u2013 is Anton\u2019s imperative. He tells Gustav: \u201cWe have to become the people we always should have been.\u201d</p> <p><em>The Gustav Sonata is published by Chatto &amp; Windus (\u00a316.99). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/385242/s/the-gustav-sonata/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\"><em>Click here to order a copy for \u00a312.99</em></a></p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>Hello Natasha! How are you?</strong></p> <p>Very well. I\u2019m just getting ready for a vocal warmup and making adjustments to my new gown.</p> <p><strong>Ah yes, for your new album, The Bride, you\u2019re hosting pop-up weddings as part of the festival shows. How\u2019s that going?</strong></p> <p>It\u2019s good! I\u2019ve already had one, I\u2019ve just got another three to go.</p> <p><strong>How many gowns does it take to get through a Bat For Lashes wedding tour?</strong></p> <p>The dry cleaner\u2019s on speed dial. But there\u2019s a few. I have the beautiful white wedding dress I wore on the album artwork which I made from scratch with a stylist and dressmaker, I\u2019ve got a red one the same as that. They\u2019re beautiful for videos and stuff but because they\u2019re so low cut and short, if you try and do a show in them you\u2019re constantly pulling down your skirt and pulling up your top. So I\u2019ve got a really long blood red dress for the stage, going a bit more widow, which is fun.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/07/natasha-khan-bat-for-lashes-new-album-the-bride\">Bat For Lashes: 'Even in Sex And The City, the single girls end up with someone'</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Cool! Are we all invited to the wedding disco you\u2019re DJing?</strong></p> <p>Yes! I want everyone to dress up as wedding guests at End of the Road. I\u2019m going to drop Chaka Khan and Michael Jackson just as soon as everyone\u2019s at the right end of drunk and happy.</p> <p><strong>Can we talk about Bat For Lashes, the aesthetic? I mean, arguably you\u2019ve influenced festival fashion more than any other pop star in the last decade. The head-dresses, the feathers, the makeup, the jewellery \u2026</strong></p> <p>Well yeah, definitely. I think that\u2019s partly why Coachella felt so strange this year, I didn\u2019t get into it and felt a bit old and past it because I was playing to a bunch of people a lot younger than me that reminded me of my first album. It was weird because something so special, magical, deep and meaningful for me has become so generic and a uniform in a way. It\u2019s partly flattering to see my makeup and the colours I like using everywhere because it means it spoke to the collective conscious or whatever it is. So obviously, that resonated \u2013 people are still enjoying the flower crown and they\u2019re not bored years and years later!</p> <p><strong>But you\u2019ve moved on \u2026</strong></p> <p>Well, it\u2019s not a calculated fashion statement but musically, I hope I keep evolving. It\u2019s music that informs the art and what I\u2019m attracted to and what I wear. It all blends into one. I think there was something very Native American fairy about me in my early 20s and I was a girl then, whereas now as a woman I\u2019m quite into 90s trashy road films like True Romance and Wild At Heart, that Nicholas Cage kind of sexy style.</p> <p><strong>What was your first festival experience like?</strong></p> <p>Oh god, I went to a few as a teenager and in my early twenties, quite obscure ones that I can\u2019t really remember because I was off my face half the time. But I think my very first festival was V with my best friend from school. I think we were 18: a debauched, drunken, teenage mess in love with Damon Albarn.</p> <p><strong>And the worst?</strong></p> <p>Roskilde! I went with my first boyfriend, we all took hallucinogenic drugs and got completely lost and couldn\u2019t make our way back to the tents because we were too scared to walk over a bridge. We all ended sitting in a circle in the mud, holding each other for about a day.</p> <p><strong>Romantic</strong>.</p> <p>Ha ha. I love seeing the sunset behind main stages at festivals, I think there\u2019s definitely something really romantic about that.</p> <p><strong>Can you give us your top festival hacks?</strong></p> <p>Erm \u2026 what?</p> <p><strong>Well, it\u2019s tips really. But if I say \u201chacks\u201d it sounds all modern and less Good Housekeeping.</strong></p> <p>Ha. Easy! Get off your phone, stop taking selfies and listen to the music.</p> <p><strong>Music! I thought festivals in 2016 were about Instagram value.</strong></p> <p>Exactly! But people should try and disconnect from the technology and get into the spirit of things. It\u2019s an opportunity to forget life back at home, live a magical existence, dress up, have loads of fun, get involved and forget social media. In a way, I wonder if that\u2019s why festivals have gone a bit weird because everyone\u2019s so concerned with Instagramming where they\u2019re at all the time. I noticed that a lot in America, it would be really nice if everyone went back in time a bit to the point when people would walk around and look at each other and talk to each other at festivals. Maybe I\u2019m sounding idealistic.</p> <p><strong>You are pretty hippy, to be fair. But it\u2019ll probably be the next retro take on vintage stuff: the no-phones festival.</strong></p> <p>I hope so. We had a no-phones show last month and I\u2019d forgotten how much it really changes when the audience aren\u2019t taking pictures of you or filming it, just when everyone\u2019s really present. Festivals really benefit from that mass communication of everyone being in the moment. Otherwise it disrupts the atmosphere and the environment and the artist\u2019s ability to create something powerful.</p> <p><em>Bat for Lashes headlines End of the Road Festival 1-4 September.</em></p>",

Let me be clear, Britain and every other country in the EU has a veto on another country joining. That is a fact,\u201d said Cameron, in an interview on ITV\u2019s Peston on Sunday.</p> <p>\u201cThe fact that the leave campaign are getting things as straightforward as this wrong should call into judgment the bigger argument about leaving the EU.\u201d He said out campaigners were trying to persuade people to vote for Brexit solely on the back of an issue \u201cthat is not true\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2c1767f8092d9d58f023f64477e31c9c616ef90c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2c1767f8092d9d58f023f64477e31c9c616ef90c/0_45_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Penny Mordaunt on BBC1\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Penny Mordaunt on BBC1\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Overs/BBC/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His comments followed an interview with Mordaunt on The Andrew Marr Show, in which she said the way the migrant crisis was being handled was speeding up the accession of Turkey, in particular, but other countries as well.</p> <p>Asked if Britain had a veto on the issue, Mordaunt replied: \u201cNo it doesn\u2019t.\u201d She then argued: \u201cI do not think that the EU is going to keep Turkey out. I think it is going to join. I think the migrant crisis is pushing it more that way.\u201d</p> <p>She argued that if the expansion policy was being pursued then Britain needed the \u201ctools to protect our national security\u201d, which were not currently available. And in an attack that appeared to be aimed at Cameron, she agreed when asked if the remain campaign was \u201can establishment stitch-up\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/21/vote-leave-prejudice-turkey-eu-security-threat\">Vote Leave embroiled in race row over Turkey security threat claims</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI think the public are seeing through this and I think that at moments in our history \u2013 1939, 1982 \u2013 we have gone against the orthodoxy of the establishment. We have stood up and said no, we are not going to be a nation of followers, we are going to be a nation of leaders and that\u2019s what we need to happen in this referendum.\u201d</p> <p>She accused her opponents of scaremongering and said it was a \u201cshame that there are a lot of people who want us to be frightened right now\u201d. </p> <p>Cameron hit back, arguing that Mordaunt was doing a good job in the Ministry of Defence, \u201cbut on this question of whether or not we have a veto, the leave campaign are wrong\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt is not remotely on the cards that Turkey is going to join the EU any time soon. They applied in 1987. At the current rate of progress, they will probably get round to joining in about the year 3000.\u201d</p> <p>Leave campaigners pointed out that in recent years the prime minister had made positive arguments in favour of Turkey\u2019s accession, including during a visit to the country in 2010. <br /></p> <p>Matthew Elliott, chief executive of Vote Leave, said: \u201cDavid Cameron has said he wants to pave the road to Ankara and has repeatedly confirmed it is government policy for Turkey to join the EU. The EU is speeding up the process of Turkey joining and we are paying nearly \u00a32bn to help make it happen. If it isn\u2019t on the cards why are taxpayers footing the bill for it already?\u201d</p> <p>David Owen, the former foreign secretary, added: \u201cOnly nine weeks ago David Cameron committed the country at the European council to re-energise the accession process of Turkey into the EU. The EU is continuing the preparatory work for Turkey at an accelerating pace with all of this going forward in parallel.\u201d</p> <p>Asked about the pressure the battle was putting on the Conservative party, and in particular Boris Johnson calling his points \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/may/11/pmqs-corbyn-cameron-osborne-boris-johnson-interview-politics-live?page=with%3Ablock-5732f564e4b01a6abab1c0a3\">demented</a>\u201d, Cameron said he was remaining focused on the arguments.</p> <p>\u201cBoris is hugely capable in lots of ways but I\u2019m not going to go into Boris today,\u201d said the prime minister.</p> <p>Cameron said he believed the government and Conservative party would reunite at the end of the campaign and focus on its legislation agenda but admitted that the result of the June referendum was high stakes.</p> <p>\u201cWhat is a more important decision \u2013 a general election or this Europe vote? Actually the Europe vote is more important because if you don\u2019t like the government, you can always get rid of them in five years\u2019 time.</p> <p>\u201cWhereas if we make this decision to leave the EU, and get out of the single market and hit our economy and hit jobs it would be very, very difficult if not impossible to reverse that decision.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Asked about Conservative succession and whether <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/georgeosborne\">George Osborne</a> should be the next leader, Cameron said: \u201cWe have been working together for the last 11 years. I think he is a man of great talent. I am not going to pick my successor. The Conservative party will do that. But George is hugely talented, a brilliant chancellor of the exchequer. In politics you have to have partnerships, you have to have teamwork. Prime ministers do not do this on their own.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/David_Cameron/status/734281174621822977\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Great to join <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HarrietHarman\">@HarrietHarman</a> at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/asda\">@Asda</a> in Hayes.

I do think that is wrong and divisive.</p> <p>\u201cWe have got to demonstrate that what we\u2019re up against here is a very small minority of a minority, Islamist extremists, that want to divide our societies, and we have got to explain that there are billions of people in our world who are devout Muslims but who believe in liberal democracy and all the things we believe in.\u201d</p> <p>He added that the original statement from Trump was \u201ca very dangerous thing to say \u2026 as well as a divisive and wrong one\u201d. </p> <p>Trump had said he feared the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/16/donald-trump-unlikely-have-good-relationship-david-cameron\">US might not have a good relationship with the UK</a> under his presidency following the prime minister\u2019s comments. But he later said he had been invited to visit Cameron at No 10.</p> <p>\u201cI will do just fine with David Cameron. I think he\u2019s a nice guy. I will do just fine,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they have asked me to visit 10 Downing Street \u2013 and I might do it.\u201d</p> <p>Downing Street has indicated that formal invites are not generally sent to presidential candidates but traditionally they do meet the prime minister when travelling in Europe. Trump\u2019s reference to an invite might relate to press reports around that.</p>",

The driver\u2019s brother Mohammad Qasim said he did not know the identity of the passenger but that he had been on a long drive with a customer from Afghanistan.</p> <p>An official from Nushki district said he recovered a passport and ID card for a man who closely resembles Mansoor from a bag that was blown out of the destroyed car.<br />According to the passport he went by the name Muhammad Wali and was a resident of Killa Abdullah in Balochistan.</p> <p>The document showed that earlier on Saturday he had crossed into Pakistan from Iran at the Taftan border post, some 450km from where he was killed. He first entered Iran on March 28 immigration stamps showed.</p> <p>A local man said before the missile attack Mansoor had stopped for lunch at a restaurant in Nushki district before continuing his journey in the direction of the provincial capital Quetta.<br /></p> <p>Mansoor\u2019s death came days after diplomats from Pakistan, Afghanistan, US and China held the latest round of talks in Islamabad about a flagging effort to draw the Taliban into peace negotiations. </p> <p>The Taliban were plunged into factional fighting in 2015 when it was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/29/taliban-leader-mullah-omar-dead-claims\">revealed that their former leader Mullah Omar had been dead for nearly two years</a>, with Mansoor running the organisation in his name. After asserting his control, Mansoor redoubled the Taliban\u2019s campaign of violence within Afghanistan, even succeeding in<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/28/taliban-attempt-to-invade-key-afghan-city-kunduz\"> briefly capturing the major city of Kunduz</a>. It is not known whether Pakistan gave its consent for a strike that seems at odds with its stated strategy of attempting to broker peace talks between Kabul and the Taliban.</p> <p>In recent weeks, Pakistan has resisted Afghan calls for military action against \u201cirreconcilable\u201d members of the Taliban saying such a move would be counterproductive. Officially the country objects to all US airstrikes on its territory, although State Department cables leaked by the website WikiLeaks support claims by US officials that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/30/wikileaks-cables-us-forces-embedded-pakistan\">Islamabad secretly gives it consent</a>. But almost all previous attacks have been tightly confined to specific areas of North and South Waziristan, tribal areas bordering Afghanistan that were until recently largely controlled by militant groups.</p> <p>Saturday\u2019s strike, on an open road at 3.45pm local time, was the first known strike in Balochistan, the vast southern province that is home to many senior Taliban leaders. Islamabad has staunchly resisted Afghan demands for action against insurgent sanctuaries on Pakistani soil. It also backed Mansoor in his efforts to shore up control of a fast-splintering movement.</p> <p>After remaining silent most of the day the government finally released a statement on Sunday evening that confirmed the US only informed the Pakistani prime minister and army chief after the strike had taken place.</p> <p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not dispute the claim the man was Mansoor but said further investigations were being carried out.</p> <p>\u201cPakistan wishes to once again state that the drone attack was a violation of its sovereignty, an issue which has been raised with the United States in the past as well,\u201d the statement said.</p> <p>The government repeated its view that \u201ca politically negotiated settlement was the only viable option for lasting peace in Afghanistan\u201d.</p> <p>Some analysts and diplomats think Pakistan might have agreed to the strike, even if it would never dare say so publicly for fear of enraging public opinion and provoking violent attacks by Afghan militants in Pakistan. <br /></p> <p>\u201cPakistan has a history of offering up sacrifices to the Americans when the political heat gets intense,\u201d a western official in Kabul said. \u201cThese gestures of goodwill have never diminished the intensity of Pakistan\u2019s proxy war against Afghanistan, and it\u2019s unlikely that the death of Mansoor will be any different.\u201d<br /></p> <p>The official said insurgent violence could increase if the death of Mansoor led to an especially lethal Taliban faction known as the Haqqani Network taking a greater control over the movement.</p> <p>In recent weeks Islamabad and Washington have been arguing about a deal to buy F16 fighter jets which has been jeopardised by the US Congress, which voted to block $450m (\u00a3310m) in military aid unless Pakistan takes various steps, including tackling the Haqqani network, which enjoys sanctuary on its territory.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d65c6c4e9530555a30c0c8b418bb5a6a94e3d17\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d65c6c4e9530555a30c0c8b418bb5a6a94e3d17/0_47_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"residents gather around a destroyed vehicle hit by a drone strike in which Mansoor was believed to be travelling.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Local residents gather around a vehicle hit by a drone strike in which Mansoor was believed to be travelling.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AFP/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ismail Qasemyar, a member of Afghanistan\u2019s High Peace Council, a body tasked with negotiating with the Taliban, predicted Mansoor\u2019s death would lead to a short-term surge in violence. \u201cHowever, if Pakistan uses its sway over the movement to influence the pick of the next leader, it could choose to drive it toward reconciliation,\u201d he said, adding that internal rifts in the Taliban could be healed if the leadership went to a member of Mullah Omar\u2019s family.</p> <p>Saturday\u2019s strike was also notable for being carried out by the US military and therefore with far greater transparency than under the officially clandestine CIA drone programme. Whereas details about the hundreds of drone strikes conducted by the CIA are almost never made public, on Sunday the Department of Defense gave extensive information about the operation to kill Mansoor.</p> <p>In Afghanistan on Saturday, a police official said six officers were shot and killed by colleagues who turned their guns on them at a checkpoint in the volatile southern Uruzgan province. Mohammad Hasham, head of police in the Charchino district, told AP the shooting happened in the early hours of the morning. Three of the gunmen escaped the scene, he said, taking weapons and vehicles with them.</p> <p>The incident followed another in the capital, Kabul, on Friday, when an Afghan security guard at a United Nations compound shot two Nepalese guards, killing one.</p>",

In <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/mar/20/trayvon-martin-death-story-so-far\">February 2012</a>, Trayvon Martin, 17, was visiting Sanford, Florida, with his father. He went out to buy an iced tea and some candy. As he walked through a gated community, he was trailed by George Zimmerman. Zimmerman called 911, to report what he claimed was suspicious activity.</p> <p>Though Zimmerman was advised not to follow Martin, an altercation ensued. Zimmerman shot the teenager through his chest. He was charged with second degree murder and manslaughter, and acquitted.</p> <p>The killing and the verdict sparked nationwide protests. The Black Lives Matter movement has since galvanized activists across the country, amid police killings of unarmed black men including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/michael-brown-shooting\">Michael Brown</a> in Ferguson, Missouri and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/eric-garner\">Eric Garner</a> in New York City. Clinton mentioned several such victims on Saturday, as their mothers looked on.</p> <p>She was introduced by Martin\u2019s mother, Sybrina Fulton, who talked about \u201call the murders and killings in the streets\u201d and praised Clinton as the only candidate to openly campaign against gun violence. Last fall, Clinton met Fulton and other parents. They have since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/22/hillary-clinton-primary-sandra-bland-eric-garner-black-lives-matter\">campaigned with her</a>, dubbing themselves the \u201cMothers of the Movement\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cShe walked in as a presidential candidate, but she walked out with compassion,\u201d Fulton said. \u201cShe walked out as a mother. She walked out as a grandmother, as a wife and as a woman.</p> <p>\u201cShe listened to each one of our tragedies. It\u2019s not a story, because a story ends. This doesn\u2019t end for us.\u201d</p> <p>Clinton has unveiled plans to reduce gun violence and reform the criminal justice system. On Saturday, she reiterated her support for universal background checks, pointing to broad public approval for modest gun safety measures.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"716e49a9ac67a15c0c23f692023d2ae9455e0985\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/716e49a9ac67a15c0c23f692023d2ae9455e0985/0_40_2784_1961/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Donald Trump speaks at the NRA\" width=\"1000\" height=\"704\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Donald Trump speaks at the NRA Leadership forum in Louisville, Kentucky on Friday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ddp USA/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/21/nra-meeting-gun-control-advocates-everytown\">Gun control advocates pray for NRA members: 'They too are children of God'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>According to <a href=\"http://several polls\">several polls</a>, at least 70% of Americans, including a majority of Republicans and gun owners, consistently favor the expansion of background checks. Following the 2012 elementary school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, the Senate failed to pass an amendment that would have required background checks on all private sales and closed the so-called \u201cgun show loophole\u201d.</p> <p>Typically, gun control, seen as politically toxic, has not been a wedge issue in presidential races. But Clinton has campaigned aggressively on the subject and the Democratic primary has presented a contrast between the former secretary of state and her opponent, Bernie Sanders. The Vermont senator, although holding a D-minus rating from the NRA, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/17/bernie-sanders-gun-control-consensus-vermont\">has a mixed record on gun laws</a>.</p> <p>Clinton did not mention Sanders on Saturday. Her criticism was reserved for Trump, who in his speech to the NRA on Friday called her \u201cthe most anti-gun\u201d candidate to ever run for office, and claimed, falsely, that she wanted to abolish the second amendment.</p> <p>\u201cWe are smart enough and strong enough as a nation,\u201d Clinton said, \u201cto figure out how to protect the rights of responsible gun owners while keeping guns out of the hands of domestic abusers, other violent criminals, gang members, the severely mentally ill.</p> <p>\u201cParents, teachers and schools should have the right to keep guns out of classrooms. Just like Donald Trump does at many of his hotels, by the way.\u201d</p>",

Mourinho has already agreed a salary and has discussed possible transfer targets with the club and is likely to be presented as United\u2019s new manager once his agent, Jorge Mendes, has finalised the finer details of the contract.</p> <p>Van Gaal leaves United after two seasons in charge. United finished fourth in the league in his first campaign and won the FA Cup on Saturday but went out in the group stage of the Champions League and were then eliminated by Liverpool in the Europa League.</p> <p>United\u2019s plan had always been to keep Van Gaal in the job for three years before handing over to someone younger, such as Ryan Giggs. But the lack of progress on the pitch and the fact that many of the club\u2019s new signings failed to improve the team meant that the club decided to end the deal with one year remaining.</p> <p>However it seemed Van Gaal was unaware of the news as rumours started to swirl round Wembley last night and his final press conference turned into something of a farce.</p> <p>The FA Cup-winning manager turned up to speak at Wembley with the trophy in his hands, and placed it on the table in front of him. \u201cI show you the Cup, I don\u2019t discuss my future with the media,\u201d he said defiantly. \u201cSome of you have had me sacked already.\u201d</p> <p>Reports were still emerging at that point that the club had drawn a line under Van Gaal\u2019s reign, with William Hill shortening their odds on United for the title next year on learning of Mourinho\u2019s appointment, but the Dutchman was having none if it.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk about leaving,\u201d he said. \u201cI am proud that I am the first United manager after Sir Alex Ferguson to win a trophy. I have had a picture taken with Sir Alex, because that is history.\u201d</p> <p>Even before Saturday night\u2019s developments it was common knowledge that United would not be satisfied with just an FA Cup win. Champions League qualification has always been their main aim and Van Gaal could only manage a fifth-place finish. Yet when asked if he had plans for next season Van Gaal replied in the affirmative.</p> <p>\u201cThe aim will be the same, we need to improve further and we need to sign new players,\u201d he said. \u201cHow much we improve is dependable on the players we can buy.

      "headline": "George Osborne, the really unfortunate chancellor",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-23T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Britain\u2019s economic problem is easy to identify. As a nation, we live beyond our means. Consumption exceeds production. Exports are lower than imports, resulting in a balance of payments deficit that has got bigger over time. <br /></p> <p>None of this is new. George Osborne is not the first chancellor of the exchequer to arrive in office expressing concern about the unbalanced nature of UK growth. Nor, as things stand, will he be the last.</p> <p>Some chancellors find that their biggest headache is the trade deficit and decide that the answer is to suck spending power out of the economy. If the slowdown goes too far and recession ensues, the trade deficit problem becomes a budget deficit problem. Really unfortunate chancellors have to cope with both at once.</p> <p>Osborne is one of those. The latest data show that <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/nationalaccounts/balanceofpayments/bulletins/balanceofpayments/octtodecandannual2015\">the current account deficit is running at a record 7% of national output</a>, while despite the improvement since 2010 the <a href=\"http://budgetresponsibility.org.uk/efo/economic-fiscal-outlook-march-2016/\">budget deficit in the last financial year was 4% of GDP</a>. That is a twin deficit problem with a vengeance.</p> <p>Hugh Dalton and Sir Stafford Cripps provided the template for how to cope with a twin deficit problem: stimulate growth through low interest rates while simultaneously tightening fiscal policy to bring down the budget deficit and to keep inflation in check. Add in a devaluation of the currency to boost exports and there\u2019s your recipe for rebalancing the economy.</p> <p><a href=\"http://researchbriefings.parliament.uk/ResearchBriefing/Summary/SN05745\">Figures provided by the House of Commons library </a>show just how tight fiscal policy was in the years immediately after the second world war. The cost of the conflict meant that Britain had a budget deficit of just over 6% of GDP in 1946-47, but within three years this had been turned into a surplus of 4.6% of GDP. This was austerity red in tooth and claw.</p> <p>Other chancellors have trodden the same path. In the aftermath of the 1967 devaluation, Roy Jenkins wanted to make sure that the cheaper pound would boost exports rather than domestic consumption. The subsequent squeeze turned a 4% of GDP budget deficit into a 2% of GDP surplus within two years.</p> <p>Ken Clarke did the same after Black Wednesday in September 1992. Again there was a determination not to fritter away the gains from devaluation, so fiscal policy was tightened aggressively in the mid-1990s. The budget deficit peaked at 7% of GDP in 1993-94, but was showing a small 0.5% surplus within five years. With growth biased towards exports, the current account deficit almost disappeared. By the time Gordon Brown became chancellor, the twin deficit problem had disappeared. But only temporarily.</p> <p>In the years running up to the financial crisis, the current account deficit grew steadily bigger and, after running a budget surplus for three consecutive years around the turn of the millennium, Brown borrowed to finance public investment. The budget deficit on the eve of the Great Recession was 2.6% of GDP, but within three years had ballooned to a peacetime record of just over 10% of GDP.</p> <p>For a while, the 25% depreciation of sterling that occurred between mid-2007 and early 2009 helped the current account. But then a combination of factors made the picture rapidly worse. The financial crisis ended a period when the UK had been enjoying big surpluses on investment income. Declining North Sea production meant the UK became a net importer of oil. The crisis in the eurozone affected exports to Britain\u2019s biggest market. And, by historical standards, Osborne\u2019s attempt at diverting resources away from consumption and into production was modest. As an austerity chancellor, he simply has not been in the same league as Clarke or Jenkins, let alone Dalton and Cripps.</p> <p>This is obvious from the House of Commons library figures. These show that on current plans it took six years for Osborne to reduce the budget deficit by six percentage points of GDP \u2013 something Jenkins achieved in just two and Clarke in four.</p> <p>Progress in Osborne\u2019s first two years at the Treasury stalled in year three, 2012-13, when the deficit rose as a share of GDP. Given the sluggishness of the economy in the first half of the last parliament, it is easy to see why the chancellor failed to stick to his original deficit reduction targets. Indeed, it would have been self-defeating had he tried to do so, since higher taxes or lower spending would have led to even slower growth and greater pressure on the public finances. </p> <p>By giving himself more time to hit his fiscal targets, Osborne got the growth he was looking for. But it was the wrong sort of growth, the sort of growth that Dalton, Cripps, Jenkins and Clarke had expressly been seeking to avoid.</p> <p>In a sense what happened is understandable. Export-led growth was a challenge in 2012, <a>since the eurozone was in near meltdown </a> and the pound was rising on the foreign exchanges as a result. UK exports became less competitive at a time when demand was weakening.</p> <p>One alternative to export-led growth would have been investment-led growth. This, though, would have required action by the government, either through higher spending on infrastructure or through a national investment bank. Osborne could have squeezed current government spending harder in order to free up extra resources to finance higher investment spending. This would have led to faster and more sustainable growth. It is what Dalton and Cripps did in the late 1940s.</p> <p>Instead, capital spending was cut aggressively in the early years of the last parliament, and incentives were provided for banks to lend money for mortgages. It didn\u2019t take long for the housing market to recover, with knock-on effects for consumer spending.</p> <p>But this was never going to be the basis for a strong or lasting recovery. Britain now has house price inflation running at 10 times the level of general inflation, rising household indebtedness as individuals run down their savings to finance consumption and a whopping trade deficit. In the past, these have traditionally been the classic signs of overheating.</p> <p>Yet, in other respects the economy is clearly not overheating. Earnings growth is running at around 2% a year; manufacturing output is 10% lower than it was before the Great Recession; and the cost of living as measured by the consumer prices index is rising at an annual rate of 0.3%.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/17/budget-2016-osborne-chances-of-delivering-surplus-50-50-ifs\">Osborne has a balanced budget rule</a>, under which the government will be obliged to run budget surpluses unless growth is particularly weak. Balanced budgets are not unprecedented \u2013 Conservative chancellors kept a tight grip on the public finances in the 1950s and 1960s, with the exception of the pre-election years of 1959 and 1964. But the real challenge, then as now, was to cure Britain\u2019s supply-side problems: under-investment; poor management; inadequate skills; weak productivity. What Britain needs is a balanced economy rule. If that were adhered to, the deficits would look after themselves.<br /></p>",

      "body": "<p>Jeremy Moberg peers into a microscope at a leaf in a Petri dish. \u201cThrips\u201d, he declares to a man wearing a facemask and surgical gloves. \u201cWe\u2019ll get rid of those with neem oil.\u201d Moberg spotted the pest while cloning in his greenhouse. He\u2019s not your run-of-the-mill biologist or horticulturalist. The 41-year-old owns a marijuana farm with a multi-million dollar turnover in Washington state, USA, where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/nov/07/marijuana-legalisation-colorado-washington-yes\">the drug was legalised for recreational use in 2012</a>. His expertise comes from two decades of growing illegally, deep in the woods, dodging the helicopter raids of drug-enforcement officers.</p> <p>The smell of marijuana hangs heavy and pungent in the processing centre, where half a dozen people are clipping flower buds. \u201cYou\u2019re trimming too closely,\u201d he calls to one man working on his cheapest product as he walks to the boardroom. \u201cLeave it shaggier and go faster.\u201d Life is good for Moberg. He\u2019s generated more than $3m in the 20 months since he started the business. However, he says a glut on the market has depressed prices this year, taxes are high and profits are invested back into the farm, so his personal pay cheque is modest. Still, he owns a couple of houses and enjoys eating out, skiing and fishing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It felt so good when the vote passed to legalise. We drank and sat in the hot tub</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As Moberg says, he is a \u201cproduct of circumstance, the right person at the right time\u201d. Four years ago he was on his uppers. He had taken a job as a fisheries ecologist, using his environmental science degree, and stopped growing weed to \u201cgo straight\u201d while involved in a custody battle for his daughter, now 10. Then he was laid off and his life unravelled. With no crop in production, he sold wood to make ends meet, borrowed money from his mother and relied on friends for food. He nearly lost his house and had a difficult break-up with a girlfriend, which led to him being arrested for taking his rucksack out of her car. He was arrested again for stealing a Sim card tray from a shop so he could use his mobile for a job interview. Both charges were later dismissed.</p> <p>That\u2019s important because people with marijuana convictions are often barred from working in the industry. This has meant Black Americans, who were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/mar/25/colorado-marijuana-legalization-racial-disparity-drug-arrests\">disproportionately targeted in the \u201cwar on drugs\u201d</a>, are thought to be missing out on the opportunities created by legalisation.</p> <p>Now Moberg runs a legitimate business, producing and processing 900kg of marijuana a year that he sells to pot shops springing up across the state. And it\u2019s about to become a family affair. His mother, a retired teacher, and his brother, a lawyer, are going into production, too, each having taken leases on farms neighbouring Moberg\u2019s.</p> <p>\u201cIt felt so good when the vote passed to legalise,\u201d Moberg says. \u201cWe drank and sat in the hot tub in the snow. We totally partied. The next morning my pipe, my beer, my weed were still there. I remembered saying: \u2018This is going to be huge.\u2019\u201d </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43a5d6b6bc2cf8a6159688b56ab39d5eae3148f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43a5d6b6bc2cf8a6159688b56ab39d5eae3148f9/0_358_5545_3326/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Moberg\u2019s farm in Okanogan County, Washington.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joint account: Jeremy Moberg\u2019s farm in Okanogan County, Washington.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Kehoe for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I first met Moberg in a coffee shop in Seattle \u2013 a four-hour drive west from his farm \u2013 on his way to deliver tens of thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of stock. He was rangy from a food-is-fuel attitude and a hectic schedule, and his face was weathered from a life outdoors. He talked rapidly. It was no surprise that he smoked marijuana to help him sleep at night, although the double-shot espressos probably don\u2019t help.</p> <p>Establishing his business hasn\u2019t been straightforward. Moberg grows outdoors; the conditions in Okanogan are perfect \u2013 hot summers with low humidity. At first it was proposed licences be granted to indoor growers only, largely because of security concerns over open fields of marijuana. Moberg, who spent most of his life terrified of being raided by police or robbed, now had to step forward and argue his case in public. He and fellow growers formed the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonsungrowers.org/\">Washington Sungrowers Industry Association</a> (WSIA), lobbying politicians in Olympia, the state capital, and giving a presentation to the liquor control board.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Moberg\u2019s mother told only close friends about the farm. \u2018There\u2019s prejudice \u2013 even in my quilting group\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/27/marijuana-industry-huge-energy-footprint\">Indoor production leaves a large carbon footprint</a>, he told me, because of the electricity needed for intense lighting and air regulation. Sun-grown marijuana \u2013 as he calls outdoor weed \u2013 was more environmentally friendly, he argued, even in Washington, which uses mainly hydropower, considered greener than other energy sources. \u201cIndoor growers use lots of nitrates and phosphates and there\u2019s mercury in the lightbulbs.\u201d He used only vinegar, natural plant-derived oils and potassium bicarbonate. </p> <p>\u201cIt was prohibition that led to growing indoors in the first place \u2013 to hide it,\u201d he added. This led to a more potent product because it was bombarded with light and fertilisers. \u201cPeople got used to the look and strength of it. There\u2019s a perception that outdoor is crappy because for a long time it was grown illegally in difficult conditions. But I can manipulate the plant by depping [using tarpaulins to deprive plants of light and trick them into flowering] and can produce marijuana that is as good quality.\u201d</p> <p>WSIA\u2019s campaign was successful and licences were granted for outdoor cultivation of up to 30,000sqft. Moberg, now one of more than 600 growers in the state, told me there are strict rules around security and to avoid environmental damage like that caused by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/vital-signs/2015/mar/28/marijuana-cultivation-in-california-sucking-streams-dry-says-new-report\">illegal outdoor farming in California</a>, where there are cases of water being diverted from salmon-spawning creeks, deforestation and soil erosion. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"586675cc8c2b46afb3282188085c6212a24abd82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/586675cc8c2b46afb3282188085c6212a24abd82/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A CannaSol employee trims marijuana buds before packaging for sale\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pot luck: a worker in Moberg\u2019s cannabis farm.

Moberg chatted to the owner, Ian Eisenberg, who said he was now testing the pot he sold for pesticides. Two Washington growers had been fined for using illegal pesticides and regulators in Colorado had recalled several batches over similar concerns. </p> <p>He pointed towards the lunchtime queue of office workers, hipsters and a couple of middle-aged women in yoga pants. A security guard checked ID at the door \u2013 you have to be over 21 to buy and use marijuana \u2013 and half a dozen \u201cbudtenders\u201d stood in front of shelves filled with bottles of marijuana flowers with names like Girl Scout Cookies, Aliens on Moonshine and Double Lemon Cheesecake, as well as vape pens, pre-rolled joints, oils and waxes, and edibles \u2013 cookies, chocolates and brownies.</p> <p>Eisenberg said: \u201cPeople care about how their chicken is raised, whether it\u2019s in a cage or not, but until now no one cared how their pot was grown. The older crowd is going for non-pesticide now.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The older crowd is going for non-pesticide now</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The roads to Moberg\u2019s CannaSol Farms in Okanogan County, north-central Washington, stretch long and empty, flanked by apple and pear orchards, and fields of alfalfa. There\u2019s no sign marking the anonymous buildings on the one-acre site surrounded by 8ft fences topped with barbed wire and security cameras. </p> <p>Moberg has been teaching his mother MaryAnn Bennett, 68, how to clone marijuana from a mother plant, so the same strain can be grown repeatedly. She\u2019s giggling at how the nickname for a greenhouse of marijuana plants is the Mother Room. \u201cYou\u2019re getting the hang of it, Mom, just like you did with your roses,\u201d jokes Moberg. </p> <p>With her long wool skirt, glasses and bobbed hair, she certainly looks more retired elementary school teacher than cannabis farmer. She\u2019s a new convert to the drug. Moberg showed her how to infuse it into sugar and she sprinkles half a teaspoon in her tea every evening to help her sleep. </p> <p>She intends to grow <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/apr/17/pennsylvania-legalizes-medical-marijuana\">medicinal marijuana</a>, which is legal in 23 states. Recreational use is legal in Washington, Oregon, Alaska and Colorado as well as Washington DC. \u201cThis is a new venture for me,\u201d she says. \u201cI have senior friends who have really benefitted. One has a serious case of lupus and her joints hurt real badly, and this has really helped her.\u201d </p> <p>However, Bennett, a churchgoer, adds: \u201cI don\u2019t really talk about it with my friends, just my very close ones. There\u2019s still prejudices and bias, in the churches especially. Even in my quilting group \u2013 they\u2019re older than me, I\u2019m young, some are in their 80s \u2013 there\u2019s a prejudice. I always thought it was less harmful than alcohol. It\u2019s beneficial in certain circumstances. Everyone can use something to excess.\u201d</p> <p>She says she knew nothing of Moberg\u2019s years of guerrilla growing until she heard him speak at a symposium after he\u2019d been granted a licence. \u201cIt was a bit of a shock,\u201d she admits. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d657a3c78afb77755354fb5adb4acf3815dfad8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d657a3c78afb77755354fb5adb4acf3815dfad8/518_338_5242_3145/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Moberg on his farm, leaning against a tractor, his land behind\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A lot of friends got busted.

His father, since separated from his mother, was a lawyer. When Moberg was in his early teens he became a socialist, experimenting with dope and starting the school\u2019s first recycling programme. His activism wasn\u2019t always well received, particularly during the first Gulf war. \u201cWe had an anti-war group and held a forum\u2026 I got hate mail. I was, like, OK I\u2019m not going to school any more.\u201d His parents sent him to a private school 100 miles away in Spokane, where he lived with his older brother and enjoyed his new-found freedom. </p> <p>\u201cMe and my friends used to cruise around for hours looking for green bud. We\u2019d find a little bit of weed for 50 bucks, smoke it and go look for it again. That was what probably first made me think there\u2019s a market here.\u201d He was soon growing marijuana in his wardrobe and selling it at school, which ended with him being expelled and then arrested for possession. \u201cI made a deal to spend a month in rehab. It was full of alcoholics, cokeheads and meth heads. I was like: \u2018I just smoke weed, I don\u2019t know what your problem is.\u2019\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This stuff is so strong. Older people get wasted on it. They get sick</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Back at high school, he began growing in the basement of a house he shared, and then outdoors. \u201cMe and my buddy would ride motorbikes deep into the woods and grow not very good weed. We had no idea. I was producing around 20lb a year. People could make $50,000 to $100,000 a year from that. It was a big risk and a lot of effort, but a good income for my age.\u201d He made enough to put himself through college. \u201cI\u2019d turn up two weeks late for fall quarter and leave two weeks early. I had a crop to tend.\u201d</p> <p>He bought some property in the North Cascades mountains near where CannaSol Farms now is. \u201cI was just hanging out. My pal had next door. I had a beautiful lake. Those were my back-to-the-land years. I wasn\u2019t making a lot of money, but enough.\u201d It doesn\u2019t sound relaxing, however. \u201cI was a hermit. We were very afraid to speak to anyone, even fellow growers. The helicopters came every year and I had a lot of friends who got busted. I hid the plants under trees in the woods. They did find a lot, but they couldn\u2019t prove it was ours unless they caught us with them.</p> <p>\u201cOne time, it was so scary, I couldn\u2019t breathe. Even now when I hear the voom, voom, voom of a chopper, wow\u2026 I reckon I smoke marijuana to help my PTSD from selling marijuana.\u201d</p> <p>In 2002 he got a \u201cproper\u201d job, monitoring habitat in rivers for an environmental consulting firm. He was laid off in 2011. For some of these years, Moberg lived next to the sheriff of Okanogan County. He still does \u2013 growers are not allowed to live on their farms \u2013 and they are on friendly terms. \u201cI think he was like, \u2018Yeah, we knew the whole time,\u2019\u201d says Moberg, laughing. </p> <p>Sheriff Frank Rogers is weeding the garden of his home in Okanogan. \u201cDon\u2019t mind dead animals, do you?\u201d he yells, striding inside to the living room where half a dozen stag heads and a bobtail cat stare down from the walls. \u201cYeah, I knew Jeremy when he was counting fish, before he got into the legal dope growing.</p> <p>\u201cI knew he grew illegally, they had dope in the house,\u201d he continues. \u201cI could\u2019ve done something, but the trend was towards legalisation. He had a lot more up at his other place, turns out.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"701361b5f7bc7e67dfae369a3ca3ba889b42b675\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/701361b5f7bc7e67dfae369a3ca3ba889b42b675/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A CannaSol employee holds a bag of Dutch Treat marijuana ready to be shipped to retailers\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ready to roll: a CannaSol employee holds a bag of \u2018Dutch Treat\u2019 marijuana ready to be shipped to retailers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Patrick Kehoe for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There has been a mixed reception to legalisation in this rural, conservative area \u2013 48.6%, including Sheriff Rogers, voted against it in Okanogan. There were fears that usage would increase, particularly among young people, leading to more addiction and mental health issues, crime and traffic accidents.</p> <p>\u201cWe do see more people using it,\u201d says Rogers. \u201cOnce it was legalised they were like, hey, we used to smoke this when we were kids. This stuff is so strong, though. They\u2019re hallucinating, having anxiety attacks. These people my age, 55, 60, used to smoke a big bag of crap weed, but on this stuff they get wasted like with booze, they get sick. We\u2019ve seen more problems with kids, too, because getting hold of it is easier \u2013 they can get it from home, steal a little bit from Dad. It\u2019s here to stay. The worse issue here is the meth and heroin, it\u2019s bad.\u201d </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My best decisions were made smoking sativa \u2013 it\u2019s the thinking man\u2019s weed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A paper published in the <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/add.13247/full\">journal <em>Addiction</em> </a>in January stated that while it was too soon to assess many of the effects of legalisation, there was little evidence that more people were using it. There had been an increase, it said, in the number of motorists suspected of driving under the influence testing positive for cannabis. There had also been a dramatic fall in the number of prosecutions for possession (it is legal to carry up to 28g), although African-Americans continued to be three times more likely than whites to be charged, despite comparable rates of use.</p> <p>Rogers worries about visiting houses where people are smoking marijuana. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for cops. I can\u2019t stand and talk to them because I can\u2019t breathe it in. If I then go out and shoot someone, I\u2019ll be automatically tested for drugs and alcohol and it\u2019ll be in my system. We ask to talk to them outside.\u201d </p> <p>Andi Ervin, of the Okanogan County Community Coalition, which works to reduce youth substance abuse, believes regular cannabis use affects the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/17/the-guardian-view-on-cannabis-and-psychosis-how-do-we-protect-teenagers\">developing teenage brain</a>. She says data shows that the percentage of teenagers in the state who thought there was no risk of harm from regular use had jumped between 2008 and 2014. There\u2019s another issue, too \u2013 Rogers has received complaints about the smell coming from the farms, which travels a couple of miles during harvest. \u201cThe county stinks,\u201d he tells me.</p> <p>However, the \u201cgreen rush\u201d \u2013 which is producing millions in tax revenues for the state \u2013 has also brought economic benefits to the county, one of the poorest in Washington. There are more than 50 licensed growers in Okanogan now who are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars locally on equipment, labour and construction work.</p> <p>Moberg is in the greenhouse inspecting his mother plants. He describes how <em>Cannabis sativa</em> strains make users more alert, while <em>C indica</em> is more sedate. What does he prefer? \u201cAll my best decisions were made when I was smoking <em>sativa</em>, it\u2019s thinking man\u2019s weed,\u201d he says, as an employee comes in to tell him he\u2019s needed at a meeting. \u201cBut I don\u2019t get to smoke as much as I did,\u201d he adds ruefully. \u201cI just don\u2019t have the time.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>As I write this, I\u2019m about to travel to beautiful, sunny Puerto Rico for a brief vacation. If all goes according to plan, there will be keys waiting for me in a mailbox outside an apartment in San Juan, which will hopefully look like the pictures I saw on the Airbnb website. </p> <p>To get to the airport, I\u2019m probably going to take an Uber, partly because I just moved to New York and still feel like a fool trying to wave down a cab, but mostly because calling an Uber is really, truly, ridiculously easy to do.</p> <p>Welcome to the new economy, where convenience is king. It\u2019s no wonder these kinds of services are popular \u2013 they give us just what we need, when we need them. They make fast lives possible. But is convenience turning us into monsters?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Trading ethics for comfort is par for the course in America</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A high minimum wage, guaranteed medical leave for workers, and paid overtime are all issues young progressives have taken vocal positions on. But in an environment shaped by on-demand apps, workers are considered independent contractors or free agents, and job protections are eliminated. It\u2019s a system that heavily favors the corporation over the laborer.</p> <p>Strangely enough, however, progressives aren\u2019t just giving their tacit approval to the sharing economy by spending their money with companies like Uber. They\u2019re straight up <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/18/sharing-economy-pew-survey-airbnb-uber\">coming out against</a> protecting the workers involved. A survey from Pew found that Americans who use ride-hailing and home-sharing services are against regulating them. The people who use these services <a href=\"http://www.globalwebindex.net/blog/uber-half-of-16-34s-are-interested\">tend to be younger</a>, and they tend to identify as Democrats. </p> <p>The conclusion is obvious: we young progressives are hypocrites. We want corporations put in check, except when those corporations provide us a convenient service. We are against the exploitation of workers in theory, but in reality, we couldn\u2019t care less about Uber drivers or about what they have to say about the weather during an awkward 15-minute drive. </p> <p>Yes, that distant humming you hear is the anti-millennial thinkpiece machine revving up. To be clear, I do think some calling out is in order: we need to wake progressives up to the fact that workers are being taken advantage of.</p> <p>But it\u2019s also more nuanced than that.</p> <p>I am reminded of another story in the news right now: people calling out Beyonc\u00e9, a noted feminist, for supposedly employing \u201csweatshop\u201d labor in Sri Lanka for her new sportswear line. <a href=\"https://broadly.vice.com/en_us/article/beyonce-topshop-ivy-park-sweatshop-factory-labor\">Critics say</a> she is exploiting poor workers while many have <a href=\"http://thefederalist.com/2016/05/18/beyonces-use-of-sweatshops-does-more-for-the-worlds-poor-than-you-ever-will/\">come to her defense</a>, arguing that she is providing Sri Lankan women with much-needed jobs.</p> <p>But Beyonc\u00e9 is not responsible for the system in which these ethically ambiguous situations arise. Nor are progressives or millennials responsible for the economic structures that allowed Uber to become such a juggernaut.</p> <p>The reality is that to exist in a capitalist system is to engage with exploitation. I am writing this article on a MacBook, an Apple product. Apple has been accused of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/business-30532463\">failing to protect workers</a>, though it claims it does more than any other company to ensure fair conditions. Right now, I am wearing clothes that, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/06/patagonia-labor-clothing-factory-exploitation/394658/\">in all likelihood</a>, were made with exploited labor. Exploited laborers likely picked the food I eat. </p> <p>If being a progressive required ideological purism, I would have to abscond to a yurt in nature, grow my own crops, make my own clothes, and never list that yurt on Airbnb as a romantic getaway in the woods.</p> <p>So, yes, convenience has turned many of us into monsters. We are choosing our desire for ease over justice for Uber drivers. But every progressive could delete their app tomorrow, and it wouldn\u2019t radically shift the tectonic plates that thrust Uber to prominence in the first place.</p> <p>Trading ethics for comfort is par for the course in America. We can aspire to become conscious participants in the system. We can understand where our money is going before we give it out, and be aware of how our actions collude with economic oppression and exploitation. But I can\u2019t help feeling that more is required. What could stop the march of convenience? It\u2019s a question my generation may one day have to answer. But by then, will the luckier ones among us have become too comfortable to care?</p>",

Starling headed to the capital, Montgomery, and the fight began: court and corset. Black robes versus a miniskirt. The judge against the drag queen \u2013 and the drag queen is winning.</p> <p>After Starling and companions filed complaints against Moore, the state\u2019s disciplinary board for judges removed Moore from power on May 7, charging he had \u201cflagrantly disregarded and abused his authority\u201d and \u201cabandoned his role\u201d as chief justice.</p> <p>Multiple times in recent days Moore has named Starling as his nemesis and once said, \u201cWhen I started in 2013, if this would\u2019ve happened then, this person and the people around her, or some of the people around her \u2013 him \u2013 would have been said to have a mental disorder.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/jul/12/alabama-judges-gay-marriage-licenses\">Meet the Alabama  judges who refuse to issue marriage licenses \u2013 gay or straight</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The two personalities could not be more opposite, or more unexpected. The judge, instead of being known for reserved reflection, is infamous for bombast. And the drag queen, by contrast, speaks with the demure bearing of an Old South debutante.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the \u2018land of the free and the home of the brave\u2019,\u201d Starling said. \u201cBut right now there are people who are free, and others who are brave. I believe we can all be free.\u201d</p> <p>Starling prefers \u201cshe\u201d and speaks with the soft, rounded vowels of someone raised in the wiregrass of south-east Alabama. Her harshest words come when talking about Moore\u2019s professed Christianity. He was removed from the bench once before, in 2003, for refusing the US supreme court\u2019s order to remove the Ten Commandments from his courtroom.</p> <p>\u201cHe shoves hate and fear into God\u2019s mouth,\u201d Starling said. \u201cHe puts the devil\u2019s words on God\u2019s tongue. Very rarely am I met with rudeness or unkindness when I go buy panty hose and I\u2019ve got a beard going, or I go in the Christian donation store to pick out a dress. These people are not as hateful and spiteful as the politicians are pushing them to be.\u201d</p> <p>Starling doesn\u2019t reveal her real name, for fear of reprisal. But she was born and grew up in Dothan, Alabama, where she still lives. It wasn\u2019t an easy upbringing, and Starling found comfort in the kitchen with her grandmother.</p> <p>\u201cI learned to cook, and I learned my manners,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re a southern child between ages five and six, you\u2019re going to learn your manners. I was busted three times in one meal for not saying \u2018Please pass the ...\u2019 and I slammed down my fork and crossed my arms. I said, \u2018I don\u2019t like good manners.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cMy grandmother very calmly put down her fork and looked at me. She said something I\u2019ll never forget: \u2018Manners are free. Around the world, war and bloodshed and chaos begin because someone didn\u2019t have respect for someone else.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Starling\u2019s first schoolyard fight came when she told a boy: \u201cMind your manners.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a fight that, in her mind, she carries on to this day. </p> <p>\u201cRoy Moore simply is not using good manners. He is being rude,\u201d she said. \u201cIn his mind the south won the war, and we don\u2019t have to pay any attention to the federal government.\u201d</p> <p>Moore is widely speculated to be aiming for an elected position \u2013 governor or senator \u2013 and if so, shaking his fist at the nation\u2019s government is a time-tested political move in Alabama. </p> <p>After he ordered probate judges to not issue marriage licenses to gay couples, though, Starling contacted friends about making a trip to Montgomery to protest. They reached out to advocacy groups Equality Wiregrass, Human Rights Campaign and the Southern Poverty Law Center.</p> <p>\u201cIn no time we had a public address system set up, tables, chairs,\u201d Starling said. She burst out laughing. \u201cif you want to throw a party, just call us!\u201d</p> <p>On arriving in the capital \u2013 in full drag, with a towering wig \u2013 Starling and company realized the system for filing judicial complaints was complex, and required organizations to be represented by attorneys. Individuals, though, could file the lengthy paperwork without a lawyer. </p> <p>\u201cI said, hey! I know some individuals!\u201d Starling said. </p> <p>The papers were eight to 10 pages each, and required specific legal claims and notarization, and so forth \u2013 but Starling and 40 friends filed them. </p> <p>Chris Jimenez-Cherry, head of Equality Wiregrass, said Starling emerged as the natural \u2013 if heavily made-up \u2013 face of the movement. \u201cWe certainly didn\u2019t plan it,\u201d he said. \u201cAmbrosia is just very articulate and free to speak her mind.\u201d</p> <p>Now that Moore\u2019s fate rests in the hands of the disciplinary board, Jimenez-Cherry said the coalition is preparing for the next fight on the Alabama horizon: transgender bathroom rights. </p> <p>\u201cAlready there are politicians out talking about it, grandstanding for political reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cCorruption in the state is what\u2019s harming the citizens. Not this bathroom business.\u201d</p> <p>Starling agreed. </p> <p>\u201cThere are bridges falling into the river!\u201d she said. \u201cVeterans healthcare is almost universally underfunded. Our economy is still not good. But don\u2019t pay attention to that. Look, everybody: who\u2019s in that bathroom?\u201d</p> <p>Then she returned to coy decorum. </p> <p>\u201cIs it shocking for people to see a drag queen get up and call for justice and liberty? Yes. It is,\u201d she said. \u201cBut what\u2019s even more shocking is that a drag queen has to.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>My friend \u2013 call him Henry \u2013 thinks that we should start at the Equinox gym. But I don\u2019t have a membership and another friend is insisting that we have to check out the Whole Foods on East Houston in Manhattan.<br />I\u2019m intrigued: it had never occurred to me that a grocery store would make a prime pick up spot at 6pm on a Friday. But the place is crowded. Who knows who\u2019s in here? The checkout line snakes around the stacked 24-packs of organic beer almost to the door. I am 95% sure that the willowy blonde hiding under her poncho while waiting to pay for her vegetables is Taylor Schilling, the star of Orange is the New Black. I can\u2019t resist following her out, so I am standing on the corner playing on Tinder when Henry calls my name from across Second Avenue.</p> <p>By playing, I do mean playing: I have been happily married for a year and a half, and am not looking for dates, just subjects to chat with. My editor asked me to write a piece on what seems to be a perennial question: why isn\u2019t there <a href=\"http://www.grindr.com/\">Grindr</a> (a dating app for gay men with a reputation for facilitating quick hook-ups) for straight people? In other words, why, after decades of feminism and sexual revolution, at a time when new HIV infection rates aren\u2019t rising in the United States and contraception and abortion are legally available \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/19/oklahoma-ban-abortions-bill-passes-state-legislature\">at least for now</a> \u2013 are there not more venues for straight people to have no-strings-attached sex? Why don\u2019t more straight couples want it?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Why are there not more venues for straight couples to have casual, anonymized, No Strings Attached, sex?</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I\u2019ve heard the question many times before and I\u2019ve disliked every answer. Most of them seem to boil down to stereotypes. They go something like: gay men are promiscuous. Straight women are frigid. Heterosexuality always has been, and always will be, a sad compromise between men who want to get as much sex for as little affection as women can wheedle out of them, etc. I think these stereotypes are both unkind and untrue. I wanted to see whether I could come up with something better.</p> <p>Henry arrives and we cook up an experiment to try to answer my editor\u2019s question. I reactivate my Tinder account. He gets on Grindr. We spend a night hopping from bar to bar together and see what kinds of romantic or sexual prospects each of these apps presents us.</p> <p>I tell anyone I match with that I am in this for research as soon as meeting IRL comes up. <em>Hey we\u2019re all on here for something</em>, one 28-year-old replies without missing a beat. But I still fret about the ethics of it. Because Tinder simply draws photos from Facebook, my husband is in most of mine.</p> <p><em>I\u2019m gonna go ahead and assume that\u2019s your brother you\u2019re with, </em>one 32-year-old messages me.<br /><em>Na. That your cat? </em>I joke about the caged tiger he is crouching over in one of his.<br />Radio silence.</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>My initial hypothesis is that Tinder <em>is</em> the Grindr for straight people. Of the different apps that tried to corner the market circa 2010, Tinder certainly seems to have been the most successful. However, Henry \u2013 who uses both \u2013 is skeptical of the idea that the two apps are comparable.</p> <p>\u201cGrindr has an immediacy that Tinder doesn\u2019t; Grindr shows you only people who have logged on in the past hour, and you can see whether they are online at the moment. That immediacy makes hookups much more possible than I think Tinder does.\u201d</p> <p>Both Grindr and Tinder are mobile dating apps that rely on geolocation technology: they propose prospective partners in some proximity to your physical location. Grindr, which is geared toward gay and bisexual men, came first; it launched in 2009. Tinder followed in 2012. They are similar in purpose but their designs are different. Tinder displays just one person at a time, while Grindr presents a grid of active users, listed in order of how close they are to you in space.</p> <p>\u201cGrindr is different in New York,\u201d the friend who recommended Whole Foods pointed out. \u201cAnywhere else, you\u2019re dealing in miles. In New York, it\u2019s feet.\u201d<br />It\u2019s true. By the time Henry and I settle in a bar, the app shows 179 active users who are less than 10 minutes away on foot. One especially cute one appears to be within 20 feet but Henry shakes his head.<br />\u201cYou\u2019ll never find him. He could be anywhere. He could live in one of the apartments upstairs. He could be walking by on the street.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>By the time Henry and I settle in a bar, the app shows 179 active users who are less than ten minutes away by foot</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Henry seems to be right about immediacy: my half-hearted Tinder efforts do not generate much data. So I let my app idle and start up Facebook chats with a dozen friends and friends of friends who have agreed to speak with me about the subject of apps that let men look for men. As I do, I start to understand the problem with the design of our little experiment.</p> <p>A friend, in his mid-20s, who currently works at the University of Michigan, put it this way in a Facebook message:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>There\u2019s a sort of sexualized hierarchy that is well understood among the different applications. I don\u2019t know any gay people who cruise digitally on OkCupid. But it\u2019s not at all uncommon on Grindr or Jack\u2019d or Scruff. The \u2018straighter\u2019 an application\u2019s user base, the more likely someone is to be either: 1) presenting as super mainstream or 2) looking for a LTR rather than casual sex.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>By \u201cLTR\u201d the University of Michigan friend means \u201clong-term relationship\u201d. For the first-time Grindr user, browsing through other users \u2013 whose profile photos are arranged, like tiles, in a grid according to proximity (with filters by eg, age, if you like), and can be tapped to reveal a short profile \u2013 there is an entire lexicon to learn. Regulars, FWB, role, now, looking, POZ, hung, BB. </p> <p>From the beginning, as I said, I was skeptical of my editor\u2019s question: why isn\u2019t there a Grindr for straight people? Why is there no quorum of heteros who want truly casual, convenient sex? In the research that I conducted for my book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Labor-Love-Invention-Moira-Weigel/dp/0374182531\">Labor of Love</a>, I found that there were countless varieties not only of apps but of ways of using apps, of mobile phone enabled sexual communities and cultures. For instance, last November, I interviewed a group of trans women. They talked about using Facebook to meet and screen dates, for who might be dangerous \u2013 or simply promiscuous, serial daters in their community, fetishists, fantasists</p> <p>\u201cSometimes you go out with a cis guy,\u201d one African American woman in her late 30s guffawed, \u201cand you think, \u2018This is great. This guy is holding his head up high, walking with me, walking his truth.\u2019 Then you find out he lived his truth with the last hundred trans women! You have a hundred mutual friends and every single one is a member of the community. You find out he\u2019s been with all of them\u201d</p> <p>\u2022\u2022\u2022</p> <p>In casual conversations about dating apps, I have often heard friends refer to how men are or women are. How gays are or straights are. Specifically, they often rely on stereotypes \u2013 for instance, that gay men are universally promiscuous or that women, gay or straight, do not really like sex.<br /></p> <p>We are accustomed to think of sex and love as eternal and unchanging. Tech entrepreneurs are therefore inclined to believe that if they could simply create the right widget to plug into eternal human desires and behaviors they could make untold fortunes. However, these are fantasies. The history of love, sex and dating show that our beliefs about romance and its rituals change much more dramatically over time than we tend to remember. As recently as 1905, advice columnists told straight young men and women that romantic interest ALWAYS had to be initiated by the female party \u2013 and her parents. More recently than that, LGBT folks were told that their desires were dangerous, deviant and would make them sick. </p> <p>But dating apps that work well don\u2019t work well because they capture any such essence of gender or sexuality. There is no one way all men or women desire; every person has his or her own sexuality. All successful dating apps succeed because they recreate versions of older dating institutions and experiences in a new, digitally networked form. And what Grindr seeks to approximate are specifically sites of LGBT liberation and community: gay bars, bathhouses, gyms and so on. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Successful dating apps succeed because they recreate versions of dating institutions in a new, digitally networked form</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You can see it in the way they emphasize strangers mingling in space. You can see it in how many of the profile pictures literally depict muscled bodies with lockers in the background. Some friends I chat with lament the fact that these apps have replaced the significance of the brick and mortar bar, which was such an important institution of the gay liberation actions of the 1960s and 1970s. Henry emphasizes that today, in gay bars, the app lays a new kind of social network onto an old one; virtual and real space interact.</p> <p>\u201cToday, most men who go into gay bars alone, whether locals or tourists with mobile data plans, are on Grindr while at the bar, instead of interacting directly with new people around them,\u201d Henry says. He demurs as to whether this is good or bad.</p> <p>App users are building on these preexisting institutions, which were themselves created through decades if not centuries of development, tradition and political struggle \u2013 and not because they tap directly into something about universal \u201cgay\u201d nature. There is no such thing.</p> <p>Those places had particular protocols, and they were different from the protocols of the straight singles bar. </p> <p>There is a long history of entrepreneurs who saw the commercial potential of sexual subcultures that developed organically, and tried to make them \u201cmainstream\u201d\u2013 ie to make a \u201cstraight\u201d version, as a way of scaling it. For instance, the founder of TGI Friday\u2019s, the first singles bar in America, was inspired by the thriving gay bars he saw in the West Village in the 1960s. His gay bar for straight people made a splash for a while before being franchised into the internationally ubiquitous chain restaurant that has to be the least sexy place on earth. </p> <p>This is why I was wrong: Tinder is not the straight Grindr and never will be. It more closely approximates the institution that its founders came out of, and the kinds of behaviors associated with it: not the bathhouse but the frat house, not political liberation but the college campus free-for-all.</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 23 May 2016.

      "body": "<p><strong>Louise Doughty was born in the East Midlands in 1963. She took an MA in creative writing at the University of East Anglia and has written eight novels, including her latest, Black Water, which is published by Faber on 2 June.</strong></p> <p><strong><em>Black Water</em> is your eighth novel, and is set in Bali, a place you\u2019d never been to until a few years ago. Why are your books always changing direction?</strong><br />I\u2019ve realised over the years that I\u2019m just no good at thinking strategically as a novelist. I never think, oh this did really well, I\u2019ll do it again. I\u2019m much more likely to think, oh this did really well, let\u2019s do something completely different now.</p> <p><strong>And it is very different from the two novels that preceded it, </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jun/06/whatever-you-love-louise-doughty\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Whatever You Love</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em>and </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/16/apple-tree-yard-doughty-review\" title=\"\"><strong><em>Apple Tree Yard</em></strong></a><strong>\u2026</strong><br />They were both female first-person narratives, with a lot in the present tense, so they were very immediate. They were also very much about women\u2019s preoccupations at certain stages in life: so <em>Whatever You Love</em>, having children, <em>Apple Tree Yard</em>, being a middle-aged woman having knee tremblers in parliament. I think I just really needed to do something in a different tone of voice.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/jun/16/apple-tree-yard-doughty-review\">Apple Tree Yard by Louise Doughty \u2013 review</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>So, how did <em>Black Water</em> take shape?</strong><br />I was at the Ubud literary festival on Bali in 2012, and I had terrible jet lag. And also I was probably drinking one too many cocktails at the festival parties. I was lying awake every night, and the night-time in rural Indonesia is very noisy \u2013 geckoes on the roof, monkeys, cicadas, insects, monsoon rain. So I was awake a lot, listening to the noises, and a really strong image came to me of a man lying awake at night in a hut in Indonesia, mortally afraid.</p> <p><strong>Why is he so afraid?</strong><br />In the opening pages, he decides that men with machetes are going to come and kill him. But I didn\u2019t actually know who he was, I didn\u2019t know how old he was, I didn\u2019t know why he was there. But what I did know about him was that what he was afraid of wasn\u2019t what was going to happen; he was afraid of something that he himself had done.</p> <p><strong>The novel goes into the history of Indonesia, and in particular the massacres of communists and suspected communists in 1965. And your character, Harper, is deeply implicated, isn\u2019t he?</strong><br />Of course, he\u2019s a metaphor for Indonesia itself. Because a military dictator came to power in 1965, there was never any truth and reconciliation, there was never any coming to terms with this massacre.</p> <p>It\u2019s still very difficult to talk about 1965. Nobody would say, for many years, if their father had been killed in \u201965, because any family association with a communist, you would lose your job, it was dangerous. And also, in a lot of places, it was whole families that were killed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I thought Apple Tree Yard was a feminist indictment of criminal justice</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Your earliest novels, <em>Crazy Paving</em> and <em>Dance With Me</em>, got mixed in with \u201cchicklit\u201d. How did that feel?</strong><br /><em>Crazy Paving </em>is about urban terrorism and chaos theory \u2013 but it had single women running around London as its heroines. <em>Dance With Me </em>was about mental illness and sexual betrayal and ghosts, but it had a single woman, who was promiscuous, as the main character. So there was this awful phase \u2013 and thank heavens it\u2019s gone \u2013 where no young woman could write about what it was like to be a young woman in any style whatsoever without being lumped in that bracket.</p> <p><strong>Your novel <em>Fires in the Dark </em>was, again, very different.</strong><br />I was always going to write that book. That was my Holocaust novel, and that was about a group of nomadic Kalderash Roma in central Europe in 1927; they go through the great depression, the rise of Nazism, the second world war \u2013 and then it ends with the Prague uprising, May 1945.</p> <p>My family left central Europe in the mid-19th century, possibly earlier, so that wasn\u2019t what had happened to our family, but it was what might have happened if we had stayed.</p> <p><strong><em>Apple Tree Yard</em> really caught people\u2019s imagination \u2013 and now it\u2019s becoming a TV series,</strong><a href=\"http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-01-12/emily-watson-and-ben-chaplin-to-lead-cast-of-new-bbc1-political-thriller-apple-tree-yard\" title=\"\"><strong> with Emily Watson in the lead</strong></a><strong>. Did you intend to write a thriller?</strong><br />Well, the weird thing is, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m writing thrillers, but quite a lot of other people seem to. I thought <em>Apple Tree Yard</em> was a feminist indictment of criminal justice, and an explanation of a middle-aged woman who [whispers] has sex.</p> <p><strong>So, the big question is \u2013 will the next book be yet another dramatic change?</strong><br />I don\u2019t know how to do it any other way. I\u2019m just not capable of it. I can only write whatever idea grips my by the throat and holds me against the wall, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve done so far, and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve got to keep doing.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-23T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>On a sunny day just after the publication of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/12/bbc-white-paper-key-points-john-whittingdale\" title=\"\">the BBC white paper</a>, Michael Grade\u2019s office feels like an 80s film set, all black and chrome fittings in a building next to Mayfair\u2019s Playboy Club.</p> <p>Made a peer five years ago, Lord Grade has stood the test of time better than his neighbours, if the frequency of his media appearances is anything to go by. He was hard to miss on television on the day the white paper was published, and within five minutes of sitting down to talk in his office it\u2019s obvious that\u2019s not just because of his career at the top of the BBC, Channel 4 and ITV. Grade is so full of opinions, he almost writes his own headlines.</p> <p>Whether asked about the BBC (\u201cthey got an amazing deal\u201d), <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/12/vote-leave-lambasts-itv-over-eu-debate-between-cameron-and-farage\" title=\"\">the attack on ITV </a>by the Vote Leave campaign (\u201cdisgusting, really shocking\u201d) or Channel 4, (\u201cI\u2019m very strongly in favour of privatisation\u201d), Grade offers ready-made copy half a century after leaving newspapers and seven years after his last executive job in television.</p> <p>At 73, he neither holds back nor offers regrets. Saying that the white paper gave the BBC\u2019s commercial rivals \u201cnothing\u201d, he believes the \u201cluvvies\u201d who offered the corporation support in the run-up to its publication should apologise. \u201cI do think that all the luvvies have made complete idiots of themselves. Bleeding all over the TV screen. Honestly,\u201d he snorts. \u201cYou\u2019d think they\u2019d have the good grace to speak out and say, \u2018We were wrong\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Grade, who outed himself as a Conservative party member just before he was made a Tory peer in 2010, goes on to say that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/08/wolf-hall-director-says-bbc-is-under-threat\" title=\"\">the complaints </a>from the likes of Wolf Hall director Peter Kosminsky were \u201cpolitical\u201d and \u201canti-Tory\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cIt demeans them not to apologise as this is a great result for the BBC,\u201d he says of a white paper which will still radically overhaul BBC governance (for his part, Kosminsky <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/16/im-slaughtered-by-the-right-for-criticising-bbc-reform-at-the-baftas-why\" title=\"\">has already hit back</a> at his rightwing detractors).</p> <p>Grade may be known for his red socks but his views on the BBC\u2019s commercial impact are remarkably similar to those of his true blue friend John Whittingdale. \u201cThe only criticism I would have is that they haven\u2019t really looked at the sheer size of the BBC,\u201d he says.</p> <p>As for \u201crecipegate\u201d, in which the BBC first announced last week it was closing the food website before insisting it was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/17/bbc-climbdown-over-online-recipes-after-public-outcry\" title=\"\">simply transferring most of its most popular recipes </a>to its commercial site, Grade says he found it hard to get too excited. Describing himself as \u201cmore interested in eating than cooking\u201d, he says: \u201cThere is no doubt that the success of the BBC free website has reduced choice \u2013 it\u2019s such a fully comprehensive site.\u201d</p> <p>The popularity of the BBC\u2019s website, and indeed so much of its output, is what saves it, he adds. \u201cIn the end no politician of any party wants to go down as the person who destroyed the BBC. As long as there is widespread public support for the BBC.\u201d</p> <p>Given that he approved of the setting up of the BBC Trust as the last chair of governors in 2006, Grade should have a unique view on the controversy over the white paper and governance.</p> <p>Yet he groans when it is mentioned. Not because of his own role, but because it\u2019s \u201cboring\u201d, he says.</p> <p>Once he\u2019d agreed to the creation of the trust - now considered an impossible hybrid, part-champion, part-regulator - Grade promptly jumped ship for ITV. He says the trust was [then culture secretary] \u201cTessa Jowell\u2019s idea, which I supported\u201d but that it was an improvement on the \u201ccompletely broken arrangement\u201d of the governors.</p> <p>Not one for regrets \u2013 \u201cI never look back, there\u2019s no point\u201d \u2013 he says he wishes the trustees had been able to control all executive pay and not just that of the director general.</p> <p>His views on the proposed new unitary board are informed by his obvious frustration as chair when he says it was often difficult to access all the necessary information from staff members. \u201cIf you\u2019re responsible for the money, you\u2019ve got to be inside the BBC,\u201d he says. \u201cI hope that the sense of caring for the public\u2019s money will not be left to Ofcom which will only come in post facto. Stopping things happening before they do, that\u2019s the board\u2019s job.\u201d</p> <p>A former journalist who joined the Daily Mirror as a reporter in 1960, he is robust in his defence of the BBC\u2019s independence while having little to say about the idea of the government appointing six members of the new board. He admits to two concerns, though. As an erstwhile agent, famous for bringing Bruce Forsyth among many other stars to the BBC, he believes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/12/government-to-force-bbc-to-declare-star-salaries\" title=\"\">the decision</a> to make it disclose the salary of all those paid more than \u00a3450,000 will be \u201cinflationary\u201d. \u201cI know exactly what will happen. One thousand clients will ring their agents and say \u2018why is he or she getting that and I\u2019m not!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>He also fears that the National Audit Office will extend its oversight to news coverage, something the parliamentary spending watchdog has denied. \u201cI would be concerned \u2026 if the NAO were to start pronouncing on how much the BBC devoted to coverage of the referendum, for example,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He is outraged over the official Leave campaign making legal threats against ITV for choosing Nigel Farage to take part in an EU debate next month and believe it smacks of political bullying. \u201cIt\u2019s just not acceptable and I really would like to hear Michael [Gove] and Boris [Johnson] and the others, who I have got huge respect for, dissociate themselves.</p> <p>\u201cIf this was a tinpot lobbying organisation it could say what it liked, but this is led by cabinet ministers. People will probably be in cabinet afterwards and to use that power \u2026 It takes the normal push and pull of election campaigns to a new low.

The girls form a detective society and solve the mystery of the murdered teachers. </p> <p>I think children aged 9+ would enjoy the book if they read it to themselves. Maybe someone older could read it to younger children as they would enjoy it just as much. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"650a02447446ff847b8312ea33f1750f942f91de\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/650a02447446ff847b8312ea33f1750f942f91de/0_0_261_400/261.jpg\" alt=\"Murder Most Unladylike\" width=\"261\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I loved this book! I liked it because just when they are on the cusp of solving the mystery, it suddenly all falls apart! It also has two of my favourite things to read about in one book \u2013 mysteries and boarding schools. I give it five stars out of five! My favourite bit of the book was when Mademoiselle reveals her secret! </p> <h2><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/charlie-bone-and-the-shadow-of-badlock.html\">Charlie Bone and the Shadow of Badlock</a> by Jenny Nimmo</h2> <p><strong>Review by Aleksandra</strong></p> <p>This book is about Charlie\u2019s adventures in Badlock. It is the seventh book in the Charlie Bone series and I\u2019ve loved them all. In this instalment, Charlie is \u2018endowed\u2019 and his \u2018capacity\u2019 is being able to know what people are saying in photos. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a40f7655724a4cd3bcb48e4fdb82ea8ee99a02f2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a40f7655724a4cd3bcb48e4fdb82ea8ee99a02f2/0_0_261_400/261.jpg\" alt=\"Charlie Bone and the Shadow of Badlock\" width=\"261\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anyone who loves magic would really enjoy this book. Perhaps children of 8+ would like it best. </p> <p>I really liked it as much as all the other Charlie Bone books. I love them because they take me into another world. I give it 4.5 stars out of five. </p> <h2><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/witch-wars.html\">Witch Wars</a> by Sibeal Pounder </h2> <p><strong>Review by Emily</strong></p> <p>This book is about a girl called Tiga Whicabim. She lives in the shed with a horrible old lady. She discovers a fairy who takes her down the sink pipes for witch wars. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"3ec750d3387e6b27ca7faa51c635c13e75232aac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3ec750d3387e6b27ca7faa51c635c13e75232aac/0_0_283_400/283.jpg\" alt=\"witch wars\" width=\"283\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I think children aged 6-8 would enjoy this book because it has just the right context. I liked it because it was about a competition and competitions are really fun to read about. I was curious about who would be disqualified. </p> <p>I give this book three stars out of five. </p> <h2><strong>Want to tell the world about a book you\u2019ve read? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site</a> and send us your review!</strong></h2>",

      "body": "<p>Could we be about to elect a one-man financial bubble as president of the United States of America?<br /></p> <p> Donald Trump released his second annual <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/17/fec-financial-disclosure-donald-trump-net-worth\">personal financial disclosure</a> statement last week. It was the largest ever and \u201ctremendous\u201d, according to Trump. And it did indeed show that the Trump brand appears to be thriving, financially speaking.</p> <p> But what remains unclear is whether this kind of financial wellbeing is a substantial, blue-chip prosperity, or whether it\u2019s of the frothy Groupon variety.</p> <p>Don\u2019t remember Groupon? Launched in 2008 as one of the first of the daily deals websites, Groupon rapidly became a darling of the startup universe. A cover star of Forbes magazine as \u201cthe fastest growing company ever\u201d Groupon\u2019s investors celebrated as revenues soared from $313m in 2010 to $1.6bn the following year. They also ignored the fact that its marketing expenses more than doubled to reach $768m in the same time frame; by 2012, marketing spending accounted for a whopping 48% of Groupon\u2019s total revenues. </p> <p>Once Groupon went public, in late 2011, all of those figures were made public in SEC filings for investors to scrutinize, and <a href=\"http://www.sramanamitra.com/2015/12/21/from-unicorn-to-unicorpse-how-groupon-fell-from-grace/\">they didn\u2019t like what they saw</a>. Since going public, Groupon has continued to post growth in revenues and users, but its margins have remained anemic and the rare quarterly profit it has posted has only come as a result of an asset sale, and not because it is running its businesses at a profit. Hype met hard data and <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/011316/can-groupon-make-comeback-2016.asp\">Groupon\u2019s bubble went pop</a>.</p> <p>Could the same cycle be coming for Trump Inc?</p> <p>When Trump declared his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination, his finances were already at the heart of his campaign. \u201cI\u2019m really rich,\u201d <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2015/06/16/politics/donald-trump-2016-announcement-elections/\">he said at the time of his announcement</a>, noting that his wealth (and his success in business) qualified him to be president.</p> <p>How rich, precisely, remains a hotly debated topic. The candidate himself insists that <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/17/donald-trump-pegs-net-worth-at-10b-in-filing.html\">he\u2019s worth at least $10bn</a>. Deny that, and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/that-time-trump-sued-over-the-size-of-hiswallet/2016/03/08/785dee3e-e4c2-11e5-b0fd-073d5930a7b7_story.html\">you risk being sued</a>. But like Groupon before its IPO, Trump is only providing the public with some of the information that they\u2019d need to get a complete view of his finances, and to understand whether he\u2019s running them well and profitably or not. Because, as Groupon (and countless other bubble companies) remind us, a dollar in revenue or gross income does not equate to a dollar in profits or net (after tax and other expenses) income \u2013 much as Trump has tried to conflate the two in his own statements.</p> <p>Just consider Trump\u2019s own description of his disclosure filing with the Federal Election Commission, which, in true Trump style, he notes that he is proud to say is \u201cthe largest ever in the history of the FEC\u201d.</p> <p>On the one hand, <a href=\"https://www.donaldjtrump.com/press-releases/donald-j.-trump-files-personal-financial-disclosure-form-with-the-federal-e\">the press release notes</a> that it shows \u201ca tremendous cash flow and a revenue increase of approximately $190m\u201d. It then promptly states: \u201cThis income was utilized, among other things, for the funding of construction projects at various multi-million dollar developments, reduction of debt and the funding of the campaign.\u201d</p> <p>What we are seeing are <a href=\"http://fortune.com/video/2016/03/11/donald-trump-revenue/\">gross revenues</a>, as Shawn Tully at Fortune has pointed out in his own attempts to calculate Trump\u2019s net worth. There is a difference between cash flow and revenue, income or profits. </p> <p>Essentially, for most presidential candidates, a personal financial disclosure (PFD) will capture their salaries, or investment income. In Trump\u2019s case, the numbers tell a different story. We simply don\u2019t know what Trump\u2019s bottom line looks like yet. To do that, we\u2019d need to have a clear view of his costs \u2013 the equivalent of that giant marketing spending by Groupon. </p> <p>For instance, he reported royalties of between $1m and $5m from sales of his most recent book, Crippled America, published in conjunction with his campaign. But how much has he himself spent to promote that book, costs that would reduce the net profit to him from the book\u2019s royalties? Have any of his companies bought copies of the book to distribute at rallies, thus boosting sales and royalties, but eating into the net benefit? (Neither would be uncommon practices, incidentally.)</p> <p>We\u2019d also need to understand his obligations: how much he owes to creditors. That, too, is hard to gauge, given the way that Trump presents both the asset value and the debt associated with at least some of the properties in which he has an interest, <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/03/23/donald-trump-debt/\">as Fortune\u2019s Tully has shown</a>.</p> <p>Above all, we don\u2019t know what tax rate Trump is paying on whatever revenues he has told us he is generating from these assets. The assets may have grown in number over the last year, as the PFD shows; the revenue stream may have increased. But without knowing what tax rate he\u2019s paying and what his costs are, we don\u2019t know how good a job he\u2019s doing at what really matters: ending up breaking even or with a profit at the end of the day. </p> <p>Trump has declared that what he pays in taxes is \u201c<a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/donald-trump-refuses-reveal-tax-rate-business/story?id=39086788\">none of your business</a>\u201d. Voters, he said, don\u2019t have an automatic right to see his tax returns before making their decision in November. He added that he won\u2019t release them until an IRS audit, now under way, is complete, although the IRS has said he is free do so at any time.</p> <p>We, the voters, would be hiring Trump as the country\u2019s CEO and CFO. We want to be sure we\u2019d be hiring someone who would run not a bubble company like Groupon, but with at least as savvy an eye to the bottom line as some of the blue-chip companies in Trump\u2019s own investment portfolio: Alphabet (the former Google); Microsoft, AT&amp;T, Procter &amp; Gamble. The \u201ccompany\u201d that President Trump runs wouldn\u2019t need to be flashy or earn spectacular returns, but it would need to stay solvent and still be in business four or eight years from now. </p> <p>We need to learn from the experiences of those early investors in Groupon, who bought shares in a company without digging into its financial statements. Trump\u2019s business enterprises may well be solid, but the SEC wouldn\u2019t let you or me invest in them based on the level of disclosure provided to us in the FEC\u2019s statements. So why should we end up \u201cowning\u201d a bubble president, just because we couldn\u2019t get adequate financial disclosure? Especially given that so much of Trump\u2019s campaign, and his appeal to voters, relies on <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/03/01/trump-supporters-say-they-are-drawn-to-his-success-independence.html\">his apparent prowess in business</a>. </p> <p>In the case of Groupon, at least, investors who bought shares in the IPO should have been well aware of the perils: the <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1490281/000104746911005613/a2203913zs-1.htm\">company\u2019s IPO prospectus</a> contained more than 20 pages of risk factors. In making the decision whether or not to \u201cinvest\u201d in Trump, however, we need a lot more financial information than we\u2019ve got at present. Simply being \u201cthe largest\u201d financial disclosure on record doesn\u2019t make Trump\u2019s \u201cthe best\u201d.</p> <p>Alas, we can\u2019t get Trump to submit the equivalent of an IPO filing with the SEC, complete with the requisite investor warnings. That\u2019s unfortunate, as it might be the most appropriate way to get an insight into his finances. But we can and should demand that he do what every major presidential candidate for the last 40 years has done, and submit his tax return for public scrutiny, so that we can at least try to understand how he has managed his money.</p> <p>To Trump, this all seems to be about maximizing our perception of how much money he has. To the rest of us, it\u2019s about transparency on the part of an individual who aspires to govern the most powerful country on the planet. When someone aspires to that level of power and authority, they lose the right to say something so significant \u201cis none of your business\u201d.</p>",

Because it would be very dangerous if at precisely the moment the NHS is going to need extra funding actually the economy goes into a tailspin and that funding is not there,\u201d Stevens told BBC1\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show. </p> <p>\u201cIt has been true for the 68 years of the NHS\u2019s history that when the British economy sneezes the NHS catches a cold. This would be a terrible time for that to happen, at just the time that the NHS is going to need that investment.\u201d</p> <p>Stevens said it was not his job to tell the British people how to vote, but made it very clear that he believed there was no potential benefit to the NHS from Brexit.</p> <p>The interview came after the defence minister Penny Mordaunt said that Britain\u2019s \u00a310bn net contribution to the EU could be spent on other areas, arguing that the NHS and social care would be at, or close to, the top of the list.</p> <p>She also claimed that the EU would not be able to stop the accession of countries such as Turkey, which Vote Leave claims will simply mount further pressure on public services.</p> <p>Stevens rejected the argument, choosing to cite the case of the local hospital in Portsmouth, where Mordaunt is a Conservative MP, saying he was looking up the figures during her interview.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/22/brexit-britain-anger-in-appledore-fishing-industry-demise\">Brexit Britain: \u2018Foreign boats catch fish in our waters and then ship it back to us\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAt her local hospital, 80 of the doctors are from the rest of the European Union, 350 nurses in her local hospital from the EU. If only a proportion of those chose to up sticks and off on the 23 June that would create real problems in hospitals across the country.\u201d</p> <p>He said the NHS had benefited \u201cenormously\u201d from 130,000 European Union doctors, nurses and care-workers.</p> <p>Asked about the \u00a310bn cited by leave campaigners, Stevens said the UK\u2019s statistics authority had claimed it was more sensible to use a lower figure, and said it did not represent a large amount of extra funding for the NHS. </p> <p>He then added: \u201cThat is enough to fund the NHS for 19 days a year. The other 11.5 months a year, it is the performance of the economy that is what will count.\u201d</p> <p>Stevens said he was offering an \u201cobjective, non-sensationalist\u201d view of the referendum, something that leave campaigners took to Twitter to disagree with. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/picture/2016/may/22/europe-devours-one-of-her-children\">Europe devours one of her children</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The prime minister said it was right for \u201cexperts\u201d such as Stevens to make their case in what was a critical referendum. </p> <p>David Cameron told ITV\u2019s Peston on Sunday that Stevens was careful about the way he had made his argument. Cameron said: \u201cAll the experts seem to be saying \u2013 the IMF, the ECB, the Bank of England, the Treasury, the Office of Budget Responsibility are all saying \u2013 the economy would suffer if we left the European Union and single market, and that is quite a consensus.

strike</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Islamabad has long argued the only way to end the war in Afghanistan is to try to coax a united Taliban to the table for peace talks.</p> <p>It has dismissed calls to take military action against an insurgent group whose support networks operate freely in Pakistan, saying attempts to start negotiations must be exhausted first.</p> <p>But amid deadly Taliban attacks, including an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/20/death-toll-rises-talibans-deadliest-attack-kabul-since-2011\">April suicide bombing</a> in Kabul that killed 64 people, the Afghan government has run out of patience with Islamabad and has demanded firm action <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/20/death-toll-rises-talibans-deadliest-attack-kabul-since-2011\">against Taliban networks based on Pakistani soil</a>.</p> <p>Kabul says Pakistan\u2019s unwillingness proves it is not prepared to end its longstanding relationship with a movement that Islamabad values as a means of influencing events in Afghanistan.</p> <p>Pakistan directly helped the Taliban in its conquest of Afghanistan in the early 1990s and was one of only a handful of governments to recognise the fundamentalist regime before the US-led intervention in 2001.</p> <p>The killing of Mansoor suggests the US agrees with the demands of the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, that \u201cirreconcilable\u201d insurgents based in Pakistan should be targeted.</p> <p>In a highly unusual public statement about a drone strike, a Pentagon official described Mansoor as \u201can obstacle to peace and reconciliation between the government of Afghanistan and the Taliban, prohibiting Taliban leaders from participating in peace talks with the Afghan government\u201d.</p> <p>But is far from clear whether Mansoor\u2019s death will smooth the way to an end to the conflict.</p> <p>He has no obvious successor, though one of his two appointed deputies may assume power in the immediate aftermath. Neither is known as a proponent of reconciliation.</p> <p>One, Haibatullah Akhundzada, a renowned cleric from the Taliban heartland of Kandahar, is a relatively unknown figure outside the movement. </p> <p><a href=\"https://unama.unmissions.org/sites/default/files/sg_report_september_2015_0.pdf\">According to the UN</a>, Haibatullah is the Taliban\u2019s former Chief Justice. Though he was seemingly close to the movement\u2019s founder, Mullah Omar, it is unclear how much influence he holds over Taliban foot soldiers.</p> <p>The other deputy, Sirajuddin Haqqani, is the leader of the Haqqani network, which has risen to prominence in the Taliban in recent years and taken on a more central role in the insurgency.</p> <p>The group is believed to have conducted some of the most notorious terror attacks in Kabul, including the 29 April truck bomb, the 2014 attack on the Serena Hotel in Kabul and a 2014 attack on a volleyball court in eastern Afghanistan, which killed more than 50 civilians.</p> <p>While the Haqqanis do not have clout over fighters in the south, Mansoor\u2019s death could further strengthen the group\u2019s position within the insurgency, making reconciliation even more unattainable.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/17/afghanistan-ghost-soldiers-taliban-babaji\">Afghanistan's 'ghost soldiers': thousands enlisted to fight Taliban don't exist</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The attack comes in the final months of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, which has been characterised by the liberal use of drone strikes against US enemies hiding out in Pakistan\u2019s wild tribal region.</p> <p>The attacks have subsided dramatically from the high point of 2011-12 when relentless drone strikes led to intense friction between the US and Pakistan. The latter publicly condemns the drone programme despite persistent reports it secretly permits the strikes.</p> <p>The killing of Mansoor represents a remarkable expansion of the programme because it happened well outside the tribal agencies of North and South Waziristan where nearly all known strikes have taken place, usually focusing on al-Qaida and allied groups.</p> <p>US officials said the attack took place near Ahmad Wal, suggesting it was the first ever known strike in the vast southern province of Balochistan, where the insurgency\u2019s \u201cQuetta Shura\u201d leadership council is thought to be based, and one of very few to target a senior member of the Afghan Taliban.</p> <p>The drones were described as having been piloted by US special forces \u2013 suggesting it was not a CIA operation, as is usually the case with attacks inside Pakistan.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-22T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Margo Jefferson was born in Chicago in 1947. She was for many years a theatre critic at the <em>New York Times </em>and is now professor of the professional practice of writing at Columbia University.</p> <p><strong>Negroland, a memoir of your growing up in the emergent and precarious postwar elite of black society in America, feels like something you have long contemplated writing. What made you write it now?</strong><br />Well, you know how writers are. There are some things that you want to acknowledge very directly and there are others that are lurking. It takes a while for them to emerge. This one was\u00a0lurking.</p> <p><strong>Was some of that due to what you describe as the ingrained unease at making a spectacle of yourself?</strong><br />You were not supposed to show off in Negroland because you are supposed to be perfectly decorous and well behaved. You were also not supposed to tell any stories that reflected badly on the group because that reflected badly on the race. I use past tense but it still feels like present tense.</p> <p><strong>The word Negro is still very charged. Is it a hard word to use in the States?</strong><br />I was a little anxious about using it as a title. Which is why I kept trying to explain its historical, cultural, almost mythical resonance. I think for a while there was a kind of debate about whether you could bring back Negro and reclaim it, and then it was black versus African American; now I have noticed in conversation that black people will use all three terms depending on context. I don\u2019t advocate one term.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"15d62f9c1afc6c976b793e4c868d4d4ef521eb0a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/15d62f9c1afc6c976b793e4c868d4d4ef521eb0a/0_0_1976_1441/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Margot (back row, centre) as co-captain of her high-school cheerleading team, 1964.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"729\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margot (back row, centre) as co-captain of her high-school cheerleading team, 1964.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Margot Jefferson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>It still sounds very different in a white person\u2019s mouth.</strong><br />Yes, that\u2019s true. It is kind of an intimate word at this point, with lots of signifiers around it.</p> <p><strong>The society you describe in the book is a very particular historical moment really, before the civil rights movement, but\u00a0does\u00a0it persist socially?</strong><br />There are still Negro elites. Many of them are obviously much richer, and perhaps a little more integrated into what remains a white power structure. But those old rituals from the social clubs, to the broadly segregated white and black schools, to an obsessive interest in ancestry, all of that does still exist. Look: we are a class-bound society.</p> <p><strong>One way back into the history is through the lives of your parents. You kick off one chapter with an extraordinary letter your mother wrote to her friend, while she and your father were living in segregated army accommodation during the war. The letter is full of very polite observation and gossip, but it ends with that devastating line [\u201cI\u2019m so happy\u2026 Sometimes I almost forget I\u2019m a Negro.\u201d] I\u2019m guessing that was one trigger for you thinking about these things? </strong><br />It was. Mother had given me that letter some years ago. I can remember sitting at the breakfast-room table with my sister and my niece and reading this out loud and can still see their faces, which clearly mirrored mine. It was like: Oh my God! That last line knocked us out.</p> <p><strong>It was quite unusual for her to talk in those\u00a0terms?</strong><br />That is right. It was. Though it was typical of her to put it in a PS with a slightly ironic air.</p> <p><strong>It is obviously easier to escape from those imposed identities \u2013 but not as easy as you would want it to be even now.</strong><br />I think culturally it is true for blacks in America and every other group that when an identity is forced upon you, you do internalise it to a degree. I think that is still there, but you are perhaps more conscious now that you are grappling with it. We used to talk a lot about \u201cwhite privilege\u201d and privilege meant partly the idea that you didn\u2019t have to think constantly about race, or class or gender. I see this book as an attempt to look at all those three things\u00a0together.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2bba9a152542be13845345fe74c31b3d5e8bfd46\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bba9a152542be13845345fe74c31b3d5e8bfd46/13_0_601_751/400.jpg\" alt=\"Margo\u2019s high school yearbook photo, 1964.\" width=\"400\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Margo\u2019s high school yearbook photo, 1964.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Margot Jefferson</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You talk about your decision not to have a family as another gesture of liberation from some of those constraints.</strong><br />For me, yes. The key thing when it comes to partnership, marriage, children, is what your temperamental needs are, and how you see the shape of your life and what you want to be crucial in it. For me it absolutely felt like the right thing to do.</p> <p><strong>Your own mother looms large in the book. What would she have made of it?</strong><br />She only died last year. She lived to be 98. Some of the book was published in magazines as it was being written, so she saw some of it and frankly I made sure she saw some of it. I didn\u2019t show her the \u201cdeath in Negroland\u201d section about all the suicides that occurred behind closed doors, but I showed her the sections about Negroland fashion and Negroland TV. Things with humour in them. And she was tickled. She knew I was writing the book and occasionally she would say pointedly, \u201cYou know, Margo, I am a very private person\u201d and fix me with a stare. I think she would be proud of me, and admire the craft of the book, but she would by no means agree with part of it.</p> <p><strong>The suicides you mention were often brought about by the pressure to conform in Negroland, to be perfect. Pressures you felt yourself. Why did you not want to show her that?</strong><br />To be fair I had aired some of that in a theatre piece I did, and I remember overhearing my mother say to the director how painful it was for her to see that. That section of the book contains a quite severe, even harsh assessment of what I call the black bourgeoisie. Call me a coward, I\u2019m glad not to have a discussion with her about it.</p> <p><strong>When you were first working as a journalist in the 1970s, and later at the <em>New York Times</em>, did you feel you had escaped [from Negroland] for good?</strong><br />Yes and no. I was proud, pleased. I had wanted to write criticism. But I also wanted to write other kinds of things. The numbers of minority writers on culture was and is still very small. I was quite an exception.</p> <p><strong>I was struck by those scenes of you watching TV as a child with your parents: micro-analysis of how Sammy Davis Jr and Lena Horne were being treated when they were first guests on primetime shows. I\u2019m guessing that habit was very formative in your becoming a critic?</strong><br />I\u2019m sure it was. And in a way I enjoyed that constant hyper-awareness. But I have made conscious efforts to unlearn some of those habits in the sense of always obeying them. I worked very hard over the years not to be in thrall to attitudes that were confining or\u00a0snobbish.</p> <p><strong>I suppose Britain is characterised as having a class-ridden society, and America perhaps less so. But the book dwells on these incredibly fine unspoken gradations of etiquette and behaviour.</strong><br />I think that is common to every nation, but country to country the variable is perhaps what class mingles with. In America it quickly becomes a conversation about race. We have a myth of the classless society. You won\u2019t hear an American politician apart from Bernie Sanders talk about the working class. We are all middle class apparently. But it\u2019s there all the\u00a0same.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/31/black-memoir-in-2015-the-year-america-broadened-its-canon\">Black memoir in 2015: the year America broadened its canon</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Listening to this election campaign it is striking how much of it is seen in terms of an appeal to very distinct communities. Do you think that reinforces a fragmentation of the\u00a0culture?</strong><br />These essentialist identities are constantly being summoned up.

Still, I think very few people from my generation on down expected to hear that rage and fury and some of the racial underpinnings of it going on again in our lifetimes. Perhaps we should have been more cynical.</p>",

      "body": "<p>On the banks of the Godavari river, 170km north-east of Mumbai, Nashik is one of India\u2019s holiest places. Every 12 years it hosts millions of predominantly teetotal Hindu pilgrims for the Kumbh Mela, the largest religious gathering on Earth. But this central Indian city now has another, rather unlikely, claim to fame. Surrounded by 37 vineyards, Nashik is the capital of India\u2019s rapidly expanding wine industry.</p> <p>Domestic sales of Indian wine rose almost 20% in 2015, and a record 18 million litres are expected to be produced this year, and the quality is improving too: wines aimed at the Indian market are generally too sweet for international palates, but drier export varieties have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/12/indian-wine-review-fiona-beckett-curry-drink-match\">won awards and a place on supermarket shelves (including in Marks &amp; Spencer</a>). Although there are vineyards scattered across India, Nashik district is at the heart of the industry, accounting for 80% of output, thanks to a favourable climate, fertile soils and a long grape-growing history.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab005872374fbe2d464cf57c46faba603f991976\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab005872374fbe2d464cf57c46faba603f991976/0_374_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Picking grapes at the Sula vineyard in Nashtik,  India\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Picking grapes at the Sula vineyard in Nashtik, the \u2018wine capital of India\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Wine tourism is taking off too, with several vineyards offering tours, tastings and accommodation. At the forefront is <a href=\"http://www.sulawines.com/\">Sula</a>, the country\u2019s biggest producer. Its swish terrace bar, overlooking rows of vines, attracts a steady stream of hip Mumbaikars, as well as a few foreign tourists. Sommeliers are on hand to guide visitors through Sula\u2019s wine list: the smoky merlot-malbec blend, refreshingly fruity sauvignon blanc and rich, oak-aged shiraz were my highlights, especially when matched with homemade <em>khakhra</em>, spiced Gujarati crackers served with a tangy tomato and cashew nut chutney. </p> <p>Gazing across the vineyard towards Gangapur lake and pink-brown hills beyond, I could almost imagine myself in the Napa Valley \u2013 until my auto-rickshaw spluttered into view, the driver tooting his horn and the exhaust sending up a plume of smoke. <br /><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Shafik Meghji is co-author of The Rough Guide to India (\u00a320.99).

The protective Oona carries Lilly into the Indonesian rainforest where they make friends with the orangutans and encounter poachers working for a murderous baddie who is destroying the forest for profit.</p> <p> First produced by the excellent Chichester Festival Youth theatre, this out-does both <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/19/how-we-made-war-horse\">War Horse</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/1999/oct/18/artsfeatures\">The Lion King</a> in the puppetry stakes. It\u2019s Finn Caldwell and Toby Oli\u00e9\u2019s lifesize animals who are the real draw in a piece that lacks a convincing emotional underpinning (Lilly\u2019s loss of both parents seem to pass almost unnoticed) and is way too earnest in the delivery of its conservation message. But it\u2019s a brilliant spectacle.</p> <p> There are cute baby orangutans, a stealthy crocodile, giant butterflies and, of course, Oona herself who requires a cast of four to manipulate her. It\u2019s lovely stuff. A large young people\u2019s ensemble play the devastating great wave with aplomb, and there\u2019s an engaging central performance from Ava Potter as Lilly, a girl who turns personal disaster into animal magic. </p> <ul> <li>At <a href=\"http://www.openairtheatre.com/\">Regent\u2019s Park Open Air theatre</a> until 12 June.

The 22-year-old woman was taken to the Queen Elizabeth hospital in Birmingham by air ambulance.</p> <p>An eyewitness, who did not want to be named, said there were several balloons in the air above a car-boot sale held by nearby Whites Nurseries. </p> <p>He said: \u201cOne of them looked like it was carrying on towards the village and I think it must have collided with the electricity lines. There were quite a few people in the field at the time.\u201d </p> <p>A Western Power Distribution spokesman said: \u201cWe had one of our 33,000 volt circuits trip - it was a momentary interruption to 2,360 customers and they were restored automatically within a minute. <br />\u201cWe had a report of a hot air balloon crash and since then we have switched the circuit out. Engineers attended and the circuit was completely isolated. They inspected the line and completed minor repairs. The line did not come down.\u201d </p> <p> Police said the accident was being investigated by the Air Accident Investigation Bureau.<br /></p> <p>Wendy Rousell, secretary of the British Balloon and Airship club, said flying conditions had been perfect on Sunday morning, and that such accidents were very rare in the UK.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-22T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>The most popular social apps \u2013 Facebook and WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram, as well as Twitter and Snapchat \u2013 have hundreds of millions of people using them. They\u2019re not in any immediate danger of being dislodged from your home screen. That hasn\u2019t stopped startups from trying, though. There are hundreds releasing new social apps all hoping to be the next big smartphone hit. Most fail, some get bought by bigger\u00a0fish as they start to grow, but many have some inventive ideas along\u00a0the way about what the next social networking trends will be. Here\u00a0are some of the social apps making waves\u00a0in 2016.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://talkshow.im/\" title=\"\">Talkshow </a></h2> <p>Subtitled \u201ctexting in public\u201d, this app aims to get people hosting virtual chatrooms about any topic they like, encouraging visitors to contribute their thoughts and images. Whether you\u2019re a host or an audience member, look for spirited debate.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://airtime.com/\" title=\"\">Airtime </a></h2> <p>Created by Napster co-founder Sean Parker, this is a new spin on group chats, using live video of you and up to five friends, while enabling you to pull in YouTube videos, Spotify music streams and gifs to\u00a0share\u00a0with the crowd.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://miitomo.com/en/\" title=\"\">Miitomo </a></h2> <p>Nintendo\u2019s long-awaited first mobile app. It\u2019s based on the games company\u2019s Mii avatars: you create a character then can dress it up, insert it into photos and send it off to\u00a0interact with friends\u2019 Miis. Quirky.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"22df8817f330e3aff6d491a2d82d9970b10d4feb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/22df8817f330e3aff6d491a2d82d9970b10d4feb/0_0_1148_689/1000.jpg\" alt=\"MSQRD app.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Change your face for better or worse with the MSQRD app.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"http://msqrd.me/\" title=\"\">MSQRD </a></h2> <p>This is one of the apps that\u00a0has made a smartphone craze out of \u201cface-swapping\u201d \u2013 and it proved so popular that Facebook bought\u00a0it. Switching visages with a friend is just one feature here though: there are other \u201cselfie animations\u201d to explore.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://peach.cool/\" title=\"\">Peach </a></h2> <p>Peach was overhyped when it launched earlier in the year, but now the excitement has died down, it has some inventive ideas. It\u2019s about messaging friends, but also sending doodles, sharing music, and rating\u2026 anything you like.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://flipagram.com/\" title=\"\">Flipagram </a></h2> <p>A bit like Instagram \u2013 you may have guessed that from the name \u2013 but with the ability to add music to your photos and videos before sharing them. Licensing deals mean the music is legit, and the app can share to Instagram and other social networks as well as its own community.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://getonce.com/\" title=\"\">Once </a></h2> <p>Is modern dating just about\u00a0swiping through dozens of Tinder profiles looking for matches? Once has a different approach, showing you a single match every day and\u00a0giving you 24 hours to get in touch with them. Or not.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.fresh.team/\" title=\"\">FreshTeam </a></h2> <p>As a messaging app for office teams, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/nov/03/why-slack-is-worth-1bn-work-chat-app\" title=\"\">Slack</a> has been very popular. Now it\u2019s facing competition from FreshTeam, which gets colleagues pinging messages back and forth, as well as jumping into voice calls and checking one another\u2019s location on a map.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIe7QJwYQA4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MIe7QJwYQA4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIe7QJwYQA4\">Watch a video about Yubl.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2><a href=\"https://www.yubl.me/\" title=\"\">Yubl </a></h2> <p>A UK social startup, Yubl is another app with an emphasis on groups: friends, not co-workers in this case. It focuses on visuals: a \u201cYubl\u201d is a square, shareable thing blending text, images, filters and interactivity \u2013 created by you.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://musical.ly\" title=\"\">Musical.ly </a></h2> <p>This is a social network for amateur music-video creators. A category that includes anyone capable of miming along to their favourite pop hit, since this is an app for making and sharing lip-sync videos with friends, in the same vein as 2015\u2019s craze <a href=\"https://www.dubsmash.com/\" title=\"\">Dubsmash</a>.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.shelfie.com/\" title=\"\">Shelfie </a></h2> <p>Shelfie is a clever app for bookworms: take a photo of your bookshelf and it\u2019ll tell you which books are available as free (or at least discounted) ebooks. But it\u2019s also a social reading network for chatting to likeminded souls.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://beme.com/\" title=\"\">Beme </a></h2> <p>Launched by YouTube star <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/caseyneistat\" title=\"\">Casey Neistat</a>, this is a video-sharing app that tries to make \u201chonesty\u201d its virtue with an emphasis on unfiltered videos. That means you can\u2019t review what\u00a0you\u2019ve shot before sharing it, but you\u00a0can see people\u2019s video reactions.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a11dcf9d921d91ebc9e3d1fe5b5d0a018b0fb1af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a11dcf9d921d91ebc9e3d1fe5b5d0a018b0fb1af/22_1_1196_718/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kimoji screengrab\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Make your life a bit more Kardashian with the Kimoji app.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"https://www.kimkardashianwest.com/support/\" title=\"\">Kimoji </a></h2> <p>Kimoji has a stinking two-and-a-half-out-of-five stars rating on Apple\u2019s app store, although it\u2019s tempting to wonder how many people are reviewing its figurehead <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/kim-kardashian\" title=\"\">Kim Kardashian</a> rather than the app. Even so, if you\u2019ve ever wished there were more shoes, nails and bottoms in your emoji keyboard, it\u2019s worth a look.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.letsmush.com\" title=\"\">Mush </a></h2> <p>Mush is a location-based social app for mothers, helping them meet other parents in their area for messaging and playdates. It also offers advice on all things involving British motherhood, from hosting birthday parties to making it around the <a href=\"http://www.nhm.ac.uk/visit/whats-on/day.html?gclid=CM2F_Lzu3swCFYMK0wodmb0KDw\" title=\"\">Natural History Museum</a> with your sanity intact.</p> <h2><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BuzzFeedQuiz/videos/891818137580439/\" title=\"\">QuizChat </a></h2> <p>News site BuzzFeed\u2019s quizzes are regularly shared on social networks, but its standalone QuizChat app aims to get you completing them with friends in pairs, before chatting about your respective hot message or YouTube cat-star alignment.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.wonderbox.io/\" title=\"\">WonderBox </a></h2> <p>Made by children\u2019s apps firm <a href=\"http://www.duckduckmoose.com/\" title=\"\">Duck Duck Moose</a>, WonderBox is a social app designed to be used within families. That means private messaging between parents and children, as well as creative challenges to share, and educational videos pulled in from YouTube.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqzRnD9Ajxg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/TqzRnD9Ajxg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TqzRnD9Ajxg\">Watch a video about Rando.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <h2><a href=\"http://randoapp.co/\" title=\"\">Rando </a></h2> <p>Rando sounds like a dreadful idea: it picks a photo at random from your smartphone, then sends it to a friend. You can also send gifs\u00a0or quotes. Its developer says he made\u00a0it to\u00a0make people think about what\u2019s\u00a0lurking\u00a0in their camera rolls, and\u00a0whether they\u2019re happy to share it.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://stylezz.com/\" title=\"\">Stylezz </a></h2> <p>The latest in an emerging category of social fashion apps. You can browse the latest outfits from fashion bloggers by following their profiles, but you can also share photos of your own clobber. Naturally, the app also helps you\u00a0buy the clothes you find.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://vidku.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Vidku </strong></a></h2> <p>Vidku is entering a crowded market of video-sharing apps, but its selling point is control. You can share your clips publicly or in private groups, with the option to \u201cunshare\u201d them from individual friends or whole groups whenever you want.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://www.rapha.cc/gb/en/rcc-application\" title=\"\"><strong>Rapha RCC </strong></a></h2> <p>Finally, a social app for cyclists, tied to the <a href=\"http://www.rapha.cc/gb/en/rcc-public-landing\" title=\"\">Rapha Cycling Club</a>. It costs \u00a3135 a year, with the app helping you see nearby rides with other members (and organise them yourself) as well as managing your profile and sharing bike talk.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The pursuit of artistic perfection is fraught with dangers for the mental equilibrium of the artist. It is a brave man indeed who declares, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/brianwilson\">Brian Wilson</a>  did 50 years ago, that he intended to make \u201cthe greatest rock and roll album ever\u201d. Once sights are set so high, there is a long way to fall.</p> <p>Yet there are many who feel that he succeeded. The album in question, the Beach Boys\u2019 Pet Sounds (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/jan/31/three-albums-1966-beatles-revolver-bob-dylan-blonde-on-blonde-beach-boys-pet-sounds\">released on the same day in May 1966 as Bob Dylan\u2019s Blonde on Blonde</a>) still frequently tops critics\u2019 polls of the best album of all time. Online, tickets to see Wilson play it in full \u2013 purportedly for the last time \u2013 on this tour are changing hands for well over three figures.</p> <p>Wilson set out on his mission looking to surpass <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/11/beach-boys-brian-wilson\">the Beatles\u2019 Rubber Soul </a>album and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/11/phil-spector-wall-of-sound\">Phil Spector\u2019s Wall of Sound </a>production technique. It worked to the degree that Paul McCartney freely confessed that the genius of Pet Sounds was the primary inspiration when the Beatles made Sgt Pepper\u2019s Lonely Hearts Club Band a year later.</p> <p>Yet Wilson\u2019s studio obsessiveness took its toll on his already fragile psyche, as did the industrial quantities of LSD that he took as the 60s progressed. He suffered various breakdowns and when he re-emerged in the early 90s, after a long period as a recluse, he appeared a notably diminished and damaged figure.</p> <p>These repercussions remain evident as the 73-year-old Wilson ambles on stage with his 10-piece band (including founding Beach Boys guitarist Al Jardine). Greeted with a standing ovation, he sits at a grand piano and gazes blankly into the auditorium with the apparent air of a man who has no idea what he is doing there, or what he is about to do.</p> <p>Yet any potential audience misgivings vanish as soon as his fingers touch the keys. Wilson was always a brilliantly alchemical songwriter, and his superbly honed and nuanced band render the shimmering harmonies and breathtaking melodies of his sumptuous back catalogue magnificently.</p> <p>He opens with a set largely drawn from his early, salad days of 1963-65, when he composed and produced nine Beach Boys albums and countless glorious singles. The beautiful haze of California Girls draws euphoric whoops from the crowd: the rudimentary rock-and-roll of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viYfWqSECAk\">Little Honda</a>  could be Eddie Cochran.</p> <p>Wilson\u2019s voice is a tad shot now, alternating between gruff and affectingly plaintive, and Jardine\u2019s son, Matt, does much of the vocal heavy lifting. Yet there is no nepotism involved there: his swooping falsetto on tracks such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y-0nWVdBH4\">Don\u2019t Worry Baby</a>  and Do It Again is prodigious.</p> <p>Yet it\u2019s when Wilson turns to the darker, more complex and multilayered material of Pet Sounds that the night truly comes alive. The exquisite <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOMyS78o5YI\">God Only Knows</a> remains one of pop\u2019s all-time-great musings on love, and on the heartbreak that can follow in its wake. It is so devotional that it sounds like a hymn.</p> <p>There was always an ineffable melancholy at the heart of the Beach Boys\u2019 songs of sun, surfing and girls, as if the awkward Wilson was writing about parties that he never got invited to. A halting lament, I Just Wasn\u2019t Made for These Times, is a lesson in loneliness: \u201cSometimes I feel so very sad,\u201d intones Wilson, his face as stonily inscrutable as ever.</p> <p>The encore is a goose pimple-inducing embarrassment of riches \u2013 Good Vibrations, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Te_lCF69Aw\">Help Me Rhonda</a>,  Surfin\u2019 USA, Fun, Fun, Fun \u2013 then the strangely distant Brian Wilson takes a bow and slowly lollops off stage like a pensionable Baloo the Bear. It\u2019s a poignant close to a spectacularly moving evening.</p> <p><em>Tuesday: O2 Apollo, Manchester. Tickets: 08444 777 677. Then touring.</em></p>",

The self-led walks range from one to eight miles, so there are activities to fit everyone\u2019s mobility.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re hoping to engage as many people as possible with the UK\u2019s diverse landscapes, and the stories they tell about our changing environments, society and economy,\u201d says society president, broadcaster and writer Nicholas Crane.</p> <p>\u201cFrom mysterious lines along mountainsides and missing rivers, to the secrets hidden behind fake houses, (Discovering Britain\u2019s) walks and viewpoints encourage everyone to learn more about our remarkable landscapes.\u201d</p>",

And if this was what \u201cthe restriction of publicly funded market intervention\u201d looked like then even Tory-voting middle-England wasn\u2019t sure it wanted it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He looked like the guest of honour at a Japanese winky party, with a  speech bubble saying \u2018Yum!\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><em>Times</em>, <em>Telegraph </em>and <em>Daily Mail </em>readers had assumed cuts to the pinko BBC would only affect all those imaginary things they didn\u2019t like, such as BBC2\u2019s <em>Gay Pet Dating Hour</em>, BBC4\u2019s <em>Paedovision </em>and the Asian Network\u2019s <em>Superstars of So-Called Islamic State</em>. But now Whittingdale was coming for Tom Kerridge\u2019s treacle-cured beef.</p> <p>\u201cIt is for the makers of cookbooks and rival websites to decide whether the continued existence of a free online recipe archive undermines their business models,\u201d a <em>Times </em>editorial lectured its suddenly starving readers on Wednesday morning, before directing them to the paper\u2019s own page 2 recipe, this week for creamed rasam with avocado\u2011lime\u00a0toast.</p> <p>I imagined John Whittingdale in his kitchen later that evening, creaming his rasam as his latest lady friend looked on admiringly. Perhaps later he would lime his avocado. I made my excuses and left.</p> <p>I knew I could have some fun with the story, which would basically write itself, and the increasingly absurd John Whittingdale always gave good column. I\u2019ll be sorry to see him tossed aside.</p> <p>Now a public relations liability to his own government, neither is Whittingdale any further use to his free-market broadcasting barons, who expected the BBC in bits in a bucket by now, and eventually he will be thrown to the dogs by dint of whatever limed avocados they can land on him.</p> <p>On Tuesday afternoon I emailed the man who runs my website asking him if, in time for Sunday\u2019s column, he could create a space where the public could upload as many recipes as they wanted to, making a kind of safari park to protect recipes from Whittingdale and his Murdoch-encouraged poachers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a2351c9ae69feed77d49d5332c090789f22555bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2351c9ae69feed77d49d5332c090789f22555bc/0_0_1790_2934/610.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by David Foldvari.\" width=\"610\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by David Foldvari.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Then I got scissors and glue and began making a photo-collage for the front page of the new site, which was to be called John Whittingdale\u2019s Recipe Reserve. Soon I had an arresting image of John Whittingdale\u2019s scrunchy laughing face with dozens of sausages and courgettes and carrots and parsnips surrounding it, and pointing into his eyes and mouth, so that he looked like the guest of honour at a Japanese winky party. And there was a speech bubble, made of newsprint cut-and-pasted from his own comments, saying, \u201cYum yum! A tempting prospect!\u201d</p> <p>Then things started to unravel. As I have explained to you all before, I remain the third most consistently critically acclaimed British standup comedian of this century, but my standing owes as much to my relentless Protestant work ethic as it does to my debatable talents, such as they are.</p> <p>On Tuesday night I arrived at Chris Coltrane\u2019s weekly <a href=\"http://www.chriscoltrane.co.uk/lolitics-my-camden-political-comedy-club.html\" title=\"\">Lolitics</a> comedy night in Camden, where I had a 20-minute new material slot. Ignorant internet commentators routinely declare that all comedy clubs are like the rigorously politically correct meetings of a Marxist cell. Sadly they aren\u2019t, and misdirected rape jokes, wilful ignorance, and minority scape-goating are often the order of the day. If anything, at most comedy nights, the Neanderthal Comment Is Free crowd would feel among friends.</p> <p>Chris Coltrane\u2019s Lolitics gig however, actually is like the rigorously politically correct meeting of a Marxist cell. And it\u2019s superb. Lolitics is such a nice gig that last night a man came up to me before my act and asked if I minded if he heckled, even offering to tell me what the heckle would be (a 50th anniversary re-tooling of the Bob Dylan \u201cJudas\u201d put-down, if you\u2019re interested). Bless.</p> <p>And unlike aggressively entitled Tory voters, who attend vaguely alternative comedy gigs in increasingly large numbers now as standup dumbs down to meet them, Chris Coltrane\u2019s loyal self-loathing flock of becardiganned socialist sheep delight in seeing their core liberal values mocked. In fact, they love to have their fondness of fairness, justice, and anti-sexism flung back into their bearded faces. And that\u2019s just the women!</p> <p>I\u2019d been turning my Whittingdale recipe column idea over in my mind all day, making notes and scribbling sentences, and at 9pm I arrived at the packed room above Camden\u2019s Black Heart pub just in time to see Chris Coltrane\u2019s box-fresh set on the same subject, torn from the day\u2019s headlines.</p> <p>Weirdly, a crew from Sky were in the room, making a documentary about this exciting night, and yet the host\u2019s whole act concerned anxieties about the destruction of public broadcasting that their own paymasters privately pressed Whittingdale to enforce.</p> <p>A BBC documentary on the same gig would have been edited heavily in the interests of balance, just as the BBC\u2019s own Bafta ceremony coverage thinned out <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/12/bbc-john-whittingdale-white-paper-star-pay-board\" title=\"\">leftwing luvvies</a>\u2019 pro-public broadcasting comments to avoid Whittingdale\u2019s wrath. Perhaps we will look back on these double-think days and laugh.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/19/bbc-recipes-harissa-spiced-lamb-commercial-strategy-doing-nation-down\">Is it really the BBC\u2019s role to publish free recipes for harissa spiced lamb? | Christina Patterson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Having written all the following morning, on Wednesday lunchtime I checked the news.

      "headline": "The humanitarian system: 'A mammoth machinery losing track of what it is for'",
      "body": "<p><em>This piece is an extract from a written submission to the UK International Development Committee Global Humanitarian System inquiry</em></p> <p>The number of people affected by humanitarian crises has more than doubled over the past decade. The frequency, scale, and severity of humanitarian crises are set to continue rising. Yet time and again, the traditional international humanitarian relief apparatus has been unable to respond adequately. Syria is only the latest example of this.</p> <p>The aid sector is aware of deficiencies, but often frames the challenges it faces in terms that downplay its own responsibility. Needs are rising quickly, its leaders argue, and the scale of financing to respond to them is lagging behind. In reality, the problems facing the sector are much more fundamental. It has become a mammoth machinery that has, in many ways, lost track of what it stands for.</p> <p>Irin <a href=\"http://www.irinnews.org/analysis/2015/03/05/what-refugees-really-think-aid-agencies\">reported in 2015 on focus groups</a> conducted as part of the World Humanitarian Summit (WHS) process with refugees and other people affected by crises in the Middle East. The participants rated aid agencies in several categories and the results were quite damning:</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/may/12/dont-blur-the-lines-between-development-and-humanitarian-work\">Don't blur the lines between development and humanitarian work</a> </p> </aside>  <ul> <li>Treating people with respect and dignity: 3.5/10<br /></li> <li>Being neutral and impartial: 4/10<br /></li> <li>Making people feel safe and protected from violence: 3.5/10<br /></li> <li>Meeting priority needs: 3/10<br /></li> <li>Helping people prepare for future crises: 2.5/10<br /></li> <li>Considering their opinions: 2.5/10</li> </ul> <p>In addition to feeling disempowered, communities affected by crises and local responders refer to abusive north-south relationships and attitudes that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/mar/21/degan-ali-somali-woman-taking-on-the-humanitarian-system\">border on racist and colonial</a>.</p> <p>The core of the problem is that people affected by crises are no longer at the heart of humanitarian response. There are several reasons for this:</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2547d2a22b94b7a3251763a0ed9d1da5f193a4ad\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2547d2a22b94b7a3251763a0ed9d1da5f193a4ad/0_107_4702_2822/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stephen O\u2019Brien, centre, UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief. visits a refugee camp in the south-east of Niger.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephen O\u2019Brien, centre, UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief. visits a refugee camp in the south-east of Niger.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Boureima Hama/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>First, the humanitarian system remains a largely foreign-driven endeavour, which, by definition, excludes affected communities. This results in a response that is expensive and inefficient; fails to build capacity, and thus sustainability; and is often out of touch with the cultures and societies it strives to serve. For these reasons, a push to localise aid has been <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.irinnews.org/opinion/2015/08/05/editors-take-what-hope-reform\">one of the clearest recommendations</a> to emerge from the World Humanitarian Summit process, which some concrete proposals, such as the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://charter4change.org/\">Charter4Change</a>, already gathering steam.</p> <p>Second, if affected communities are to be at the heart of humanitarian action, they have to have power. The current architecture of the system does not give them much. Decision-making and funding flows are structured in a way that necessarily leaves engagement with local communities as an add-on rather than an integral part of the workflow. The business model doesn\u2019t make sense.</p> <p>Third, despite improvements in recent years, humanitarian response remains largely unaccountable for its actions. In any other sector, it could be considered a conflict of interest for the same body to be responsible for assessing needs, responding to them, and monitoring the quality of the response. Yet, in the humanitarian sector, this is normal practice. Meanwhile, aid agencies have improved their ability to garner feedback from the communities they serve, but they have yet to be able to meaningfully and systematically respond to it. </p> <p>Fourth, the power and money of the humanitarian sector is concentrated among a few key actors who are reluctant to relinquish it. As the High-Level Panel on Humanitarian Financing <a href=\"http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/%5BHLP%20Report%5D%20Too%20important%20to%20fail%E2%80%94addressing%20the%20humanitarian%20financing%20gap.pdf\">put it</a>: \u201cGiving, receiving and channelling funds is concentrated in the hands of a few \u2018giants\u2019.\u201d For example, the World Food Programme, which at 14,000 staff constitutes the world\u2019s <a href=\"https://fts.unocha.org/pageloader.aspx?page=emerg-globalOverview&amp;Year=2015\">biggest aid agency</a>, received 22% of all <a href=\"http://newirin.irinnews.org/the-humanitarian-economy/\">humanitarian funding in 2015</a>. WFP, the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) and UNICEF together handled nearly half of the $19bn (\u00a313bn) in funding reported. Rather than recognise the richness, diversity and added value of a de-centralised, networked humanitarian response ecosystem, some of these actors continue to believe in a command and control structure that is increasingly recognised as being out of touch with reality. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4c2310a155b6147a90ce1082aa83b470090fbaf9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4c2310a155b6147a90ce1082aa83b470090fbaf9/0_40_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Workers unload a cargo plane carrying humanitarian aid from Saudi Arabia at the Baghdad International Airport in Iraq.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Workers unload a cargo plane carrying humanitarian aid from Saudi Arabia at the Baghdad International Airport in Iraq.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karim Kadim/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The landscape is changing whether the oligarchs like it or not: national governments, diaspora communities, volunteers and the private sector are playing increasingly important roles. And yet, as just one example, the global humanitarian co-ordination body, the Inter-Agency Standing Committee, excludes all of these groups. </p> <h2>The upcoming World Humanitarian Summit </h2> <p>There have been hundreds, if not thousands, of <a href=\"http://www.irinnews.org/report/101867/bright-ideas-better-aid\">proposals for change</a> floating around the World Humanitarian Summit process. The Secretariat did an excellent job of consulting a wide diversity of people, but by its own admission to Irin in a private interview, failed to then build consensus around a priority set of proposals.</p> <p>The UN Secretary-General\u2019s report for the WHS was described by donors and aid workers alike as a \u201cmenu\u201d of options with something for everyone but a lack of clear prioritisation. It emphasises preventative, aspirational and normative options rather than the nitty-gritty \u201carchitectural\u201d problems and opportunities.</p> <p> In recent months, the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, has increasingly taken control of the WHS process from what was meant to be a quasi-independent secretariat. Many observers feel the five \u201ccore areas of responsibility\u201d outlined in the secretary general\u2019s report fail to sufficiently draw upon the extensive consultation process. One secretariat staff told Irin: \u201cNow, it\u2019s a bunch of people in New York writing the SG report, and who literally have taken over a lot of the process.\u201d </p> <p>Within this messy landscape, some proposals have begun floating to the top, and, more importantly, others have fallen by the wayside. Perhaps unsurprisingly, discussion about the key, structural problems have increasingly been pushed aside.</p> <p>As one example, the summit will host seven high-level roundtables with world leaders to pledge commitments around political leadership to prevent and end conflicts, upholding the norms that safeguard humanity, a commitment to address forced displacement, catalysing action to achieve gender equality, natural disasters and climate change: managing risks and crises differently, from delivering aid to ending need and humanitarian financing. An eighth planned roundtable entitled \u201cBuilding the future of humanitarian action: towards more effective, context-specific, and predictable responses\u201d \u2013 meant to address the core architecture of the system \u2013 did not appear on the final list of roundtables, seemingly due to a \u201cresistance\u201d, as one secretariat member put it, from some IASC members to opening such a conversation.</p> <p>Similarly, of the 15 special sessions, only one (People at the Centre) comes close to speaking to these structural issues. Instead, they focus instead on easier fixes, such as including people with disabilities in humanitarian action and providing education in emergencies.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2016/apr/13/global-humanitarian-fund-respond-to-long-term-crises-population\">The world needs a humanitarian fund to assist long-term crises</a> </p> </aside>  <p>To what extent are improvements to humanitarian responses inhibited by the slow pace of reform within the UN system? It is not only a question of the slow pace of reform, but the willingness to reform in the first place. Irin has conducted several interviews with high-level aid officials on the topic of reform and found little evidence of real momentum for change, particularly among IASC members, who have vested interests, mostly financial, in the status quo.</p> <p>For example, one might expect localisation to cause the World Food Programme to shrink its size and influence in favour of local actors. But in an <a href=\"http://www.irinnews.org/q-and/2015/08/05/can-un-aid-change-qa-top-officials\">interview with Irin</a>, Ertharin Cousin, executive director of the WFP, said she did not intend to shrink her workforce of 14,000.</p> <p>An Irin interview in October 2015 with Stephen O\u2019Brien, the incoming under-secretary-general and emergency relief co-ordinator, further reflected the limited appetite for substantive change. He said: \u201cthe UN doesn\u2019t have to change\u201d; that \u201cthe system isn\u2019t broken, it\u2019s simply broke\u201d; and that the UN only has to \u201cbuild on the fantastic track record\u201d by finding \u201cextra ways of delivering humanitarian action\u201d. This does not suggest a recognition of the need for any fundamental, structural changes. While his tune has since <a href=\"https://www.odi.org/events/4350-humanitarian-response-crisis\">changed</a>, O\u2019Brien\u2019s \u2013 and others\u2019 \u2013 recognition of the need for fundamental, structural changes remains unclear.</p> <p>It is not only UN agencies that have at times resisted reform. Some international NGOs are also worried about what the push to localise aid response means for their own existence. Donors, including the Department for International Development, have a vital role to play in walking the talk of reform.</p> <p><em>Read the full submission of </em><em>the UK International Development Committee Global Humanitarian System inquiry</em><em> <a href=\"http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/international-development-committee/the-global-humanitarian-system/written/31694.html\">here</a>.</em></p> <p><em>Heba Aly is managing editor of <a href=\"http://www.irinnews.org/\">Irin</a>, the humanitarian news organisation</em></p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-22T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>It might be the year of the underdog, copyright Alan Pardew 2016, but Manchester United were taking no chances. The sight of Sir Alex Ferguson walking out with the FA Cup before kick-off might have been designed to remind everyone who the underdogs were supposed to be, even if he was accompanied by Steve Coppell.</p> <p>Unlike the 1990 final this was no six-goal thriller. It took an age to get going and only came to life in the last 10 minutes, when Pardew\u2019s bid for dad-dancing posterity after Jason Puncheon looked to have scored a winner was cut short by a determined run from Wayne Rooney that allowed Juan Mata to level. If it is remembered at all, it is likely to be as Louis van Gaal\u2019s last United game, or alternatively as the day the Jos\u00e9 Mourinho background noise became loud and screechy enough to even drown out FA Cup celebrations.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/21/crystal-palace-manchester-united-fa-cup-final-match-report\">Manchester United win FA Cup as Jesse Lingard sinks Crystal Palace</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The joke in the 80 minutes before the late excitement was that the Ferguson succession at United has been botched to such an extent that the side formerly known as the mightiest in England are now regarded as underdogs when the bigger games come around, though it must be said that very few real underdogs can run to Rooney pulling the strings with Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford running off him.</p> <p>With their young strikers both showing up well and Mata getting involved United dominated the early stages, but that was to be expected. The question was whether United could make their possession and superior passing ability tell before Palace used their pace to try to catch them on the counter. It did not bode well when Connor Wickham left Chris Smalling in his wake in the first proper attack Palace mounted, particularly as the striker stayed on his feet through two heavy challenges and had cause to feel aggrieved that Mark Clattenburg had not seen fit to play advantage. Smalling received a booking for his ungainly attempt to prevent Wickham breaking free, which in turn did not bode well for a central defender certain to start when England\u2019s European Championship campaign begins. Neither did the attempted rugby tackle on Yannick Bolasie that earned Smalling a deserved red in extra time.</p> <p>This did not look like the joint best defence in the Premier League this season, especially when Marcos Rojo joined Smalling in the book for a similar sprawling foul on Joel Ward on the halfway line. Again, the referee could have played a useful advantage but did not, and the look on Pardew\u2019s face as he angrily gestured that the same thing had just happened twice was probably mirrored by the two coaches in Madrid, who will be getting Clattenburg for Saturday\u2019s Champions League final.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/21/louis-van-gaal-manchester-united-sack\">Louis van Gaal was doomed at Manchester United by refusal to adapt | Amy Lawrence</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was hardly the performance Van Gaal would have been hoping for to convince supporters, let alone the United board, that he is worth another season at Old Trafford, though if the reports swirling around Wembley in the aftermath of eventual victory are correct contact was made with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho before the final took place.</p> <p>It was generally agreed before the game that an FA Cup win would count for little in the overall scheme of things anyway. An FA Cup win combined with Champions League qualification would have amounted to a decent return \u2013 well, a couple of reasons to be cheerful at any rate \u2013 but Van Gaal could not expect to save his skin with the Cup alone in the manner pioneered by the Manchester United manager who overcame Crystal Palace in the 1990 final. Jesse Lingard\u2019s decisive strike at least let Van Gaal and United finish their season on a high, though in the manager\u2019s case euphoria was cruelly short-lived.</p> <p>Ferguson claimed the 1990 win bought him time; he still needed another three seasons to land the league title. Van Gaal was never going to be granted another three seasons \u2013 many United supporters would have been up in arms had he been awarded another one. It is true that in the final analysis Van Gaal did what Ferguson could not do and beat Palace on the day, thanks to Lingard\u2019s thunderous extra time decider. It is also true that not every manager would have promoted Lingard and that the last United manager to beat Palace in an FA Cup final went on to become the most successful in the club\u2019s history.</p> <p>Considering United were down to 10 men at the time it appears some of the old fighting spirit still remains, along with the knack of scoring late winners. History does repeat itself sometimes, but what followed 1990 is not going to happen again. If this does turn out to be the start of a new golden era for United it will be with a different manager in charge.</p>",

Immediately afterwards she started working on her first novel, <em>Tipping the Velvet</em> (a title taken from 19th-century pornography), which was published in 1998. Waters has won a number of awards: in 2003 alone, she was named one of Granta\u2019s 20 best young British writers, received the South Bank award for literature, and was named author of the year at the British Book Awards. The stage adaptation of her 2006 novel <em>The Night Watch</em> is on at Manchester\u2019s Royal Exchange until 18 June.</p> <h2>1 | Cinema<br /></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.britthatzius.co.uk/blind_cinema.html\" title=\"\"><strong>Blind Cinema</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ca508868ebf47d0532ec73148e46fb9bd71a9c8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ca508868ebf47d0532ec73148e46fb9bd71a9c8a/0_11_570_342/500.jpg\" alt=\"Blind Cinema: \u2018intimate and inventive.\u2019\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Blind Cinema: \u2018intimate and inventive.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Britt Hatzius</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I liked the sound of this Britt Hatzius project so much that I gave myself the day off work and made a special trip to Bristol for it, where it\u2019s been playing as part of<a href=\"http://mayfestbristol.co.uk/mayfest2016/\" title=\"\"> the excellent Mayfest</a>.

Locations include the spot in Haymarket, London, where, in 1822, the Bishop of Clogher was caught in a compromising position with a Grenadier Guardsman; Woking Golf Club, where lesbian composer Dame Ethel Smyth apparently liked to trespass in the men\u2019s section of the clubhouse; and the Lancaster branch of British Home Stores, scene of a 1976 picket against the sacking of a gay employee.</p> <h2>3 | Museum<br /></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.cinemamuseum.org.uk\" title=\"\"><strong>The Cinema Museum, London</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"16b1cabfe14b3556914aeccf945f37ebc7923692\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16b1cabfe14b3556914aeccf945f37ebc7923692/0_93_5616_3372/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Cinema Museum: \u2018wonderfully eccentric.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Cinema Museum: \u2018wonderfully eccentric.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I did a \u201cDesert Island Movies\u201d evening at the Cinema Museum a few months ago, and it was one of the most enjoyable events I\u2019ve ever done \u2013 largely because of the wonderfully eccentric nature of the museum itself, which is housed in a huge old building left over from the Lambeth workhouse. Run by passionate volunteers, it has a unique collection of cinema memorabilia, and offers a crowded programme of events including screenings, talks and interviews. You can settle down for the evening in a broken cinema seat or a sagging sofa, and get a cup of tea and a flapjack at half time \u2013 perfect.</p> <h2>4 | Theatre</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/apr/01/pulitzer-popcorn-playwright-annie-baker-critics-pause-thought\" title=\"\"><strong>The Flick, Annie Baker</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3213ada80234b7eb96e309f8687437bfd961aaf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3213ada80234b7eb96e309f8687437bfd961aaf/0_95_2880_1729/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jaygann Ayeh and Louisa Krause  in The Flick at the National\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jaygann Ayeh and Louisa Krause in The Flick at the National: \u2018a weirdly powerful moment.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Douet</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Made up of bits of conversation between three unhappy staff members in a rundown American movie theatre, Baker\u2019s play is a tender, funny study of disappointments and failed connections. Though I wasn\u2019t entirely convinced by every one of the (many) silences in the production I saw at the National Theatre last week, I loved the bravery of them. And I adored the minutes-long sequence in which the actors left the stage and reappeared in the projectionist\u2019s booth, and we had to watch the ensuing soundless action through the two small square apertures at the back of the set \u2013 a weirdly powerful moment, like nothing I\u2019d ever seen in the theatre before.</p> <h2>5 | Book</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/oct/22/living-on-paper-letters-from-iris-murdoch-1934-1995-edited-avril-horner-anne-rowe-review\" title=\"\"><strong>Living on Paper: Letters from Iris Murdoch 1934-1995</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a321d23fbe35873595be35dba7a70b4febdf1993\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a321d23fbe35873595be35dba7a70b4febdf1993/55_153_2925_1757/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iris Murdoch: \u2018bold and passionate.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iris Murdoch: \u2018bold and passionate.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jane Bown</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019ve always been a big Iris Murdoch fan, so I was delighted to receive a copy of this book as a present from my parents-in-law last Christmas. It\u2019s a lovely read, revealing Murdoch to have been warm, bold, passionate and loyal \u2013 to have lived her life with an incredibly open heart. And, crucially, it\u2019s made me return to her novels and remember how bloody good they are \u2013 how intelligent, how lucent, how divinely crazy. They\u2019re fun \u2013 I\u2019d forgotten that. I can feel Murdoch\u2019s work slipping out of literary fashion, and I think it\u2019s a huge shame.</p> <h2>6 | TV</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/series/happy-valley-episode-by-episode\" title=\"\"><strong>Happy Valley</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d025f66521b237f68630635b0d86ed47124840e5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d025f66521b237f68630635b0d86ed47124840e5/0_180_4288_2575/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Lancashire in Happy Valley\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Lancashire in Happy Valley: \u2018a light-touch exploration of the gendered nature of crime.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Blackall/BBC/Red Productions</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yes, everyone already knows how brilliant this is, but I\u2019m embarrassed to admit that I\u2019ve only just watched it. The first series in particular just blew me away. Sarah Lancashire is amazing, Siobhan Finneran is fabulous (I always had a perverse crush on her when she was mean Miss O\u2019Brien in <em>Downton</em>), and the naturalism of the dialogue makes you realise how stilted and silly much TV dialogue is. But what I love most about the show is the genius, light-touch way in which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/feb/07/sally-wainwright-writer-happy-valley-second-series\" title=\"\">Sally Wainwright explores the gendered nature of crime</a> \u2013 focusing not just on the male perpetrators of violence but on the women who have relationships with them as victims, law-enforcers, wives and mothers.</p> <h2>7 | Fair</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.bloomsburyephemerafair.com/\" title=\"\"><strong>Bloomsbury Ephemera Fair</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f08a7d91834a79200152542018d8a1e0029a3e90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f08a7d91834a79200152542018d8a1e0029a3e90/0_694_2448_1469/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bloomsbury ephemera fair: \u2018my nerd heaven.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Bloomsbury ephemera fair: \u2018my nerd heaven.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: bloomsburyephemerafair.com</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s hard to admit to being a collector \u2013 it makes you sound like such a nerd. But I\u2019ve been collecting Victorian and Edwardian postcards for about 25 years, and though there are lots of opportunities now to buy postcards online, nothing beats the thrill of the chase: my particular nerd heaven is this monthly London collectors\u2019 fair, where I can patiently work my way through several hundred postcards in a single Sunday afternoon. The fair has stalls selling antique books and ephemera and they are always worth a look too, but it\u2019s the postcards that get me. With their curious images on one side and their suggestive handwritten messages on the other they\u2019re such glorious, poignant scraps of social\u00a0history.</p>",

But those nostalgic for its heyday are gathering at Tate Modern\u2019s Turbine Hall this weekend for the first UK <a href=\"http://yami-ichi.biz/\">Internet Yami-ichi.</a></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/may/20/cory-arcangel-artist-canvas-out-of-clickbait\">Kittens, Kanye and kiss-and-tells: the artist who swapped canvas for clickbait</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Translated as \u201cblack market\u2019 in Japanese, the Yami-ichi has a simple aim: bringing internet culture offline. Think Edward Snowden snow-globes, spambot love letters (in envelopes not emails), and chocolate chip browser cookies you can actually eat. Founded in Tokyo in 2012, the Yami-ichi has since set up shop in Berlin, New York and Amsterdam but this is London\u2019s first chance to \u201c<a href=\"http://www.dictionary.com/browse/irl\">browse IRL</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Looking for a new artwork for your living room? Give the Tate shop a miss and head instead to <a href=\"http://yinansong.com/\">Yinan Song</a>\u2019s booth, which is selling prints of images taken from people using public Wifi. Song will obscure images for privacy purposes and sell them for between \u00a31 and \u00a33 a pop. Alternatively, you can get your digital fortune told by London artist Libby Heaney, who offers personalised Tarot readings based on age, gender and relationship status,read out in the form of pre-programmed phrases from the likes of Match.com.</p> <p>\u201cInternet companies already hold so much data about us, they can essentially predict our future,\u201d says Heaney. Japanese artist Kensuke Sembo, who founded the Internet Yami-ichi, agrees. \u201cOnce upon a time, the internet was supposed to be a place for liberty, now there are privacy issues, flame wars and social media stress. We thought we should turn off, log out and drop in on the real world to enjoy our internet liberties.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"732612d727329a1daf4d26a2cba85af9d3cae862\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/732612d727329a1daf4d26a2cba85af9d3cae862/0_0_2048_1366/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cconsent to cookies?

It is important to remain experimental; that\u2019s what the Yami-Ichi is all about.\u201d</p> <p>Other pieces up for grabs includes \u201cglitch embroidery\u201d by Japanese fashion designer <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://nukeme.nu/\">Nukeme</a>, who hacks digital patterns on sewing machines to make custom hoodies. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://x-o-x-o-x.com/\">Erik Zepka</a> has made a series of T-shirts that incorporate Twitter and Apple-inspired logos into his own pseudo-corporate brand. Meanwhile sound artist Tadeo Sendon is selling <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.tadeosendon.com/browsingthenoisecom-2011/\">Browsing Noise</a>, a book of field recordings from his travels around the internet.</p> <p>It ties into the Yami-ichi\u2019s main premise: to create a space to show experimental works that, while digitally influenced, don\u2019t necessarily fit online. \u201cThe idea for the Yami-Ichi began when my own iPhone app was rejected by Apple because it was too simple,\u201d said Sembo, who began to wonder how he might sidestep digital marketplaces like the App Store. \u201cWe thought that not only data, but also internet-inspired ideas, can be exchanged in real space.\u201d</p> <p>Just like any market, there will be haggling. But it\u2019s meant to go beyond bargains. \u201cI hope people leave with an insight of new forms of art, new worlds to explore, commercial and non-commercial,\u201d says Vardi. \u201cLondon needs more of those.\u201d</p>",

He conceptualised the possible improvements in speed that might be achieved with a quantum computer. But theoretical physics, while a necessary first step, leaves the real brainwork to practical application.</p> <p>With normal computers, or classical \u00a0computers as they\u2019re now called, there are only two options \u2013 on\u00a0and off \u2013 for processing information. A computer \u201cbit\u201d, the smallest unit into which all information is broken down, is either a \u201c1\u201d or a \u201c0\u201d. And the computational power of a normal computer is dependent on the number of binary transistors \u2013 tiny power switches \u2013 that are contained within its\u00a0microprocessor.</p> <p>Back in 1971 <a href=\"http://www.intel.co.uk/content/www/uk/en/history/museum-story-of-intel-4004.html\" title=\"\">the first Intel processor</a> was made up of 2,300 transistors. Intel now produce microprocessors with more than 5bn transistors. However, they\u2019re still limited by their simple binary options. But as Trudeau explained, with quantum computers the bits, or \u201cqubits\u201d as they are known, afford far more options owing to the uncertainty of their physical state.</p> <p>In the mysterious subatomic realm of quantum physics, particles can act like waves, so that they can be particle or wave or particle and wave. This is what\u2019s known in quantum mechanics as superposition. As a result of superposition a qubit can be a 0 or 1 or 0 and 1. That means it can perform two equations at the same time. Two qubits can perform four equations. And three qubits can perform eight, and so on in an exponential expansion. That leads to some inconceivably large numbers, not to mention some mind-boggling working concepts.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In artificial intelligence and cryptography, it\u2019s thought that quantum computing will transform the landscape</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>At the moment those concepts are closest to entering reality in an unfashionable suburb in the south-west corner of Trudeau\u2019s homeland.</p> <p>In a neat, spacious lab in Burnaby, a satellite of Vancouver, I\u2019m looking inside what appears to be a large black fridge about 10 feet high. Within it is an elaborate structure of circuit boards, not unlike the sort of thing a physics class might construct out of Meccano, except with beautifully colourful <a href=\"http://www.rsc.org/periodic-table/element/41/niobium\" title=\"\">niobium</a> wafers as the centrepiece. It all looks fairly unremarkable, yet somewhere in here a multiplicity of different universes are thought to exist.</p> <p>The lab belongs to a small company called <a href=\"http://www.dwavesys.com/\" title=\"\">D-Wave</a>, a highly skilled collection of just 140 employees that prides itself on building the world\u2019s first functioning quantum computer, which is what is contained within the large fridge-like casing. Actually it is a fridge, the coldest fridge ever assembled. The cooling apparatus enables the niobium computer chip at\u00a0its core to function at a temperature\u00a0of just under \u2013273C, or as close to absolute zero as the known\u00a0universe gets.</p> <p>The supercooled environment is necessary to maintain coherent quantum activity of superposition and entanglement, the state in which particles begin to interact \u2013 again rather mysteriously \u2013 co-dependently, and the qubits are linked by quantum mechanics regardless of their position in space. Any intrusion of heat or light would corrupt the process and thus the effectiveness of the computer.</p> <p>Exactly how and why quantum physics adheres to these science-fiction like rules remains an issue of great speculation, but perhaps the most common theory is that the different quantum states exist in separate universes. The D-Wave quantum computer I look at has one thousand\u00a0qubits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"696a44f37e3732460bf9375d829eaea2bbfa7942\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/696a44f37e3732460bf9375d829eaea2bbfa7942/66_0_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A D-Wave quantum processor.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The future is here (and also there): a D-Wave quantum processor.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: D-Wave</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cA thousand qubit computer can be in 2 to the 1,000 states at one time, which is 10 to the 300th power,\u201d says D-Wave\u2019s CEO, <a href=\"http://www.dwavesys.com/our-company/leadership\" title=\"\">Vern Brownell</a>. \u201cThere\u2019s only 10 to the 80th atoms in the universe. Now does this mean it\u2019s in 10 to the 300th universes at the same\u00a0time?\u201d</p> <p>Can billions of different universes coexist within one computer? That\u2019s the sort of question that is probably best not grappled with before midnight and without the aid of illegal stimulants. And in a sense, the answer doesn\u2019t matter. The more immediate and relevant question is whether or not this quantum computer works.</p> <p>At the moment quantum computing still resides within a largely theoretical or speculative realm. The potential is staggering, involving a computational power many times the order of all the world\u2019s existing classical computers combined. But realising that potential is a fiendishly difficult task.</p> <p>That\u2019s why D-Wave\u2019s 2X computer costs more than $15m and only a handful of organisations have so far bought one. Still, as those organisations include Google, Lockheed Martin and Nasa, and among D-Wave\u2019s investors are Amazon\u2019s Jeff Bezos and the CIA\u2019s hi-tech arm, In-Q-Tel, it\u2019s clear that some of the world\u2019s most forward- looking institutions believe that the computer has a future.</p> <p>In areas such as artificial intelligence and cryptography, it\u2019s thought that quantum computing will transform the landscape, perhaps bringing about the breakthrough that will enable machines to \u201cthink\u201d with the nuance and interpretative skill of humans.</p> <p>Brownell used to be chief of technology at Goldman Sachs. In that job there were few tech developments that he didn\u2019t have pitched at him. He believes that while social media successes like Facebook are clever utilisations of existing technology, the fact that Silicon Valley is constantly chasing profitable variations on the same theme means that it is no longer doing the really tough mental work. \u201cThe level of innovation is much, much less than we\u2019ve seen historically and probably at an all-time low in terms of the real world-changing innovations.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2015/jul/03/quantum-computing-science-podcast\">The potential of quantum computing \u2013 Science Weekly podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>D-Wave, he says, boldly bucks this trend. But that\u2019s not how he used to think. When he first heard about D-Wave seven years ago, the company had been going for nine years and, in some informed circles, was a bit of a laughing stock. His initial reaction when the company approached him was deep scepticism.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t believe it at first at all,\u201d he\u00a0says, \u201cparticularly as there were all these blog comments with experts\u00a0saying it was snake oil. I wasn\u2019t\u00a0really interested.\u201d</p> <p>His attitude changed when he came out and met the team. D-Wave was co-founded by <a href=\"http://www.dwavesys.com/our-company/leadership\" title=\"\">Geordie Rose</a>, a 44-year-old physics PhD who, doubtful about academia, took a course in entrepreneurship. He was impatient with the research approach of highly expensive but severely limited laboratory experiments.</p> <p>Rose\u2019s novel idea was to build a functioning quantum computer with commercial appeal. But this is where the science starts to cause people to pull their hair out. Most experimental quantum computers that had been assembled in labs followed the universal gate model, in which qubits substituted for transistors, without any notable success.</p> <p>Rose chose instead to develop an \u201cadiabatic\u201d quantum computer, which works by a process of what\u2019s called \u201cquantum annealing\u201d or \u201ctunnelling\u201d. In essence, it means you develop an algorithm that assigns specific interactions between the qubits along the lines of the classical model \u2013 ie if this is a 0, that one is 1 etc. Then create the conditions for quantum superposition, in which the qubits can realise their near infinite possibilities, before returning them to the classical state of 0s and 1s. The idea is the qubits will follow the path of least energy in relation to the algorithmic requirements, thus finding the most efficient answer.</p> <p>If that\u2019s hard enough to explain, imagine how difficult it was to build. And the early results were not encouraging. No one seemed to be sure what, if anything, was going on at a quantum level, but whatever it was, it wasn\u2019t impressive.</p> <p>D-Wave\u2019s first demonstration in 2007 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2007/feb/08/guardianweeklytechnologysection4\" title=\"\">of its 16-qubit device</a>, which involved solving a sudoku puzzle, hardly set the world on fire. Umesh Vazirani, co-author of a paper on quantum complexity theory, <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/theinbox/2007/02/quantum_computing_3\" title=\"\">dismissed D-Wave\u2019s claims of speedup</a> as a misunderstanding of his work, and suggested that \u201ceven if it turns out to be a true quantum computer, and even if it could be scaled\u00a0to thousands of qubits, [it] would\u00a0likely not be more powerful than \u00a0a cellphone\u201d.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Even if no one ever builds a useful quantum computer we still learn an immense amount by attempting to</p> <footer> <cite>Dr Nic Harrigan, Bristol University</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Thereafter the company was regularly accused of hype and exaggeration. Part of the problem was that it was very hard to measure with any agreed accuracy what was happening. D-Wave came up with a test to show that entanglement \u2013 seen as a necessary prerequisite for a working quantum computer \u2013 was taking place.</p> <p>But some experts doubted the reliability of the test. When D-Wave passed <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn23251-controversial-quantum-computer-aces-entanglement-tests/\" title=\"\">a different test, developed by an independent scientist</a>, sceptics argued that while entanglement might be happening, the only real test was\u00a0performance.</p> <p>In 2013, the D-Wave Two was cited in one test as performing 3,600 times faster than a classical computer. But yet again <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn28641-experts-doubt-googles-claim-about-its-quantum-computers-speed/\" title=\"\">these results were rubbished</a> by several prominent scientists in the field. In 2014 Matthias Troyer, a renowned professor of computational physics, published a report that stated that he found <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2014/06/d-wave-quantum-speedup/\" title=\"\">\u201cno evidence of quantum\u00a0speedup\u201d</a>.</p> <p>A longtime doubter of D-Wave\u2019s claims is <a href=\"http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/\" title=\"\">Scott Aaronson</a>, a professor at MIT, who has called himself \u201cChief D-Wave Sceptic\u201d. After Troyer\u2019s paper, he argued that although quantum effects were probably taking place in D-Wave\u2019s devices, there was no reason to believe they played a causal role or that they were faster than a classical computer.</p> <p>Brownell is dismissive of these critics, claiming that the \u201cquestion has been largely settled\u201d. He cites <a href=\"http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/12/when-can-quantum-annealing-win.html\" title=\"\">Google\u2019s comparative test</a> last year in which its D-Wave quantum computer solved certain problems 100m times faster than a classical computer.</p> <p>\u201cIf it isn\u2019t quantum computing,\u201d asks Brownell, \u201cthen how did we build something that\u2019s a hundred million times faster than an Intel Core? It either has to be quantum computing or some other law of nature that we haven\u2019t discovered yet that\u2019s even more exciting than quantum mechanics. I challenge any scientist in the world to tell us: if it\u2019s not quantum annealing, what is it?\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2016/mar/16/artificial-intelligence-we-should-be-more-afraid-of-computers-than-we-are-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4htcc\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2473833\"            data-video-name=\"We should be more afraid of computers than we are \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56e8517ae4b040c94037c457\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/03/15/160315AlexHernCiF_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11324857&amp;format=video/m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/03/15/160315AlexHernCiF_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/03/15/160315AlexHernCiF_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/03/15/160315AlexHernCiF_small.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2016/mar/16/artificial-intelligence-we-should-be-more-afraid-of-computers-than-we-are-video\">We should be more afraid of computers than we are</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Even Aaronson acknowledged that the Google test was significant. \u201cThis is certainly the most impressive demonstration so far of the D-Wave machine\u2019s capabilities. And yet,\u201d he added, \u201cit remains totally unclear whether you can get to what I\u2019d consider \u2018true quantum speedup\u2019 using D-Wave\u2019s architecture.\u201d</p> <p>But Troyer was not convinced. \u201cYou need to read the fine print,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is 10<sup>8</sup> times faster than some specific classical algorithm on problems designed to be very hard for that algorithm but easy for D-Wave\u2026 A claim of 10<sup>8</sup> speedup is thus very misleading.\u201d</p> <p>One side-benefit of all these claims and counter-claims, as Aaronson has most forcefully argued, is that they help us to understand quantum mechanics a little better. Nic Harrigan works at the <a href=\"http://www.bristol.ac.uk/physics/research/quantum/\" title=\"\">Centre for Quantum Photonics</a> at Bristol University, a leading research institute in quantum\u00a0mechanics.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough there are incredible potential applications of quantum computing,\u201d Harrigan says, \u201ceven if no one ever builds a useful quantum computer we still learn an immense amount by attempting to. This might sound like ass-covering, but quantum mechanics itself is a theory so fundamental to our understanding of the universe, and is the seed to so many current and future other technologies, that anything we can do to understand it better is huge. Somewhat incredibly it turns out that a good way to try and understand what is actually going on in quantum mechanics (and just how it differs from normal classical physics) is to consider which kind of computational problems one can more easily solve using quantum mechanical\u00a0systems.\u201d</p> <p>At Google they were cautiously optimistic about D-Wave\u2019s usefulness. The head of engineering, Hartmut Neven, <a href=\"http://googleresearch.blogspot.co.uk/2015/12/when-can-quantum-annealing-win.html\" title=\"\">outlined the strengths and weaknesses of the tests</a>, and acknowledged that while there were other algorithms that, if deployed on classical computers, could outperform quantum annealing, he expected future developments to favour quantum annealing. \u201cThe design of next-generation annealers must facilitate the embedding of problems of practical relevance,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The kinds of problems that quantum annealing might help address are all concerned with what\u2019s called optimisation \u2013 finding the most efficient model in complex systems.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/bt-partner-zone/2015/oct/28/how-cloud-computing-is-becoming-more-sustainable\">How cloud computing is becoming more sustainable</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cOptimisation sounds like a really boring problem,\u201d says Brownell, \u201cbut it\u2019s at the core of so many complex application problems in every discipline. Probably one of the most exciting is in the artificial intelligence world. Say you\u2019re trying to recognise a water bottle. It still takes computers an enormous amount of time to do that not as well as humans do. Computers\u00a0are catching up, but quantum computing can help\u00a0accelerate that process.\u201d</p> <p>He cites genomics, economics and medicine as other areas that are rich with optimisation problems. With conventional computers, creating complex models \u2013 such as, for example, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_methods_in_finance\" title=\"\">Monte Carlo simulation</a> used in the finance industry to analyse different interest rate scenarios \u2013 requires an enormous amount of computing power. And computing power requires real power.</p> <p>\u201cYou go to these big web properties and they have data centres that are installed next to hydroelectric plants because they consume so much electricity,\u201d says Brownell. \u201cThey\u2019re the second-largest consumers of electrical energy on the planet.\u201d</p> <p>D-Wave\u2019s vision, he says, is for a green revolution in computing, in which everyone will have access to much more energy-efficient quantum computers through the cloud. In a few years, he thinks, we\u2019ll be able to access quantum computing from our phones.</p> <p>\u201cI think we have the opportunity to create one of the most valuable technology companies in history,\u201d says Brownell. \u201cI know that sounds really grand, but based on the capability we\u2019ve built, we\u2019re at the stage to be the dominant player in quantum computing for decades to come.\u201d</p> <p>Well, any self-respecting CEO would say that. But it certainly seems that D-Wave are currently leading the\u00a0quantum computer race. Where that race is going, what it involves and how many universes it\u2019s taking place in are, however, questions that we\u2019ll probably need a working quantum computer to answer.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Born in Kolkata, India in 1957, broadcaster Michael Mosley studied PPE at Oxford; he then worked as a banker for two years before retraining as a psychiatrist. He joined the BBC in 1985, where he produced science programmes such as <em>Inventions That Changed the World </em>and presented shows including <em>The Story of Science</em>, <em>The Brain: A Secret History</em> and <em>The Truth About Exercise</em>. In 2012 he popularised the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/may/05/diet-feasts-fast-days\">5:2 diet</a>, which uses intermittent fasting, with the BBC2 documentary <em>Eat, Fast and Live Longer</em> and his book <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/fast-diet.html\"><em>The Fast Diet</em></a>, which sold 350,000 copies in the UK in its first year.</p> <p><strong>You tried your first cigarette as part of your new television programme on vaping. How was that?</strong></p> <p>Very unpleasant. The attraction was not obvious. I suspect it would have been a different experience if I had tried it at 12. But I didn\u2019t.</p> <p><strong>Why not? Were you a very square teenager?</strong></p> <p>I was really, really square but my dad offered me something like \u00a3100 when I was about 11 if I didn\u2019t smoke before I was 18. It seemed like an inordinately large sum of money so I never felt particularly tempted.</p> <p><strong>So what was your conclusion? Is vaping OK?</strong></p> <p>I think vaping is OK. There are some problems associated with it, which we explore in the film, but certainly compared with smoking, they\u2019re trivial. There are about a billion smokers in the world, and about half of them will die from smoking-related diseases. So the numbers are just monstrous, and if you can persuade even a few of them to switch to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/e-cigarettes\">e-cigarettes</a>, it would make a huge difference because we know that going cold turkey doesn\u2019t work.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We learn a lot about some of the more exotic conditions, but nothing about what a good diet looks like</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>It needs somone like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/kate-moss\">Kate Moss</a> to take it up, doesn\u2019t </strong><strong>it? It\u2019s not very rock\u2019n\u2019roll.</strong></p> <p>Yes, my daughter is 16, and she thought it was very uncool, and the fact that people like me were doing it made it even less cool.</p> <p><strong>A lot of people in the media, myself included, look wistfully at people who have proper jobs like doctors, whereas you were a doctor who went the other way. What were you thinking?</strong></p> <p>I discussed it with people in the media before I jumped. And they all said: \u201cNo, no, don\u2019t do it. It\u2019s a terrible thing to go into, you should stick with the noble art of medicine.\u201d And most of the medics said: \u201cGo, go. It sounds much more fun.\u201d So I flip-flopped quite a bit. I thought I would do it for a year or two and see if it suited me and I found that it did.</p> <p>Actually, I went to a 30th reunion of medical school recently and of the 100 of us, there were less than 50 still working. They\u2019re all just a bit tired or disillusioned. And because so few young doctors want to go into medicine, the load\u2019s been building.</p> <p><strong>You started out in TV as a producer. What brought you over to the dark side, presenting?</strong></p> <p>I had this idea about the history of medicine told through self-experimenters. The first <em>Horizon</em> I did was about a self-experimenter called Barry Marshall, who was convinced stomach ulcers were not caused by stress but by a previously unknown organism called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori\"><em>helicobacter pylori</em></a>. He ended up swallowing it himself and induced gastritis. That made me wonder how many other people had done this sort of stuff. I discovered a huge number of stories and pitched the idea to every controller of every channel for 14 years until eventually Channel 4 said, \u201cYes but who\u2019ll present?\u201d And I said, \u201cI have no idea.\u201d And they said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you do it?\u201d</p> <p><strong>Your most recent interest has been tackling diabetes through diet, hasn\u2019t it?</strong></p> <p>Yes, it came out of a <em>Horizon</em> I did because I discovered that I was type 2 diabetic. My GP suggested I start on Metformin, because that\u2019s the standard protocol \u2013 you start on the drugs. But I didn\u2019t want to do that, because my dad had developed diabetes at the age I was then, and had had complications including heart failure and dementia and died at 72.</p> <p>I started off by looking at the research around longevity, and one thing that had been found to help was cutting down one\u2019s food intake by about two-thirds. I realised I wasn\u2019t willing to do that for a long period of time but I came across research out of Chicago that got some of the benefits from doing it two days a week. And that led to the film, and writing the 5:2 diet book, but we didn\u2019t actually focus at all on the diabetes. But my weight has stayed off, and glucose is still down there in the normal range.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s been the lowlight of your self-experimenting career? Was it the tapeworm you swallowed?</strong></p> <p>No, it was actually a programme I did on fear. The producer said: \u201cWhat are you afraid of?\u201d And I said: \u201cConfined spaces.\u201d So she sent me caving and I got stuck and I really freaked. The tapeworm was absolutely fine, though I kept poo samples in the freezer, which delighted my family.</p> <p><strong>You took an empathy test, didn\u2019t you, where the scientist told you that you shared some of the same traits as psychopaths. Was that a bad moment?</strong></p> <p>He did go on and qualify it by saying that there are obviously a lot of people who are not psychopaths who have these traits. And I\u2019m reasonably confident I\u2019m not a psychopath. But I knew it was a risk. There\u2019s always an element of risk that they tell you something you don\u2019t want to know. I did a test recently on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006mgxf\"><em>Horizon</em></a> and they found that I had partial blockage in one of my coronary arteries. It was a bit freaky and I\u2019m still aware of it. No male in my family has made it beyond 72.</p> <p><strong>Do you sometimes think, I may only have 13 years left?</strong></p> <p>That\u2019s quite a scary thought, isn\u2019t it? Sometimes. I suspect I\u2019m a lot healthier than my dad was. I look a lot like he did when he was younger but because I\u2019ve done all the self-experiments, I haven\u2019t followed the same path he did.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2015/aug/13/are-health-tests-really-a-good-idea-review\">Are\u00a0Health Tests Really a Good Idea? review \u2013 a scientific look deep into Michael Mosley\u2019s future</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Do you think that it was your father\u2019s death that\u2019s led you to do all these experiments on yourself?</strong></p> <p>Yes, without a doubt. Particularly his funeral. His friends said how much like him I was, so he was kind of a warning from history. I do think, on the whole, that genetics are not destiny and you can do something about it. But at medical school we really learned nothing about nutrition. And that\u2019s quite weird. My son is at medical school now and <em>he</em> is learning effectively nothing about nutrition. We learn a lot about some of the more exotic conditions, very rare malnutrition diseases, but really nothing about what a good diet looks like, what exercise. Which is quite strange, isn\u2019t it?</p> <p><strong>But then when you look at what the official advice has been, maybe that\u2019s for the best. If you followed government advice, you\u2019d have spent years eating margarine and avoiding eggs and butter\u2026</strong></p> <p>Indeed. The dean said on the first day of medical school: \u201cOver the next five years you will learn a huge amount. And over the next 10 years most of it will be out of date.\u201d And that\u2019s what I like about science, I must admit. As a journalist I love the fact that stuff changes all the time.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019re not quite on the whole all-sugar-is-evil bandwagon, are you? Isn\u2019t that the big new thing?</strong></p> <p>No, though I do think most added sugar is pretty evil. I\u2019ve had most of my teeth filled or replaced so I think there\u2019s very little good to be said about sugar, apart from that it tastes nice. I\u2019m going to have another concerted go at trying to give it up. I\u2019ve had a go before but I find it so addictive. If I have a small bit of chocolate, I eat the whole bar.</p> <p><strong>Since you found out you have a blocked coronary artery, has that made you rethink HIT \u2013 the short blasts of high\u2011intensity exercise that you tried and tested?</strong><br /></p> <p>No, because the evidence is strong that HIT is good for people who have coronary conditions. Everyone says\u2026</p> <p><strong>\u2026 Andrew Marr.</strong></p> <p>Yes, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/aug/04/andrew-marr-stroke-robert-mccrum\">Andrew Marr</a> had two previous attacks so almost anything could have triggered it. The message of Andrew Marr is that if you have one of these episodes \u2013 face, arms, speech \u2013 then get help. But the evidence is actually very strong, doing short bursts of this stuff is fine \u2013 even in people who are older who have not previously exercised. I\u2019m still a fan and do it around three times a week.</p> <p><strong>Are you still following the 5:2 diet?</strong></p> <p>I\u2019m more 6:1. When I put on a bit of weight I go back on it. Four years on and I\u2019m absolutely fine. I don\u2019t have to think about it that much. I find it quite easy, now. It\u2019s all just habit.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07c6ll4\"><em>E-Cigarettes: Miracle or Menace</em></a><em> is on BBC2 tonight at 9.30pm</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>The rise of Nigel Farage, Donald Trump and Marine Le Pen is often blamed on the angry, reaction of blue-collar workers to decades of falling living standards.</p> <p>The financial crash of 2008 only served to make the situation worse. And so the west finds itself in the grip of powerful protest movements that seek to brush aside failing, sclerotic institutions like the US congress and EU parliament in favour of more locally democratic administrations (or possibly right-of-centre governments with autocratic leaders).</p> <p>Yet the protest goes beyond a hard core of people who believe immigration has driven down their wages, filled their local school with children who can\u2019t speak English and denied them social housing.</p> <p>As a new documentary on release now shows, the pressures of modern work go well beyond the factory floor. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/11/the-divide-inequality-documentary-katharine-round\" title=\"\"><em>The Divide</em></a> reminds us of Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett\u2019s book <em>The Spirit Level</em>, which documents how those in better-off societies and better-off jobs are making themselves unhappy.</p> <p>Globalisation is to some extent at fault, though not necessarily in the way we previously thought. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/economics-blog/2015/sep/06/america-decline-in-wages-can-be-traced-from-the-george-w-bush-era\" title=\"\">A recent study of US wages data</a> found that despite China, Russia and the previously communist east European countries entering the global economy in the late 20th century, wages generally increased until the turn of the century and the first term of George W Bush\u2019s presidency. It was not until 2003 that most household incomes went into decline.</p> <p>So rather than the previous narrative of stagnant wages for three decades, it seems that the incomes of all but the lowest-skilled blue-collar workers followed a rising arc in the 1980s and 1990s before a sudden reversal soon after the year 2000.</p> <p>This more recent decline in incomes was matched by rising costs, in particular one cost that is deliberately not captured in official inflation figures: property. For most people, that is not an insignificant expense, and, as we know, house prices began to rise steeply from the late 1990s, pushing up monthly mortgage payments.</p> <p>From 2001 we saw a flurry of initiatives designed to deal with falling incomes and rising costs in a desperate attempt to maintain living standards. Labour\u2019s introduction of tax credits in 2003 was the main prop under household incomes, extending as it did to those earning up to \u00a360,000.</p> <p>But other ways to maintain incomes \u2013 for instance, flexible working \u2013 allowed parents to dovetail working hours to minimise childcare costs. Flexibility came in the form of self-employment, flexible rotas and, to a lesser extent, zero-hour contracts. Each of these has transformed the labour market.</p> <p>The numbers of those in self-employment, after decades hovering around the 3 million mark, began to increase in 2001. Now there are 4.6\u00a0million self-employed people and they account for 15% of the workforce.</p> <p>There is scant research into what the newly self-employed do. The Royal Society of Arts has reported that thousands are young digital entrepreneurs. Others have set themselves up as drivers delivering the ever-growing mountain of stuff bought online.</p> <p>To a greater or lesser extent, they are using the internet to start businesses and cut costs. Most recently we have seen this in the technology that allows an estimated 30,000 self-employed Uber drivers to ply London\u2019s roads.</p> <p>In the five years after the financial crash the majority of new jobs were part-time, temporary or self-employed. It wasn\u2019t until 2014 that full-time employment edged into the lead.</p> <p>We also see the search for cost-efficiency through flexibility in the public sector. What is the junior doctors\u2019 dispute if not a row about efficiency being put above the interests of family life?</p> <p>For years, the health service has maintained a low basic wage for Monday-to-Friday daytime working and higher rates for other times of the day and week to persuade staff to work unsociable hours. That\u2019s not enough any more, apparently: despite being highly coercive, it still gives the employee too much power.</p> <p>It is already common to find radiographers and phlebotomists on zero-hours contracts and tied to a bank of staff who must cater for a range of hospitals, minor injury units and GP practices. They sign up to monthly rotas and can\u2019t plan for a holiday or persuade a high street lender their work is secure enough to gain a mortgage.</p> <p>If the 1990s was characterised by increasing debt to fund a decent living, flexible working is the cancer eating away at 21st century workers.</p> <p>The defenders of flexible working argue that people like it. <a href=\"http://natcen.ac.uk/media/27899/fourth-work-life-balancestudy.pdf\" title=\"\">They are supported by surveys</a> that show most appreciate being offered it. But as employment expert John Philpott points out, those who say they like zero-hours contracts are generally students and older workers, who have another income to fall back on.</p> <p>Even full-time workers say the flexibility they like does not come from draconian rota systems, but from time off to look after a sick child, and the opportunity to take leave or make up the hours another time. Working weekends and nights is rarely a pleasure.</p> <p>Regulators like the Bank of England are oblivious to the problems that are being stored up. Almost everyone on its interest-rate-setting committee believes that GDP growth will bring back permanent full-time employment. They should realise that, in an era of corporate anxiety and low investment, the trend will remain in the opposite direction.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-22T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Another week, another load of folk being hauled in front a parliamentary select committee to talk about BHS. In attendance will be Ian Grabiner (pronounced like Ribena), chief executive of Sir Philip Green\u2019s Arcadia Group \u2013 a former BHS owner \u2013 and his second cousin Lord Grabiner (pronounced less pretentiously), a board member at Green\u2019s holding company, Taveta Investments.</p> <p>Meanwhile, advisers to Arcadia and Retail Acquisitions, which bought BHS from Green, will also show up, with the latter group appealing to aficionados.</p> <p>Among the details about Retail Acquisitions the committee may be hoping to glean is exactly how long Dominic Chappell (pronounced \u201cShapp-elle\u201d; the 90% owner of Retail Acquisitions) was working with one Paul Sutton, a 59-year-old businessman who was, separately, found guilty in absentia of embezzlement in France in 2002. Sutton was originally in negotiations with Green to buy BHS, and internal documents show that he ran that bid under the project name Swiss Rock. Witnesses to some of those negotiations have also placed Chappell in Swiss Rock meetings during 2014, although he insisted last year that the pair had cut ties in February 2014.</p> <p>Confusingly, Retail Acquisitions used to be called Swiss Rock and Chappell has insisted he has no idea how that coincidence came about.</p> <h2>Easy? Not with Stelios involved</h2> <p>Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou is a man with a consistent business plan. He uses his \u201ceasy\u201d brand to launch all kinds of ventures \u2013 and then he falls out with the management.</p> <p>This is an exaggeration, perhaps, but after years of sniping at the easyJet board \u2013 as well as another aviation venture, FastJet \u2013 Stelios had a little spat with the directors of easyHotel earlier this year: he reckons they are trousering too much pay.</p> <p>We may find out whether the Greek tycoon has a point, when easyHotel announces interim results.</p> <p>The company has actually been on a half-decent run of late: last month it unveiled a trading statement that cheered its house broker, Investec, with increased forecasts and a prediction that the shares could reach 120p (they closed Friday at 98p).</p> <p>\u201cThe company identified the potential for 12,000 owned and 15,000 franchised easyHotel rooms and is currently reviewing a range of office conversions, greenfield developments and the conversion of existing hotels to help achieve this potential,\u201d Investec gushed, while puffing the shares.</p> <p>Sounds OK. But will more of the same this week cheer up Stelios?</p> <h2>Green tries to unseat MPs</h2> <p>Sir Philip Green may have done his old mate Mike Ashley a favour when it comes to select committees. The collapse of BHS \u2013 and the subsequent probes into what went on there \u2013 have diverted some of the attention away from the issue of whether the Sports Direct founder might bother gracing Westminster with his presence, having been summoned to answer questions on working conditions at his firm.</p> <p>Having previously refused to rock up, Ashley performed a U-turn last week, saying that he would attend the business, innovation and skills committee \u2013 but only if MPs visited his Shirebrook warehouse in Derbyshire the day before.</p> <p>Anyway, the committee will meet this week to decide on how to react to this unconventional invitation, when they will surely send someone to the parliamentary archives to explore precedent (did Rupert Murdoch answer questions on phone hacking only after meeting MPs at private investigator Glenn Mulcaire\u2019s pad?).</p> <p>Also, Ashley has attempted to sweeten his invitation by offering to fly the parliamentarians to Shirebrook in his helicopter, which, like a Sports Direct sales promotion, might not prove to be the offer it appears. The select committee has 11 MPs (plus staff). Ashley\u2019s AgustaWestland seats eight.</p>",

Here, a plethora of artists tackle Dead tunes in a variety of revelatory idioms. The cat-herding comes courtesy of arch-networkers Aaron and Bryce Dessner of the National, who previously curated 2009\u2019s <em>Dark Was The Night</em> outing \u2013 once again, in aid of the Red Hot HIV/Aids charity.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/19/bryce-dessner-grateful-dead-american-folklore\">Bryce Dessner of The National: 'The Grateful Dead are part of folklore'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The headline news is that little here sounds like the Dead \u2013 allowing sceptics a way in, and the work to breathe anew. If you like War On Drugs, you might warm to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72OLupNWNho\">Touch of Grey</a>, done in the vein of Bob Dylan singing Tom Petty circa 1985.</p> <p>Australian Courtney Barnett sashays quite typically through <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdaAQlmExmI\">New Speedway Boogie</a>, while the inimitable Bill Callahan makes Easy Wind into a spacey dirge (this is praise). The album provides a timely snapshot of leftfield Americana with very welcome esoteric additions. This roster says more, perhaps, about the artists involved than it does about the Dead\u2019s perceived legacy: these leftfielders are often the heirs to the alternative rock tradition that historically has had little time for the jam band. Phish \u2013 the Dead\u2019s de facto heirs \u2013 are conspicuous by their absence, as are AnCo.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdaAQlmExmI\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XdaAQlmExmI?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdaAQlmExmI\">Watch the video for Courtney Barnett\u2019s New Speedway Boogie.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Instead, the Dessners summon everyone from Anohni all the way through to Wilco, via Canadian punks Fucked Up, and Britons including Mumford &amp; Sons. Cross-pollination is rife, with Perfume Genius and Sharon Van Etten duetting persuasively on a country version of To Lay Me Down, redolent of The Rolling Stones\u2019 Wild Horses. The Afro-Cuban Orchestre Baobab do a palate-cleansing Clementine Jam as jazz-salsa. Bewildered Deadheads will find some succour in Bob Weir cameos alongside Wilco and the National.</p> <p>Digital composer Tim Hecker, meanwhile, is one of a handful of non-guitar-slingers. He gets properly weird on Transitive Refraction Axis for John Oswald, a tribute, of sorts, to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grayfolded\"><em>Grayfolded</em></a>, an entire album of \u201cplunderphonics\u201d, featuring umpteen takes on the Dead\u2019s totem tune Dark Star, now distilled into a sort of cosmic jazz raga.

      "body": "<p>What shall we have for lunch this morning? Veggie burgers with slaw from the BBC Food site, perhaps? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/18/bbc-recipe-rival-publishers-bbc-good-food\" title=\"\">Or vegetable shepherd\u2019s pie from BBC Good Food?</a> Which would be the most distinctive, public-service choice? Welcome to royal charter chaos as usual.</p> <p>BBC News has to find \u00a380m in cuts over the next four years. Simply, Whitehall has drained the funding dry. The corporation is also under heavy fire from George Osborne and massed ranks of newspapers \u2013 local and national, <em>Guardian</em> as well as <em>Mail</em> \u2013 for making it more difficult for other news websites to flourish in a land where one licence fee buys you a \u201cfree\u201d digital banquet. That\u2019s why the Beeb will be letting 150 reporters provide basic court and council reporting for papers and its own local stations in future. That\u2019s why local radio and TV will provide more commodious links to local papers\u2019 sites. That, in turn, is why the BBC cash tap for Jeremy Hunt\u2019s memorial chain of local TV broadcasters has been turned off. There was a bargain here: a distinct effort to get both sides of UK news provision making peace rather than hacking lumps out of each other.</p> <p>How does the migration, under petition duress, of many of the 11,000 BBC Food site recipes to the BBC Worldwide commercial site play into that scenario? It doesn\u2019t. It looks like a fix \u2013 a ploy to get BBC foodies and compliant MPs backing a gambit to keep veggie and other burgers on a BBC website that takes ads and sponsorship rather than one that doesn\u2019t. And, since the supposed death of the 11,000 was big BBC news on Tuesday morning, before a rapid volte-face on Tuesday night, a cynical <em>Mail</em> and <em>Telegraph</em> detect matching cynicism around Broadcasting House.</p> <p>Well, what does that matter? Devious tit for devious tat over a pile of mashed turnips and shredded kale. But there is a rather more protein-packed issue here. Can it really make sense for the BBC\u2019s wilting news budget to use fee money to plaster recipes all over its site? How many news reporting jobs would axing the meat and veg save? And where\u2019s the red line that stops 11,000 migrant recipes drifting over to the free-but-commercial Good Food side anyway?</p> <p>The only distinctive thing about BBC Food is that it\u2019s ad-free. Good Food can do the rest of the job and, in a more sensible world, would probably be left to it \u2013 except that newspapers and other competitors are anxious (going on slightly paranoid) about fundamentally licence-fee-backed competition for food ads and magazine subscriptions. But, with suitable Ofcom superintendence, two into one does go: easily, completely, profitably.</p> <p>Meanwhile a whole raft of other sites at bbc.co.uk are for the chop \u2013 no outrage manifest \u2013 as moves to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/17/bbc-news-channel-bbc-world\" title=\"\">merge the BBC News Channel and BBC World News gather pace</a>. Two into one comes naturally when you have to save money. The merger of home news and World Service news \u2013 with a twist of BBC Parliament and the hope of raising a bit of extra cash worldwide \u2013 makes a certain sense for channels with too many softish features and a news agenda too divided into home and away.</p> <p>Mergings and closures aren\u2019t necessarily the end of this BBC world. They can rationalise a service grown alike haphazardly. They can create one good place for vegetable lasagne rather than slop it across the board. They can bring news together in a more meaningful whole. They can decide what needs to be paid for and what doesn\u2019t. Distinct progress, you might say.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Confess by Colleen Hoover is a beautiful and devastating story that will make you feel so much. Needless to say that this book was remarkable, like all other novels written by Colleen Hoover \u2013 each of her books are better than the book before it. There\u2019s a lesson within the pages of this book; it is a story about finding hope when it seems like the hardest thing to find. There\u2019s so much more to this story and the characters than meets the eye. This book is a contemporary romance novel but it\u2019s also a heart-wrenching story of survival, courage, hope and unexpected odds.<br /></p> <p>The main character as well as the protagonist of the book, Auburn has suffered immensely in her teenage years and is struggling with her life. The story commences with her in search of a job because she is desperately in need of income, and just then she notices this building whose exterior is covered with deepest, darkest confessions of people and a sign that says \u201cHelp Wanted\u201d. When she signed up for the job she definitely didn\u2019t expect herself to be falling for the ludicrously handsome and talented artist Owen Gentry who literally begged her to work for him. As they continue to get acquainted, we realise that both of them are hiding big secrets which, if confessed, threaten to destroy any kind of relationship that they have built up.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"084baf21f11b59222330d9b965ce934c1338594b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/084baf21f11b59222330d9b965ce934c1338594b/0_0_258_400/258.jpg\" alt=\"Confess Colleen Hoover\" width=\"258\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>What I really loved about the character of Owen Gentry was how he acquires inspiration for his artwork from the excruciating confessions of common people. This makes the story and this character so unique and intriguing.</p> <p>The book is written from both Auburn\u2019s and Owen\u2019s points of view, so the readers get to know each of the characters and their struggles immensely, which makes the novel all the more interesting.</p> <p>With most YA novels you get an idea of which direction the story is headed but not in this book. Colleen Hoover keeps springing unexpected plot twists at you which will have you saying \u201cNo way\u201d, thus making it a dynamic and gripping read.</p> <p>Colleen Hoover will definitely make you fall in love with the main characters and their words. Whist reading this book you will feel every human emotion within the range of possibilities. That\u2019s what I love about Colleen Hoover\u2019s writing \u2013 she makes you feel vastly about her characters. It is the kind of book that you are going to be thinking about even after a week of reading it and probably won\u2019t be able to move onto to a next book because you are still re-reading your favourite parts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The story is also accompanied by exquisite artwork at relevant places in the story, so you should absolutely pick it up.</p> <p>This book deserves a 5/5.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Buy this book at the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/confess.html\">Guardian Bookshop</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Want to tell the world about a book you\u2019ve read? <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">Join the site</a> and send us your review!</strong></h2>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-22T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Another Sunday, another vote in the Greek parliament, another self-imposed punishment beating as the parliament in Athens votes through fresh austerity measures. There will be higher VAT and an increase in taxes on all the pleasures of life: coffee, booze, fags, gambling, even pay TV.</p> <p>And just in case Greece might need to tighten its belt by another couple of notches to meet stringent budget targets, there will be additional measures that will kick in if there is any fiscal slippage over the next couple of years. George Harrison started his song Taxman with the words: \u201cLet me tell you how it will be/There\u2019s one for you, nineteen for me.\u201d The Greeks know exactly what he meant.</p> <p>Greece\u2019s predicament is simple. It has debt repayments to make this summer and it doesn\u2019t have the money to pay the bills. The European Union can solve this acute cashflow problem by unlocking the funds pledged to Greece under the terms of last summer\u2019s bailout agreement, but it will only do so if Athens demonstrates that it is serious about sorting out its budget. Austerity today will lead to generosity from EU finance ministers when they meet on Tuesday.</p> <p>That, at least, is the hope of Alexis Tsipras, Greece\u2019s prime minister, who is looking for a package in which he gets debt relief in return for austerity.</p> <p>Here\u2019s where things get interesting. The difference between this Sunday and all the other tension-packed Sundays that have studded the Greek crisis over the past six and a half years is that, this time, the battle is not between Greece and the \u201ctroika\u201d of the European commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund. Instead, there is a face-off between Europe and the IMF.</p> <p>The Europeans badly want the fund to be part of Greece\u2019s bailout and to contribute money to it. But Christine Lagarde, the IMF\u2019s managing director, says her support is conditional on two things: a credible deficit reduction plan and a decent slug of debt relief.</p> <p>Hardline EU governments, led by Germany, have resisted this idea, fearing the Greeks will interpret any writedown of its debts as a sign of weakness that Athens will exploit to avoid meeting its budgetary commitments.</p> <p>EU finance ministers have sought to bridge the gap with the IMF by saying debt relief will be provided \u201cif necessary\u201d at the end of the bailout in 2018. This has the advantage, as far as Berlin is concerned, of deferring a decision until after German elections next year.</p> <p>The IMF is not going to swallow this classic piece of Brussels fudge. It wants debt relief for Greece and it wants it now. If not, the fund will walk away. This has been made abundantly clear by Lagarde and her officials.</p> <p>There is no prospect of Europe agreeing to write off a chunk of Greece\u2019s debt, so as an alternative to a \u201chaircut\u201d, the fund has proposed exceptionally soft terms: nothing until 2040, a 40-year repayment period thereafter lasting until 2080, and a 1.5% cap on interest rates. The fund believes this sort of package is necessary because Greece is expected to do the impossible \u2013 run a budget surplus of 3.5% of GDP excluding debt interest payments for two decades.</p> <p>So how will this end? With a compromise, probably, but one in which Europe will have to give most. There are two reasons for thinking that. The first is that the fund holds the better hand. Angela Merkel, for example, made fund involvement a prerequisite for Germany to agree a third Greek bailout. The threat of the IMF walking away is both real and powerful.</p> <p>The second reason is that the fund\u2019s proposal makes more sense. A long grace period, coupled with a cap on interest rates and more realistic budget surplus target, will not solve Greece\u2019s problems by any means. But they would help.</p> <h2>Confused by pensions? So\u2019s the Bank<br /></h2> <p>The Bank of England\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane, indulged in a little false modesty last week when he announced: \u201cI consider myself moderately financially literate. Yet I confess to not being able to make the remotest sense of pensions.\u201d</p> <p>Coming from someone widely considered one of the biggest brains in central banking, it was a damning indictment of the pensions system.</p> <p>Haldane didn\u2019t pull his punches: \u201cConversations with countless experts and independent financial advisers have confirmed for me only one thing \u2013 that they have no clue either.\u201d</p> <p>He went on to make a crucial point: not only is the pensions system <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/19/uk-pensions-complicated-rule-changes\" title=\"\">fiendishly complicated</a>, the onus is increasingly on individuals to understand it.</p> <p>Haldane is right. Financial decisions once made by the state or companies must now be shouldered by employees. Changes ushered in by George Osborne have only intensified that trend. The chancellor talked about \u201cfreedom and choice\u201d when, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/19/chancellor-scrap-compulsory-annuities-pension-overhaul\" title=\"\">in his 2014 budget, he removed key restrictions on access to pension pots</a>, ending the requirement to buy an annuity. But with freedom come risk and responsibility.</p> <p>There have been warnings against using pension savings for spending sprees, yet billions of pounds have been withdrawn since the change came into force. It would appear some people took Lib Dem pensions minister Steve Webb at his word when he said <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/mar/20/pension-pots-used-lamborghinis-minister\" title=\"\">people should be free to blow their pension pot on a Lamborghini</a>. These newly available pots of money have also turned some retirees into targets for con artists.</p> <p>In principle there are many merits to individuals being able to make their own decisions. But they need clearer information, the UK generally needs better financial education and, most importantly, the pensions system itself must be made simpler and governments must stop tinkering with it.</p> <p>Constant permutations and endless acronyms are a huge problem. If the Bank of England\u2019s top brain doesn\u2019t get it, what hope for the rest of us?</p> <h2>M&amp;S needs to finds a profitable pattern for its clothing</h2> <p>Sell more clothing at full price. That\u2019s basically what Steve Rowe, the new boss of Marks &amp; Spencer, needs to do to halt its losing streak in fashion. It\u2019s a simple formula and shouldn\u2019t use up much of the two hours set aside to brief City analysts at his maiden full-year results on Wednesday. Clothing remains M&amp;S\u2019s problem child, and despite rave reviews from the fashion press, women continue to turn away unless 20% off is dangled in front of them. Rowe, who is simultaneously a new broom and an old hand after 26 years at the retailer, is reviewing a wardrobe full of labels that increasingly blur together: when does North Coast reach Blue Harbour or M&amp;S Collection become a Classic? He\u2019s already promised to sharpen prices and become more fashionable, but in a tough retail climate he needs, ultimately, to pick a side. Does he want to dress older or younger shoppers, the well-off or the cost-conscious? M&amp;S can no longer be all things to all people \u2013 that doesn\u2019t work any more.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-22T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>For a brief time, in 1998, Rotherham stood proudly in the vanguard of European integration. \u201cEuro puts town on the world map,\u201d said a front-page headline in the <em>Rotherham Advertiser</em> in November that year. \u201cAll eyes turned on Rotherham this week as the town announced it was the first in Britain to be ready for the euro when the new currency becomes official in exactly 49 days,\u201d the paper declared. Euro notes were printed and put into limited circulation as part of a \u201ceuro ready\u201d campaign led by the chamber of commerce.</p> <p>Today the Rotherham euro project is long forgotten and this Labour town is, instead, a hotbed of anti-EU, pro-Brexit sentiment in the heart of South\u00a0Yorkshire.</p> <p>Research released this month by Chris Hanretty, reader in politics at the University of East Anglia, showed Rotherham had one the highest proportions of Brexit supporters of any constituency in the country: 49% of people backed leaving the EU and only 25% wanted to stay in. Pro-EU Labour may remain dominant on the council but this is no longer a \u201cone-party state\u201d. At the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2016/may/05/uk-election-results-tracker-2016\" title=\"\">local elections on 5 May,</a> Labour won 48 seats but Ukip strengthened its grip, taking 14.</p> <p>A visit to the town centre quickly yields clues as to why much of the population has turned against Europe and why Ukip is making strides. If anti-EU feeling was once a preserve of Conservative heartlands mainly in the south of England, Rotherham is proof that it is now deeply embedded in many former industrial communities in the north, too.</p> <p>The many foreign languages \u2013 Polish, Czech, Slovak, Urdu \u2013 spoken by shoppers are evidence of a rich multiracial, multicultural mix. David Kcak, who came over to Rotherham from the Czech Republic 10 years ago to work as a printer, is shopping with his wife Lucia. They say the town was attractive to them and many eastern Europeans after their countries joined the EU because property prices and the cost of living were low, and there was work if you looked for it.</p> <p>They have had two children in Rotherham, who are happily installed in local schools. \u201cWe are happy here, yes. There were no jobs at home,\u201d says David. \u201cBut not everybody likes the immigrant population.\u201d</p> <p>The hostility is not immediately obvious but many older people resent the change that has happened in their midst, without their asking for it. Good jobs that once existed in the coal mines have all gone and now the existence of the local Tata steelworks is under threat. Last year, Tata announced the loss of 720 British jobs in Rotherham, saying it was unable to compete against cheap foreign imports. Now the few thousand that are left may go too.</p> <p>A retired builder, who did not want to give his name, says the good jobs in coal and steel have been replaced by low-wage ones that eastern Europeans have taken up. Those are the hard-working ones, he says, but others just come to claim benefits and have filled up council houses and left schools overcrowded in the process. He says his town has changed beyond recognition and blames \u201cthe politicians in Europe\u201d for everything, including the loss of his bus service.</p> <p>\u201cEnoch Powell had it right: send \u2019em home,\u201d he says. He believes most people in Rotherham \u2013 bar the immigrants who will back a European Union that enables them to move around \u2013 will vote for Brexit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"275b174dedf9ce7d78803c28b9b37d33b5d6e484\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/275b174dedf9ce7d78803c28b9b37d33b5d6e484/0_36_1776_1066/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rotherham playing its part in the introduction of the euro in 1998.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rotherham playing its part in the introduction of the euro in 1998.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Trevor Travis, 68, a former haulage contractor, blames the EU for the demise of the steel industry and the influx of cheap Chinese imports. \u201cThe EU doesn\u2019t allow steel to be subsidised in this country. It is all Chinese now. How can that be?\u201d he asks. \u201cWe have to get out of the EU. Why do we obey all these EU rules, which on the continent they just ignore? We have to get back control for ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>Of course, not everyone in Rotherham is anti-EU. The manager of Eden Mobility in the town centre, Alan Bray, says he and many others don\u2019t know what to think.</p> <p>\u201cYou get one lot of intelligent people telling you to stay in and another lot saying vote to leave. It is difficult to know which way to go. I think I will vote to stay in because of the economic uncertainty of being on our own.\u201d</p> <p>His seems a minority view. Since 2012, anti-immigrant feeling has deepened as a result of the scandal of the sexual abuse of young children by gangs of predominantly Pakistani heritage in Rotherham. The scandal eroded confidence not just in the Labour council and police but in authority in general.</p> <p>Ukip councillors in Rotherham claim that the Labour-run council has compounded what they say was the town\u2019s already serious immigration overload by welcoming thousands of Roma over the last few years. The Roma put further strain on health services, housing and schools.</p> <p>Ukip councillor Peter Short says: \u201cThe teachers where they live don\u2019t speak Romanian and the children don\u2019t speak English. I feel sorry for the immigrants. They just want to get on and you can\u2019t blame them for that, but a lot of them haven\u2019t got work and they fill the schools and doctors\u2019 surgeries. Where is the joined-up thinking in that? It is ridiculous.\u201d</p> <p>Businessman John Turner, also a Ukip councillor, says he believes Labour councillors deliberately invited the Roma in large numbers and gave them homes believing that they would then vote Labour and keep the party in power. But he thinks more and more people have turned against Labour and the EU as a result.</p> <p>\u201cThere is no denying that there is a movement away from Labour, as well as hostility to the EU,\u201d he says.</p> <p>Andrew Mosley, editor of the <em>Rotherham Advertiser</em>, says feelings have moved from bitterness to anger and he senses that local people are engaging with the EU referendum as a potential means to effect real change. \u201cRotherham is a not a racist place,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have had the BNP and the EDL [English Defence League] holding marches and events here, but people in Rotherham did not want to vote for extreme parties. But they do want something new to look to.\u201d</p> <p>Rotherham is a proud community but one that has lost faith in those in charge, including those in the councils of Europe.</p> <p>\u201cI have worked on newspapers in other towns in the north and I have never known so many letters in the paper about Europe,\u201d says Mosley. \u201cIt is a big issue here.\u201d</p>",

      "headline": "How big tobacco lost its final fight for hearts, lungs and minds",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-22T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>There was a finality about it all, a sense that after half a century something was coming to an end. As David Anderson QC, one of \u201cbig tobacco\u2019s\u201d senior lawyers, put it, the battle against the introduction of plain packaging for cigarettes had become the industry\u2019s equivalent of Custer\u2019s Last Stand, its \u201clast battlefield\u201d.</p> <p>Legal hyperbole perhaps, but also an indication of just what the tobacco industry believed was at stake last week when the high court handed down its <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/19/tobacco-firms-lose-high-court-battle-plain-packaging-uk\" title=\"\">landmark judgment</a> rejecting a coordinated attempt by the world\u2019s four largest cigarette manufacturers to derail the new EU regulations that came into effect on Friday.</p> <p>The new tobacco directive means graphic health warnings with photos, text and cessation information must cover 65% of the front and the back of cigarette and roll-your-own tobacco packs. Member states have 12 months to sell old stock, and up to four years to sell menthol and flavoured cigarettes, which were banned outright.</p> <p>The EU directive also allowed the UK to go further and parliament voted last March by a majority of 254 MPs to introduce its own regulations, requiring all tobacco products to be sold in uniformly drab green-brown packaging with large images designed to act as health warnings. Having failed to overturn the changes at the European court of justice last month, big tobacco hoped it could succeed in front of a British judge.</p> <p>However, hailed by health campaigners as something that will save lives, not just in the UK but around the world, Mr Justice Green\u2019s ruling \u2013 rejecting an application for a judicial review into the government\u2019s regulations \u2013 laid bare, in embarrassing and irrefutable detail, how cigarette companies have targeted young people.</p> <p>The ruling was the full stop to a story that had its glamorous beginnings in the <em>Mad Men</em> era of the 1960s, when Hollywood made smoking fashionable, but which became ever darker as the tobacco industry connived to suppress evidence of the health risks posed by cigarettes, its role in smuggling its products around the world, how it routinely bribed governments and officials not to legislate against it and the way it identified developing countries as lucrative markets for exploitation.</p> <p>Then the narrative shifted. An increasingly muscular tobacco control lobby fought back, identifying the battle to strip the firms of their marketing weapons as a key priority, and big tobacco suddenly found its arsenal heavily depleted. Barred from promoting its product on billboards, in magazines and on television, it came to the view that packaging was essential to the identity of its brands, a piece of intellectual property that it could never afford to lose.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/sifting-the-evidence/2016/may/20/plain-standardised-cigarette-packaging-has-arrived-but-will-it-reduce-smoking\">Plain cigarette packaging has arrived, but will it reduce smoking?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As a cigarette packet designer, John Digianni, explains in an interview on the tobacco industry website <a href=\"http://www.tobaccotoday.info/2012/05/23/cigarettes-brand-evolution/\" title=\"\">Tobacco Today</a>: \u201cA cigarette package is part of a smoker\u2019s clothing, and when he saunters into a bar and plunks it down, he makes a statement about himself. When a user displays a badge product, this is witnessed by others, providing a living testimonial endorsement of the user on behalf of that brand and product.\u201d</p> <p>Boring old packaging, it transpires, is not so boring after all.</p> <p>The court was shown what seemed to be a normal pack of Benson &amp; Hedges cigarettes that went on sale in 2006. To open the pack, the consumer needed to slide a tray containing the cigarettes out of its side. Printed on the tray was an aphorism attributed to GK Chesterton: \u201cI owe my success to having listened respectfully to the very best advice and then going away and doing the exact opposite.\u201d Japan Tobacco International, owner of the Benson &amp; Hedges brand in the UK, credited the packaging innovation with a near 47% year-on-year rise in sales.</p> <p>Cigarette manufacturers acknowledge that such innovations boost sales among adults. However, they vigorously deny their products are targeted at young people. Yet the court was shown clear evidence of how even very young children can be drawn to cigarette packaging. A <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_z-4S8iicc\" title=\"\">video made by Cancer UK,</a> in which young children discussed the look of various packs, brought home the point forcefully. One girl, around six or seven years of age, was delighted with the pink packaging of a particular brand. \u201cIt\u2019s actually quite pretty,\u201d she said excitedly. A young boy described a yellow pack as \u201cfun\u201d and declared: \u201cIt makes you feel almost happy by looking at it.\u201d</p> <p>It is hard to see children of a similar age enthusing about the new-look packets \u2013 drab cartons adorned with gruesome images of people with smoking-related diseases.</p> <p>\u201cThis was a devastating defeat for big tobacco,\u201d said Deborah Arnott, chief executive of <a href=\"http://www.ash.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Action on Smoking and Health</a>, whose evidence submitted to the court was also shared with MPs before they debated the introduction of the regulation. \u201cFirst Australia, now the UK and France, have gone ahead with removing all branding, except the name in a standard-size font. Coming up fast behind are Ireland, Hungary, Norway, Canada and New Zealand, with others soon to follow. Before too long, glitzy, brightly coloured and highly branded tobacco packs will be a relic of the past, which children born today will never see.\u201d</p> <p>The tobacco giants\u2019 failure to win their case has left them picking up a multimillion pound legal bill and scrambling to calculate the devastating impact it will have on the value of their brands.</p> <p>In hearings last year, Anderson, on behalf of his client, Japan Tobacco International \u2013 which alongside Philip Morris, British American Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco brought the case against the government \u2013 expressed outrage at the idea this could happen without financial redress. \u201cHowever strong the objective for taking property away, you will normally compensate,\u201d he told Green. \u201cYour lordship will remember the slave owners were compensated when slavery was abolished.\u201d It was an unfortunate example. Big tobacco\u2019s profits were built on slavery: even many smokers would feel queasy with this argument. But the case was not really about compensation, the manufacturers maintained. Rather, it was about preventing bad law that would have repercussions for other industries \u2013 a favourite big tobacco argument.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6ac53bf2047784144d1a3a49fbf5b6ea0132d182\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ac53bf2047784144d1a3a49fbf5b6ea0132d182/0_21_1921_2400/800.jpg\" alt=\"An example of the new packaging\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An example of the new packaging</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Australian Government/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As Geoffrey Hobbs QC, a lawyer for BAT, who, along with JTI has said it plans to appeal the ruling, observed: \u201cThis case is not just about tobacco \u2026 there are proposals coming from different sources for the same sort of reasoning and approach to be applied in relation to foods with high salt content, foods with too much fat, too much sugar.\u201d</p> <p>More importantly, the new regulation was disproportionate and would not work, the cigarette giants argued. There was no evidence that it would discourage young people from smoking, as the government insisted. Rather, it would encourage the counterfeiting of cigarettes, because non-branded packets would be easier to make, something that would deprive the Treasury of much-needed tax revenues. Ultimately the illicit trade would help only criminal networks and terrorist groups.</p> <p>But all of these arguments, Anderson implied, fell on deaf ears because of what he called the \u201cmyth of tobacco exceptionalism\u201d \u2013 the view that manufacturers are \u201cuniquely devious\u201d.</p> <p>He told the court: \u201cWe have been trying at the bar to imagine whether we can think of any other group of legal or natural persons, terrorist suspects, arms dealers, Jews, in respect of whose evidence one might even begin to think that one could tenably say, \u2018Well, of course, in looking at this evidence I have been very careful because I know from the past that these people are a bit devious and a bit unworthy, and the only thing they\u2019re really interested in is subverting public health.\u2019\u2009\u201d Yet last week\u2019s judgment, running to 1,000 paragraphs, confirmed in excoriating detail just how determined big tobacco has been down the decades to achieve precisely this goal. It noted how the court had been made aware of some 14m internal tobacco industry documents that had been revealed as a result of a raft of legal settlements in the US. Among the treasure trove, its attention was drawn to a damning internal memo from Marlboro manufacturer Philip Morris, written as far back as 1981.</p> <p>\u201cIt is important to know as much as possible about teenage smoking patterns and attitudes,\u201d the memo read. \u201cThe smoking patterns of teenagers are particularly important to Philip Morris \u2026 it is during the teenage years that the initial brand choice is made.\u201d</p> <p>Other internal Philip Morris documents made the same points. \u201cThe success of Marlboro Red during its most rapid growth period was because it became the brand of choice among teenagers who then stuck with it as they grew older,\u201d one memo stated.</p> <p>\u201cYounger adult smokers have been the critical factor in the growth and decline of every major brand and company over the last 50 years,\u201d another stated. \u201cThey will continue to be just as important to brands/companies in the future.\u201d</p> <p>A memo written in 1992 was even more blunt: \u201cThe ability to attract new smokers and develop them into a young adult franchise is key to brand development.\u201d</p> <p>The court was also made aware of evidence cited by the World Health Organisation, held in several online archives in the US and the UK and running to almost 50m pages. The evidence prompted the WHO to conclude: \u201cTobacco companies and their public relations firms have always insisted that advertising does not cause non-smokers to take up the habit, but is intended to get those already smoking to switch brands. And the companies deny vigorously that they ever marketed to children.</p> <p>\u201cThe documents reveal the complete opposite to be true. The marketing experts in the tobacco companies knew the essential arithmetic: current smokers quit or die; therefore new smokers are always needed. Since the majority of adult smokers begin in their teenage years, this is the group that had to be targeted by advertising and promotions. The tobacco companies have created \u2018children shouldn\u2019t smoke until they are adults\u2019 campaigns around the world, without ever mentioning the health reasons for not smoking. Internal company documents show these campaigns to be a public relations effort to deflect the severe criticism against the industry for such successful promotions as those using the <a href=\"http://www.vintageadbrowser.com/joe-camel-ads\" title=\"\">Joe Camel character</a>, which may have hooked millions of teenagers into smoking.\u201d</p> <p>The court also discussed the landmark <a href=\"http://publichealthlawcenter.org/topics/tobacco-control/tobacco-control-litigation/united-states-v-philip-morris-doj-lawsuit\" title=\"\">Kessler judgment</a> of 1999, which followed a legal case brought against the tobacco companies in the US.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a2fdbae827676a729125f2f6c5dacd15a93f5e33\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a2fdbae827676a729125f2f6c5dacd15a93f5e33/0_113_2764_1659/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A 1939 advert for Craven \u201cA\u201d cigarettes.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A 1939 advert for Craven \u201cA\u201d cigarettes.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe evidence is clear and convincing \u2013 and beyond any reasonable doubt \u2013 that defendants have marketed to young people 21 and under, while consistently, publicly, and falsely, denying they do so,\u201d Justice Kessler declared.</p> <p>\u201cDefendants intensively researched and tracked young people\u2019s attitudes, preferences and habits. As a result of those investigations, defendants knew that youth were highly susceptible to marketing and advertising appeals, would underestimate the health risks and effects of smoking, would overestimate their ability to stop smoking, and were price sensitive. Defendants used their knowledge of young people to create highly sophisticated and appealing marketing campaigns targeted to lure them into starting smoking and later becoming nicotine addicts.\u201d</p> <p>A breakdown of the sales figures of the three most popular brands confirms this claim. Once confidential company documents reveal that in 2003 88% of youth smokers bought the three most heavily advertised brands \u2013 Marlboro, Camel and Newport. In contrast, fewer than half of smokers over the age of 25 purchased the same three brands. Marlboro, the most heavily marketed brand, held a staggering 49.2% of the 12- to 17-year-old market in the US.</p> <p>The tobacco giants insisted that many of the documents cited as evidence against them were 40 years old and no longer relevant. Instead they sought to shift the focus to Australia, where plain packaging was introduced in 2012.</p> <p>The court heard that the industry had commissioned two reports from KPMG codenamed \u201cProject Star\u201d and \u201cProject Sun\u201d, which purportedly showed that plain packaging was responsible for a rise in illicit sales of cigarettes in Australia. But in a letter to public health minister Jane Ellison, dated 2 May 2014 and released under the Freedom of Information Act, Robin Cartwright, a KPMG partner, admitted that: \u201cThe report we released recently, Illicit Tobacco in Australia \u2013 2013 Half Year Report, has been somewhat misrepresented by others, without our consent, to suggest it supports the contention that plain paper packaging could lead of itself to an increase in tobacco smuggling and duty avoidance.\u201d</p> <p>Ultimately, despite the mountains of evidence they submitted to the court, there was an extraordinary lacuna at the heart of the tobacco companies\u2019 case. In public they claimed that the new regulations would not achieve their chief goal of discouraging children from taking up smoking, but they failed to submit any of their own private analysis to explain how they reached this conclusion. Green was astonished by this failure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"7908951460ee3d9a598a95fe0aaf75d86b1f9ed1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7908951460ee3d9a598a95fe0aaf75d86b1f9ed1/5_26_1566_1956/801.jpg\" alt=\"Marlboro Man billboard\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Marlboro Man advertised the brand from the 1950s until the 1990s.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Chapple/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt is common sense that the claimant tobacco companies will have conducted some analysis, internally, of the economic and financial implications for each of them of the introduction of the regulations,\u201d he noted in his ruling. \u201cNone of that analysis is before the court or has been (apparently) seen by the experts instructed by the tobacco companies.\u201d</p> <p>As a result, much of the evidence produced by the experts on behalf of big tobacco to counter the government\u2019s case was dismissed by Green who, one by one, shot them down. The evidence of Jonathan Klick, a professor of law at the University of Pennsylvania, who was \u201cretained by BAT to offer an opinion upon the literature regarding the effects of plain packaging on smoking\u201d, was described as \u201cunsatisfactory in multiple respects\u201d.</p> <p>Neil McKeganey, professor of sociology at the University of Glasgow and director of the Centre for Drug Misuse Research, produced a review of some of the main pieces of research literature that failed to confront \u201cthe contrary evidence, including that from the tobacco companies\u201d which would have made it \u201chard to see how he could have advanced the opinions that he did\u201d.</p> <p>Gregory Mitchell, professor of law at the University of Virginia, who produced a report on how adolescents make health decisions, submitted \u201cevidence unsatisfactory at almost every level\u201d.</p> <p>Casey Mulligan, professor in economics, University of Chicago, who developed economic models examining the impact of plain packaging on the Australian market, \u201cemploys an unforgiving approach which never admits of even the possibility of error on his part whilst simultaneously taking the view that any and all opposing experts\u2019 reports are flawed\u201d.</p> <p>As the smoke cleared from the battlefield after last week\u2019s landmark ruling, one question lingered: why had the cigarette giants not shared the vast amounts of data they had accumulated over more than half a century with their own expert witnesses? Green had a view: \u201cThe experience in the US shows that there are likely to be a multiplicity of relevant documents, and that they might well not be supportive of the claimants\u2019 case.\u201d</p> <p>For Marlboro Man and Joe Camel, the risk that such documents would become public was just too great. They had waged a ferocious rearguard action to prevent the truth from coming out. In the end they went down fighting. But they were firing blanks.</p>",

      "body": "<p>They know their patriotic history in Appledore. The fleet that defeated the Spanish armada was largely built and crewed by the men of this port, in north-west Devon. The village, sitting on the banks where the Taw and Torridge rivers meet before they flow into Bideford Bay, is perhaps England\u2019s oldest fishing port.</p> <p>So it was with dismay that locals looked on as the last English boat based here \u2013 the Hannah Marie \u2013 was sold five weeks ago. The marine-blue trawler is awaiting shipment to Denmark. According to local people, it is the latest victim of EU fishing quotas. \u201cNot one English boat here now,\u201d said Tony Rutherford, chief executive of North Devon Fishermen\u2019s Association, his anger barely concealed. \u201cThere were about 80 to 100 in these parts in 2002.\u201d</p> <p>Rutherford turned to his laptop, opened up a real-time map of the local seas on his screen and pointed at the red arrows representing fishing boats. \u201cJust off Milford Haven now is a very big fishery for ray fish,\u201d said Rutherford, who has owned Bideford Fisheries, a business on the quay that buys from fishermen and sells on to wholesalers, since 1979.</p> <p>He settled his cursor on each of the six red arrows swarming around the screen. The flag under which each boat was sailing was revealed in turn. \u201cBelgian,\u201d he said. \u201cBelgian, Belgian fishing boat. Belgian, Belgian, Belgian.\u201d</p> <p>Rutherford reached into his files and took out a letter sent to the fisheries minister in November 2008. \u201cI have got folders and folders of paperwork.\u201d He pointed to the text warning of the consequences of cutting the amount of ray English trawlers could catch. \u201cWe note with concern the commission\u2019s proposal to put skate and ray on quota for 2009,\u201d the letter says. \u201cThe Bristol Channel is very much a ray fishery and Appledore is the single most important port in the country to handle ray \u2026 Because the Bristol Channel is a unique fishery, we know that without ray, the fishing fleet would be unviable.\u201d</p> <p>The plea fell on deaf ears. Rutherford will vote in favour of leaving the European Union next month.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ba8b837958ef741e6356aa43ebd2678c02a8d323\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ba8b837958ef741e6356aa43ebd2678c02a8d323/0_813_5336_3203/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Appledore has been hit by the loss of fishing and shipbuilding jobs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Appledore has been hit by the loss of fishing and shipbuilding jobs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Saville/Apex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Appledore is in the parliamentary constituency of Torridge and West Devon and many others in these parts will vote the same way as Rutherford. Recent polling suggests that 49% of people will vote to leave the EU next month, with a mere 28% who want to stay. It is one of the most Eurosceptic places in the country. And the plight of the fishing industry is only the most tangible explanation for why people here feel they have lost control of their destiny. As picture-postcard pretty as much of this constituency is, there are many brutal pressures on the residents of Appledore.</p> <p>The average age of people in the area run by Torridge district council, of which Appledore is part, is 44, higher than the English average of 39, according to the 2011 census. A quarter of those who live here have no educational qualifications. The percentage of people in the village who rate their health as \u201cvery good\u201d is less than the national average; while the percentage rating their health as \u201cvery bad\u201d is above the national average.</p> <p>Only 15% of the population have professional or managerial occupations, compared with the 22% average for England as a whole. And a report in 2014 suggested that workers in Torridge are the worst-paid in the country, receiving on average \u00a310,000 less than the English average of \u00a327,000. In February a third of the workforce from the Babcock\u2019s shipyard in Appledore \u2013 visible from the quayside where dog walkers stroll \u2013 was transferred down to a sister yard at Devonport, Plymouth, because contracts had dried up.</p> <p>The grey vessel being built at Appledore for the Irish navy, visible from the village quay, is due to be launched later this year, leaving the remaining workers with little to work on. The yard has lost its bid to build the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/video/2016/mar/21/polar-research-ship-absolutely-critical-to-forecast-climate-change-video\" title=\"\">\u00a3200m polar research vessel</a>.</p> <p>On Thursday afternoon, at a Brexit debate at Petroc further and higher education college in Barnstaple, six miles east of Appledore, tempers flared. \u201cYou\u2019re a historian,\u201d shouted one man in his 60s at the young lecturer, head of the college\u2019s history department, who had spoken in support of remaining in the European Union, \u201ctell me how the EU is democratic.\u201d</p> <p>Philip Milton, a one-time Tory parliamentary candidate, told the 60 people in the audience that those in favour of remaining in the EU were using \u201cemotional propaganda and fear\u201d to win the campaign and that it was time to give the faceless bureaucrats in Brussels \u201ca bloody nose\u201d. And while the speakers in favour of remaining in the EU had their turn to speak, it was the Brexiters who made the headway with the crowd, which was noticeably elderly despite the location.</p> <p>Indeed, a generational divide was evident. Stuart Robertson, chair of Ukip in North Devon (a constituency where 48% say they want to leave), noted that the local newspaper had reported that 80% of students at the college were pro-EU. \u201cThat\u2019s very worrying,\u201d he said. \u201cBrainwashed,\u201d a member of the audience shouted. \u201cI believe so,\u201d said Robertson, nodding. A second audience member shouted back: \u201cEducated.\u201d Looking appalled, Robertson muttered: \u201cSays it all.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2392f6ad37966d7d584b36d56b2731725bed9f1b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2392f6ad37966d7d584b36d56b2731725bed9f1b/0_113_5778_3468/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Appledore worker Graeme Farmer: \u2018I was always someone who was Remain, but the debate has pushed me away.\u201d\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Appledore worker Graeme Farmer: \u2018I was always someone who was Remain, but the debate has pushed me away.\u201d</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Saville/Apex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On the cobbled streets, and in the quaint coffee and antique shops of Appledore, the divide was just as obvious. Graeme Farmer, 38, who works on a programme for children with special needs, was watching over some teenagers on a skateboard ramp on Friday. \u201cI\u2019m stuck in the middle on the EU really,\u201d he admitted. \u201cI was always someone who was Remain, but the debate has pushed me away.</p> <p>\u201cI watched <em>Question Time</em> last night and the audience were asking sensible questions but the politicians just came back with their scripted answers. I am probably still Remain though.\u201d</p> <p>Over at the gift shop, Linda Brodie, 64, stocking the shelves, was far less conflicted \u2013 and said she spoke for many of her generation in the village. \u201cI am 100% for leaving and a lot of people here are,\u201d she said. \u201cI read in the paper that the EU is going to make us build 220,000 homes for immigrants coming over.\u201d She whispered: \u201cThe good thing about around here is that we don\u2019t have any immigrants.\u201d</p> <p>Linda Upton, 57, at John\u2019s Grocers on the quayside, had similar concerns \u2013 but was rather more diplomatic. \u201cMore and more I just think we would be better making our own decisions about border control,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I feel angry for the poor fishermen. I wasn\u2019t sure how I would vote but as it goes on I think we would be financially better off if we left and we can put the money into the NHS.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6a692bfba420e65a3f762408ff99e88fe16bfb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6a692bfba420e65a3f762408ff99e88fe16bfb4/0_941_4016_2410/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Local worker Linda Upton: \u2018We would be better making our own decisions.\u2019\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Appledore worker Linda Upton: \u2018We would be better making our own decisions.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Saville/Apex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back in Bideford Fisheries, Rutherford was a busy man. He has adapted his business over the years. \u201cFish is now caught in our waters by foreign boats, taken abroad, shipped back in to the UK, processed here and sold on,\u201d he said, adding that his turnover for that week had been \u00a375,000 and that he had just sorted the wage packets for 14\u00a0people.</p> <p>But he said he found what had happened to Appledore \u201cheartbreaking\u201d. Rutherford, the fourth generation in his family in the fishing business, works in a building that was built using \u00a33.8m of EU grants. Yet the clumsiness of the EU behemoth had killed his community, he said. \u201cThey throw around money but I don\u2019t think they have got enough knowledge, don\u2019t understand things,\u201d he said, shaking his head. \u201cNobody is listening.

      "body": "<p>Isabelle Huppert is known to have a certain self-awareness regarding the way she looks. But we\u2019re not talking about the kind of vanity you might conventionally be tempted to ascribe to film stars. With this outstanding French screen and stage actor, it\u2019s more a precise analytical interest in her appearance and the meaning it can convey. She once said, \u201cIn a close-up, a flicker of the eyelids is a major event\u201d \u2013 and in so many of her films that flicker, or the slightest tense moue at the corner of the mouth can have a profoundly eloquent, even seismic effect. Her body and her face are among the precision tools of her trade, so it\u2019s understandable that she takes a hands-on interest in her relation with the camera, whether it\u2019s shooting film or stills.</p> <p>So when I walk into her dressing room at Paris\u2019s historic Th\u00e9\u00e2tre de l\u2019Od\u00e9on, Huppert has her glasses on and is huddling over the <em>Observer </em>photographer\u2019s laptop, peering intently at the portraits he\u2019s just taken of her and giving firm opinions on which do and don\u2019t work. \u201c<em>Non</em> \u2013 too hard. Not this one, it makes me look like I\u2019m missing a leg. This one\u2019s good. But you\u2019d have to crop it here.\u201d</p> <p>I\u2019d love to be able to report on exactly how Huppert uses those finely tuned features in the stage performance she is about to bring to London\u2019s Barbican. But I arrive in Paris to find that this evening\u2019s performance of <em>Phaedra(s)</em>, her current <em>spectacle</em> at the Od\u00e9on, has been cancelled because the theatre is occupied by demonstrating <em>intermittents du spectacle </em>\u2013 arts workers protesting against proposed cuts to the benefits that they receive while not working. That this system exists is testament to the enlightened attitude towards culture that still operates in France, although it\u2019s apparent that a certain irritation towards the cause exists backstage at the Od\u00e9on, the show\u2019s director Krzysztof Warlikowski having decided it was impossible to stage <em>Phaedra(s)</em> during the occupation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43134cfde8136b350fc75c19863d154d9cdd6b5f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43134cfde8136b350fc75c19863d154d9cdd6b5f/0_196_4500_2760/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Isabelle Huppert on stage in Phaedra(s) in Paris.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"613\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Isabelle Huppert on stage in Phaedra(s) in Paris. The play comes to London\u2019s Barbican next month, complete with surtitles. \u2018You will understand,\u2019 Huppert promises.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pascal Victor/ArtComArt</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the event, all I have seen of the production is a somewhat blurry video recording in which Huppert and her fellow actors appear as murky figures in the stage landscape. But I can report that, vocally and physically, Huppert gives a performance radically at odds with the minimalism we often associate with her screen roles. There are eldritch screams, agonised physical contortions, highly formal enunciations of speeches and stage directions alike. The theme is the classical story of Phaedra, the queen who falls passionately for her stepson Hippolytus \u2013 as told by Euripides, Seneca and most famously Racine. Polish director Warlikowski\u2019s version of the myth mixes the classics with a new text by Lebanese writer Wadji Mouawad, chunks of JM Coetzee\u2019s 2003 essay-novel <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2003/sep/14/fiction.jmcoetzee\"><em>Elizabeth Costello</em></a> and the entirety of the late Sarah Kane\u2019s characteristically brutal 1996 play <em>Phaedra\u2019s Love</em>. Containing dance sequences, video projections, an extremely mobile stage set and a radically decentred approach to its ostensible subject, <em>Phaedra(s)</em> is a full-on multi-media assault that will startle theatregoers expecting a classic tale classically told. It has, I suggest to Huppert, very little to do with the British theatre tradition.</p> <p>\u201cOr with the French theatre tradition,\u201d she says. \u201cLet\u2019s say that Warlikowski has his own world.\u201d This is the second time she has worked with the director; their last collaboration was a version of <em>A Streetcar Named Desire</em> set in a mental hospital, with Blanche DuBois as a literature professor reciting Flaubert and Euripides.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I don't particularly think about Phaedra the character. We know what her problem is. She's in love with her stepson</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Sitting in her dressing room \u2013 trim at just over 5ft, in black trousers and boots and a white couture jumper \u2013 Huppert lives up to one of her reputations. I don\u2019t mean the version that depicts her as a chilly, forbidding figure, but certainly the one that presents her as unashamedly cerebral, an alert and acute thinker who doesn\u2019t squander words. French actors in particular can be a little vaporous in interview as they weave poetic abstractions around the intangibles of their art, but with Huppert, speaking in French, you feel you\u2019re getting a very considered tutorial. On Sarah Kane, whose demanding <em>4.48 Psychosis </em>she performed in 2002, Huppert says, \u201cHer language is the language of consciousness. It\u2019s somehow cosmic, certainly in no sense realist.\u201d</p> <p>She explains how the different levels of <em>Phaedra(s) </em>fit together. \u201cWadji Mouawad gives us a geopolitical Phaedra \u2013 a Phaedra torn from her roots, who reminds us of the struggles of immigrants, people who\u2019ve lost their land and are dealing with the deaths of those close to them. Sarah Kane gives us a bourgeois family stifling under the weight of secrecy, lies and shame. And Coetzee\u2019s Phaedra isn\u2019t really Phaedra but an intellectual giving a lecture on female desire, on the relationships between men and gods.\u201d</p> <p>Phaedra, Huppert commented in a recent French interview, \u201cis less a character than an idea\u201d. What, for her, is the difference? \u201cWhen I do a performance like this, I\u2019m not particularly thinking about Phaedra the character. Everyone already knows what her problem is. She\u2019s in love with her stepson, who isn\u2019t her son, so it\u2019s transgression but not quite incest \u2013 and maybe that makes it worse.\u201d With mythical figures, you\u2019re dealing with readymades, she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like Madame Bovary\u201d \u2013 whom Huppert played in a Claude Chabrol film of 1991 \u2013 \u201cMadame Bovary is ennui, depression, unrealisable dreams. And Phaedra is burning desire, desire associated with death. That means you can very easily move away from the story, from the anecdote,\u201d she says, giving the word the very faintest hint of contempt.</p> <p>There\u2019s no denying that <em>Phaedra(s)</em> is a challenging piece, both in its kinetic, confrontational staging, and in its dense flood of text, performed in a heightened, non-naturalistic manner; in the Kane section, Huppert recites the stage directions aloud in a haunted, robotic style. Some French critics admitted to being mystified by the show. So how will it go down in London, accompanied by surtitles?</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve seen a lot of surtitled performances, and I\u2019ve done a lot of them,\u201d Huppert says. \u201cSometimes it can really open things up, because a surtitle can\u2019t give you everything. In theatre it doesn\u2019t matter if there\u2019s something else that transmits meaning \u2013 our imagination can take its cue from vision alone. For me, it\u2019s not a problem if I see a play and I can\u2019t understand anything at all \u2013 it can be fun. Here, you won\u2019t understand nothing \u2013 you will understand.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4a3b44d8bb9b80a3d7a87eb207c9ccb9adce46ab\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a3b44d8bb9b80a3d7a87eb207c9ccb9adce46ab/0_0_2148_3126/687.jpg\" alt=\"Huppert with G\u00e9rard Depardieu in Loulou (1980)\" width=\"687\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Huppert with G\u00e9rard Depardieu in Loulou (1980).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Huppert clearly feels at home in an abstracted, experimental realm of theatre; the last time I saw her on stage in Paris was in a super-austere version of <em>Hedda Gabler</em>, in which she spent nearly the whole evening standing motionless on a stage resembling a Japanese lacquered platform. \u201cI\u2019ve been lucky,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve had a very rich experience in theatre because of the stature of the directors I\u2019ve worked with.\u201d She reels off a list of names including Bob Wilson, Peter Zadek, Yasmina Reza.</p> <p>But her debut in theatre was a little more rough and ready. Born in 1953 and raised in the Paris suburb of Ville-d\u2019Avray, Huppert is the daughter of an English teacher mother and a father who manufactured safes. She studied at the Paris Conservatoire and had an early stage stint at the start of the 70s working with her sisters, director Caroline and playwright Elisabeth. A particular hit was a cafe-theatre production of Elisabeth\u2019s play <em>The True Story of Jack the Ripper</em>. \u201cIt had a very long run \u2013 it was a pretty scandalous play. It imagined Jack as a woman, so you had this sapphic relationship between Jack and his victims. And in a cafe-theatre, you\u2019re very close to the audience, which makes for a very powerful eroticism.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>All the directors whose debut features I\u2019ve made recently  turned out to be real film-makers \u2013 I have good intuition</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Perhaps in a similar mode, Huppert will soon be seen in a French reworking of the Jekyll and Hyde story, <em>Mrs Hyde</em>, in which she plays Madame G\u00e9quil. Her husband in the film will be G\u00e9rard Depardieu, a screen partner from way back: in 1980, they made a striking star-crossed couple of social outsiders in Maurice Pialat\u2019s realist drama <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2006/nov/17/worldcinema.drama1\"><em>Loulou</em></a>. Last year, one of the event movies in Cannes was their reunion after 35 years in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/may/22/valley-of-love-review-some-peaks-more-troughs-as-gerard-depardieu-and-isabelle-huppert-hike-death-valley\"><em>Valley of Love</em></a>, in which the actors play a divorced couple \u2013 named Isabelle and G\u00e9rard \u2013 summoned to California\u2019s Death Valley, seemingly by their dead son. It\u2019s a haunting figures-in-a-landscape drama, and an essay on time and physicality, with a trim, elegant, seemingly ageless Huppert, now 63, framed in the shadow of Depardieu\u2019s weary, gargantuan bulk. When I ask about the film, Huppert is more willing to talk about the locale than her co-star.</p> <p>\u201cThere are lots of tourists but you can get away \u2013 I went on some long walks, miles from anyone. It was a brilliant idea to set that story there \u2013 if they had met up in the Place de l\u2019Od\u00e9on, it wouldn\u2019t have been the same.\u201d</p> <p>As for working again with Depardieu, Huppert is almost dismissive about the legendary status of their reunion, which was so much the film\u2019s selling point. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we\u2019re Marlene Dietrich and whoever.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyYGDy_6tuk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/dyYGDy_6tuk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Valley of Love trailer.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Huppert generally seems reticent to talk about other actors or collaborators. When I ask her about sharing a stage with Cate Blanchett in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/10/cate-blanchett-isabelle-huppert-the-maids-review\"><em>The Maids </em></a>in Sydney and New York, she simply says they have very different acting styles, and turns the discussion to how strange it felt to be performing Jean Genet in English. On working with Patti Smith for a reading of the singer-poet\u2019s book <em>Just Kids</em>, she only says Smith has a fabulous voice whether singing or speaking.</p> <p>Huppert is more inclined to enthuse about directors; she has said that her only criterion for deciding to make a film is the desire to work with a particular person. In the course of a formidable \u2013 and sometimes relentlessly globe-trotting \u2013 career, she has chalked up a vast catalogue of illustrious auteur names. She has worked her way through the pantheon of major French directors: in recent years, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/jul/04/white-material-claire-denis-huppert\">Claire Denis</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/157812/abuse-of-weakness\">Catherine Breillat</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/olivier-assayas\">Olivier Assayas</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2002/nov/29/artsfeatures6\">Fran\u00e7ois Ozon</a>; before that, Jean-Luc Godard, Bertrand Tavernier and, repeatedly, Claude Chabrol. She has also collaborated with film-makers from Russia, Hungary, South Korea and the Philippines, as well as making a handful of films in the US, most famously Michael Cimino\u2019s <em>maudit</em> western <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/aug/04/heavens-gate-review\"><em>Heaven\u2019s Gate</em></a> (1980). And she regularly works with largely untested names on first or second features \u2013 much more than a star of her status might be expected to \u2013 a recent example being Belgian director Bavo Defurne, in whose forthcoming <em>Souvenir </em>she plays a forgotten Eurovision singer on the comeback trail. How does she know when a new name will have what it takes? She gives a casual shrug. \u201cOh, it\u2019s just a bet I take, and I\u2019ve rarely been wrong. All the directors whose debut features I\u2019ve made in the past seven, eight years have turned out to be real film-makers \u2013 I have a good intuition.\u201d</p> <p>Huppert\u2019s latest film, however, is directed by a controversial A-lister \u2013 Paul Verhoeven. He\u2019s the Dutch provocateur who became one of the biggest names in 80s-90s Hollywood, specialising in abrasively violent science fiction (<em>RoboCop</em>, <em>Starship Troopers</em>) and sexually intense thrillers and melodramas such as <em>Basic Instinct</em> and the flamboyantly brassy <em>Showgirls </em>\u2013 a film widely regarded as a bad joke, yet viewed in France as a highly serious artistic statement. Premiered at Cannes, Verhoeven\u2019s French-language thriller <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lp3vr098WqY\"><em>Elle</em> </a>stars Huppert as the head of a computer games company reacting to rape by a mystery assailant. Judging by the trailer, it plays both on Huppert\u2019s skill at extreme emotion and on her fine command of inscrutability.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"97b76c2f9c853623034af87d52aeafa1238789a0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/97b76c2f9c853623034af87d52aeafa1238789a0/0_101_2961_1862/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Huppert with Kris Kristofferson in Heaven\u2019s Gate (1980)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"629\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Huppert with Kris Kristofferson in Heaven\u2019s Gate (1980).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Courtesy Criterion Collection.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She loved working with Verhoeven, she says. \u201cThe film is really rich, very surprising and enigmatic. It\u2019s elusive. It\u2019s not a genre movie, but it\u2019s not a non-genre movie either \u2013 it floats somewhere between Chabrol and Hitchcock, but it\u2019s still a thousand per cent Verhoeven. There\u2019s also a sociological dimension. It\u2019s about a very contemporary woman, not a victim, but someone who bears up \u2013 only you don\u2019t see her bearing up. Things just happen to her and she lives through them, without complaining. You can\u2019t say she\u2019s a victim, or a heroine, or a woman of power \u2013 although she is a woman of power. All those categories distract us from reality, in a way.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s strange to think of Verhoeven \u2013 whose notoriety rests partly on a subliminal flash of Sharon Stone\u2019s crotch in <em>Basic Instinct</em> \u2013 making what sounds like a feminist film. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s strange \u2013 <em>Showgirls</em> was a major feminist film. In a way. He\u2019s certainly not misogynist.\u201d</p> <p>Perhaps a more overtly feminist statement is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/13/things-to-come-review-mia-hansen-love-berlin-film-festival\"><em>Things to Come</em></a>, Huppert\u2019s collaboration with young French writer-director Mia Hansen-L\u00f8ve, which premiered in February in the Berlin film festival. In it, Huppert gives a phenomenally vivid yet understated performance as a philosophy teacher going through separation from her husband and coping with her elderly mother\u2019s dementia. A middle-aged intellectual woman with complex depths, everyday emotional travails and a sense of humour \u2013 this is the sort of role that barely anyone writes these days. Only in France, you might say, and only from someone as astute as Hansen-L\u00f8ve, who made the French techno-generation film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/26/eden-review-paris-clubland-hansen-love-mia-sven\"><em>Eden</em></a>, and who is herself the daughter of philosophers; Huppert says she essentially plays the director\u2019s mother.</p> <p>Does she, I wonder, ever feel less appreciated when playing ordinary women, rather than the characters she\u2019s often most closely associated with \u2013 such as the emotionally damaged musician in Michael Haneke\u2019s harrowing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/nov/09/londonfilmfestival2001.londonfilmfestival1\"><em>The Piano Teacher</em></a>, or the murderous women of Chabrol\u2019s films (<em>Violette Nozi\u00e8re</em>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/17/la-ceremonie-crime\"><em>La C\u00e9r\u00e9monie</em></a>)? \u201cNot at all,\u201d she says. \u201cMost of my characters are very, very ordinary women. Chabrol only ever cast me as fairly ordinary characters \u2013 they just have rather particular destinies.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s also the comic side of Huppert, seen in the lighter films that don\u2019t always get distributed in the UK. It sometimes comes as a surprise to see her letting her hair down and having fun, playing a confused tourist in the South Korean comedy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/may/21/in-another-country-review\"><em>In Another Country</em></a>, or in <em>Copacabana</em>, a French film in which she plays a flighty ex-hippie holed up in Ostend, of all places. Viewers do tend to think of her on-screen persona as a full-on neurotic, steeped in psychosexual anguish.</p> <p>\u201cYes, but you can be a comic neurotic too.\u201d So does she feel underrated doing comedy? \u201cI certainly do feel\u2026\u201d she hesitates a moment; I take that as a yes. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019d love to work with Woody Allen or Noah Baumbach \u2013 to do comedy in that New York vein.\u201d But her serious roles, she insists, often contain more humour than is apparent. \u201cEven <em>The Piano Teacher</em> \u2013 although I wouldn\u2019t try to persuade anyone that was an out and out comedy\u2026\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I haven't started it yet but you can imagine what a Michael Haneke film called Happy Ending will be like</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Next year, Huppert will be seen in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/30/michael-haneke-to-reunite-with-isabelle-huppert-for-calais-set-drama\">another film with the austere Austrian maestro Haneke</a>. \u201cI haven\u2019t started it yet. But you can imagine what a Michael Haneke film called <em>Happy Ending</em> will be like. You can imagine there will be a certain irony, a certain\u2026\u201d \u2013 she hesitates playfully, choosing her words \u2013 \u201cclear-sightedness. For me, the title says everything about how lucidly Haneke sees the world.\u201d Apparently it\u2019s about immigration, I hazard. \u201cApparently. That\u2019s not all there is to it. We\u2019ll see.\u201d</p> <p>The mention of immigration seems a good moment to steer Huppert on to political themes, although she is famous for being reserved on this terrain: she once told an interviewer, \u201cYou\u2019re not entitled to ask questions like, \u2018Who do you vote for?\u2019\u201d Given that the Od\u00e9on is, while we\u2019re speaking, surrounded by a police guard \u2013 even with a relatively small, quiet contingent of demonstrators in occupation \u2013 I ask how she feels about the general mood in Paris since the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/paris-attacks\">attacks at the Bataclan</a> and elsewhere in November 2015. Huppert turns uncharacteristically vague.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s complicated. There\u2019s definitely less freedom of speech, less freedom <em>tout court </em>\u2013 you have to really be careful about what you say, it\u2019s very easy to be misunderstood, and that makes for a harmful climate. It\u2019s all a bit complicated. Still, you have to have faith in the future.\u201d</p> <p>I mention the rise of the right in France. \u201cWell, it\u2019s not just the right and the extreme right, there are problems on the left too, it\u2019s all a bit complicated\u2026\u201d And that\u2019s about as far as she\u2019ll go.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"433716f61960101af39e71a3ebb2d2002cb6247e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/433716f61960101af39e71a3ebb2d2002cb6247e/99_0_756_1000/756.jpg\" alt=\"Huppert with her actress daughter Lolita Chammah on the cover of Psychologies magazine\" width=\"756\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Huppert is also famously guarded when it comes to her personal life. She never discusses her husband, and the father of her three children, Ronald Chammah, whom she met when he directed her in a 1987 film called <em>Milan Noir</em>: \u201cThat\u2019s part of my private life,\u201d she firmly told me when I asked her about him years ago. Yet, given her reluctance to place her life in the media spotlight, I tell her I\u2019m surprised to see her all over the Paris newsstands on the cover of <em>Psychologies</em> magazine, together with her 32-year-old daughter Lolita Chammah, herself a rising screen actor. Huppert perks up. \u201cIs it out already?\u201d I pass her my copy. On the front are mother and daughter in a portrait that plays up their resemblance: both red-haired, both in identical white shirts, both gazing inscrutably at the camera. \u201cAh\u2026 <em>C\u2019est belle la photo!</em>\u201d she enthuses.</p> <p>Inside is a lengthy interview in which the pair discuss the pleasures and pains of the mother-daughter relationship. \u201cWhy did I do it? Does that surprise you? But I don\u2019t talk about my private life in it at all, it\u2019s all very general talk about a mother\u2019s relationship with her children \u2013 there are no details, no anecdotes.\u201d The interview does indeed maintain an amiable pitch of faux-revelatory vagueness: \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve been an anxious mother\u2026 more a strong, protective one,\u201d and so forth. They\u2019re clearly a strong team, in any case; Huppert and Lolita play a zesty comic turn as mother and daughter in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7O1A2p-5pU\"><em>Copacabana</em></a>, and are about to play similar roles again.</p> <p>Admirers of Huppert on screen, then, should be prepared to abandon all preconceptions for <em>Phaedra(s)</em>. They should probably abandon some of their preconceptions of theatre too \u2013 if the production is theatre, strictly speaking. \u201cFor me,\u201d Huppert says, \u201ctheatre is all about the possibility of not doing theatre. Very often in theatre, you think you\u2019re obliged to do certain things \u2013 but it really gets interesting when you\u2019re obliged to do precisely nothing. It\u2019s about placing writing and language somewhere other than they\u2019re usually supposed to go.\u201d</p> <p>And neither is her idea of the theatrical experience necessarily to do with emotion, she says. \u201cWhether it\u2019s moving or not, that\u2019s not really my problem. It\u2019s more the feeling of life.\u201d</p> <p><em>Phaedra(s) is at the Barbican, London EC1, 9-18 June.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-22T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Spanish actor Laia Costa is the much-lauded lead in the German heist thriller <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/03/victoria-sebastian-schipper-observer-review\"><em>Victoria</em></a>, whose 138 mostly improvised minutes were filmed in one take by cinematographer Sturla Brandth Gr\u00f8vlen (given top billing in the end credits by director Sebastian Schipper). The film has been described by the <em>New York Times </em>as a \u201csensational cinema stunt\u201d and won six gongs at the German film awards last year (including best leading actress for Costa). Victoria is a foreigner alone in Berlin who hooks up with a group of young men as she is leaving a club in the early hours. At first there is much flirting and fun, but as the night unwinds she finds herself in darker territory, when she is co-opted to be their getaway driver in a robbery. Costa, 31, was included in the <em>New York Times\u2019s </em>breakthrough performances in 2015 and <em>Victoria </em>is her first lead role.</p> <p><strong>Have you been that girl, dancing alone in a club in a foreign city?</strong><br />No, I\u2019m a very boring classic girl. That\u2019s why I love Victoria so much, we are so different. I have had a happy life with family and friends. I\u2019ve never felt alone. I love these kind of characters where I haven\u2019t had the experience, those kind of feelings. I loved robbing a bank. I was like \u201cWoah, I could do it now!\u201d</p> <p><strong>When you first read the script did you find it believable?</strong><br />I never had a script, they just told me the story. But I have a lot of friends in Spain who are living abroad, working or studying just trying to <em>be,</em> and I talked to them a lot before doing the movie and everyone said that this feeling of loneliness is very hard. It makes you do things you wouldn\u2019t ever... you do it to survive. So I could believe that Victoria would [behave this way] because she is not robbing the bank to rob the bank, she is doing it because she has found some friends. They are showing her, for the first time, friendship with no limits, no conditions.</p> <p><strong>A lot of the film was improvised, which must have been challenging. The club scene after the robbery is pretty wild.</strong><br />We rehearsed for 12 days before shooting [Schipper had three attempts at the film, which was shot between 4.30am and 7am in the Mitte district of Berlin. He released the third take]. It was a very unusual way of shooting, over a very short period of time. Every night we rehearsed one scene/location. For that club scene we were told, it\u2019s like a big party and you have to be crazy because it\u2019s a big moment... at first we weren\u2019t doing it very well and then we figured it out \u2013 it\u2019s not like going to party, it\u2019s like breaking the limits, it\u2019s about going crazy because you are feeling so free, you know? I have never been on drugs but I had the feeling that I was on drugs. We were doing this scene the whole night and in the end we couldn\u2019t stop. We were saying, \u201cWe have to do it again\u201d and everyone else was saying, \u201cNo, look guys, it\u2019s done.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqeWbhO8rXY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sqeWbhO8rXY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqeWbhO8rXY\">Watch the trailer for Victoria</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>At the end of the movie you were so \u201cin the moment\u201d that you apparently just carried on walking [down a street] and the crew were shouting at you, telling you it was over, that you could stop.</strong><br />Yes I could hear them and it was like when you\u2019re sleeping and someone is waking you up and saying, \u201cCome on, you have to go to work and you\u2019re thinking\u2026 just five minutes, OK, just five minutes.\u201d It was the same sense.</p> <p><strong>Quite an experience then?</strong><br />Yes. I really love the film. And when it came out everyone was crazy about it. I\u2019m shooting in Buenos Aires at the moment [starring in <em>Black Snow</em> (Nieve Negra) with Argentine director Ricardo Darin] and the crew asked me to go and see <em>Victoria </em>with them at their house. They talked about it for hours. Which is really nice \u2013 you don\u2019t get that reaction to all the movies.</p> <p><strong>What do your family think of it?</strong><br />My boyfriend David, well my husband now, he\u2019s not an actor, we met at university in Barcelona 10 years ago and he\u2019s a company chief executive. He gives me good advice from the outside. When he saw <em>Victoria</em> he said \u201cthis is very good work because I cannot recognise you in this role. I cannot see you.\u201d Usually he says he can see <em>me</em> in there.</p> <p><strong>You only became an actor recently?</strong><br />Yes, four years ago. I was working in a Spanish advertising agency [in Barcelona] and then I worked in a German agency and the hours were different. I was finishing at 6pm and it was very weird for me, very early, it was like, \u201cWhat am I going to do now before dinner?\u201d My sister said, \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go to this acting school?\u201d And I said \u201cLet\u2019s do it\u201d. My first job was on a TV soap opera in Madrid.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"43cadb4f7a36e0b95ccd00bf5b7a2f253dbe2e0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/43cadb4f7a36e0b95ccd00bf5b7a2f253dbe2e0e/0_117_2739_1644/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Isabelle Huppert in Michael Haneke\u2019s The Piano Teacher.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Isabelle Huppert in Michael Haneke\u2019s The Piano Teacher.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>What actors/films do you like?</strong><br />I have four top films that when I saw them I felt very touched\u2026 I spent some weeks just thinking about them. One is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-piano\"><em>The Piano</em></a> by Jane Campion. Isabelle Huppert in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/may/15/cannes2001.cannesfilmfestival\"><em>The Piano Teacher</em></a>. I love Emily Watson in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/20/breaking-waves-trier-arthouse\"><em>Breaking the Waves</em></a>. Also Gina Rowlands in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/jul/03/film-changed-life-cameron-mitchell\"><em>A Woman Under the Influence</em></a>. I like movies where there is a strong female lead.</p> <p><strong>So you are a feminist?</strong><br />In film there is a really big problem with women. I read about women who have been rejected because they are too old to play a role with a very old man and they are 35. And I\u2019m thinking, what? What kind of world do we live in? But actually that\u2019s a reflection of our society. I\u2019ve just seen a movie recently here in Buenos Aires and I had to leave the theatre because I was so angry about the way the girl was being treated. I was thinking \u201cWhy has this actress said yes to this role?\u201d You know movies are not the most important thing in our society, of course they\u2019re not, but movies are powerful sometimes and we need to fight or somehow speak about women in them. I\u2019m talking about when you really feel that the female character is being treated like shit.</p> <p><strong>Do you think you will ever get another role as good as Victoria?</strong><br />When we had finished I talked to the cameraman and I asked him, \u201cSturla, will you ever be offered a project like this again?\u201d And I was so sad because he said no. No one is going to ask me to do a one-take movie of two and a half hours again. But later I thought, it doesn\u2019t mean that tomorrow someone isn\u2019t going to say \u201cLook, do you want to do this other thing?\u201d I want to think some good stuff is coming.</p> <p><em>Victoria is released on DVD/Blu-ray tomorrow</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>William Boyd\u2019s understanding of British history, which often underlies his novels, and his keen interest in middle-class British life, have made him one of the most admired novelists of our time.</p> <p>This is the fourth novel he has written from a woman\u2019s point of view. Amory Clay, the protagonist, is a typical Boyd heroine: beautiful, a photographer in Weimar Berlin who becomes notorious for taking pictures of naked prostitutes, fiercely independent, with a fondness for good-looking and intelligent men, preferably in uniform.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2009/sep/12/william-boyd-life-in-writing\">A life in writing: William Boyd</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She has two lovers: Jean-Baptiste Charbonneau and Cleveland Finzi. As war clouds gather, they drink huge amounts in the Savoy Grill among other places. A number of these types help Amory with her career as a war photographer; others help her to set up photographers\u2019 bureaux in Europe and in America. As usual in Boyd\u2019s novels, there is very little depiction of domestic life. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/apr/22/lee-miller-war-peace-pythons\">Lee Miller </a>and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/1986/apr/03/politics\">Martha Gellhorn</a> spring to mind.</p> <p>There are two descriptions of male genitals in this book \u2013 they are universally grey and wrinkly, Amory reports. This is not the first time I have wondered if Boyd is well advised to go down this particular avenue. I remember reading in <em>Brazzaville Beach </em>of the heroine\u2019s struggle to get her bra in place.</p> <p><em>Sweet Caress</em> is a compendious and intelligent work, made authentic by Boyd\u2019s extensive use of real dispatches and evocative photographs and his familiarity with makes of camera and even something called the Creed Teleprinter Mark II.</p> <p>He gives the impression of enjoying ferreting around in archives to uncover arcane facts and find resonant photographs to go with the script: as his heroine says: \u201cIt\u2019s the complications that have engaged me and made me feel alive.\u201d</p> <p>A few years ago his deception in his fictional <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/oct/14/nat-tate-artist-hoax-william-boyd\"><em>Nat Tate: An American Artist \u2013 1928-1960</em></a> gave Boyd sly pleasure; for a few weeks many people thought that Nat Tate was a real person: National and Tate in the same title was the clue. Boyd has always been acutely aware of painting and art and he has written some fine pieces on the subject. He brings this acute awareness to <em>Sweet Caress</em>.</p> <p><em>Sweet Caress is published by Bloomsbury (\u00a37.99). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/395049/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\"><em>Click here to order a copy for \u00a35.99</em></a><em> </em></p>",

      "body": "<p>\u201cYour problem is that you\u2019re not happy being sad\u2026\u201d When it comes to capturing the strange, romantic magic of making music, few modern film-makers are more on the money than John Carney. In his note-perfect 2007 drama <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2007/oct/21/drama.romance\" title=\"\"><em>Once</em></a>, he gave us a beautifully unconsummated Dublin love story played out over the composition and recording of songs such as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzQ9VrnNQLQ\" title=\"\">Falling Slowly</a>, which went on to win an Academy award. In 2013\u2019s underrated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/jul/13/begin-again-review-ramshackle-charm-john-varney\" title=\"\"><em>Begin Again</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/keiraknightley\" title=\"\">Keira Knightley</a> played an adrift singer-songwriter who winds up recording her music to the backing of New York street sounds, spurred on by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/mark-ruffalo\" title=\"\">Mark Ruffalo</a>\u2019s formerly washed-up A&amp;R man. Now Carney returns to Dublin and his youthful heyday of the mid-80s, where the delightful <em>Sing Street</em> spins its warm and uplifting fairytale, tugging at our melancholy heartstrings like a piece of classic bubblegum pop.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As Carney has proved before, he knows how to straddle the line between the sound in the room and the sound in your head</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Ferdia Walsh-Peelo is Conor, a bedroom Bob Dylan struggling to turn the background noise of his parents\u2019 collapsing marriage into songs. When his dad\u2019s work hits the skids, Conor \u2013 later Cosmo \u2013 is sent to the Christian Brothers\u2019 Synge Street school, where his private education manners (\u201c<em>Restaurant</em>? You mean the canteen? You\u2019re not in France now, you bleedin\u2019 spanner!\u201d) strike a bum note. Bullied by skinhead Barry, and smitten by mysterious outsider Raphina (Lucy Boynton), Conor decides that \u201cwe need to form a band\u201d, and sets about rounding up local talent who can provide the perfect soundtrack to his VHS-era love story. \u201cI\u2019m a futurist!\u201d declares Conor after conceding that John Taylor\u2019s bass proficiency does indeed lend a funky edge to Duran Duran, a mantra he has learned from his stoner big brother, Brendan (Jack Reynor), who insists that, like the Pistols, \u201cyou need to learn how <em>not</em> to play \u2013 and that takes practise\u201d.</p> <p>The bittersweet, \u201chappy sad\u201d drama that follows has drawn inevitable, if misguided, comparisons with <em>The Commitments</em>, yet tonally this is closer to the teen spirit of Todd Graff\u2019s 2009 film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/aug/16/bandslam-review\" title=\"\"><em>Bandslam</em></a> (to which David Bowie lent an approving cameo) or even <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/richard-linklater\" title=\"\">Richard Linklater</a>\u2019s sublime <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2003/nov/23/features.review\" title=\"\"><em>School of Rock</em></a>. As Carney has proved previously, he knows how to straddle the line between the sound in the room and the sound in your head \u2013 a sequence that segues from bedroom composition to living room rehearsal (with tea and biscuits) to full studio production perfectly negotiates the space between kitchen-sink realism and musical fantasy in which this lovely, lyrical movie casts its spell.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYk2Vx1z6lk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jYk2Vx1z6lk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Watch the trailer for Sing Street.</figcaption> </figure>   <p>There\u2019s a touch of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/michel-gondry\" title=\"\">Michel Gondry</a>\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/feb/22/comedy\" title=\"\"><em>Be Kind Rewind</em></a> or Garth Jennings\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/apr/06/comedy.drama\" title=\"\"><em>Son of Rambow</em></a> in the band\u2019s attempts to reproduce the high-gloss sheen of Russell Mulcahy\u2019s pop videos in a Dublin backstreet, armed only with a silk scarf, a cowboy outfit and\u00a0an abundance of eyeliner. As the film progresses, the videos become more ambitious, mutating into a dreamscape reminiscent of <em>Back to the\u00a0Future</em>\u2019s climactic prom, setting\u00a0the tone for <em>Sing Street</em>\u2019s own fabulist finale.</p> <p>But it\u2019s the fact that Carney wisely keeps one foot on the ground that gives the film its emotional heft. Having served time in the Frames, Carney understands the practicalities of writing, rehearsing and performing pop songs. Here, he enlists former <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7hqgC3W9GUI\" title=\"\">Danny Wilson</a> frontman Gary Clark to\u00a0(co-)write original material inspired by Conor\u2019s ever-changing playlist, from the Cure to the\u00a0Jam, Joe Jackson, Spandau Ballet and beyond. Reminding us that most great pop songs are written by channelling existing hits, Drive it Like You Stole It neatly echoes the triplet bass riff from Hall &amp; Oates\u2019s already derivative <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRYFKcMa_Ek\" title=\"\">Maneater</a> to finger-popping effect, while the band\u2019s dress sense changes with the winds of the latest <em>Top of the Pops</em> (some chronological liberties notwithstanding).</p> <p>Providing the backbone \u2013 both musical and fraternal \u2013 for Conor\u2019s education is Reynor\u2019s affectionately observed Brendan, his lost dreams and rich experience fuelling his younger brother\u2019s rite of passage. Typical of Carney, too, to lend a gentle ear to even the most seemingly unsympathetic characters, with Barry\u2019s\u00a0bullying behaviour contextualised as a product of his own battered horizons.</p> <p>In this hazy, street-lamped world, no one is beyond the redemption of a good\u00a0tune. With its inclusive 12A certificate, <em>Sing Street</em> should strike a chord not only with those ageing 80s nostalgists underwhelmed by the locker room Americana of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/15/everybody-wants-some-review-linklater-freshmen-campus\" title=\"\"><em>Everybody Wants Some!!</em></a>, but also with tween audiences who have long outgrown their <em>Camp Rock</em> DVDs and are ready for a little more grit amid the glitter. Happy sad indeed. I laughed, I cried, I bought the soundtrack album.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The most interesting discovery of the week was not that IBM, Citigroup and Microsoft were unwittingly running ads on (and therefore providing funds to) an Indonesian jihadi website \u2013 <a href=\"https://www.acast.com/ft-news/howajihadiwebsiteprofitedfromgoogleadplatform\" title=\"\">though they were</a> \u2013 but that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/10/peter-thiel-paypal-co-founder-to-be-delegate-for-donald-trump\" title=\"\">Peter Thiel is supporting Donald Trump</a> in his bid to become the next president of the United States.</p> <p>\u201cPeter who?\u201d I hear you say. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel\" title=\"\">Mr Thiel</a> is not exactly a household name in these parts, but in Silicon Valley he\u2019s a big cheese, as a co-founder of PayPal and the first investor in Facebook. He is therefore rich beyond the dreams of avarice. But he is also: a philosophy graduate; a lawyer; a former bond trader; a hedge-fund manager; a venture capitalist; a philanthropist; a far-out libertarian; <a href=\"http://tinyurl.com/hee2pl6\" title=\"\">and an entertaining author</a>. So what is a guy like that doing supporting Trump?</p> <p>One answer might be that he\u2019s as much of an irritant to the Silicon Valley crowd as Trump is to the Republican establishment. Although the Valley\u2019s tech titans like to portray themselves as non-statist disruptors, in fact most of them are \u2013 politically speaking \u2013 Democratic party supporters, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/17/the-networker-john-naughton-hillary-clinton-democrats-silicon-valley-big-government\" title=\"\">albeit of an unusual kind</a>. They may <a href=\"http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/29/why-labor-unions-and-silicon-valley-arent-friends-in-2-charts/\" title=\"\">detest trade unions</a>, for example, but they\u2019re <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-06-05/tech-immigrants-a-map-of-silicon-valleys-imported-talent\" title=\"\"><em>very keen on immigration</em></a> \u2013 so long as the immigrants have PhDs from elite Indian or Chinese universities. And they\u2019re not opposed to big government, so long as it\u2019s \u201csmart\u201d, whatever that\u00a0means.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What is a billionaire fantasist to do? Why, \u00a0hitch his wagon\u00a0to that of another billionaire fantasist, of\u00a0course</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Peter Thiel doesn\u2019t fit this template at all. In 2009, he published <a href=\"http://www.cato-unbound.org/2009/04/13/peter-thiel/education-libertarian\" title=\"\">an intriguing essay</a> entitled The Education \u00a0of a Libertarian. \u201cI remain committed to the faith of my teenage years\u201d, it began: \u201cto authentic human freedom as a precondition for the highest good. I stand against confiscatory taxes, totalitarian collectives, and the ideology of the inevitability of the death of every individual. For all these reasons, I still call myself \u2018libertarian\u2019.\u201d But, he confessed, \u201cover the last two decades, I have changed radically on the question of how to achieve these goals. Most importantly, I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are\u00a0compatible.\u201d</p> <p>So what changed his mind? Answer: the 2008 banking collapse, which Thiel describes as \u201ca financial crisis caused by too much debt and leverage, facilitated by a government that insured against all sorts of moral hazards \u2013 and we know that the response to this crisis involves way more debt and leverage, and way more government. Those who have argued for free markets have been screaming into a hurricane. The events of recent months shatter any remaining hopes of politically minded libertarians. For\u00a0those of us who are libertarian in 2009, our education culminates with the knowledge that the broader education of the body politic has become a fool\u2019s errand.\u201d</p> <p>The emerging theme is that democratic politics is irretrievably broken. \u201cIn our time,\u201d Thiel says, \u201cthe great task for libertarians is to find an escape from politics in all its forms \u2013 from the totalitarian and fundamentalist catastrophes to the unthinking demos that guides so-called \u2018social democracy\u2019. The critical question then becomes one of means, of how to escape not via politics but beyond it.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2016/may/12/why-people-vote-donald-trump-indiana-death-american-dream-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4j53g\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2503483\"            data-video-name=\"Why people vote Trump: the death of the American dream \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-573367c7e4b035c26fc403c1\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/11/160512ABWindiana_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/11/160512ABWindiana_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/11/160512ABWindiana_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/11/160512ABWindiana.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/11/160512ABWindiana_small.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2016/may/12/why-people-vote-donald-trump-indiana-death-american-dream-video\">Why people vote Trump: the death of the American dream</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>In 2009 Thiel could only see three possible escape routes. The first was cyberspace: \u201cBy starting a new internet business,\u201d he wrote, \u201can entrepreneur may create a new world. The hope of the internet is that these new worlds will impact and force change on the existing social and political order.\u201d The second was \u2013 wait for it \u2013 outer space: \u201cBecause the vast reaches of outer space represent a limitless frontier, they also represent a limitless possibility for escape from world politics.\u201d And finally there was what Thiel called \u201cseasteading\u201d \u2013 floating islands in international waters run as libertarian paradises, presumably with free copies of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2011/apr/22/tea-party-movement-republicans\" title=\"\">Ayn Rand</a>\u2019s books on every bedside table.</p> <p>Sadly, none of these ideas has \u2013 as yet \u2013 borne much fruit. The internet has been captured by governments and huge corporations. Colonising Mars and escaping to other galaxies is a proposition only for Hollywood and the Starship Enterprise. And <a href=\"http://www.seasteading.org/\" title=\"\">seasteading</a>, though technically less impracticable, remains the fantasy of dreamers and flakes of Cadbury\u00a0proportions.</p> <p>Faced with these cruel disappointments, what is a billionaire fantasist to do? Why, hitch his wagon to that of another billionaire fantasist, of course. And Trump and Thiel have more in common than perhaps they realise. In his 2009 essay, for example, Thiel wrote: \u201cSince 1920, the vast increase in welfare beneficiaries and the extension of the franchise to women \u2013 two constituencies that are notoriously tough for libertarians \u2013 have rendered the notion of \u2018capitalist democracy\u2019 into an oxymoron.\u201d Trump\u00a0is hoping to turn that oxymoron into a reality.</p>",

      "body": "<p>I\u2019ve always been intrigued by characters who shapeshift. From mythological creatures like werewolves and vampires to magical beings like sorcerers and wizards, there are any number of characters who have the ability to take another form and, as a kid, I often wondered what that would be like. To this day, if I had a choice in superpowers, it would probably be to change my appearance at will, but I still have a hard time deciding if I would want to turn into an animal or just change my human features.<br /></p> <p>Narrowing this list down to some of my favourite shapeshifting characters was difficult, but in no particular order, these are the ones who have stuck with me the most over the years. (Please note there are some minor spoilers for the books mentioned.)</p> <h2>1. Polgara the Sorceress, from <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/belgariad-1-pawn-of-prophecy.html\">The Belgariad and Mallorean series</a>, by David and Leigh Eddings</h2> <p>There are a plethora of sorcerers to choose from in this 13-book series, but Polgara has always been my favourite. She\u2019s the only woman in a brotherhood of sorcerers, but she\u2019s also strong, smart, and can hold her own not against other people, but against gods as well. In the final book in the series we see her in a number of roles, from child and twin to her mortal sister to the most powerful politician in the world, giving a full sense of who she is outside of her abilities. But add in her tendency to shift into a snowy white owl, and she\u2019s an unstoppable force.</p> <h2>2. Remus Lupin, from the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/harry-potter-and-the-philosopher-s-stone-23.html\">Harry Potter series</a> by JK Rowling</h2> <p>Lupin, Harry\u2019s favourite Defense Against the Dark Arts professor, is yet another character who isn\u2019t defined by his ability - or, in this case, curse - to turn into a wolf. Though he faces the stigma of being a werewolf, struggling to find steady employment and acceptance from others, he is enormously kind, knowledgeable, and generous, despite having little in the way of material things to begin with. We only see him turn into a werewolf once in the series but even after that frightening encounter, Harry still sees him as the person he really is beneath the curse.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"80f6994b4cd12283eee597204db0f2b10c9ecc74\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/80f6994b4cd12283eee597204db0f2b10c9ecc74/0_169_2448_1469/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Christopher Lee as Dracula in The Horror of Dracula.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christopher Lee as Dracula in The Horror of Dracula.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Everett/REX Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>3. Count Dracula, from <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/dracula-45.html\">Dracula</a> by Bram Stoker</h2> <p>Believed to have been inspired by Vlad the Impaler, Dracula is a legendary figure. We all know the lore surrounding vampires: the fangs, the blood, the widow\u2019s peak and intimidating black cloak. But while Dracula is well-known for turning into a bat, he could also shapeshift into fog and a wolf, which only made him all the more terrifying as a character.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"447f8b29896ac84efbd13ec1f8aa6b48955447ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/447f8b29896ac84efbd13ec1f8aa6b48955447ed/0_233_5917_3551/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jennifer Lawrence, who played Raven/Mystique in X-Men Apocalypse at the film premiere in London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jennifer Lawrence, who played Raven/Mystique in X-Men Apocalypse at the film premiere in London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Guy Bell/REX/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2> 4. Mystique, from the X-Men comics and movies</h2> <p>Played most recently by Jennifer Lawrence in the films, Mystique - originally named Raven - is a mutant who has the ability to change her natural blue-skinned and red-haired appearance into anyone she likes. A super-villain who is responsible for many deaths and assassinations throughout her storylines, she still has several redeeming qualities that rise to the surface often, giving way to a character who, while using her abilities most often for evil, is still fascinating and dimensional.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2015/oct/08/stephenie-meyer-interview-life-and-death-twilight\">Stephenie Meyer: 'It\u2019s still about two teenagers falling head-over-heels in love'</a> </p> </aside>  <h2> 5. Leah Clearwater, from the <a href=\"http://bookshop.theguardian.com/twilight-18.html\">Twilight series</a> by Stephenie Meyer</h2> <p>The shapeshifters of the Quileute tribe have several interesting characters to choose from, including Leah\u2019s little brother, Seth, but Leah stands out to me not only as the only female, but the one facing perhaps the most difficult circumstances. She endures near constant ridicule from the rest of her wolf pack, whose thoughts are all linked, and becomes bitter after her longtime boyfriend breaks up with her after he imprints on her cousin, which is enough to make anyone crave the space and privacy she can\u2019t have. But she\u2019s still there for her family and pack when they need her to be, and she plays an important role in the final book as an ally and beta to Jacob Black.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2011/aug/30/snape-favourite-harry-potter-character\">Snape is voted favourite Harry Potter character</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>6. Sirius Black, from the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/harry-potter-and-the-philosopher-s-stone-23.html\">Harry Potter series</a> by JK Rowling</h2> <p>The second of three Harry Potter characters on this list, Sirius Black taught himself how to become an Animagus, alongside James Potter and Peter Pettigrew, to remain with Remus Lupin during the full moons. It\u2019s a useful trick that allows him to keep his mind while locked in Azkaban for murderers he didn\u2019t commit, and it\u2019s also a supposedly tightly regulated aspect of the wizarding world - although we do meet more unregistered Animagi in the series than registered. From the first moment we meet Professor Minerva McGonagall as a cat, I wondered why the entire wizarding world wasn\u2019t queuing up to learn this awesome ability.</p> <h2>7. Tobias, from the Animorphs series by KA Applegate</h2> <p>Being a kid in the 90s meant having at least a passing familiarity with the Animorph series, about a group of kids who gained the alien power of turning into animals - but only for an hour at a time. Tobias, a shy and quiet boy, accidentally remained in the form of a hawk for too long and wound up stuck in that form for a considerable portion of the series. He was always a standout character to me, mostly because of how he handled the loss of his human form, but also how he continued to help his friends, proving <em>what</em> he was didn\u2019t change <em>who</em> he was.</p> <h2>8. Lord Barak, from the Belgariad and Mallorean series by David and Leigh Eddings</h2> <p>The prophesised protector of the protagonist, Garion, Lord Barak has lived with the curse of randomly and seemingly inexplicably turning into a bear for over a decade, only to discover that this \u201ccurse\u201d is activated when Garion is in mortal danger. He\u2019s far from a perfect character, and the way he treats his wife is deplorable, but I always found the guardian connection between Barak and Garion intriguing and unique to what I had read up until that point. </p> <h2>9. The Greek Gods, from mythology</h2> <p>Greek mythology is steeped in a rich tradition of shapeshifting, and as a kid, flipping through D\u2019Aulaire\u2019s Book of Greek Myths was one of my favourite ways to pass the time. There are countless examples of the gods either taking different forms - Zeus is especially fond of doing so, especially while hiding from his wife, Hera - or turning others into animals and the occasional plant. The mortal Io is turned into a cow either by Zeus or Hera, depending on the myth; Daphne, a nymph, is turned into a laurel tree to escape Apollo\u2019s affections. Nearly every major god and goddess has a myth connected to shapeshifting, and you can find shades of more contemporary myths and legends in the oral traditions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/02/jk-rowling-apologises-killing-off-remus-lupin-harry-potter\">JK Rowling apologises for killing off Remus Lupin in Harry Potter</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>10. Nymphadora Tonks, from the <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/harry-potter-and-the-philosopher-s-stone-23.html\">Harry Potter series</a> by JK Rowling</h2> <p>The young and spunky Tonks is a Metamorphmagus - a rare magical gift that allows her to change her appearance at will. She\u2019s a cheerful, charming, lovable fighter who doesn\u2019t hesitate to fight to protect her loved ones and the causes she believes in, and her Metamorphmagus talents - and bubblegum pink hair - only make her even more memorable. Though her abilities are more of a fun party trick in the series than a plot device, it\u2019s still fascinating to think about how her abilities could have contributed to both her job as an Auror and her role in the Order of the Phoenix. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"29e390f35acf3602b84fd0b1b8228a03dab0b2d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/29e390f35acf3602b84fd0b1b8228a03dab0b2d2/0_0_1521_2338/651.jpg\" alt=\"Simon Thorn and the Wolf\u2019s Den by Aimee Carter\" width=\"651\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Aim\u00e9e Carter is the author of Simon Thorn at the Wolf\u2019s Den. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/368004/\">Buy it at the Guardian bookshop</a>. <br /></p>",

A new production of <a href=\"http://www.oldvictheatre.com/whats-on/2016/jh\"><em>Jekyll and Hyde</em></a>, which McOnie has written and choreographed, and which he directs, is at the Old Vic, London until 28 May.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve been dancing all your life. Did you come from a theatrical background?</strong><br />No, the dancing came as a surprise to my family. My father worked for a plastics company near Birmingham, and my mother was a nurse. But they had eclectic musical tastes, everything from Diana Ross to Meatloaf, and I was always making up routines. I\u2019d push the sofa back and throw myself around. When I was six I was taken to ballet class to work off some of that energy, but I hated every moment: skipping around like a fairy in a roomful of girls. Then my cousin Ruth started freestyle disco classes, and I tagged along.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Creatively Jekyll and Hyde is an interesting knot to untie, because the one thing that everyone knows is the ending</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>So you got the theatre bug?</strong><br />Yes, I dragged my parents along to see Wayne Sleep at the Birmingham Hippodrome, and Baz Luhrmann\u2019s film <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2014/feb/03/strictly-ballroom-rewatching-classic-australian-films\"><em>Strictly Ballroom</em></a> was a big influence too. When I was 11, I went to the Arts Educational school at Tring [now the <a href=\"https://www.tringpark.com/\">Tring Park school for the Performing Arts</a>]. I wasn\u2019t popular. I took up residence under one of the goalposts in the school playground, which was the nearest thing I could find to a proscenium arch, and directed myself in one-man shows. The other, sportier boys were not amused. I left when I was 17 to take a dancing job in <em>Cats</em>, in D\u00fcsseldorf. I was <a href=\"http://www.catsthemusical.com/characters/mr-mistoffelees\">Mr Mistoffelees</a>.</p> <p><strong>As a performer, you were very much associated with the work of Matthew Bourne.</strong><br />Yes, I was offered a place in the original production of Matthew Bourne\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/dec/14/matthew-bourne-edward-scissorhands-review-mad-hatters-tea-party-kate-prince\"><em>Edward Scissorhands</em></a>, so I had the chance to watch the whole creative process from the ground up. I did five of Matthew\u2019s shows in all, as well as roles in <em>Chicago</em>, <em>A Chorus Line</em>, and <em>On the Town</em>. And then when I was 25 I stopped dancing to choreograph and direct full time.</p> <p><strong>Every choreographer has a different way of creating dance. What\u2019s yours?</strong><br />I have an image, inside me, of what I want. I close my eyes, and there\u2019s a fuzzy feeling. It\u2019s there. But then I ask myself, do I have the skill-set to make it happen? How do you get it from your brain to the stage? How do you get that soaring vision out of your chest and into the bodies of your dancers?

But the central idea is of physical transformation between two characters. You\u2019re being told a story about a man who has this ability. It\u2019s a gothic story, about the darker side that everyone likes to explore. Creatively it\u2019s an interesting knot to untie, because the one thing that everyone knows about the story is the ending: that Jekyll and Hyde are the same person. So we get that out of the way in the first 15 minutes.</p> <p><strong>And it\u2019s no longer set in the Victorian era?</strong><br />No, it\u2019s set in the backstreets of 1950s London. We\u2019ve got a wonderful score composed by Grant Olding, who composed the music for the National Theatre production of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/may/29/james-corden-two-guvnors-acid-test\"><em>One Man, Two Guvnors</em></a>. Jekyll\u2019s world has a big-band sound, all MGM brassy swing, and Hyde\u2019s music is more like the White Stripes, with an electric, grungy underbelly.</p> <p><strong>Working in the commercial mainstream, are you in touch with other forms of dance?</strong><br />There are art-dance people who think that musical theatre is all jazz hands and high kicks, and musical theatre people who think that contemporary and classical dance is weird and elitist. But I love to watch it all. I think <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/hofesh-shechter\">Hofesh Shechter</a>, for example, is a genius. In the end, we all want the same thing: to connect with the audience.</p>",

The previous evening at the Savoy theatre, ENO\u2019s chorus, whose work has continued to dazzle despite months of darkness over its future, <a href=\"https://www.eno.org/news/eno-chorus-triumph-at-international-opera-awards/\">won its category</a> in the fourth<a href=\"http://www.operaawards.org/archive/2016/\"> International Opera awards</a>, outsinging choruses from the New York Met, Berlin and elsewhere. The cheers at the announcement were loud and unanimous. (Having once sat on the judging panel for the IOA, headed by a tough bunch of international opera cognoscenti who have seen all and been everywhere, one thing is sure: the discussion would not have been a kindly \u201cwho deserves to win?\u201d but a ruthless \u201cwho is best?\u201d).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9279274118458f8dbf0c27cfe3596d19b17992e6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9279274118458f8dbf0c27cfe3596d19b17992e6/0_21_640_397/500.jpg\" alt=\"Members of the triumphant ENO Chorus at the International Opera awards last week.\" width=\"500\" height=\"310\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Members of the triumphant ENO chorus at the International Opera awards last week.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Word is that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/05/english-national-operas-new-artistic-director-promises-to-heal-the-trauma\">Daniel Kramer</a>\u2019s first priority as newly appointed artistic director is to restore some of the shattered confidence of chorus, orchestra, technical teams and all the central workforce of the company. This past year, with all its exits, arguments and industrial conflicts, too much control has fallen inevitably on the shoulders of the chief executive, <a href=\"https://www.eno.org/news/further-update-on-eno/\">Cressida Pollock</a>, firefighting on all fronts, including those where she lacks expertise. She has come in for a level of personal attack unpleasant to witness, however fair or unfair the criticism. Now is her chance to prove herself. It is within her power, as some previous and inherited issues were not, to relinquish the artistic reins to those trained in that area. ENO has enough other issues of a physical, corporate, funding kind, all urgent, for a CEO to tackle. Perhaps some wise old opera head (in both senses) can persuade Pollock to trust absolutely her artistic director and, when he or she is appointed, a new music director. Either they are good enough to carry out the task, respecting the responsibilities and restraints that come with public funding, or they are not. They won\u2019t stick around to find out unless given proper scope.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"9b8d067c48770b71b1a2c98a76108193ef603c48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b8d067c48770b71b1a2c98a76108193ef603c48/0_218_2400_1440/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rena Harms and David Butt Philip in Madam Butterfly.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rena Harms and David Butt Philip in Madam Butterfly.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Thomas Bowles</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Alas this was a disappointing <em>Butterfly</em>. The cast was uneven and one particularly pressing issue for ENO was evident: diction, or lack of it. This was the sixth revival of the exquisite staging by Anthony Minghella, the film and stage director\u2019s only foray into opera before his premature death <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2008/mar/19/anthonyminghella.obituaries\">in 2008</a>. Directed and choreographed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/oct/23/classicalmusicandopera\">Carolyn Choa</a> and designed by <a href=\"http://www.michaellevinestudio.com/\">Michael Levine</a> (another International opera awards nominee), the production stands strong and fresh in <a href=\"http://theagency.co.uk/the-clients/sarah-tipple/\">Sarah Tipple</a>\u2019s revival. For sheer beauty it\u2019s hard to beat. Much of the singing was good, but the words of only one performer, the British-born tenor <a href=\"http://www.davidbuttphilip.com/\">David Butt Philip</a> making his role debut as Lieutenant Pinkerton, were consistently clear. <a href=\"http://www.rayfieldallied.com/artists/david-parry/\">David Parry</a>\u2019s translation is singable and unfussy. Sung words are always hard to hear, but surtitles for English texts should be a guide not, as here, a lifeline to comprehension.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQfBnKpAZ2U\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/mQfBnKpAZ2U?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mQfBnKpAZ2U\">ENO\u2019s Madam Butterfly trailer</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The orchestra, under <a href=\"http://www.ingpen.co.uk/artist/sir-richard-armstrong/\">Richard Armstrong</a>, either began too loudly or had overestimated the power of the singers (not entirely the same thing). Eventually they settled and let the music unfurl. The American soprano <a href=\"http://www.renaharms.com/Welcome.html\">Rena Harms</a> made an uncomfortable title-role debut, inconsistent in tone, with too much shrillness where innocence and purity were needed, though also possessing a residual strength for the climactic moments. Butt Philip had the right degree of arrogant fecklessness \u2013 too naive to realise the consequences of his actions, rather than a downright thug. His voice is agile and secure: a wonderful talent in the making. Stephanie Windsor-Lewis was touching as the faithful Suzuki. <a href=\"http://georgevonbergen.com/\">George von Bergen</a> combined assurance and despair as Sharpless, and his I-warned-you laments to Pinkerton were certainly easy to hear. Smaller roles were well taken, and the puppeteers of <a href=\"http://\">Blind Summit</a>, inspired by Japanese bunraku theatre, were skilful and moving. I find<em> Madam Butterfly</em>, in which a mother is prepared to kill herself in front of her blindfolded child, so overpowering that I do not rush to see it and had resisted earlier revivals of Minghella\u2019s staging. Despite reservations, this ENO production still hits hard and Puccini\u2019s mercurial and brilliant score wins out.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3c31c6401291b0b2b0a203f05f527f86fddbba8d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3c31c6401291b0b2b0a203f05f527f86fddbba8d/0_266_3800_2280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Harpsichordist extraordinaire\u2019 Mahan Esfahani.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Harpsichordist extraordinaire\u2019 Mahan Esfahani.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bernhard Musil</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>After a couple of name changes (it was, for a long time, the Lufthansa festival), the <a href=\"http://www.lfbm.org.uk/\">London Festival of Baroque Music </a>now has a clear identity as a platform for ambitious exploration of the 17th and 18th century beyond the Monteverdi, Bach and Handel mainstream, though with plenty of that ilk too. This year\u2019s theme is \u201cThe Word\u201d and the way instrumental repertoire reflected the lyrical qualities of the human voice. This allowed the harpsichordist extraordinaire <a href=\"http://www.mahanesfahani.com/\"><strong>Mahan Esfahani</strong></a> to construct a quirky programme with help from the tenor <a href=\"http://www.thomashobbs.co.uk/Thomas_Hobbs/Welcome.html\">Thomas Hobbs</a>. Esfahani, if you don\u2019t know him already, approaches concerts with an impromptu flourish and some in-built randomness: not in his virtuosic playing but in the rest of the proceedings. It keeps you alert, which is not always true of an evening of harpsichord music. From a rich offering of the largely unfamiliar, the Sonata II, \u201cOf Saul, Whom David Cured by Means of Music\u201d (1700) by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johann_Kuhnau\">Johann Kuhnau</a> stood out: flamboyant, expressive and ingenious.</p> <p>News came in late that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3\"><strong>Radio 3</strong></a>, one year into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/21/were-too-darned-modest-about-we-do-radio-3-boss-alan-daveys-typical-day\">Alan Davey</a>\u2019s tenure as controller, has achieved its highest ratings for three years (2.12 million listeners this quarter, up from 2.05 million). Without space to analyse how this has come about, we must assume that Davey\u2019s stealthy preference for dumbing up is beginning to work.

Their deliciously forthright reading of the Beethoven makes the Schumann Phantasie for violin and orchestra in C Major feel a bit thin in comparison, but Bohren and the players sparkle in Jean Jean Fran\u00e7aix\u2019s Nonetto from 1995, an arrangement of Mozart\u2019s E flat major quintet, K452. Fran\u00e7aix takes the piano part and redistributes it for string quartet and double bass, while retaining the wind parts of the original. The result is refreshingly rich in colour and nuance.

The celebrations of Williams\u2019s 75th birthday have had us nostalgically recalling the optimistic time when through his advocacy classical music was everywhere, feeding into film scores, and a natural part of light entertainment television. This soft-edged compilation gathers his biggest film hits from <em>The Deer Hunter</em>, <em>The Mission </em>and <em>Schindler\u2019s List</em>, but they are woven in with brilliant arrangements of Falla, Albeniz, Satie and Bach \u2013 the E major Violin Partita\u2019s Prelude, done with exquisite good taste.

      "body": "<p>There is a <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-liverpool/exhibition/francis-bacon-invisible-rooms\"><strong>Francis Bacon</strong></a> pope in Tate Liverpool that is barely a squeak from high camp. It shows the pontiff in sumptuous purple robes, raising his dainty little hands in a fit of girlish horror. It is a very strange addition to the long sequence of screaming popes; indeed this pontiff is not screaming so much as wincing with his eyes closed. But it makes the point, as Bacon\u2019s paintings so often do, that there is sometimes very little distance between hilarity and nervous hysteria.<br /></p> <p>This is not why the image is currently on display in the largest Bacon show ever held in northern England. No, it is here because the figure is immured in a diagrammatic version of the throne in <a href=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7f/Retrato_del_Papa_Inocencio_X._Roma%2C_by_Diego_Vel%C3%A1zquez.jpg\">Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s portrait of Pope Innocent X</a>, from which all of Bacon\u2019s many variations issue. And more than that, he is boxed in a black cube (within an already dark painting) that might be the very definition of an invisible room.</p> <p>This phrase, which gives the show its subtitle, was coined by the French philosopher Gilles Deleuze in a <a href=\"https://monoskop.org/images/1/1f/Deleuze_Gilles_Francis_Bacon_The_Logic_of_Sensation.pdf\">famous meditation on Bacon</a>. Deleuze was preoccupied by the painter\u2019s strange and original pictorial space. This is so familiar by now that it is odd to come across a Bacon that doesn\u2019t have that flat backdrop of glowering darkness or gorgeously rich colour; that doesn\u2019t have those architectural sketch-lines hinting at cubes, cages, arenas, plinths or cells; that doesn\u2019t have those thin black or white lines, sometimes scumbled, sometimes spectral, sometimes incisively clear.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Narratives begin to form in your head but the story is sidelined every time by the sheer force of the image</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Often they set a scene quite precisely: a window and the door of a hotel room; a parlour with curving architecture and a portrait by Bacon hanging on the wall; a sheaf of vertical lines that look like the shimmering strip curtains of an otherwise sepulchrally dark nightclub, though this might also be the anteroom of hell, given the contortions of the figure.</p> <p>This man is Peter Lacey, one of Bacon\u2019s lovers, who appears in another painting apparently mired to the waist in a newscaster\u2019s kidney-shaped desk, except that this is 1957 and they hadn\u2019t yet been invented. Nor indeed had Samuel Beckett yet written of Winnie, up to her waist in sand in <em>Happy Days</em>. For all that Bacon found so many of his sources in the past \u2013 Vel\u00e1zquez, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/eadweard-muybridge\">Eadweard Muybridge</a>\u2019s motion photographs, Victorian boxing, Picasso\u2019s cubist distortions \u2013 his visions often leapt in advance of western culture.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7a1e6ee13b89f93b7f78c80c0a1d35393ea5b812\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7a1e6ee13b89f93b7f78c80c0a1d35393ea5b812/10_7_2456_3470/708.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A horrifying perpetuum mobile\u2019: Study for the Nurse in Battleship Potemkin, 1957 by Francis Bacon.\" width=\"708\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A horrifying perpetuum mobile\u2019: Study for the Nurse in Battleship Potemkin, 1957 by Francis Bacon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Estate of Francis Bacon. All Rights Reserved, DACS 2016 \u00a9 St\u00e4del Museum/ U Edelmann/ Artothek</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Since these diagrammatic structures appear everywhere it seems an odd theme for a show: practically anything by Bacon might be admitted, for one thing, and attention to these schematic stagings, what\u2019s more, seems quite unnecessary. The relationship between ground and figure, to use that old phrase, has always felt conspicuously theatrical in Bacon\u2019s work. His pictures are stage sets with wings, entrances, scenery and downstage performances in which the figures stand out starkly against the backdrop, sometimes in ellipses like spotlights.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is hard to know what is going on in this sequence \u2013 as hard as Bacon wanted it to be</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And while the curators harp on about the usual themes of postwar futility, theatrical alienation and existential angst, it is worth pointing out that when the art critic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/jun/20/guardianobituaries.arts\">David Sylvester</a> asked Bacon about those invisible rooms, he simply replied: \u201cI cut down the scale of the canvas by drawing in these rectangles which concentrate the image down.\u201d They are there to highlight, to focus, to point to the figure. They are intensifiers.</p> <p>Tate Liverpool has managed to borrow 29 major works from European collections, such as the outstandingly sinister painting of a child creeping round a circuit on all fours from Amsterdam, and the raw, screaming figure of <a href=\"http://www.theartstory.org/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/baconcollage1.jpg\">the nurse in <em>Battleship Potemkin</em></a>, trapped in some kind of cage-like swing, <a href=\"http://www.staedelmuseum.de/en/collection/study-nurse-film-battleship-potemkin-1957\">from the St\u00e4del Museum </a>in Frankfurt. In each case the mise-en-sc\u00e8ne implies a horrifying perpetuum mobile.</p> <p>It gets worse in the Hirshhorn Museum\u2019s immense <em>Triptych</em>, where the bodies appear thrashed to a pulp and contained in some kind of glass case raised up on a platform. An observer, hanging on the phone, peers at them through the glass. And in an anonymous hotel room with a deep blue view some terrible bloodbath has apparently occurred: or are these simply bloodstained clothes tumbling out of a case? It is hard to know what is going on in this sequence \u2013 as hard as Bacon wanted it to be.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5fc4bc812835384e50406425bb8f15645554087f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5fc4bc812835384e50406425bb8f15645554087f/0_24_2953_3973/743.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Outstandingly sinister\u2019: From Muybridge, The human Figure in Motion: Woman Emptying a Bowl of Water/ Paralytic Child Walking on All Fours, 1965.\" width=\"743\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Outstandingly sinister\u2019: From Muybridge, The human Figure in Motion: Woman Emptying a Bowl of Water/ Paralytic Child Walking on All Fours, 1965.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 The Estate of Francis Bacon. All rights reserved. DACS 2016</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For what is really going on in his opera of gaping mouths and writhing figures, what is Bacon actually doing with \u2013 to \u2013 his figures? Flanged, spraddled, twisted, split apart and reassembled like the botched and shattered faces in <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=henry+tonks+portraits&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=2420&amp;bih=1259&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiE2KzCuOHMAhVLJcAKHQ1DBlIQ_AUIBigB&amp;dpr=1\">Henry Tonks\u2019s first world war portraits</a>, they appear to twist and melt, materialise and evaporate against the backdrop in nameless torsions. How this is done remains elusive. Bacon used the grainy back of the canvas, and somehow got his paint to seep into the surface like blood \u2013 very often while describing blood with exceptional brilliance, and his drawings (many shown here) indicate all sorts of sources, from medical textbooks to monkey manuals. But still these morphings remain defiantly mysterious.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Lassnig was also compelled by the experience of having, and being, a body; with sex and death and mordant humour</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And they veer quite melodramatically from violence to <em>Carry On </em>comedy. A mouth yowling in silence becomes funny when the teeth inside are awfully clean and tidy. A brutal coupling, when the bodies are as hard to tell apart as eels in a pail, gets a comic punchline with a neatly painted packet of fags. John Berger long ago compared Bacon to Walt Disney, and this goes to the balletic exuberance and graphic zip of his art. All these rectangles, cubes and ellipses are marvellously concise and strong. Whatever else, they keep the wild dynamism in place.</p> <p>Whether they describe actual places, too, will perhaps become clearer when Martin Harrison\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.henipublishing.com/product/francis-bacon-catalogue-raisonne/\">immense Catalogue Raisonn\u00e9</a> is published next month, with its revelation of many unfamiliar paintings. In the meantime, their ingenious ambiguity is apparent all through this show. Here is the ghoulish circus ring that doubles as a cattle pen; here is the black void that might be an electric chair. Narratives begin to form in your head \u2013 is this figure trapped in a gas chamber, or a witness box; is this ectoplasm gas or a man\u2019s shadow? \u2013 but the story is sidelined every time by the sheer force of the image. The lesson of Liverpool is that Bacon\u2019s art is exactly what he wanted it to be, no matter how many ways we might like to explain it: not stories but pictures that hold their own, a set of deathless, inexplicable images.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c8caf23ff2da3d070f99cfa8291960a0841b06c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c8caf23ff2da3d070f99cfa8291960a0841b06c5/0_0_2953_3701/798.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Painter and painting are inseparable\u2019: Self-Portrait With Saucepan, 1995 by Maria Lassnig.\" width=\"798\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Painter and painting are inseparable\u2019: Self-Portrait With Saucepan, 1995 by Maria Lassnig.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Maria Lassnig Foundation</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In an embarrassment of riches, Tate Liverpool is also presenting a show by the late and very great Austrian painter <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-liverpool/exhibition/maria-lassnig\"><strong>Maria Lassnig</strong></a> (1919-2014), which appears to have strong links with Bacon. Lassnig was also compelled by the experience of having, and being, a body; with sex and death and mordant humour. Her coinages are superb, especially with the self-portraits: herself as a shrieking cheese grater or a saucepan head, herself as triangle jabbing away at a square. She clambers out of the canvas, sinks into it, emerges from it like a newborn baby. Painter and painting are inseparable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"832141844f90bf44dd6d74f7d5a4dccd199bff3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/832141844f90bf44dd6d74f7d5a4dccd199bff3b/0_0_2953_2226/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hospital, 2005 by Maria Lassnig.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"754\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hospital, 2005 by Maria Lassnig.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: \u00a9 Maria Lassnig Foundation/ Archive Hauser &amp; Wirth</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The late works, which seem to grow brighter as she aged, are masterpieces of courageous invention: above all, paintings such as <em>What Next?</em>, where the woman is becoming a thing of paper, and <em>Hospital</em>, which shows what few artists have ever portrayed.

The quintet (1879) shares that same big, romantic sound and emotional intensity of the violin sonata, beautifully brought out here by <a href=\"http://www.marcandrehamelin.com/\" title=\"\">Marc-Andr\u00e9 Hamelin</a> and <a href=\"http://www.takacsquartet.com/\" title=\"\">the Tak\u00e1cs</a> in a stirring, virtuosic recording - an ideal way to encounter a still unfamiliar work. This is, however, a CD of two uneven parts: there\u2019s no questioning the Tak\u00e1cs\u2019s ability to play the Debussy String Quartet wonderfully. Something less corporeal, a little more elusive and vaporous, would have made it even better.</p>",

      "body": "<p>From \u201cJack\u201d to \u201cKick\u201d, the Kennedy self-confidence expressed in demotic monosyllables does not cease to dazzle. Fifty-three years after JFK\u2019s assassination, and 68 years after his beloved sister\u2019s death in an air crash, biographers continue to fly into the lost world of Kennedy brilliance, as moths to a flame. In the inevitable burn-up that follows, language itself acquires ever more lurid tones.</p> <p>So <em>Kick </em>is not the biography of Joe Kennedy\u2019s second daughter Kathleen. Rather, it is \u201cthe true story of Kick Kennedy, JFK\u2019s forgotten sister and the heir to Chatsworth\u201d. But if <em>Kick </em>is a \u201ctrue story\u201d, we should also recognise what it\u2019s not. It is, for instance, scarcely a dispassionate biography. Paula Byrne, the author of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/aug/16/evelyn-waugh-mad-world-byrne\" title=\"\"><em>Mad World: Evelyn Waugh and the Secrets of Brideshead (2009)</em></a>, the book that gave her the idea for <em>Kick</em>, is too heavily invested in her subject for the usual considerations of objectivity. Thus: \u201cKick was approaching her 16th birthday, and she wanted some fun.\u201d No surprise, also, to find it falling for the temptations of sentiment: \u201cKick felt as if she was in another world as she gazed at the rows of snow-capped pines and the enormous fairytale hotel nestling under the Swiss Alps, which loomed over the tiny village of Gstaad.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/aug/16/evelyn-waugh-mad-world-byrne\">Mad World by Paula Byrne | Book review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Addressing Kick\u2019s place in a family dominated by boys, Byrne reports that \u201ca hierarchy was established within the family with Joe Jr, Jack and Kick firmly at the top\u201d. But the relationship of Joe\u00a0Jr (who would also die in an air crash), and JFK (who would become a \u201cwar hero\u201d), to their one-of-the-lads sister rarely departs from a pop psychological narrative. It also fails completely to elucidate the impact on the young Kennedy family of its darkest secret. Older than Kick, but brain-damaged from birth, was another daughter, Rosemary, who would eventually be subjected to a botched\u00a0lobotomy.</p> <p>Still in the family division, <em>Kick </em>hardly offers much that\u2019s new about the cold but tormented marriage of Joe and Rose Kennedy. When Joe Sr starts his affair with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/feb/19/gloria-swanson-interview-demille-1969\" title=\"\">Gloria Swanson</a>, we learn that Kick \u201cwas intrigued to meet the daughter of the world\u2019s most famous movie star. She liked little Gloria, but she longed even more to meet the beautiful star herself.\u201d Shortly after this\u00a0breathless revelation, Byrne describes the Kennedys as \u201cthe ideal Catholic family\u201d.</p> <p>The deficiencies of <em>Kick</em> multiply within its unfolding narrative. It is not really a fraternal portrait of JFK as a young hero, though he\u2019s hovering in the wings throughout. When Kick moves to London during her father\u2019s disastrous tour of duty as US ambassador, this is not even a study of expat American life in the blitz. Kick\u2019s biographer, apparently oblivious to the flourishing genre of blitz studies, is content to describe the high jinks in the Gargoyle club and the Cafe\u00a0de\u00a0Paris.</p> <p>Despite several index entries for Evelyn Waugh, who was apparently \u201cbewitched\u201d by Miss K, Byrne has almost nothing to say about Waugh\u2019s partiality for an American girl with outstanding \u201csexual charisma\u201d, a species Waugh generally, and notoriously, loathed. Finally, <em>Kick </em>is not\u00a0really an Anglo-American romance, more a snapshot of wartime heartbreak. So what kind of book is it?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Behind the luxurious long weekends is the poignant story of an impressionable American, starved of parental affection</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Paula Byrne certainly has a beady eye on the marketplace. All too frequently a \u201ctrue story\u201d apparently written and researched in the UK, tips its cap to an American audience, with unintentionally hilarious results. When\u00a0Kick visits Cambridge, Byrne\u2019s readers, who will shortly get a lesson in the art of the apple-pie bed, discover that the\u00a0\u201cTrinity Ball [is] the highlight of the\u00a0academic year\u201d, which might come as news to many Cambridge graduates. When Kick and JFK first land in wartime Britain, \u201cthey intuitively understood the understated British humour\u201d.</p> <p>Elsewhere, Byrne\u2019s transatlantic readers will doubtless yearn to join \u201ca smart set of aristocratic young people\u201d and \u201cembrace the wholesome American girl with the dazzling smile\u201d. Actually, Kick was tormented by her lack of wholesomeness, and we hear so\u00a0much about her \u201cdazzling smile\u201d that\u00a0one is tempted to elevate this biography into that rarest and most exclusive genre of life-writing: the\u00a0hagiography.</p> <p><em>Kick</em>, then, is a missed opportunity. Behind the luxurious long weekends and the high-society junketing is the poignant story of an impressionable, gung-ho American (a discernible type), starved of parental affection, tyrannised by her mother, trapped in a cruel web of Roman Catholic guilt, trying to make sense of her young adult\u00a0life in a baffling and impenetrable\u00a0society high on the adrenaline of total war.</p> <p>Having defied her parents (especially her mother), and married Billy Hartington, the \u201cheir to Chatsworth\u201d, this unfortunate Bostonian was first widowed, then snagged by a philandering Irishman (\u201cking dandy and scum\u201d, according to Waugh), dying with him in a senseless plane crash (shades of John Kennedy\u00a0Jr). End\u00a0of\u00a0story.</p> <p>Less a book than an uncontrolled magazine article, <em>Kick</em> reads like an unedited film treatment. But it contains, for Hollywood, one fatal flaw. Kathleen \u201cKick\u201d Kennedy was a tragic figure, a victim of her upbringing and circumstances, who died in the quest for love. In the movie, we should shed a tear. In the book, we could hardly care less. That famous Kennedy magic is all the more golden for being so tantalisingly elusive.</p> <p><em>Kick is published by William Collins (\u00a320). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/391684/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a316</em></a></p>",

      "body": "<p>There must have been 50 prisoners in the bleak, scruffy meeting room at HMP Grendon in Buckinghamshire. They had turned out on a Tuesday afternoon to share their first-hand experience of prison education for the review <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/sep/08/michael-gove-prison-education-review-england-and-wales\">set up last autumn</a> by the justice secretary, Michael Gove.</p> <p>There were two panel members there to listen \u2013 me and the chairwoman, the educationist and \u201csuperhead\u201d, Dame Sally Coates. The prisoners took it in turns to speak. All were polite, most thought-provoking and some desperate. The most common complaint came from those who \u2013 like an estimated one-third of prisoners \u2013 identified as having learning difficulties and disabilities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/22/looking-for-better-ways-to-make-prison-work-in-the-21st-century\">Looking for better ways to make prison work in the 21st century | Letters</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Often, they said, they had gone undiagnosed during their early education (42% of all prisoners have been excluded from school) and there had been no proper screening when they entered the prison system, no tailored provision at the jail, and therefore no means or incentive for them to engage in education.</p> <p>The hard-pressed head of learning and skills at the prison looked away. Later she spelled out the problem for us. If her prison \u2013 and prisons across the system \u2013 assessed and then responded as best practice to such large numbers with learning difficulties, it would swallow the whole education budget of around \u00a3130m for a prison population of 86,000. And where did that leave the other inmates? It was a stark illustration of the strains on the system.</p> <p>There were other disturbing stories at Grendon. We heard much the same on visits to 30 other jails over the course of six months.</p> <p>At each, the Coates panel had unprecedented and unrestricted access. In 25 years writing about prisons, I\u2019d grown accustomed to the prison service finding reasons not to open its doors to outside busybodies. Now there was a red carpet for the education review.</p> <p>It is a welcome part of a new spirit of openness \u2013 and hope even \u2013 that Gove has engendered in a demoralised system, most recently with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/17/skype-ipads-in-cell-education-prison-legislation-queens-speech\">announcement in last week\u2019s Queen\u2019s speech</a> of pilot schemes in six prisons where governors will be given autonomy to promote rehabilitation, free from central controls that often cut across that.</p> <p>Coates\u2019s review is part of the same reform agenda. Critics say that agenda is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/18/prison-reform-not-solve-overcrowding-funding-problems-queens-speech\">too small to have any real impact on an overcrowded, understaffed system,</a> starved of money, and there was, at some prisons we visited, a suspicion that we were inspectors, come to find fault. But usually staff and inmates saw us as potential champions for a neglected part of prisons.</p> <p>Heads of learning and skills don\u2019t even sit on the senior management team in most jails. When Ofsted turns up at the gates, as part of a wider evaluation carried out by Her Majesty\u2019s Inspectorate of Prisons, it can rate education provision as inadequate or requiring improvement (as it did in 34 out of 45 inspections in 2014-15) without it having any effect on the establishment being rated good or outstanding. Indeed, in those prisons where education is repeatedly judged inadequate by Ofsted, there is apparently no consequence at all for the governor. In a school, the head would be lucky to keep his or her job, but that is presumably because education matters there.</p> <p>It would have been easy to feel very downcast by the scale of the challenge we saw. It was, however, the pockets of good practice that inspired us to believe they could be shared. Often they had arisen as the result of the resilience and inventiveness of teaching staff. I spent, for example, an uplifting morning in HMP Guys Marsh in Dorset with Elva Longfoot, one of the dedicated band of 4,000 prison teachers who often have committed most of their careers to this unloved area, despite being paid substantially less than their equivalents in further education colleges.</p> <p>On the door of her classroom was a sign that read: \u201cWelcome to Room 7 \u2013 Your Temple of Learning\u201d and the unorthodoxy continued inside where she offered short courses that taught the inmates to know themselves as a way of preparing them to learn English and maths. That was the right way round, experience had taught Longfoot, if they were to be persuaded that education was the key to unlocking their own potential.</p> <p>In theory, under the education providers\u2019 contract with Whitehall, the sort of PSD (personal and social development) curriculum that Longfoot offers is not fundable. The focus should be on basic skills. Providers get paid by putting bums on seats in classes for English and maths. But they know \u2013 as some of their senior officials told us \u2013 that the set-up isn\u2019t working, and so they contrive to find a way to give the likes of Longfoot room to do what is really effective.</p> <p>Another recent visitor to her Temple of Learning had been Gove himself. One of the proposals the Coates panel has made to him <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/unlocking-potential-a-review-of-education-in-prison\">in its report, published last week</a>, is that such local autonomy should become the norm, with education geared not to nationally generated targets and clunky funding mechanisms that create perverse incentives, but rather to the needs of individual prisoners.</p> <p>Two practical issues came up time and again. The first was the virtual campus, a bespoke intranet system designed to allow inmates to access a limited number of sites that help with education, employment and CV writing, without getting them on to the internet. Though it is available in 105 jails, in the third quarter of 2015 around 5,000 inmates, or just 6% of the prison population, used it regularly.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>One man was not allowed to touch the keys on a computer connected to the internet. A staff member had to do it for him</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This pale imitation of what the rest of us take for granted is patently failing. So why not upgrade it to an internet, and allow prisoners to be part of the modern world, but only on the basis of individual assessment and their ability to stick to certain rules? Governors told us they would have no problem with that. The stumbling block, they advised, is ministers who live in fear of headlines about a prisoner using the internet to contact a victim, intimidate a victim or control their criminal network. It would only take one bad case, they warned, to prompt a total shutdown.</p> <p>It is one of the challenges highlighted by the Coates report, now in Gove\u2019s hands. Another is to bring prisons into the digital age with the sort of technology that enables teachers to access up-to-date materials to engage learners and allows prisoners\u2019 education records to be stored and transferred efficiently between jails as they move about the system.</p> <p>Under current arrangements, one inmate we met was taking Level 2 maths for the third time because he could not provide the paperwork to prove he had passed it at his last jail. It\u2019s a waste of his time and of scarce public resources.</p> <p>And what of the impact on reoffending by those serving longer sentences when they are released from internet-free prisons without any of the IT skills that are obligatory to get a job or claim a benefit? I met too many such middle-aged men trying desperately to prepare for the outside world on antiquated prison computers. They had a rough idea of how to send an email, they told me, but only in theory because their machines were not connected to the web. It was hard to be optimistic for them.</p> <p>The second recurring issue was frustration at the glass ceiling that prevents those inmates keen to make up for lost time in their studies from going beyond a Level 2 qualification. Official figures show a fall of 85% between 2012-13 and 2014-15 in those doing Level 3 (A-level) courses in prison. At most now it is a couple of hundred. And those taking Open University modules are down 42% over a roughly similar period. What lies behind this precipitous drop is money. Education providers cannot have funding for anything over a Level 2 course and so are reluctant to provide teaching resources. And the pots of government funding, once provided in the belief that helping prisoners get qualifications reduced reoffending, have gone. So ambitious prison learners must now take out a student loan and \u2013 unsurprisingly \u2013 most are just not willing, especially when they will pay the same as learners outside, but without the access to tutors or the internet.</p> <p>\u201cAt the very least I should get a discount on the fees,\u201d suggested one young man I spoke to, struggling to do his research for an assignment on the one computer with an internet link in the library. He wasn\u2019t able to touch the keys. That had to be done by a member of staff, on his behalf. We might as well have tied his hands behind his back.</p> <p>It all comes down to a basic question. We know that education plays a role in reducing reoffending. The Ministry of Justice\u2019s data reports a 25% fall in reoffending for those who engage up to further and higher education levels. Those who have a job to go to on release are also less likely to reoffend. To get a job you need qualifications.</p> <p>So if we want to cut reoffending \u2013 which is now between 46% and 59%, and is estimated by the government to cost society up to \u00a313bn a year \u2013 we have to be prepared to make prison education a priority. That will mean a collective change of heart about giving prisoners a second chance. And it will require directing additional public resources to those who have squandered the educational chances society routinely provides. It is not a popular call for any minister, but it is to be hoped Gove will have the courage. The alternative, as I have witnessed these past few months, is to accept a waste of human potential on a colossal and even more costly scale.</p> <p><em>Peter Stanford is director of the </em><a href=\"http://www.longfordtrust.org/\"><em>Longford Trust</em></a><em> </em></p>",

Stranded in the desert, penning plaintive missives to his daughter, Alan starts to unravel, blaming his woes on a growing lump on his back, which comes to symbolise his inner sickness. Flashbacks to his home life rub shoulders with a more general malaise about outsourcing home industries to China in this peculiar melange of the personal, the political and the parodic. Alexander Black makes some dramatic headway as Alan\u2019s driver-cum-guide Yousef, while Sarita Choudhury breathes life into blossoming romantic subplot which proves the film\u2019s most intriguing feature. As for Hanks, he does a nice line in hassled everyman, but can\u2019t quite inject an element of magic into Tom Tykwer\u2019s movie, even when coincidentally reprising a touchstone scene from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMIsXdoj2vU\" title=\"\"><em>Splash</em></a>.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrodtZUUsgM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/GrodtZUUsgM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrodtZUUsgM\">Watch a trailer for A Hologram for the King.</a></figcaption> </figure>",

      "body": "<p>\u201cThis is an interesting project to be involved with if you consider yourself a socialist,\u201d says <a href=\"http://oma.eu/partners/reinier-de-graaf\">Reinier de Graaf</a> of the Rotterdam-based architects<a href=\"http://oma.eu/\"> OMA</a>, \u201cwhich I do.\u201d The square foot of new apartment space on which he is standing is worth more than \u00a34,000, and there is a view out of the window of another apartment block of which a Syrian art collector has bought four entire floors.</p> <p>We are in a new development branded as <a href=\"http://www.hollandgreenw8.com/\">Holland Green</a> that stands between Kensington High Street and Holland Park in west London, and thus far it is an everyday story of exospheric property dealing in the capital. What makes it unusual is that a proportion of the profits of the development are paying for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2012/jan/24/design-museum-new-plans\">the adjacent new home of the Design Museum</a>, with an interior by John Pawson, to open this autumn. The museum will be housed in the wonky, curved-roofed, much-rebuilt pavilion that is all that is left of the Commonwealth Institute, a 1960s icon of vaguely progressive thinking that never worked too well, but was nonetheless a listed building, Grade II*.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Conflict or extremity don\u2019t sell well in the high-end residential market</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Holland Green is also unusual for the fact that it is designed by OMA, who are more often famous for provocative cultural projects and public works, and are not from the usual run of architects who design luxury residential speculations in London. They are there because the project\u2019s developer, Stuart Lipton, needed a practice of skill and credibility to solve the problem presented by the Commonwealth Institute and get through what proved to be hard-fought planning battle. De Graaf and OMA, who were appointed to the job in 2008, came up with a plan to demolish most of it and replace it with three square apartment blocks, and leave the pavilion for a cultural purpose, which turned out to be the Design Museum.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5aa0e78752fa647ec470d3aaf4f9a42db6f46ebe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5aa0e78752fa647ec470d3aaf4f9a42db6f46ebe/98_0_2400_3000/800.jpg\" alt=\"One of OMA\u2019s Holland Green \u2018blinker\u2019 rooms.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of OMA\u2019s Holland Green \u2018blinker\u2019 rooms.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sebastian van Damme/OMA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>OMA is the practice founded by Rem Koolhaas, and any project associated with him tends to come with a fluster of anticipation. In Britain, moreover, OMA projects are still rare. By these standards the arrival of Holland Green is relatively low-key, partly because the big event on this site will be the opening of the museum in the autumn. It might also, for fans of the Koolhaas universe, come as a bit of a disappointment. OMA\u2019s usual themes \u2013 complexity, contradiction, an interest in conflict and (sometimes) its resolution, a certain playful waywardness \u2013 are lacking, or at least muted.</p> <p>It is not that the raw materials are lacking. The site is one of an encounter between the embers of postwar Keynesian public works, transmuted from the old institute into the museum, and the contemporary march of private property investment. On the one hand an institution whose aim will be to attract as many of the public as possible, on the other the buyers of flats who will generally want maximum seclusion from the said public. The old 60s remnant, preserved by order of English Heritage (now Historic England), is in a style for which few of the residents of the new flats will have an interest or liking.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A quantum-mechanical degree of uncertainty between public and private and open and closed seems likely</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Holland Green has a swimming pool, spa, games room and cinema in the basement, which presents opportunities for strange encounters between plutocrats who might be at war with each other in their home country. It slightly resembles the early Soviet idea of a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/may/05/moscow-narkomfin-soviet-collective-living-history-cities-50-buildings\">social condenser</a>, in which blocks of workers\u2019 housing came with communal facilities, a type with which Koolhaas and OMA have long been fascinated, but the opportunity has not arisen to give it the dramatic constructivist form it might have had in the 1920s.</p> <p>The instinct is more towards discretion, as statements of conflict or extremity don\u2019t sell well in the high-end residential market. It is left to OMA to make smaller gestures, such as an overall severity of appearance, and projecting, box-like rooms called \u201cblinkers\u201d which, eschewing the usual demand for maximising views out at every possible opportunity, proffer largely blank walls. OMA-ness is also present in the way flat, repetitive elevations are offset by corners eroded into stepped terraces or ground floor porticoes.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2fed7008e1b7222b7646cd88babc6dc3759b16fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2fed7008e1b7222b7646cd88babc6dc3759b16fd/0_0_7426_5958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018An encounter between the embers of postwar Keynesian public works and the contemporary march of private property investment\u2019: Holland Green and, left, the old Commonwealth Institute pavilion.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"802\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018An encounter between the embers of postwar Keynesian public works and the contemporary march of private property investment\u2019: Holland Green and, left, the old Commonwealth Institute pavilion.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Philip Vile</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most of all, de Graaf wants to draw attention to other victories, above all the presence of the museum. Others are more subtle, such as the planning of the site. The old institute pavilion is set at 45 degrees to the street, which is taken as a precedent for setting the new apartment blocks in the same orientation. Between them, landscaped spaces run, which allow city and park to infiltrate each other and create both an open space and pleasing change of rhythm on Kensington High Street.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5a68cfa4ad805d4f1a587b19cea8d782139585e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5a68cfa4ad805d4f1a587b19cea8d782139585e1/0_656_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Holland Green, with park attached.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Holland Green, with park attached.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sebastian van Damme</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The public is also admitted to some of the landscaped spaces, especially those that will offer a route to the museum, albeit managed by a strange ballet of security gates. These exist to reassure buyers that they will be protected from sharing space with the masses, but the museum will have the legal right to insist that they are open at certain times. A quantum-mechanical degree of uncertainty between public and private and open and closed seems likely.</p> <p>The outcome is one in which no one gets exactly what they want \u2013 not the buyers, the architects, not the protectors of the old building. De Graaf describes the protracted struggle to protect original ideas from external pressures of planning and finance (\u201csix weeks of creativity to design it, and eight years of struggle\u201d) before wryly commenting on the result \u2013 \u201cas Rem said of another project, it\u2019s a building for a property developer so it\u2019s best judged as sculpture\u201d. But for all that, Holland Green achieves a degree of intelligence and public spirit almost unheard of in luxury residential developments. And there will be the museum.</p>",

      "headline": "Recruitment lessons: how Japan and Australia attract teachers into rural schools",
      "body": "<p>I recently spotted new adverts on my Facebook feed asking me to help struggling schools. It\u2019s no surprise \u2013 I regularly post about teaching and education, and count being a teacher in my career history. The ad promotes the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/national-teaching-service-pilot-gets-underway\" rel=\"nofollow\">National Teaching Service</a>, a new scheme to encourage the best teachers and middle leaders to move across the country and work in rural or underperforming schools that struggle to recruit and retain staff.</p> <p>This time, Facebook\u2019s marketing algorithm has missed its mark; I haven\u2019t been a teacher for three years. But my experience visiting and studying education systems in top-performing countries in the years since I was in the classroom allows me to shed light on how other systems work \u2013 and how this ambitious national programme might be best implemented.</p> <p>The challenge of getting qualified, quality teachers into schools that need them most is one many countries face. Australia, for example, has some significant geographical challenges. When we talk of rural schools in the UK, we refer to coastal or remote schools, two or three-hour\u2019s drive from the nearest city. In Australia, that is more likely to be a three-hour flight. How does the government convince their teachers to move into the outback?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2013/oct/22/teacher-professional-development-school-advice\">10 professional development ideas for teachers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Australian states offer a number of incentives to encourage teachers into these remote schools. These can include: housing subsidies of 70-100%; retention benefits if they stay in rural schools beyond a certain number of years; vacation travel expenses; and an \u201cisolation from goods and services\u201d allowance. The UK\u2019s National Teaching Service is offering <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/national-teaching-service-for-teachers-and-middle-leaders\" rel=\"nofollow\">relocation subsidies of up to \u00a310,000</a>, which is a great start, but other potentially persuasive benefits, such as allowances for travelling home and retention renumeration for staying beyond the three-year programme, aren\u2019t included.</p> <p>North of Australia, the Japanese government also offers benefits to mitigate being posted to schools that teachers have not chosen themselves, but their approach is much more structured. In Japan they have a system called tenkin, in which company and government employees are rotated to different offices (and sometimes roles) every few years. New teachers are posted to a new school after four years, and after that, teachers are rotated to a new school every six years. This allows for rich professional experiences, evens out teaching quality and revitalises the workforce within each school. Teachers are compensated with generous subsidies and given a formal introduction to the area, in addition to mentoring and professional development. Vitally, these opportunities are not reliant on individual schools.</p> <p>While England does not have a recruitment system in which teachers can be posted where they are needed, the National Teaching Service could offer an opportunity to start one. Like the Japanese system though, the professional development offered would need to be of a guaranteed, recognised standard \u2013 not reliant on the individual schools to which teachers were posted.</p> <p>Another important feature of the Japanese system is that while they do post great teachers to schools that need extra help, they also post teachers who need to improve to successful schools with strong teaching skills. This latter point is crucial. Just moving around good teachers isn\u2019t enough to make a significant impact on the system because the same amount of talent is just distributed in a different way. To have a significant and long-lasting impact on the teaching quality across the country you need to ensure that there are systems in place that support teachers to learn from one another.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2014/jun/25/busy-teachers-england-miss-out-professional-development\">Busy teachers in England missing out on professional development</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Japan, Singapore and Shanghai, this learning happens through lesson study, where teachers of different expertise and experience plan lessons together, observe each other teach and have discussions about the effectiveness of the pedagogy observed. Teachers in Finland also have a weekly timetabled session to plan lessons with their colleagues, which allows them to learn from one another. The focus in all of these places is on supporting teachers. </p> <p>National Teaching Service teachers must be given the time to plan professional development and engage other staff in conversations about pedagogy. Their impact could be so much greater if headteachers could make space for these conversations and observations throughout their school.</p> <p>Korea\u2019s system rotates teachers like Japan\u2019s does, but they also make the experience of working in disadvantaged schools count more when it comes to promotion than working in affluent areas. By making access to the highest rungs of their career ladder depend partly on whether they\u2019ve had experience in a more challenging area, they make the experience more sought-after.</p> <p>With a variety of career incentives, including guaranteed professional development and time for supporting others, the benefits of the National Teaching Service could convince more brilliant teachers to make the move to rural areas and challenging schools \u2013 and to stay there. And maybe if I return to the classroom, and work my socks off to become a brilliant teacher, I might click on that Facebook link after all.</p> <p><em>Lucy Crehan is an associate at the <a href=\"https://www.educationdevelopmenttrust.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Education Development Trust</a>.

      "body": "<p>Stunning views of the Isle of Mull lend much-needed beauty to this sternly overwrought tale of puritanical minister Balor McNeil (Damian Lewis) terrorising his outsider wife Aislin (Andrea Riseborough) on an increasingly deserted Scottish island. When young offender Fionn (Ross Anderson) is dumped on his doorstep, the minister\u2019s perpetual seething enters a new register, so it\u2019s a relief to everyone when he sets sail on a boat full of church pews, leaving wife and incomer to fend for themselves. Cinematographer Ed Rutherford, who worked wonders for Joanna Hogg on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/archipelago\" title=\"\"><em>Archipelago</em></a> and <em>Exhibition</em>, skilfully marks the tonal shift from shadowy storm clouds to hallucinogenic sunshine, leaving Riseborough and Anderson to frolic briefly in this fragile new Eden, awaiting the returning tempest. Writer-director Corinna McFarlane counterposes Bergmanesque interiors with gaping exteriors, while Alastair Caplin\u2019s eerie, evocative score cranks up the searing, brooding mood.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3MfLl8-XV4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/V3MfLl8-XV4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3MfLl8-XV4\">Watch a trailer for The Silent Storm.</a></figcaption> </figure>",

      "body": "<p>In the rural south of France, where his mother is closing up the family\u2019s holiday home, brittle British teenager Elliot (Alex Lawther) becomes besotted with the alluring Cl\u00e9ment (Ph\u00e9nix Brossard), only to discover that his frustrated, heartbroken mum has similar interests. Writer/director Andrew Stegall\u2019s debut feature benefits from a reliably rigorous performance by Juliet Stevenson as the conflicted Beatrice, a woman whose inner pain is reflected in the tiniest movement of her eyes, or tightening of her cheek. As Elliot, Lawther is deliberately more unlikable, his anxious narcissism and peevishly cruel turn of phrase nurtured in the vacuum of his parent\u2019s marriage, leaving Brossard to inject some force-of-nature vibrancy into the stiflingly mannered proceedings. \u201cYou\u2019re a bit of a clich\u00e9,\u201d Cl\u00e9ment tells Elliot, indicating that Steggall knows exactly how irritatingly pretentious this callow youth appears. Yet the film plays with our affections, alternately seducing and repelling us. Finbar Lynch is affectingly spiky as the all-but-absent husband whose presence feels more like a void, but Stevenson steals the show as the woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/feb/02/departure-watch-an-exclusive-trailer-for-the-new-british-drama-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4gbgg\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2449159\"            data-video-name=\"Departure: watch an exclusive trailer for the new British drama \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"Other...\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2016/2/2/1454416575063/KP_1649416_crop_640x480.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-56b0a2c9e4b04602930027aa\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2016/2/2/1454416575063/KP_1649416_crop_640x480.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/02/02/160202DepartureTrailer_1_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/02/02/160202DepartureTrailer_1_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/02/02/160202DepartureTrailer_1_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/02/02/160202DepartureTrailer_1.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/02/02/160202DepartureTrailer_1_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/feb/02/departure-watch-an-exclusive-trailer-for-the-new-british-drama-video\">Departure: watch an exclusive trailer for the new British drama \u2013\u00a0video</a></figcaption> </figure>",

So this opening gambit \u2013 the kind of thing a hardened professional might say every night \u2013 bodes extremely well. And the happy portent is not misleading.</p> <p>By the end of a polished and ultimately engaging 80-minute show, even those who start out wondering if the space-jazz trappings of the Birmingham Conservatoire-trained Mvula\u2019s music \u2013 the harp, the cello, the euphorically out-there choral interludes \u2013 might be just so much window dressing, designed to convince a <em>Later\u2026 With Jools Holland</em> audience that this is something more interesting than routine post-Prince sophisto-pop, will have come to hear them as part of a well-integrated and satisfying whole. Mvula also manages to hold on to the crowd while playing all but one track of her imminent second album, <em>The Dreaming Room</em>, to a crowd that won\u2019t yet have heard more than a few tracks.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The show really comes to life when she introduces the song Kiss My Feet with a monologue about a romantic betrayal</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Mvula\u2019s chatty, playful stage patter certainly helps with this connection, as does the fact that many of her new songs are \u2013 taking into consideration their expansive arrangements and penchant for baroque flourishes and swirling codas \u2013 unexpectedly short. The point where the show really comes to life is when she introduces the song Kiss My Feet with a monologue about a romantic betrayal (\u201cYou know, innit... heartbreak\u201d) that changed its meaning \u2013 \u201cWhen it was written, this was a love song, but it isn\u2019t now.\u201d All the evidence suggests that Mvula\u2019s opera-singing husband \u2013 the reason her brother and sister James and Dionne Douglas (contributing cello and guitar respectively in her well-drilled, intuitive backing ensemble) have a different surname \u2013 has ascended to the pantheon of inspirational musical exes.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duBoc34KUzM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/duBoc34KUzM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duBoc34KUzM\">Laura Mvula\u2019s Father, Father.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>From <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/amywinehouse\">Amy Winehouse</a>\u2019s <em>Frank</em> to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/adele\">Adele</a>\u2019s <em>21</em>, the multi-platinum landscape of 21st-century female pop empowerment has usually been defined against a male other, and as Mvula telegraphs with engaging candour (\u201cHere\u2019s another song for that motherfucker who broke my heart\u201d), <em>The Dreaming Room</em> is no exception. But where <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/bjork\">Bj\u00f6rk</a> (whose name is helpfully put forward from the crowd when Mvula lists musical influences including Queen, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/mar/02/nina-simone-10-of-the-best\">Nina Simone</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/mar/19/schubert-ferocious-tender-sublime\">Schubert</a>) recently struggled to impose her individuality on the conventions of the breakup album, Mvula seems to have made an excellent job of it, with Kiss My Feet \u2013 \u201cI feel lost and found at the same damn time/ Made my bed but I can\u2019t rest/ I got losing on my mind\u201d \u2013 just one of several new songs to strike a winning balance between wistful regret and affronted ferocity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5f96248ec4b3843477d0caf3551e529af0ab433c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5f96248ec4b3843477d0caf3551e529af0ab433c/0_197_2956_1774/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A winning balance between wistful regret and affronted ferocity\u2019: Laura Mvula at Gorilla.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Wistful regret and affronted ferocity\u2019: Laura Mvula at Gorilla.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matthew McNulty/ Redferns</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>She expresses fulsome gratitude to her new album\u2019s producer, former Amy Winehouse drummer Troy Miller, now securely ensconced behind the kit at the heart of her band. The absent male who doesn\u2019t get a mention is Steve Brown, who helped get Mvula a record deal and produced her excellent (and rightly Mobo-laden) first album <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/03/laura-mvula-sing-moon-review\"><em>Sing to the Moon</em></a> when she was, if not quite working as a waitress in a cocktail bar, then certainly on reception for the Birmingham Symphony Orchestra. Brown\u2019s shadowy presence as an enabler of upscale British female pop (he provided the same service for Rumer) is rendered no less intriguing by his parallel career as Harry Hill\u2019s musical director and stellar backstory as Alan Partridge\u2019s legendary band leader Glenn Ponder.</p> <p><em>The Dreaming Room</em>\u2019s seductive Afro-futurist shimmer suggests it will avoid the ignominious fate that befell Rumer\u2019s second album when she too unceremoniously dumped Brown off the back of an award-winning set. Tonight\u2019s stellar solo performance of <em>Sing to the Moon</em> standout <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duBoc34KUzM\">Father, Father</a> \u2013 accompanying herself on giant antique 80s funk-style keytar \u2013 confirms that Mvula has what it takes to go it alone.</p>",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.orangetreetheatre.co.uk/whats-on/the-philanderer\"><em>The Philanderer</em></a>, written in 1893, is a prescient play. Bernard Shaw included it in his <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/plays-unpleasant.html\"><em>Plays Unpleasant</em></a>, because its plot pivoted on the \u201cgrotesque sexual compacts\u201d that the marriage laws obliged men and women to make. Despite the title, this is actually a play about women. About the tough times and triumphs we faced in finding a way to be in charge of our lives. It scythes through sentiment.</p> <p>Shaw drew for the character of Julia Craven on his experience with his first, rather late-in-the-day love. Dorothea Myer-Bennett renders this woman, struggling not to live up to her surname, with palpitating, tear-drenched conviction. There is something of Shaw in Rupert Young\u2019s philanderer, though his jutting beard is more persuasive than the delivery of his verbal flights. Helen Bradbury is beautifully cool as the other woman involved in a sexual triangle which is also an intellectual boxing match.</p> <p>The dynamic artistic director of <a href=\"https://www.orangetreetheatre.co.uk/\">the Orange Tree</a>, Paul Miller, wanted to free the play from the constraints of Victoriana and so sets it in a loosely modern day. With mixed results. Shaw himself said he would no more think of updating the play than of setting Ben Jonson\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/13/ben.jonson\"><em>Bartholomew Fair</em></a><em> </em>in Woolworth\u2019s. After all, \u201cThe human nature in it is still in fashion.\u201d I think Miller is right not to treat the iconoclast as if he were a sacred cow. Yet it is peculiar to set a drama hinging on the impossibility of divorce in England so entirely in modern dress. A little leather jacket for Julia, red cord trousers for her blustering father, neat jeans for the philanderer. Why do they need to go to North Dakota when they could get unspliced in London?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"63096650668d2fc9112e3482cbd834693b9df388\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/63096650668d2fc9112e3482cbd834693b9df388/0_192_3455_4316/801.jpg\" alt=\"Christopher Staines (Dr Paramore) and Dorothea Myer-Bennett (Julia Craven) in The Philanderer.\" width=\"801\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christopher Staines (Dr Paramore) and Dorothea Myer-Bennett (Julia Craven) in The Philanderer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Shaw\u2019s original, pro-divorce ending would, he was told by a scandal-ridden friend, be considered too scandalous to be performed. He substituted a blander third act. Miller explosively stages both versions. The result, a rare two-interval evening, is too long. Yet full of interest. Not only for its intricate discussion of the plight of the New Woman, but for two of its satirical inventions, Dr Paramore and the Ibsen club.</p> <p>In the character of Dr Paramore, Shaw was having a dig at the medical profession and at the practice of vivisection. Paramore, having made his name by discovering a disease from his work on a guinea pig\u2019s \u201cducts\u201d, is devastated to learn that those able to experiment on monkeys and camels and dogs have discredited his research. He almost breaks down in telling a patient that he is after all not under sentence of death.</p> <p>In the imaginary Ibsen Club, Shaw pays homage to the dramatist who was beginning to revolutionise the tepid English stage with his dark realism. He even purloins a line from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/ibsen\"><em>Hedda Gabler</em></a>: \u201cPeople don\u2019t do such things.\u201d He does so while poking complicated fun. Men and women are admitted to the club only if the men agree not to be manly and the women not to be womanly. Simon Daw\u2019s design cleverly hangs the bust of the Norwegian hero from the ceiling, where it slowly rotates. Rather like Shaw\u2019s arguments. His ingenious elaborations play well in the round.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.orangetreetheatre.co.uk/whats-on/the-philanderer/about\">The Philanderer is at the Orange Tree, Richmond until 25 June.

      "body": "<p><em>Solo</em> was choreographed by Hans van Manen in 1997, and it\u2019s a wonder. Now 83, Van Manen is the high priest of Dutch modernism. His work is characterised by rigorous musicality and an austere wit, both in evidence here. <em>Solo </em>was made for three male dancers, who dash through Bach\u2019s first partita for solo violin with thrilling velocity, replacing each other at intervals like a relay team. Van Manen gives us flurries of stage-skimming terre-\u00e0-terre, taut-sprung reverses, skittering turns. Steps glint and ricochet like beads cascading from a broken necklace.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There\u2019s pseudo-ritual, faux martial-artistry and much breathless rushing about</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Performed here by Gregory Lau, Benjamin Behrends, and Miguel Duarte, it\u2019s the strongest work in a mixed programme by <a href=\"http://www.ndt.nl/en/discover/news/ndt-2.html\">Nederlands Dans Theater 2</a>. NDT2, whose dancers are all between 18 and 23, is the junior division of the Hague-based Nederlands Dans Theater, which was founded in 1959. All are good, the best are brilliant. Lau, who started his career in breakdance, is a performer of consummate virtuosity, with an elegantly cursive style and an openness of manner which is a joy to watch. Alice Godfrey, who appears in three of the evening\u2019s six works, is another dancer who compels the gaze, her expansive arms and long, articulate leg line endowing the simplest move with beauty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2be7324e0e29731ee90c7a29483cc1b4510c1cf0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2be7324e0e29731ee90c7a29483cc1b4510c1cf0/0_0_2833_4535/625.jpg\" alt=\"Katarina van den Wouwer and Alexander Anderson in NDT2\u2019s Schubert.\" width=\"625\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Katarina van den Wouwer and Alexander Anderson in NDT2\u2019s Schubert.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In terms of technical finish, this 18-strong ensemble is a dream team. So it\u2019s a pity that the work they have to perform is so uneven. The evening opens with three pieces by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dkc7Q3JBM5s\">Sol L\u00e9on and Paul Lightfoot</a>, who have created more than 50 ballets for the company (Lightfoot is also the artistic director of NDT). L\u00e9on and Lightfoot\u2019s collaborations show off the physical skills of the company to advantage, but <em>Schubert </em>(2014), <em>Sad Case </em>(1998) and <em>Some Other Time </em>(2014) are typical in that they do so in a shallow and meretricious context, heavily reliant on whimsy. So there\u2019s much face-pulling, specious vocalisation, ironic bumping and grinding and would-be significant slow-motion walking. It\u2019s all very glossily produced, but it doesn\u2019t amount to a hill of beans, and these dancers deserve better.</p> <p>The evening wraps with Alexander Ekman\u2019s <em>Cacti</em> (2010), a witty demolition of postmodern dance\u2019s pomposities and pretensions. Behind a larky veneer, Ekman puts the boot in with no little ferocity. There\u2019s pseudo-ritual, faux martial-artistry and much breathless rushing about, with the titular cacti carried hither and thither as if profoundly significant. There\u2019s a clever passage in which a couple rehearse a duet, and discover that their relationship is constructed from the same inconsequential cliches as the choreography. There\u2019s a certain irony in <em>Cacti</em>\u2019s inclusion in a NDT programme, and with <em>Solo</em>, it redeems the evening\u2019s shaky start. But the real pleasure of NDT2 is the dancers.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Painted on the outside wall of Leith Dockers Club is a mural that depicts some of the wizened faces of the men who worked the port amid familiar haunts of this working-class district north of Edinburgh\u2019s gilded city centre. Soon they will be joined by another of Leith\u2019s favourite sons, Irvine Welsh, the writer and poet who, they felt, brought this neglected place to life once more.</p> <p>It is 23 years since Welsh penned his masterpiece, <em>Trainspotting</em>, the ferocious and poetic depiction of an underclass that generations of the city burgesses had tried to pretend didn\u2019t exist. The film of the book was made three years later and now, on its 20th anniversary, the director Danny Boyle and most of the original cast have come together to begin filming the long-awaited sequel. In locations around Leith, as well as some in Glasgow, Ewan McGregor, Robert Carlyle, Jonny Lee Miller and the boys have been glimpsed playing their former selves with some gusto.</p> <p>They look as though they are enjoying themselves and Carlyle says that the <em>Trainspotting 2</em> script is even better than the original. In the Dockers, Rab Mitchell, the manager, is fishing out a photograph of Welsh standing beside the club. \u201cIrvine Welsh is the first and only honorary member of the Leith Dockers Club,\u201d he says proudly. \u201cI\u2019ve been meaning to get an image of him put up on the mural outside. He\u2019s a great lad and often pops in for a pint when he returns home from the States. He\u2019ll always be welcome here and not just because he talked fondly about us in <em>Trainspotting</em>. He gave Leith a voice, a real voice.\u201d</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/may/16/trainspotting-2-the-first-teaser-trailer-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4j938\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2506391\"            data-video-name=\"Trainspotting 2: the first teaser trailer \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Film4\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5739b2fde4b06d63a2613e57\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/16/160506Trainspotting_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/16/160506Trainspotting_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/16/160506Trainspotting_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/16/160506Trainspotting_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/16/160506Trainspotting.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/may/16/trainspotting-2-the-first-teaser-trailer-video\">Trainspotting 2: the first teaser trailer</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The Dockers Club is one of several places in this little enclave that are stitched forever into the fabric of British cinema and literature. Just across the road is the Central Bar underneath the old Leith Central Station which inspired the name of the book. The pub is a throwback to an earlier age when working-class men, some retired, would spend an afternoon perched beside a big saloon bar sipping ale and making the day\u2019s racing selections. The smoking ban in Scotland\u2019s pubs has been in force for more than a decade but this is one of those bars which, while smoke-free, cannot be pictured in your mind without smoke. Cigarettes ought to be smoked in here.</p> <p>On Friday afternoon it\u2019s busy and I stop to pick up some of the working- class Edinburgh dialect which Irvine gave voice to. The author and journalist Simon Pia, born and raised here, is another who says that <em>Trainspotting</em> is perhaps the best book that\u2019s ever been written about Scotland. \u201cYou have to remember,\u201d he says, that when people think of working-class dialects they immediately think of Glaswegian and people like Billy Connolly and Stanley Baxter. In literature, the authentic Glaswegian dialect has been captured wonderfully by James Kelman.</p> <p>\u201cWhat Welsh did in <em>Trainspotting</em> was bring to life a rich and varied authentic Edinburgh working-class dialect that many people outside its natural habitat probably didn\u2019t even know existed, including in the city itself. The book also perfectly captured what was going on in real Edinburgh in the 1980s.\u201d</p> <p>What was going on then was that Edinburgh, posh, elegant and classical Edinburgh \u2013 the Athens of the north \u2013 was becoming known as the Aids capital of Europe, mainly brought about by shared needles in filthy tenements in scenes that Welsh faithfully and with no adornment whatsoever brought to grim life. At the beginning of a chapter called The First Day of the Edinburgh Festival, Welsh brutally paints a city of contrasts. \u201cAy took ma last shot in order tae git us through the horrors ay the shopping trip. Ma final score will be used tae help us sleep, and ease us oaf the skag. Ah\u2019ll try tae take it in small, measured doses. Ah need some quickly. The great decline is setting in. It starts as it generally does, with a slight nausea in the pit ay ma stomach and an irrational panic attack.\u201d</p> <p>Under Danny Boyle\u2019s cinematic direction, scenes like that were accorded a terrifying beauty, like the first time you watched the 1966 footage of a Buddhist monk serenely setting fire to himself. Unsurprisingly, the book and film were not received well in some parts of an Edinburgh which was trying to promote itself as the go-to cultural destination in the western world. \u201c<em>Trainspotting</em> captured a time and a place in the history of this city perfectly,\u201d says Pia. \u201cThose of us who knew these places and who had lived and worked here in places like Leith, Pilton, the Drylaw and Muirhouse, knew that this was just as real as the Castle and the Palace and the galleries and the old town. Irvine observed all this, and he got it all. It might not be what some others would like to have seen up there on the screen, but the people around here loved it. They didn\u2019t think he had reduced them or disparaged them. They thought he honoured them \u2026 and he had.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/03/irvine-welsh-interview-blade-artist-trainspotting-porno-begbie\">Irvine Welsh: \u2018I thought, what if Begbie was the most self-controlled guy in the room?\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>The port of Leith</strong> was formally merged with Edinburgh in 1920 despite Leithers voting 5-1 against the move in a referendum. But it has never really belonged to the rest of the city. As well as having its own coat of arms and civic hall, it also has a strong sense of its own identity which is palpably distinct from Edinburgh\u2019s.</p> <p>Glaswegians who have lived and worked in Edinburgh are fond of saying that Leith reminds them of Glasgow\u2019s warmth and edginess. Last week, a local arts festival announced that it plans a rerun of that 1920 referendum.</p> <p>Morvern Cunningham, festival director of the LeithLate arts programme, wants to mark the centenary of that controversial ballot with a second one. \u201cI\u2019ve always quite fancied the idea of doing another referendum,\u201d he said. \u201cThe idea might be to ask people if they still wanted to be part of Edinburgh, even though they voted No back in the day. I would be interested in the answer.\u201d</p> <p>The answer, though, would never really be in any doubt. Following the 2014 referendum on Scottish independence, Edinburgh voted for the status quo in greater numbers than anywhere else. In Leith, though, the residents backed independence, the only Edinburgh neighbourhood to do so. It wasn\u2019t so much a vote for an independent Scotland as a vote for an independent republic of Leith.</p> <p>In the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/07/losers-no-more-tories-scotland\" title=\"\">Scottish elections this month, Tories in Edinburgh</a> loosened the SNP\u2019s stranglehold on Scottish politics a little. Ruth Davidson, leader of the Scottish Tories, chose to move from Glasgow to stand in Edinburgh, sensing that this city would give her a better chance of winning a seat after two electoral defeats in Glasgow by wide margins. She romped home in Scotland\u2019s capital.</p> <p>Welsh has been attending some of the filming for <em>Trainspotting 2</em>, fitting these in between watching his beloved Hibernian\u2019s forlorn attempt to return to the Scottish Premiership.</p> <p>He was delighted that Rab Mitchell at the Leith Dockers Club had passed on his best wishes. \u201cAh give Rab my best. He\u2019s one of the last of the real old school still involved there. What gave me most pride with <em>Trainspotting</em> was just finishing it. It had been in my head such a long time. To prove to myself I could write and be able to move on was big for me.</p> <p>\u201cWith the film I was so proud that all those incredibly talented people were gathered in this space doing their thing and bringing it to life big time because I\u2019d bothered to write the novel. That was a real buzz.\u201d</p> <p>In the Central Bar and in the Banana Flats around the corner, also made famous by <em>Trainspotting</em>, history hangs in the air once more and there is tension. On Saturday Hibernian, the pride of Leith, won the Scottish Cup with a late winner against Rangers. They haven\u2019t lifted the trophy since 1902, at a time when many of those who voted in the first Leith independence referendum would have been alive.</p> <p>In the same year that <em>Trainspotting 2 </em>will bring Leith and its characters and its language to the world once more, the planets have aligned favourably for Leithers and their long-suffering football team.</p>",

Underneath it, people live in self-contained cells, communicating with each other remotely. Their lives are controlled by the Machine. Which we might call technology. They have lost the habit of touching each other, of seeing things directly rather than on a screen. The forests have been chopped down for newspaper pulp. People no longer know the word for snow.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6ed49b5c0a495203817f432ecd4986187c873203\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6ed49b5c0a495203817f432ecd4986187c873203/0_170_1367_1708/800.jpg\" alt=\"They\u2019re behind you: Gareth Aled, Maria Gray and Caroline Gruber in The Machine Stops.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">They\u2019re behind you: Gareth Aled, Maria Gray and Caroline Gruber in The Machine Stops.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Bentley</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Neil Duffield\u2019s adaptation for <a href=\"http://pilot-theatre.net/\">Pilot Theatre</a> is faithful to Forster. Caroline Gruber is the stationary woman, an expert on the old \u201cprimitive civilisation\u201d, especially the \u201cmusic of the Australian period\u201d. Karl Queensborough plays her rebellious son. He brings catastrophe to a regime which, unchallenged, has become a religion. He ushers in the possibility of once again looking directly at the stars.</p> <p>Juliet Forster\u2019s production is nimble in a small space, and not doggedly literal. Rhys Jarman has designed a metal scaffolding over which creatures \u2013 the energy in the Machine \u2013 swarm in sackcloth-coloured onesies. Maria Gray and Gareth Aled swing and clamber together, sometimes upside down. They speak the automated messages of the Machine\u2019s repair system. First in a smooth monotone. Later, they falter, stammering over each other in a dextrous display of synchronous failure, like snarled cassette tapes. The action, chilly rather than truly fearful, is expanded by the soundscape created by John Foxx and Benge. First routinely soothing notes, then a rough wall of noise. Finally a burst of choric, almost sacred music, as humans enter a non-mechanical universe.</p> <p>The Theatre Royal gleamingly reopened last month after redevelopment. In the manner of today\u2019s stages, it now lures audiences towards drama with everyday theatre: a cafe, visible to passersby. A cultural machine with a friendly face.</p> <p>\u2022 <a href=\"https://www.yorktheatreroyal.co.uk/event/the_machine_stops.php#.Vz8DfDYrKrM\">The Machine Stops is at York Theatre Royal until 4 June.

His first album in six years finds him trying hard to relocate <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/verve\" title=\"\">the Verve</a>\u2019s sense of symphonic grandiosity (to that end he has been reunited with <em>Urban Hymns</em> co-producer Chris Potter and strings arranger Wil Malone), but ultimately falling short. With the exception of the poignant and understated <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH4YnMuFvWE\" title=\"\">Black Lines</a>, Ashcroft\u2019s material is uninspired, drowned beneath bloated production and hardly enlivened by his customary broadbrush lyrics about standing alone against ill-defined adversaries, with the added bonus of a blizzard of clunking weather metaphors. Although to his credit the couplet \u201cCouldn\u2019t be life without the melody/ A soixante-neuf without the \u00e9rotique\u201d does leap out for not sounding as if it\u2019s been lifted straight from \u201cChicken Soup for the Misunderstood and Solitary Middle-Aged Man\u201d. It doesn\u2019t help that every song is needlessly drawn out. Indeed, by its close the repeated refrain of \u201cI think I\u2019ve told you before\u201d on They Don\u2019t Own Me sounds like the most otiose six-word phrase in the history of language.</p>",

But if a more orchestral take on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/elliottsmith\" title=\"\">Elliott Smith</a> appeals, Canadian troubadour <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/18/new-band-of-the-week-andy-shauf\" title=\"\">Andy Shauf</a> is a find. A singer-songwriter with a Beatles hang-up and a voice like sodden velvet, Shauf is on his second properly available album. <em>The Party </em>isn\u2019t a concept album so much as a set of closely observed tracks linked by intersecting characters where Shauf replaces Smith\u2019s more misanthropic tendencies with compassion and wry understatement. On the more indie-leaning Quite Like You, Shauf\u2019s narrator makes a clumsy play for his best friend\u2019s on-off girlfriend. Partygoers collapse or embarrass themselves; strings, clarinets and lush <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2000/sep/13/artsfeatures1\" title=\"\">Harry Nilsson</a>-style moments all add to the snapshot of an accomplished new voice.</p>",

This messy sequel (technically still a prequel) goes back further to ancient Egypt, where a proto uber-mutant\u2019s <em>Temple of Doom-</em>style-meets-<em>Stargate</em> regeneration is stalled, only to resume in 1983. With Raven/Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) hiding her true-blue colours in East Berlin and Erik/Magneto (Michael Fassbender) passing as a production-line worker in Poland, new recruits continue to gather at Xavier\u2019s School for Gifted Youngsters. But when sunlight awakens Oscar Isaac\u2019s En Sabah Nur (aka Apocalypse), it\u2019s time for forces old and new to pull together once again. Suffering from the same bewildering superfluity of colourful characters that beset the superior <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/01/captain-america-civil-war-review-superpowered-bust-ups\" title=\"\"><em>Captain America: Civil War</em></a>, this nevertheless has fun with its 1980s setting, visually riffing on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/the-breakfast-club\" title=\"\"><em>The Breakfast Club</em></a>, <em>Teen Wolf</em>, <em>Risky Business</em>, Terry Gilliam\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2010/oct/21/brazil-gilliam-fantasy\" title=\"\"><em>Brazil</em></a>, Michael Jackson\u2019s Thriller video, Schwarzenegger\u2019s red-eyed sunglasses and more. Fassbender and James McAvoy bring their now familiar clipped theatrical tones to the party, while Isaac looks like a cross between Predator and Peter Boyle in <em>Young Frankenstein</em>, growling like Brando in <em>Apocalypse Now</em> about the decadent state of mankind (\u201cwelcome to the 80s!\u201d). Self-referential jokes about <em>Return of the Jedi </em>being a let-down (\u201cthe third one is always the worst\u201d) poke gently at the edges of colliding franchise universes, while some slashy/stabby bloodletting tests the boundaries of the obligatory 12A certificate far more than all the weightless gargantuan destruction.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/may/18/x-men-apocalypse-oscar-isaac-marvel\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4j7xv\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2504871\"            data-video-name=\"'It's nice for the ego': Oscar Isaac on X-Men: Apocalypse\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5735ce2ee4b01f9e6c2546c6\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/18/160513XMenJunket2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/18/160513XMenJunket2_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/18/160513XMenJunket2_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/18/160513XMenJunket2_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/18/160513XMenJunket2.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/may/18/x-men-apocalypse-oscar-isaac-marvel\">\u2018It\u2019s nice for the ego\u2019: Oscar Isaac on X-Men: Apocalypse</a></figcaption> </figure>",

Animation and Super 8 footage lend personal texture to the documentary\u2019s dreamy, healing fragments, with Anderson\u2019s soothing narration providing poetic perspective on childhood trauma, the nature of storytelling, the transience of life and the release of love. Watching a small dog picking out accidental tunes on an electronic keyboard is a squealy delight, but it\u2019s the haunting recognition that (as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/david-foster-wallace\" title=\"\">David Foster Wallace</a> wrote) \u201cevery love story is a ghost story\u201d that strikes the most affecting chord. Kierkegaard, Wittgenstein and 9/11 are all thrown into the mix with a lightness of touch at once ephemeral and profound.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v37BnyHefnY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/v37BnyHefnY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v37BnyHefnY\">Watch a trailer for Heart of a Dog.</a></figcaption> </figure>",

      "body": "<p>When Monica Demeterova completed her early years childminding course last December local parents were swift to sign up to her services and she looked forward to launching her own business. Five months on she is scraping a living doing agency work at a warehouse while the children on her books have found provision elsewhere. The reason is that she has been waiting 150 days for the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/disclosure-barring-service-check/contact-disclosure-and-barring-service\">Disclosure and Barring Service</a> (DBS) certificate required by law for anyone working with children and vulnerable adults.</p> <p>The DBS, which replaced the Criminal Record Bureau in 2012, checks the background and suitability of individuals. As a former nanny and nursery employee, 31-year-old Demeterova already has the necessary paperwork, but since she will be running her business from her home, her husband Michal also needs to be assessed, and his application, submitted last December, is one of tens of thousands stuck in a bureaucratic log-jam.</p> <p>\u201cFinancially it\u2019s ruining my family\u2019s life,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s always been my dream to run my own business, and last year we\u2019d saved enough for a deposit on a house to run it from, and I was approved for a \u00a3500 government start-up loan which I hoped would cover my training. I\u2019ve now lost that money because you must have started your business within six months of the loan being agreed.\u201d</p> <p>Demeterova is one of thousands of would-be workers unable to take up a new job because of the DBS backlog, which reached an unprecedented peak this spring. The NHS and schools are among those who are prevented from hiring staff because of the weeks of waiting for the required disclosures, and this month a former Home Office junior minister described as \u201cscandalous\u201d the news that childminders are unable to run their businesses because of the delays. Meg Hillier, Labour MP for Hackney South and Shoreditch, has raised the issue with the Home Office and blames \u201ca basic lack of police resources\u201d for the problem.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"53e52fe51e4f4e6ea0ee900b87057a51e1bd5f56\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/53e52fe51e4f4e6ea0ee900b87057a51e1bd5f56/60_133_4942_2966/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Meg Hillier\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Meg Hillier blames delays on a lack of police resources.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonathan Goldberg/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The lengthy wait for the certificate is undermining the government\u2019s commitment to double the provision of free childcare, according to the <a href=\"https://www.pacey.org.uk/\">Professional Association for Childcare and Early Years</a>. \u201cPrimarily, DBS delays prevent a childminder from operating, and at worst it could potentially delay the growth of the sector,\u201d says chief executive Liz Bayram.</p> <p>Demeretova says her neighbour was the first to sign up for her services because his children\u2019s school had closed its after-school club. \u201cBecause of the delays in DBS checks they didn\u2019t have enough qualified staff or volunteers to continue it,\u201d she says.</p> <p>The majority of DBS applications are stuck with police forces who examine the records of those seeking to work in a range of sectors \u2013 among them education, healthcare, social services and private hire transport. Seventeen out of 45 forces are missing the government target of completing 85% of applications within 14 days, according to Home Office data. Nearly half the checks lodged with the worst performing forces, Dorset and London\u2019s Metropolitan Police, are still ongoing after 61 days, leaving an estimated 150,000 jobseekers in limbo.</p> <p>Anyone calling the DBS helpline to check progress is now informed by an automated message that they can expect to wait up to 18 weeks for their application to clear.</p> <p>When more than one police force is involved in a check, the delays can be even longer. The Met, which handles 12% of applications nationally and which is struggling to clear a backlog of 80,000 cases, blames a sharp increase in applications over the past two years and difficulty in recruiting and retaining the staff required to process them. It has hired extra staff and temporarily moved 58 non-frontline or retired officers to assist.</p> <p>\u201cIt is anticipated that we are at the peak of the backlog of outstanding cases, but we can\u2019t take any short cuts,\u201d says a spokesperson for the force. \u201cIt\u2019s not simple administrative work. Staff are making decisions about the disclosure of information that may involve a number of different police forces and, because these decisions directly impact children and vulnerable adults, staff require significant specialist training and supervision.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It is not simple administrative work. Staff require significant training and supervision</p> <footer> <cite>Met Police spokesperson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Applicants are only entitled to lodge a complaint if they have waited more than 60 days, and even then, the DBS warns, their case may not be escalated because of the congested system. It admits that in March this year 11,804 applications lodged with the Met had been in progress for longer than 130 days.</p> <p>Moreover, if the police have to send an application back to the DBS with a query the clock returns to zero and the 60 days start again. Many of those waiting are forced to live off state benefits or personal savings in the interim.</p> <p>Adam Wilkins of Birmingham had a job offer as a coach driver withdrawn after his enhanced DBS check was still ongoing after 69 days. Within a month he secured a contract as a hospital phlebotomist, but a new DBS application had to be submitted and, 30 days on, is still parked with the Met.</p> <p>Wilkins, who had applied for both jobs after being made redundant, has been forced to live on \u00a3114-a-week jobseeker\u2019s allowance since December because of the bureaucracy that prevents him drawing his \u00a3400 a week hospital salary. \u201cI\u2019ve worked all my life and I don\u2019t want to be on benefits,\u201d he says. When <em>the Observer</em> raises his plight with the Met a senior manager is assigned to his case and within four days his original December application is completed. As it covers working with children the certificate is valid for his healthcare job.</p> <p>The DBS says that although it has a service level agreement with police forces to complete 100% of checks within 60 days, it is powerless to speed up the process. \u201cWe are reliant on the police to carry out their checks within agreed timescales; failure to do so impacts on our ability to achieve our targets,\u201d says a spokesperson for the DBS, which processes 4m checks a year. \u201cThe delay in processing DBS checks by the Metropolitan Police is of great concern to us and our customers. They have informed us that their recovery plan includes recruiting, training and transferring additional staff and we are monitoring this situation closely.\u201d</p> <p>The problem is also affecting service providers who are already struggling to recruit staff. Care homes report that they are having to rely on expensive agency workers while they await DBS checks for new recruits, and many are suffering from financial loss as a result, according to the Care Home Association.</p> <p>Meanwhile, many teachers\u2019 applications submitted last June were not ready before the school year began in September. One primary school in north London said that 10% of its staff are unable to fulfil their roles because of the delays.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We had to wait four months for one check. There\u2019s already a teacher shortage \u2026 this is a headache we could do without</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cUnder official guidelines you can do a risk assessment based on the DBS from someone\u2019s previous job, but they have to be supervised at all times,\u201d says the headteacher who asked to remain anonymous. \u201cIn one case we had to wait four months for a check to come through. There\u2019s already a teacher shortage in London so this is a headache we could do without.\u201d</p> <p>The Royal College of Nursing also says the issue is having an impact on the NHS at a time when there is a shortage of nurses. \u201cIt is causing severe disruptions for individuals and great concern to us,\u201d says Roz Hooper, principal legal officer. \u201cRecently our advice line has taken a call from someone who had her job offer withdrawn because her disclosure hadn\u2019t come through in time, and someone else who has had to delay her university course and possibly lose her bursary and her place.\u201d</p> <p>Demeterova, meanwhile, estimates that the delays have so far cost her up to \u00a37,000. She can\u2019t find a stop-gap job that pays enough to fund childcare for her two young children or with hours to fit in with her husband\u2019s shift work.</p> <p>Instead of earning \u00a3500 a week caring for the eight children who had signed up for her services, she is reliant on whatever warehouse shifts are available. On a good week that earns her \u00a3300, but for times when cover is not required she receives nothing.</p> <p>\u201cMy husband\u2019s salary goes on the mortgage and bills, and mine was to be used for living expenses,\u201d she says. \u201cWe had planned to buy a new car and go on a holiday, but now I\u2019m just happy if I can afford to do the weekly shop. When I call for an update no one can give me any information. Sometimes I feel there\u2019s no point going on. I have hit rock bottom.\u201d</p> <h2>HOW THE SERVICE WORKS</h2> <p>The Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) replaced the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB), which was established after the murder of schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman. Anyone working with vulnerable people had to be checked for a criminal record, and 2012 figures revealed the checks had prevented more than 130,000 unsuitable people, including rapists and paedophiles, from working with at-risk groups. But the CRB was beset by long waiting times and cumbersome bureaucracy, and in December 2012 the coalition government replaced it under the Protection of Freedoms Act.</p> <p>The DBS was supposed to speed up the process by introducing an update service which, for an annual fee, enables people to reuse their certificate when applying for similar jobs, subject to an instant online check by their employer. This confirms if the certificate is up to date, whereas the old CRB had to be started from scratch each time an update was required. The new system also exempts under-16s from checks.</p> <p>However, the DBS requires other rigorous checks which might involve more than one police force depending on where the applicant has lived and worked. There are three types of check: a standard check required, for example, for court, prison or security officers; an enhanced check for anyone working with children or in social or healthcare services; and an enhanced check with barred list check for adoptive parents or taxi drivers.</p> <p>While companies can employ those whose checks have not been completed, it\u2019s at their own risk and the individuals in question have to be supervised at all times.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Up to 50 million people in Africa will need food by Christmas as a crisis across the continent triggered by El Ni\u00f1o worsens, the UN and major international charities have warned.</p> <p>A second year of deep drought in much of southern and eastern Africa has ravaged crops, disrupted water supplies and driven up food prices, leaving 31 million people needing food now, and 20 million more likely to run out this year.</p> <p>A further 10 million people in Ethiopia, six million in southern Sudan and five million in Yemen were in danger of starvation after floods and drought, said the UN.</p> <p>The severest El Ni\u00f1o in 30 years was expected to tail off in the next month as hot equatorial waters in the Pacific returned to normal temperatures, but its effects would be felt for many more months, said the World Food Programme. Stephen O\u2019Brien, the UN\u2019s humanitarian chief, said: \u201cThe collective impact of the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon has created one of the world\u2019s biggest disasters for millions of people, yet this crisis is receiving little attention.</p> <p>\u201cThe numbers are staggering. One million children in eastern and southern Africa alone are severely acutely malnourished, and across southern Africa 32 million people need assistance and that figure is likely to increase.\u201d The UN predicts that food will start running out on a large scale by July, with the crisis peaking between December and next April.</p> <p>Malawi, Mozambique, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Madagascar, Angola and Swaziland have declared national emergencies or disasters, as have seven of South Africa\u2019s nine provinces. Botswana, Kenya, Somalia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have also been badly hit.</p> <p>In Zimbabwe, President Robert Mugabe has appealed for foreign aid to buy food and Malawi is expected to declare in the next few weeks that more than 8 million people, half the population, will need food aid by November. Maize prices have risen by 60% across much of the region within a few months.</p> <p>Seven million people in Syria, 10 million in Ethiopia and 14 million in Yemen also needed food urgently, said the UN. Elhadj As Sy, secretary-general of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, pledged $110m after visiting Malawi and Zimbabwe last week. \u201cWe cannot describe enough how dire the situation is,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Abdoulaye Balde, the World Food Programme country director in Mozambique\u2019s capital, Maputo, said: \u201cThe situation is critical. We are at the point of no return.\u201d</p> <p>Fears are mounting that international donors, meeting at this week\u2019s UN humanitarian summit in Istanbul, will not pledge enough in time to buy and deliver food. Their fear is that the Syrian civil war and refugee crises are putting an unprecedented strain on aid. African leaders have requested more than $1.5bn, but less than 25% has been pledged.</p> <p>\u201cThe window for responding in a meaningful manner is closing rapidly,\u201d said Shadrack Omol, senior adviser to the UN\u2019s children fund, Unicef. \u201cThe concern is that slow-onset emergencies, such as the one we are dealing with in southern Africa, do not get enough attention because they creep up on us.\u201d</p> <p>Since July 2015, Britain has contributed about \u00a3150m for aid to El Ni\u00f1o-affected countries in Africa, including Malawi, Ethiopia, Kenya Mozambique, Somalia and Uganda. The international development minister, Nick Hurd, said: \u201cWe cannot and will not stand idly by while millions suffer. Britain is playing a leading role in helping countries across Africa to cope with the impact of El Ni\u00f1o. Support for people affected by El Ni\u00f1o is important to Africa and also firmly in Britain\u2019s national interest.\u201d</p>",

It\u2019s quite a while since I\u2019ve done this listening between 6.30 and 7pm, I must say.</p> <p>There\u2019s not much at all to <em>Heresy </em>\u2013 it\u2019s just a series of received opinions unpicked by witty people in front of a live audience \u2013 but, somehow, this week\u2019s episode really worked. This was a lot to do with host Victoria Coren Mitchell, who delivers her tinder-dry lines with just the right amount of nonchalance. She\u2019s sharp without being nasty or egomaniacal: at certain points in this episode, she formed a sort of comedy alliance with guest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2014/jun/08/katy-brand-comedian-actor-writer-brenda-monk-funny\">Katy Brand</a>, also on great form. Lloyd Langford, a standup, was excellent, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/grayson-perry\">Grayson Perry</a> as hilarious as ever. The person who made me laugh the most, however, was a member of the audience during a discussion about whether anyone would want to own a picture painted by Hitler. I\u2019m not going to spoil his deadpan punchline, but, listeners, I laughed. I honestly did.</p> <p>Next thing, I\u2019ll start liking Radio 2 documentaries\u2026 Or maybe not. I do find them irritating. They have great content, but the style, editing and scripts drive me doolally. Too often they come across as documentaries for simpletons, and Radio 2 listeners aren\u2019t stupid.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a33768e1b3db5fff65da4e99b3ac95565f979634\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a33768e1b3db5fff65da4e99b3ac95565f979634/0_119_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The voice of Bolsover: Dennis Skinner MP, discovering the power of a good singalong.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The voice of Bolsover: Dennis Skinner MP, discovering the power of a good singalong.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The station has been running a series of programmes about mental health, and the final one featured MP <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/dennis-skinner\">Dennis Skinner</a>. (How long do you think it was before he was referred to as the Beast of Bolsover? One second. Arrggggghhhh.) Skinner was the subject of a documentary called <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07b2pnh\"><strong>Dennis Skinner vs Dementia</strong></a>. You wouldn\u2019t have known this for the first 10 minutes, though: Jeremy Vine was presenting, and on and on he blathered, explaining everything, from who Skinner is, to what Skinner appeared to be feeling when Vine was interviewing him. I don\u2019t blame Vine \u2013 he\u2019s only doing what his producer suggests \u2013 but we really could have done with a lot less of him up front.</p> <p>The programme only got going when we were allowed to hear Skinner speak. Vine interviewed him very well, and we heard a lot about his early life and family. The point of the programme was to explain that Skinner believes singing really helps older people with dementia. He discovered this after his mother and then his sister got the disease. Neither could recognise their relatives or really communicate, and yet when he sang old songs to them, they brightened and joined in quite happily. Now Skinner makes a point of visiting old people\u2019s homes to have a good old singalong.</p> <p>He sang the songs for us, too, in a beautiful voice. \u201cI often think what would have happened if I were born in the middle of a city and I could have gone to drama class,\u201d he said, without bitterness. Skinner was a gem, shining bright amid the cliches and over-explanation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fc230760b72b62401f6ce08954596fd82fd3fb36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fc230760b72b62401f6ce08954596fd82fd3fb36/5_0_1190_714/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Karina Longworth, creator and presenter of the \u2018exemplary\u2019 movie podcast You Must Remember This.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Karina Longworth, creator and presenter of the \u2018exemplary\u2019 movie podcast You Must Remember This.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/serial\"><em>Serial\u2019s</em></a><em> </em>second season ended a few weeks ago now (did anyone notice?), but its format, of a single event explored over a few episodes, has taken root in other podcasts. <a href=\"http://www.youmustrememberthispodcast.com/episodes/\"><strong>You Must Remember This</strong></a>, the exemplary film podcast made and presented by Karina Longworth, has a couple of series within its overall series, and I must recommend the 12-episode exploration of the Manson murders. This came out last year, but a few friends have been talking about it, and I offer it to you, with caveats (Manson is a lot nastier than you think). And if you\u2019re into that kind of thing, then longstanding horror story show <a href=\"http://www.thenosleeppodcast.com/\"><strong>The No Sleep Podcast</strong></a>, is a good one too. It has also been experimenting with the developing storyline recently, to some fans\u2019 chagrin.

When, for instance, more than 250,000 Leicester City supporters fill Victoria Park for a triumphant celebration of their Thai-owned football team, starring, inter alia, a Danish goalkeeper (Kasper Schmeichel), an Austrian full-back, Jamaican and German centre-backs, a French midfielder and an Algerian winger.</p> <p>And what of Leicester \u2013 my home town \u2013 itself? It\u2019s Britain\u2019s most diverse city: only 45% described themselves as white British at the last census. Try 33% Christian, 18.6% Muslim and 15.2% Hindu. Mix in football fans from the West Indies and 5% from eastern Europe and what have you got? A melting pot that works. One cheery story on top of another.</p> <p>But did the Brexit tabloids pause to connect one thing with another? Did <em>Newsnight</em> camp in Victoria Park rather than Boston, Lincs? <em>Channel 4 News</em> managed a perfectly civil debate between Leave and Remain migrant audiences from De Montfort University without one genuflection to the story all Leicester \u2013 as a community \u2013 was talking about. No, we like our fairy tales on the pitch and on the back pages. Don\u2019t ruin the plot by lifting eyes and looking around.</p>",

But it can have sat on no head more preposterously fascinating, of course, than that of Richard III, via Shakespeare\u2019s depiction of whom the BBC last night drew a solid line beneath its latest triumph.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Here was thrilling and unpatronising Shakespeare acted in blazing fashion for the BBC</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Whether the real Richard was in any way the nefarious child-killer, \u201chell\u2019s black intelligencer\u201d illustrated, or in fact a sagacious instigator of far-reaching beneficial reforms, are ponderables to be argued over by both real historians and those keen amateurs, such as members of the \u201cfellowship of the white boar\u201d, whose wives might wish they got out a little more. What <em>is</em> known is that Mr Shakespeare didn\u2019t necessarily like the facts to get in the way of a damned good story \u2013 actively resented them, in fact \u2013 and so he gives us a tale not even of a good man gone bad, but of a bad man bad from the start. Who else would widow so many, or orphan so many, or set kin against kin for so long, out of simple <em>boredom</em>?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"eee931232e595fbb4fc599352fe8f72704f7fd76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eee931232e595fbb4fc599352fe8f72704f7fd76/0_0_2856_4284/667.jpg\" alt=\"Sophie Okonedo as Queen Margaret \u2018stole every scene she was in\u2019.\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sophie Okonedo as Queen Margaret \u2018stole every scene she was in\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Carnival Film &amp; Television Ltd/Robert Viglasky</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But from the very outset, the winter of our discontent stuff, it was clear that a magnificently caustic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/benedict-cumberbatch\">Benedict Cumberbatch</a> was determined to spit quicklime in the face of a quiet life \u2013 \u201cI hate the idle pleasures of these days\u2026 this weak piping time of peace\u201d, instead being determined \u201cto prove a villain\u201d. And Ben, I have to say, makes a terrific villain. His <em>jolie laide</em> features ranging from porcine to insufferably pious, sometimes segueing, rather shockingly, to instant murderous whimsy, it became fast clear he isn\u2019t going for the sympathy vote: no woebegone foot-dragging, hunching shrinkback he, but a proud, silver-tongued schemer.</p> <p>Even when he was sweet-talking the wronged widows into falling for his machinations, he had to gloat to the audience \u2013 gasping incredulous not at his own clevernesses, but at their stupidity (\u201crelenting fool, and shallow, changing woman\u201d) \u2013 because, by this stage in his galloping villainry, he <em>just can\u2019t help himself</em>. Witty, too, and the peerless scene in which he\u2019s \u201cpersuaded\u201d into kingship \u2013 \u201csince you <em>will</em> buckle fortune on my back\u201d \u2013 had echoes even of <em>Sherlock</em>, in its managing simultaneously to patronise and wheedle. Whether tapping up an angry thunder with his rings on the chessboard, or haughty in the saddle, he\u2019s all man.</p> <p>The crux (for Cumberbatch; not for all actorly Richards) came not at the battle but just before. We realise that we might have forgiven him, once, even pitied him once, but he was too far gone in badness, to the extent that he refused, now, to blame even circumstance. \u201cI shall despair. There is no creature loves me; and if I die, no soul shall pity me. Nay, wherefore should they, since that I myself/Find in myself no pity to myself?\u201d This was perhaps his finest solo scene, and chilling to behold. A little earlier, though, there was a scene to run it close, when he was confronted in the woods by no less daunting a triumvirate than <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/oct/14/judi-dench-interview-skyfall\">Judi Dench</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/aug/25/keeley-hawes-interview-barking-essex\">Keeley Hawes</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/sophie-okonedo\">Sophie Okonedo</a>, who stole every scene she was in and a good few she wasn\u2019t.</p> <p>Ben Powers\u2019s adaptation, Dan Jones\u2019s music \u2013 each in its own way sublime, and yet the acting was still the thing. Seeing these three soaring talents in the forest, and none of them exactly born close to a silver spoon, was, for republicans such as I, our Queen\u2019s 90th come about a month late: here, we could finally say, here in thrilling and unpatronising Shakespeare acted in blazing fashion for the BBC, broadcast to the world, nobody does it better.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"052a37321a4acd7f42ddbea7c061c4e0a670273a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/052a37321a4acd7f42ddbea7c061c4e0a670273a/0_0_4300_2870/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barbara Windsor as Peggy Mitchell bows out of EastEnders \u2018with just the right mix of bling, bish-bosh and heartache\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barbara Windsor as Peggy Mitchell bows out of EastEnders \u2018with just the right mix of bling, bish-bosh and heartache\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kieron McCarron/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Apparently the Samaritans have praised the handling of the death of Peggy Mitchell in last week\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006m86d\"><strong>EastEnders</strong></a>, for its awareness of sensitivities surrounding suicide. Rightly so: in the hands of writer Sarah Phelps an immensely subtle job was achieved, with just the right mix of bling, bish-bosh and heartache. A crucially nice touch to get the ghost of Pat in at the close, a joy, in fact, to see her again: and even though I\u2019m no fan of Barbara Windsor, possibly because I\u2019m such an overweening snob, it was touching to slowly imagine, through her eyes, the many memories in every pub corner, of every snatch of love and of anger. And I\u2019ll phrase this carefully, for he\u2019s a big lad, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2016/mar/22/ross-kemp-britain-danger-tourism\">Ross Kemp</a> demonstrated that, despite long years away presenting to camera, the level of acting talent he habitually brought to the character of Grant Mitchell remains refreshingly unchanged.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"132370de6e54c119859e6b1b3935acbe017013a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/132370de6e54c119859e6b1b3935acbe017013a6/0_40_2835_1701/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Mimsy\u2019: Maggie Civantos as Macarena in Locked Up\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Mimsy\u2019: Maggie Civantos as Macarena in Locked Up.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Global Series Network/Channel 4</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/locked-up\"><strong>Locked Up</strong></a> is the thunderously unimaginative title (under this thinking, the <em>Hollow Crown</em> series would have been known as Murdery Plantagenets) for a fine new Spanish soft-porn thriller set in a women\u2019s prison. Inevitable comparisons will be drawn with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/orange-is-the-new-black\"><em>Orange Is the New Black</em></a>, but in fact it has much less slice-of-life black humour and more tooth-sucking plot. That\u2019s not to say it\u2019s without humour, just that most of it arrives unintentionally, via the subtitling or the clunking symbolism (really? A canary being freed, all blithe and free, from a cage? And all the prison\u2026 ladies\u2026 are wearing DayGlo-lemon?). Despite unpromising beginnings, it\u2019s still rather well acted by all but the star, the infuriatingly mimsy newbie, Macarena. But even she shows promise, if only of narrative arc to come, and the plot \u2013 a sim card poked deep into a prison allotment \u2013 has already led to one murder, steamy for all the wrong reasons, and all I really want to say is that orange is the new black is not the only fruit.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03v1q8h\"><strong>Love, Nina</strong></a> arrived with such an impeccable pedigree \u2013 a runaway bestseller from a couple of years back, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/helena-bonham-carter\">Helena Bonham Carter</a> and Jason Watkins, adaptation by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/nickhornby\">Nick Hornby</a> \u2013 it was hard not to hug oneself, nay swoon, at the sheer <em>niceness</em> of its cosy take on 80s London literary life, as far from <em>\u2019Stenders</em> as Primrose Hill is from Walford.

Which is to say: I watched it, but an hour later couldn\u2019t for the life of me remember having done so. Ah, yes. Bonham Carter got a couple of sharp lines as the bright, scatty, effortlessly cool literary lioness; and the kids were great. But the wonderful Jason Watkins, despite an unimpeachable Scottish accent, is made to come across as a self-regarding boor. I know he\u2019s meant to be an amalgam, but I don\u2019t think any favours are done to Bennett, nor (especially) to Watkins. I have great trust it will improve. But this opener\u2019s humour revolved chiefly around canned vegetables versus fresh: possibly <em>the</em> chief talking point in that place, that time, so A-plus for verisimilitude, but, um, dare I say\u2026 still not <em>that</em> funny.</p>",

      "body": "<p>There are bigger films than <strong>Victoria </strong>(Curzon, 15), out on DVD tomorrow, but none that can quite match it for grand, gutsy vision. You may have heard by now that Sebastian Schipper\u2019s heart-speeding heist thriller was shot in one continuous take \u2013 one prodigiously athletic 130-minute take, that is, racing through more than 20 locations in downtown Berlin without a single cut or digital join. This is true, and altogether belief-defying: no film in recent years has inspired astonishment at such a fundamental, how-did-they-do-that? level.</p> <p>But what\u2019s most extraordinary about <em>Victoria</em> is that the trick isn\u2019t what you\u2019re thinking about as you watch it. Rather, it\u2019s the desperate, double-quick romance that blooms over two hours between a winsome Spanish waitress (Laia Costa) and the German charmer (Frederick Lau) who draws her into a wild robbery scheme. It\u2019s the high-wire, high-stakes love story between wholly believable people in wholly insane circumstances that grips your heart while you\u2019re on the run; it\u2019s only when this technically miraculous but very human stunt comes to a stop that you realise how long you\u2019ve been running.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"951dad2d28885db00679d608c02d0639cc97f1e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/951dad2d28885db00679d608c02d0639cc97f1e1/0_209_3344_2007/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Impassioned\u2019: Mark Ruffalo in Spotlight.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Impassioned\u2019: Mark Ruffalo in Spotlight.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: LMK</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/feb/29/how-did-spotlight-beat-the-revenant-to-the-biggest-oscar-win-of-all\">welcome surprise winner</a> of this year\u2019s best picture Oscar, <strong>Spotlight </strong>(eOne, 15) is a film approximately as stock-still as <em>Victoria</em> is kinetic, yet it rivets in its own unassumingly rigorous way. Tom McCarthy\u2019s tightly wound true-life thriller was unsurprisingly hailed by critics as a paean to journalism \u2013 and certainly, its methodical examination of the<em> Boston Globe</em> crack team that uncovered a systemic history of child abuse in the city\u2019s Catholic church makes the profession look good. But it\u2019s something more special than that: a procedural drama that champions general human decency above all other objectives, and celebrates the unfashionable virtues of listening. Appropriately enough, then, its superbly integrated ensemble players do some of their best work in wordless response to one another; when <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/mark-ruffalo\">Mark Ruffalo</a>, as star reporter Michael Rezendes, finally gets an impassioned rant in, it feels hard earned.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vgqG3ITMv1Q\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/vgqG3ITMv1Q?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://youtu.be/vgqG3ITMv1Q\">Watch the trailer for The Big Short.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>By contrast, virtually no one in <strong>The Big Short</strong> (Paramount, 15) \u2013 thankfully, one of the films <em>Spotlight</em> beat to the Oscar \u2013 is able to shut up for a nanosecond. Adam McKay\u2019s anarchic, semi-comic breakdown of the real estate-driven US financial crisis of 2007 is a caffeinated, cacophonous beast, darting frantically between the overlapped dialogues of assorted bankers, brokers and victims of the crash as it seeks to stridently assign blame. Essentially a feature film influenced by the short-form bittiness of YouTube, it\u2019s ambitious and obnoxious in equal measure, tilting more towards the latter when McKay, over-enamoured of his role as Irreverent Explainer of Big Things, cuts away to Selena Gomez and a bubble-bathing Margot Robbie to simplify dense financial theory for us drooling yokels.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSoXoOAY1zU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/YSoXoOAY1zU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://youtu.be/YSoXoOAY1zU\">Watch the trailer for The Assassin.</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>After all that fevered hyperactivity, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jan/18/hou-hsiao-hsein-the-assassin\">Hou Hsiao-hsien</a>\u2019s swooning martial arts romance <strong>The Assassin</strong> (Studiocanal, 12) is something of a deep, Margot Robbie-free bubble bath in itself. The imagery magicked up here by Hou and genius cinematographer Ping Bin Lee is so ravishing, sometimes recalling the saturated colour processes of Jack Cardiff, that one risks wallowing in it at the expense of tracing its arcane, intricate narrative of braided revenge and mercy. It locked together for me on a second viewing, though the first was still a rush. Hou\u2019s sensory storytelling is richly specific to engender feeling even when the details are lost in the glow.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiPLfwi2Uqo\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/FiPLfwi2Uqo?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://youtu.be/FiPLfwi2Uqo\">Watch the trailer for Mavis!</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>The unseemly waxen beauty of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/zac-efron\">Zac Efron,</a> meanwhile, does its best to make sense of \u2013 or at least to locate purpose in \u2013 <strong>Dirty Grandpa </strong>(Lionsgate, 15), but to no avail. This wheezing, crotch-scratching comedy squanders the comic potential that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/07/dvds-and-downloads-bad-neighbours-concussion-sopranos-blue-ruin\"><em>Bad Neighbours</em> </a>tapped in Efron\u2019s dude-bro exterior by casting him as the straight man to a grimly gurning <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/robertdeniro\">Robert De Niro</a>, about whose character the title pre-empts every gag you might care to predict.

Conventionally but exactingly constructed, with killer performance footage and on-screen tributes from the likes of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/bobdylan\">Bob Dylan</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/prince\">Prince</a>, it\u2019s a portrait vibrant and persuasive enough to shake up even those with the most atheistic musical preferences.</p> <p>Finally, <a href=\"https://mubi.com/films/eat-your-bones\">Mubi.com</a> uncovers an exciting, never released curio from Cannes 2014 in Jean-Charles Hue\u2019s <strong>Eat Your Bones</strong>. Already unusual in its choice of social focus \u2013 the Yeniche Gypsy community of northern France \u2013 the film follows a ragged, reckless group of brothers over a one-night joyride in which the youngest must choose between church and crime. It\u2019s an age-old good versus evil premise, given tang and tension by the vivid, antsy milieu and Hue\u2019s hard-driving technique \u2013 and a pretty good companion piece to <em>Victoria</em>, if you fancy two fast, dark nights of the soul in a single sitting.</p>",

But this year the rains never came and, for a second year running, the family grain store is empty. If they manage their savings carefully and eat just one small meal a day, they may just have enough food for two more months.</p> <p>By August, said Irish charity <a href=\"https://www.concern.net/en/\" title=\"\">Concern Worldwide</a>, they and tens of thousands of other small farmers in southern Malawi will have completely run out of food, with no prospect of another harvest for at least seven months. With nothing to sell and no chance of earning money, Witimani, Matafle and family will starve.</p> <p>\u201cI am worried the children will starve to death. I don\u2019t know what to do,\u201d said Matafle.</p> <p>\u201cWe need food. We are in a desperate situation,\u201d her husband added.</p> <p>Countries are just waking up to the most serious global food crisis of the last 25 years. Caused by the strongest <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/feb/17/el-nino-leaves-100-million-people-hungry-short-of-water-droughts-floods-worldwide\" title=\"\">El Ni\u00f1o weather event</a> since 1982, droughts and heatwaves have ravaged much of India, Latin America and parts of south-east Asia. But the worst effects of this natural phenomenon, which begins with waters warming in the equatorial Pacific, are to be found in southern Africa. A second consecutive year without rain now threatens catastrophe for some of the poorest people in the world.</p> <p>The scale of the crisis unfolding in 10 or more southern African countries has shocked the United Nations. Lulled into thinking that Ethiopia in 1985 was the last of the large-scale famines affecting many millions, donor countries have been slow to pledge funds or support. More than $650m and 7.9m tonnes of food are needed immediately, says the UN. By Christmas, the situation will have become severe.</p> <p>Malawi, Mozambique, Lesotho, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Madagascar, Angola and Swaziland have already declared national emergencies or disasters, as have seven of South Africa\u2019s nine provinces. Other countries, including Botswana and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, have also been badly hit. President Robert Mugabe has appealed for $1.5bn to buy food for Zimbabwe and Malawi is expected to declare that more than 8 million people, or half the country, will need food aid by November.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"5aa7c6c56047e3d8f368d6f13e6917f7d669bd0e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5aa7c6c56047e3d8f368d6f13e6917f7d669bd0e/0_869_4000_5000/800.jpg\" alt=\"Serena Gadinala\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Serena Gadinala, from the in Neno district of Malawi, has tried different planting techniques but nothing worked and her crops continue to wilt.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tamara van Vliet/OCHA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>More than 31 million people in the region are said by the UN to need food now, but this number is expected to rise to at least 49 million across almost all of southern Africa by Christmas. With 12 million more hungry people in Ethiopia, 7 million in Yemen, 6 million in Southern Sudan and more in the Central African Republic and Chad, a continent-scale food crisis is unfolding.</p> <p>\u201cFood security across southern Africa will start deteriorating by July, reaching its peak between December 2016 and April 2017,\u201d says the UN\u2019s office for humanitarian affairs. The regional cereal deficit already stands at 7.9m tonnes and continues to put upward pressure on market prices, which are already showing unprecedented increases, diminishing purchasing power and thereby reducing food access. As food insecurity tightens and water scarcity increases due to the drought, there are early signs of acute malnutrition in Madagascar, Malawi, Mozambique and Zimbabawe.</p> <p>For Coco Ushiyama, head of the UN\u2019s World Food Programme in Lilongwe, Malawi\u2019s capital, just working out how to import a million tonnes of food, needed to support between five million and eight million people in Malawi over the next 12 months, is proving nightmarishly difficult. With no guarantees of money from donors, she cannot buy the food on the open market, or book ships and transport.</p> <p>\u201cWe are very concerned. Last year, like many other countries in the region, Malawi had a double disaster with erratic rains and then floods which led into droughts,\u201d said Ushiyama. \u201cLast year, 2.8 million people were affected. Then we had a deficit of 220,000 tonnes of food. This year, we are anticipating it will be four times as bad. The maize price is already exceptionally high.</p> <p>\u201cWe are monitoring 50 markets throughout the country and already they are seeing abnormally high prices. We have very worryingly high admission rates for childhood malnutrition in health clinics. In some areas it is very serious already and it is likely to get much more serious. It will be a regional issue,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The government has declared a disaster and will publish a new assessment of its needs in the next few weeks. The vice-president, Saulos Chilima, has said that about 1.3m tonnes of maize will be needed.</p> <p>Politicians may talk of going on to the world market to buy a million tonnes of maize, but Ushiyama is unsure where it will come from. There is usually enough food in the region, but South Africa, which usually exports a million tonnes of food a year, will need to import 3.5m tonnes this year. Only Zambia may have enough food to export and it has imposed restrictions, she said.</p> <p>\u201cSouth Africa is in trouble. Nearby Zambia has had a better harvest than most countries but it has put export restrictions on its food. If we import it [from outside Africa], the food will take four to six months [to arrive]. We have learned from experience that the rains start in November so the roads will be terrible when the food is most needed and some lorry drivers will refuse to come. By November, we will need to have pre-positioned food in key areas. But to get it there by then means ordering the food right now,\u201d she said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"6f8185e1f6b6366ec5361cb63a4d652d6957118e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f8185e1f6b6366ec5361cb63a4d652d6957118e/0_262_4000_5000/800.jpg\" alt=\"People are divide pulses among themselves at a United Nations World Food Programme food distribution centre in Chikwawa district, Malawi.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People are divide pulses among themselves at a United Nations World Food Programme food distribution centre in Chikwawa district, Malawi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tamara van Vliet/OCHA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Finding the cash to feed possibly 50 million people for eight or more months is the biggest problem of all, says the UN, because Africa\u2019s slow-burn crisis must compete with Middle East wars, refugees and natural disasters for attention. According to the UN, which is holding an unprecedented <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/world-humanitarian-summit\" title=\"\">humanitarian summit</a> this week in Istanbul, 125 million people worldwide need long-term assistance and a further 60 million have been forced from their homes by war, violence and disaster.</p> <p>More than $1.5bn has been requested by southern African governments, says Ocha, the UN\u2019s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, but less than a quarter of this has been pledged. Officially, the deficit is $677 million (87%) but this will grow when countries complete their assessments of the harvests in the next few weeks.</p> <p>\u201cThe window for responding in a meaningful manner is closing rapidly,\u201d said Shadrack Omol, senior adviser to the UN children\u2019s fund, Unicef. \u201cThe concern is that slow-onset emergencies, like the one we are dealing with in southern Africa, do not get enough attention because they creep up on us.\u201d</p> <p>John Makina, Oxfam country director in Malawi, said: \u201cThe donors just do not have the money; there is donor fatigue. Malawi has been hit by drought, then floods, then drought. The donors are getting tired of it. In 2015, Malawi alone needed $170m. In 2016-17, it will be far more.</p> <p>\u201cThe full impact will be felt from October to March 2017. It\u2019s looking really bad. The most affected will be the poorest and jobless. They will end up selling what little they possess. The price of maize flour has already gone to 9,000 kwachas (\u00a38.70) for 50kg. It will double again for sure,\u201d he said.</p> <p>International development minister Nick Hurd, who has visited Mozambique, wants Britain to lead the humanitarian effort. But money cannot be given directly to the country following a corruption scandal, and the government must work through a consortium of NGOs, providing food vouchers, medical aid and food-for-work schemes.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot and will not stand idly by while millions suffer. Britain is playing a leading role in helping countries across Africa to cope with the impact of El Ni\u00f1o. Support for people affected by El Ni\u00f1o is important to Africa and also firmly in Britain\u2019s national interest,\u201d says Hurd.</p> <p>In villages across southern Africa, people are fearful, unsure how they will survive. In Mozambique, where Britain is contributing \u00a311.8m over three years, some food aid has arrived in the village of Mblalava.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"21b47847970bf6525fc261ee2b066f9e1a877a05\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21b47847970bf6525fc261ee2b066f9e1a877a05/0_813_4000_5000/800.jpg\" alt=\"A farmer tries to grow crops with the help of a United Nations supported irrigation scheme in the Neno district of Malawi.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A farmer tries to grow crops with the help of a United Nations supported irrigation scheme in the Neno district of Malawi.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tamara van Vliet/OCHA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The women are ecstatic: \u201cIt\u2019s been two and a half years since we had good rain,\u201d said Rosita Chauque, a mother of three. \u201cWhen the drought started we used to be able to find vegetables in the bush, but even these have gone now. We used to make and sell charcoal, but there are so many other people doing that now it\u2019s not possible. We have thought of leaving, but where to? We have no crops in the fields, no food for the cattle and nothing for ourselves. There is no water, no grass. People are selling their animals. They have no other resources. There is a lot of suffering.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe situation is critical,\u201d said Abdoulaye Balde, the World Food Programme country director in Mozambique\u2019s capital, Maputo. \u201cWe are at the point of no return.\u201d</p> <p>Droughts and \u201chungry seasons\u201d are common throughout southern Africa, but the breadth of this year\u2019s crisis is very unusual, says Caoimhe de Barra, Malawi country director of Concern Worldwide. Her frontline workers see rural people already employing traditional coping strategies, including eating wild foods, taking children out of school, selling their animals and assets.</p> <p>\u201cEarly action is key. If we can start supporting people now, we can save lives and prevent an even worse situation later this year. People are not currently dying of hunger but the overall health of the population will be severely affected by hunger-related illnesses. Malnutrition will blight the life chances of countless more Malawian children,\u201d she said.</p> <p>The secretary general of the International Red Cross, Elhadj As Sy, who visited Malawi and Zimbabwe last week, said: \u201cMuch more needs to be done to support communities to survive and strive over the coming months. We met families who have received no external support and who are simply desperate. We need to urgently scale up our interventions to prevent this situation from becoming a catastrophe,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Relief from Africa\u2019s long drought may finally be coming, says the World Meteorological Organisation, which is monitoring the temperature of waters in the Pacific. These are said to be cooling rapidly and are expected to be \u201cneutral\u201d by mid-June. That, says the UN, signals the coming end of the El Ni\u00f1o, the droughts and the worldwide heatwaves.</p> <p>The effects, however, will not be felt in southern Africa until April 2017 when the next main harvest should be in. But, says the WMO, there may be a sting in the tale.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-22T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>\u201cShish kebab,\u201d the young man said to us with a grin, nodding to the freshly slaughtered lamb splayed in front of us, entrails flopping out. The sound of cartilage cracking as the butcher hacked punctuated the prayers spoken by onlookers. Despite the sun being high in the sky, the crooked passageway in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/tangier\">Tangier</a>\u2019s old town was swathed in shadow from the tall buildings on either side. A small crowd offered the butcher advice as he cut through the tendons. And my wife and I had stumbled on to it all after losing our way in the maze of streets while shopping for pots. (Every type of pot is available, but we were interested in the ceramic variety.)</p> <p>Mick Jagger loves Tangier. Samuel Pepys not so much. \u201cWe had a great deal of discourse upon the viciousness of this place, it being time for God almighty to destroy it,\u201d said the diarist of a dinner in the city, where he was overseeing the British withdrawal from the colony in the 1680s. The viciousness of the poverty is still jarring today. On an early evening, drinking a beer overlooking the Grand Socco (the big marketplace), we watched teenage beggars brawl on the grass below, offered barely a glance by passers-by.</p> <p>North Africa\u2019s experience of terrorism in recent years has hit tourism in Morocco quite hard. Yet those with a little adventure in their soul should visit now. Listening to the call for prayers over a beer as the sun goes down is warming, given the rise of a less tolerant Islam elsewhere.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d124aaee999bb72d9ee20851d4ad01d4e8a6b551\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d124aaee999bb72d9ee20851d4ad01d4e8a6b551/29_97_5519_3313/1000.jpg\" alt=\"True colours: vendors at the vegetable market in Tangier.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">True colours: vendors at the vegetable market in Tangier.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Harding/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tangier\u2019s past is full of peaks and troughs, and it looks on the cusp of enjoying a boom. A strategic gateway between Africa and Europe, it was torn and tussled over by the British, Moroccans, Portuguese, Spanish and French, each destroying and developing it in their time.</p> <p>In the early 1960s the Great Scandal erupted, sparked by a series of paedophile convictions. Tales emerging from the city so appalled the Moroccan royal family that they could barely stomach the existence of the place, letting it slide down on its own sleaze into the Strait of Gibraltar. The young King Mohammed VI has, however, woken up to Tangier\u2019s potential, believing that it could become a North African Saint-Tropez.</p> <p>A king\u2019s fortune is being spent on a new port, marina and three terminals for fast ferries. A high-speed train service is to \u201crevolutionise\u201d rail travel, with journeys from Casablanca to Tangier reduced from five to two hours. Vast hotels and malls are slowly emerging. The plan, according to locals, is for much of the work to be completed by summer. \u201cThe king is coming soon. He\u2019s pissed off and wants it finished,\u201d confided the manager at the excellent El Tangerino restaurant on the beachfront. But then this plan was in the making at the turn of the century, so we shall see.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4518c11e67a75b96774a3384503dac7df3f6f1f4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4518c11e67a75b96774a3384503dac7df3f6f1f4/0_444_3264_1958/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018You can see why the artist Matisse adored the hotel\u2019s calm\u2019: view from the Grand Hotel Villa de France.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018You can see why the artist Matisse adored the hotel\u2019s calm\u2019: view from the Grand Hotel Villa de France.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dan Boffey</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The medina and kasbah took up most of our time. The Grand Hotel Villa de France, perched on a hill on the edge of the medina, offers a perfect platform for exploring. It had been exquisitely renovated after being shut for two decades \u2013 and you can see why the artist Matisse adored the hotel\u2019s calm. Wandering down the hill from the hotel, we are soon wrapped up in the anarchy of the medina \u2013 the maze of alleyways busy with tradesmen and hustlers.</p> <p>Every five minutes a keen young man approaches offering some wisdom. A 20-year-old guidebook we find in our hotel offered the following on how to deal \u201cwith the kids\u201d: \u201cAll of us have our own odd tricks, like being able to roll one\u2019s eyes, imitate bird calls, or wiggle one\u2019s ears,\u201d they advised.</p> <p>We found a \u201cno thanks\u201d worked sufficiently well, which is perhaps a sign of optimism. There is none of the aggression of the young \u201cguides\u201d of old, where rejection would lead to prolonged stalking, catcalls and general botheration. Here it is met instead with a shrug and a smile.</p> <p>Fortuitously, it also appears to be an unwritten rule that you won\u2019t be interrupted while drinking mint tea in the Petit Socco (little marketplace) in the centre of the medina \u2013 and once the heart of Tangier\u2019s gay scene, although you wouldn\u2019t think it now.</p> <p>Indeed, generally sitting around ruminating, people watching and taking it all in is a respected pastime. If interruptions come, it is more likely to be from the western passengers disgorging from the cruise trips regularly arriving into port.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f617842633867a5403672a5d665051da0f2644bc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f617842633867a5403672a5d665051da0f2644bc/0_209_5360_3218/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Get it while it\u2019s hot: terracotta tagines for sale in the medina.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Get it while it\u2019s hot: terracotta tagines for sale in the medina.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dining out isn\u2019t taken quite as seriously as tea drinking. Traditionally people eat at home, rather than at restaurants, and so it is all quite informal. But that befits the city. At the rough-and-ready Le Saveur de Poisson, near the Grand Hotel Villa de France, there is no menu, but a series of seafood plates arrive with little explanation, ending with a nut and honey confection and the obligatory mint tea. The opening bowl of fish soup, ladled from a bubbling cauldron in the corner of the small open-plan kitchen and dining room, is especially good.</p> <p>Once the dust settles from the new hotels, the developers will no doubt move elsewhere in the city. A boom time it may be, but the finished product may not be to everyone\u2019s taste; the new order might even frown on the ritual slaughter of animals on street corners. It might be worth braving Tangier now. After all, being meek doesn\u2019t seem to be working out too well for the lambs.</p> <h2>Essentials<br /></h2> <p><em>Flights from Gatwick to Tangier with <a href=\"http://www.airarabia.com/en\">Air Arabia Maroc</a> from \u00a3215 return.

      "body": "<p>It began, as these things sometimes do, with a stink. On the evening of 15 July 1895, in Plaistow, east London, a girl arrived at the house of Emily Coombes, sent by her mother, who\u2019d noticed a rank smell at the home of Coombes\u2019s sister-in-law, nearby in Cave Road. Two\u00a0days later, on the morning of 17 July, the milkman also encountered a stench at the house in Cave Road, and again word was sent to Emily Coombes. At 1.20pm on the same day, accompanied by her friend, Mary Burrage, she knocked on the door of the terraced house, demanding that her nephew, 13-year-old Robert, open it. Pushing past him, she went upstairs, following her instincts and, presumably, her nose. There in the bedroom, she found the body of a woman, her face covered by a sheet and a pillow. Sister-in-law Emily was unrecognisable. She had been there a while, and the weather had been hot. The corpse was all maggots.</p> <p>There was, and is, no mystery attached to <a href=\"http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?ref=t18950909-720\" title=\"\">Emily Coombes\u2019s unfortunate end</a>. Her son Robert immediately and almost nonchalantly confessed to having stabbed her 10 days before. Having committed this heinous act, moreover, he and his little brother Nattie had enjoyed themselves mightily (their father was away at sea). They had been to see WG Grace play cricket at Lord\u2019s, and to the seaside. By way of money, they\u2019d pawned various bits and pieces, aided by an adult family friend called John Fox, whom they\u2019d asked to stay while their mother was supposedly away in Liverpool. (\u201cWe\u2019ve had a rich uncle die in Africa,\u201d they said, \u201cand Auntie wants to see Ma.\u201d) Fox had not noticed the stink, or so he said. \u201cMy smell is not very good,\u201d he told the police. At this point, I pictured him sniffing the air, experimentally.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/04/kate-summerscale-life-in-writing\">A life in writing: Kate Summerscale</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Why had Robert killed his mother? He spoke of the beatings she\u2019d dished out, of the need to defend Nattie. However, as Kate Summerscale notes in this account of his crime and its aftermath, it seems more likely that he had suffered some kind of psychotic breakdown. The newspapers of the day, high on <em>fin-de-si\u00e8cle</em> fear and loathing \u2013 in the 1890s, children were no longer innocents; they were little beasts, capable of all sorts of savage doings \u2013 thought him a \u201cmonster of depravity\u201d. But the jury at his trial for murder, gazing on his confident but undeniably young face in the dock, took a more compassionate view, and thanks to them, he was not hanged, but dispatched to Broadmoor, where he took part in chess tournaments and learned to play the violin and cornet.</p> <p>Seventeen years later, when he was 30, he was thought well enough to be released, and with a small inheritance from his father, he travelled to Australia to make a new life. Redemption comes twice in this account. At Gallipoli and the Somme, Coombes served with distinction as a stretcher bearer; and then, a little later, there came another beautiful paying off of debts, an extremely touching twist, the nature of which I won\u2019t give away here.</p> <p>I must be honest. My feelings about <em>The Wicked Boy</em> \u2013 unexpectedly, given my deep and abiding admiration for its author\u2019s last book \u2013 are mixed. If the salvation of Robert is wondrous in a human sense, in narrative terms it is nothing short of a miracle, for without it, Summerscale would, I think, have struggled to make his story work between hard covers. I wonder, though. Is this coda really enough? Does it reshape, in the mind of the reader, the first half of <em>The Wicked Boy</em>, absolving it of its faults?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Fans of Victorian true crime will certainly enjoy Summerscale\u2019s scrupulous account of Coombes\u2019s trial</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I\u2019m not sure that it does. Although there are moments when events spring vividly to life \u2013 impossible to forget the sad, disturbing letter Coombes sent while he was on remand, in which he drew pictures of the gallows and gave away an imaginary fortune \u2013 most of the time, our wicked boy is little more than a cipher, an outline rather than a fully fleshed character.</p> <p>Of course, Summerscale has painfully little to go on, and just as she did in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/may/13/mrs-robinsons-disgrace-summerscale-review\" title=\"\"><em>Mrs Robinson\u2019s Disgrace</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/may/11/crimebooks.features\" title=\"\"><em>The Suspicions of Mr Whicher</em></a><em> </em>before it, she plugs the gaps, not with silly imaginings (like mine of Fox\u2019s sniffing), but with as much background as she can find, carefully building a picture of Victorian mores in the process. In this book, however, her research feels curiously uneven, and sometimes a touch bolted on.</p> <p>She tells us, for instance, all about a curate at Coombes\u2019s local church \u2013 the profession of his father, the epiphany he had aged 10 \u2013 yet Richard Dadd, the great Victorian painter of fairies whose long incarcerations first in Bethlem and then in Broadmoor resulted in some of the most singular works in the Tate\u2019s collection, is referred to only as \u201ca patricide who decorated the asylum hall with a series of fantastical murals\u201d. Her examination of the \u201cpenny dreadfuls\u201d Coombes loved to read \u2013 cheap adventure stories for boys that some thought filled their heads with dubious cravings \u2013 is excellent as far as it goes. But it also seems beside the point, somehow. Even the raciest tale of derring-do \u2013 silly stuff by our standards \u2013 can have had nothing to do with what Robert Coombes did that summer.</p> <p>Fans of Victorian true crime will certainly enjoy Summerscale\u2019s scrupulous and occasionally startling account of Coombes\u2019s trial. I did myself at times. But those who want something richer \u2013 a world in microcosm \u2013 may find <em>The Wicked Boy </em>just a little slight. This is a furrow she has already ploughed more deftly\u00a0elsewhere.</p> <p><em>The Wicked Boy is published by Bloomsbury (\u00a316.99). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/395037/s/the-wicked-boy/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a312.99</em></a></p>",

      "body": "<p>This very affecting feature debut from director Joe Stephenson, adapted from Freddie Machin\u2019s play by Chris New, centres on a teenager with learning difficulties (Scott Chambers, superb) who communicates more easily with animals \u2013 both dead and alive \u2013 than with people. Living in a caravan with his volatile and violent brother Polly (a convincingly wired Morgan Watkins), 15-year-old Richard befriends Yasmin Paige\u2019s Annabel, whose family owns the land they live on. With its clash of natural beauty and societal disorder, <em>Chicken </em>nods towards the template of Ken Loach\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/kes\" title=\"\"><em>Kes</em></a>, with Richard doting on pet hen Fiona, a symbol of his own flightless yet nurturing plight. Like the young Leonardo DiCaprio in <em>What\u2019s Eating Gilbert Grape</em>, Chambers\u2019s performance has tuning-fork precision, his slightly skewed physical movements and scattershot speech creating a childlike portrait that is neither patronising nor pat, ensuring that Richard becomes a fully rounded character with a complex emotional life, engaging and empathetic. A late-in-the-day revelation provides an unnecessary bombshell, which somewhat underestimates the power of the preceding drama, but Eben Bolter\u2019s widescreen cinematography captures the warmth, loneliness and harsh reality of this disenfranchised world with unobtrusive aplomb.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1e-d57_7kg\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1e-d57_7kg?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M1e-d57_7kg\">Watch the trailer for Chicken.</a></figcaption> </figure>",

      "body": "<p>New York looms so large in the collective imagination, the city a permanent set broadcasting images 24/7, that only the work of a rare talent such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2012/sep/15/neil-libbert-portraits-photography-art\" title=\"\">Neil Libbert</a> can jolt us into seeing it anew. In a series of street scenes capturing his first impressions of 1960s New York, he shows the city\u2019s swagger, the cocky young lads, glamourpusses and money men, through the eyes of an outsider, a fresh-faced photographer from Salford.</p> <p>\u201cNew York was very exciting. It was a good city,\u201d remembers Libbert. \u201cHarlem probably wasn\u2019t the safest place to be wandering around with a camera, and there were a lot of bricks being thrown around, but I had no problems.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMany of the photographs appear to have been taken discreetly,\u201d says curator <a href=\"http://www.katybarron.com/about/\" title=\"\">Katy Barron</a> in the introduction to her catalogue for <a href=\"http://benuri.org.uk/exhibitions/unseen/\" title=\"\"><em>Unseen</em></a>, a group photography show featuring Libbert\u2019s work, \u201creflecting both his natural reserve and huge charm.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e2556689a957dc21f1ab0d2a4f6efbcfc081c137\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2556689a957dc21f1ab0d2a4f6efbcfc081c137/75_54_7922_5256/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lower East Side, 1964 by Neil Libbert.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lower East Side, 1964 by Neil Libbert.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Above, Libbert, who went on to become a leading photojournalist for this paper, captures a young boy on Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side posing for another photographer with a toy gun. We witness both the frenetic energy of the city\u2019s streets, a literal blur of activity visible in the photo\u2019s foreground, and, through its characters and the shop window\u2019s signs, its multiculturalism.</p> <p>Barron has said of Libbert\u2019s images that they \u201cconvey the optimism and energy of a city that considered itself the economic, political and cultural capital of the world. Such confidence was short-lived.\u201d Look closely and the image is full of shadows, while the child in the foreground is oblivious to the gun, albeit a toy one, being brandished behind her back.</p> <p><a href=\"http://benuri.org.uk/exhibitions/unseen/\" title=\"\">\u2022 Unseen London, Paris, New York, 1930s-60s: Photographs by Wolfgang Suschitzky, Dorothy Bohm and Neil Libbert is at Ben Uri Gallery, London NW8 until 29 August</a></p>",

It\u2019s what he\u2019s supposed to do \u2013 and <em>Sun</em> readers can find a more rational account on page two. But there is one strand in the verdict worth spinning on for a while.</p> <p>Above \u201c\u2018Queen Backs Brexit\u2019 was another headline saying \u201cExclusive: bombshell claim over Europe vote.\u201d Gallagher wrote in an editorial last Wednesday: \u201cIt seemed fair enough to us. Tabloid newspapers like the <em>Sun</em> have long made eye-catching assertions in headlines alongside a smaller headline to qualify or attribute them. It is a standard device.\u201d</p> <p>Which, alas, seems dismally true of this entire referendum campaign. Bombshell shock \u2026 Obama backs the Mau Mau \u2026 Every family will be zillions poorer \u2026. Isis slaughter votes Out for carnage \u2026 Hitler inspired Remain campaign. If the public, at this point, has anything coherent to say to press and politicians alike, it is please put away your \u201cstandard devices\u201d. The real bombshell shock this June would be weeks of facts, honesty and grey, dispassionate sober forecasting \u2013 not crazed \u201ceye-catching assertions\u201d.</p> <h2>Who needs Twitter?

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-22T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>There\u2019s a huge irony to all the press fury over the supreme court\u2019s decision to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/may/19/supreme-court-upholds-celebrity-threesome-injunction\" title=\"\">keep a privacy gag on that (now rapidly ageing) celebrity threesome</a>. Current law, doggedly putting an English interpretation on privacy and freedom of expression rights as laid out in the Strasbourg charter, seems to mean maintaining the injunction to at least four out of the five supreme arbiters. But the three names involved have been published all over America, all over the internet, all over Scotland. There were 78,000 Twitter clicks on judgment day alone. Even the judges anticipated that the <em>Daily Mail</em> and others would cry \u201cass\u201d, \u201cCanute\u201d and much, much more.</p> <p>Wait a second, though. Aren\u2019t the papers most anxious to deride our supreme court in this matter also the ones who want us to quit Europe because our supposed sovereignty lies in peril? But now, when it suits them, they condemn most judges as donkeys for not seeing that American privacy legislation \u2013 nothing to do with Europe \u2013 is drastically different from English or continental law. America, in broad terms, is far tougher on intrusion of the phone-hacking variety, but far more relaxed when celebrities are caught up to no good with pants up or down. First amendment rights. No prior restraint.</p> <p>That\u2019s why names have been named in the US, where injunctions can\u2019t compel silence. That\u2019s why American celeb sites on the worldwide web publish without fear of damnation. That\u2019s why continuing gags invite hollow laughter. The technology of globalisation has simply made English-style privacy redundant. Sovereignty in such matters stops at the internet.Some judges involved see the new situation clear. Lord Justice Jackson did that at the appeal court stage. \u201cIt is my view inappropriate for the courts to ban people from saying that which is common knowledge.\u201d Lord Toulson, the dissenting supreme court judge, clearly chooses practicality first: \u201cThe story in its essential details has been published in a major Scottish newspaper, it has been widely accessible on websites and Twitter, and anyone who seriously wanted to know [the celebrity\u2019s identity] will have ways of finding it\u00a0\u2026I have reached a clear view that the story\u2019s confidentiality has become so porous that the idea of it still remaining secret in a meaningful sense is illusory.\u201d</p> <p>The question isn\u2019t whether you approve of seeing celebrity sex indiscretions in print or on the net. The question is whether any proportionate action \u2013 far distant from, say, China\u2019s draconian ways with digital information \u2013 can reasonably offer even the flimsiest pretence of privacy now. The question is whether the law has a duty to recognise reality.</p> <p>In this world of swirling communication, there is no certain sovereignty, only panting humiliation. No British bill of rights is going to change that \u2013 unless, of course, it comes with the thrust of American privacy law. That, on an international scale, is the only meaningful response. But don\u2019t hold your breath. At best, the supreme court has drawn up a \u201ccheaters\u2019 charter\u201d that disintegrates as it reaches Berwick-on-Tweed. At worst, it has made England (not Twittering Europe or Snapchatting America, just England and Wales) a laughing stock, an island of delusion \u2013 one where only the lawyers, proceeding now to full trial, have reason to smile.</p> <p>\u25a0 When a print paper dies, those competitors that remain expect to pick up little somethings. Or, in the case of April sales post-<em>Independent</em> demise, some pretty substantial things. There\u2019s a good deal of settling down, promotional ploys and the like to go yet, but while the tabloid sector gained 0.2% on March and the <em>Mail-Express</em> mid-market actually declined, the qualities were up almost 3% month-on-month and 2.62% year on year. 40,000 more copies sold than in April 2015 (with the surviving <em>i</em> naturally doing best of all). The <em>Observer</em> has good news: 9,471 more April copies sold than in March. The <em>Sunday Telegraph</em> put on 11,372. Oh! and if <em>Indy</em> addicts are feeling down, their standalone website is up over 40% in a year.</p> <p>You can get glum reading circulation figures. You probably will again as summer comes. But note the resilience, while it\u2019s there, as the pages turn.</p>",

The man had been carrying what appeared to be a suicide note, authorities said.</p> <p>The drama began on Saturday morning when Franco Luis Ferrada, 20, climbed atop the roof of the lion pen, then forced his way into the cage. According to witnesses the lions initially ignored the intrusion but attacked after Ferrada taunted them.</p> <p>Zookeepers responded at first by turning a hose on the animals, then by firing a tranquiliser dart \u2013 but hit the man in the neck instead of the lions. As the lions set upon the man, a zookeeper opened fire with live rounds. The two beloved animals died in front of a horrified and massive holiday crowd.</p> <p>Ferrada was taken in critical condition to a local health clinic with injuries to his pelvis and head, as well as a massive dose of tranquiliser.</p> <p>Gerson Sep\u00falveda, subcommisioner of the investigative police\u2019s crime division, confirmed that one of the darts hit the young man and said that Ferrada had left a written message thought to be a suicide note. \u201cWe are comparing it with other [writing samples],\u201d said Sep\u00falveda, who stated that police were also looking at videotapes, still photos and the firearms involved.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/21/african-nile-crocodiles-captured-florida\">Man-eating crocodiles surface in Florida swamps</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Alejandra Montalva, the zoo director, defended the actions of staff. \u201cThe alarms sounded and chemical control arrived [tranquiliser darts] and an independent shooter arrived.

Others commented on the treatment of people with mental health problems like the young man involved.</p> <p>Dozens of people arrived at the zoo on Saturday night to hold a candlelight vigil for the dead lions. Meanwhile doctors at the nearby clinic were cautiously optimistic that Ferrada would survive but said the next 24 hours would be key.</p>",

      "headline": "East West Street by Philippe Sands review \u2013 putting genocide into words",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-22T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>On 20 November 1945, exactly 10 infernal years after the Nazis\u2019 Nuremberg laws had instituted the legality of antisemitism \u2013 robbing Jews of citizenship, rights, property, and eventually of life itself \u2013 the ancient Bavarian city was host to the war crimes trials that gave birth to the modern system of international justice.</p> <p>For the first time in history, national leaders were indicted for their murderous acts before an international court. Hermann G\u00f6ring and other leading Nazis such as the \u201cbutcher of Poland\u201d, Hans Frank, Hitler\u2019s preeminent legal adviser and the head of occupied Poland\u2019s \u201cgeneral government\u201d, met their ultimate judgment. It was here, too, that the concepts of \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d and \u201cgenocide\u201d, so central to contemporary political life, had their first courtroom airing.</p> <p>Philippe Sands begins this important and engrossing book in Nuremberg. The trial of Frank provides its climactic moment. It will come as no surprise that Sands is a leading human rights lawyer who was involved in Chilean dictator <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/16/pinochet-law\" title=\"\">Pinochet\u2019s extradition trial</a>, as well as in many key cases that have made their way to the international criminal court. The surprise is that even when charting the complexities of law, Sands\u2019s writing has the intrigue, verve and material density of a first-rate thriller.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/19/our-fathers-the-nazis-film-explores-the-legacy-of-atrocities\">Our fathers the Nazis: film explores the legacy of atrocities</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But then this is not solely the story of the Nuremberg trials and the human rights laws they put on the global map. One strand of the book, and perhaps its precipitating one, is a family memoir unearthing the life of Sands\u2019s rather taciturn maternal grandfather, Leon Buchholz, and his wife, Rita. As a child, and later as a young man, Philippe would visit his grandparents in Paris where they lived. He never learned anything much of their history, except that they were Jews who came, in Leon\u2019s case, from Lemberg, and in Rita\u2019s from Vienna. The grim war years, the loss of parents and relatives in death camps, or the gruelling period before the war were rarely mentioned.</p> <p>Sands\u2019s mother, too, was born in Vienna. Then mysteriously she was brought to Paris as a child in the summer of 1939 to join her father, while her mother stayed behind in a city now hazardous to Jews. The reasons for this odd separation were clear to no one by the time Philippe started asking questions.</p> <p>His narrative implies that his first curiosity about these past matters crystallised only when an invitation arrived asking him to lecture on human rights in the city of Lviv. Depending on the point in history and the shifts in eastern Europe\u2019s precarious border regions, Lviv is one of those cities whose name readily metamorphoses into Lw\u00f3w or Lemberg. Eastern outpost of the Habsburg empirecorrect in the region of Galicia, western corner of Russia, proud city of briefly independent Ukraine, then Poland, then Russia, then Germany and back again, the only constant in Lw\u00f3w up until the terrors of the second world war was its sizable Jewish population of some 100,000.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b4494fb714d34b8834b9f47aadc93c624a6e410f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b4494fb714d34b8834b9f47aadc93c624a6e410f/0_425_5784_3470/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hans Frank  in Graz, Austria, in 1938.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hans Frank photographed in Graz, Austria, in 1938.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Imagno/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These included two brilliant legal thinkers whose lives provide further strands of Sands\u2019s interwoven narrative. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2010/nov/10/my-legal-hero-hersch-lauterpacht\" title=\"\">Hersch Lauterpacht</a>, professor of international law and already an advocate of human rights in the 1920s and 1930s, grew up in Lw\u00f3w, not far from Sands\u2019s own Buchholz family. This is the East West Street of his title.</p> <p>Chased away by one of the regular outbursts of antisemitism (the Jewish quarter was burned down in 1918) and his inability as a Jew to take the law exams, Lauterpacht left for Vienna in 1919. That city was only slightly less allergic to Jews in the immediate years following the first world war and soon he and his new wife travelled to England and the London School of Economics. Lauterpacht\u2019s PhD thesis already laid out the groundwork for international obligations that would rein in the power the state had over individuals. He eventually took a post in Cambridge, where his son, Sir Elihu Lauterpacht, would one day teach Philippe Sands. Lauterpacht put the indictment of \u201ccrimes against humanity\u201d \u2013 that is, murderous acts by the state against individuals, often enough its own citizens \u2013 into the Nuremberg trials and drafted a substantial portion of the speeches of Sir Hartley Shawcross, the chief British prosecutor.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It underscores that it was men with direct experience of persecution who laid the foundations of human rights law</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Like Lauterpacht, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/mar/09/my-hero-al-kennedy-raphael-lemkin\" title=\"\">Raphael Lemkin</a> also studied at the law faculty in Lw\u00f3w. He became a significant Polish prosecutor before events forced him to leave for the US. It was his thinking and pressure on the American legal team that put the crime of genocide \u2013 crimes against a race or group on the basis of their identity \u2013 into play at Nuremberg and in 1948 saw it adopted by the UN general assembly.</p> <p>Though genocide has in our own epoch of human rights become the crime of crimes in international courts, Sands remains a little wary of Lemkin. He evokes a personal life that is perhaps a little sexually shady. Meanwhile, Lemkin\u2019s social demeanour emerges as a little too assertive, even febrile, in the runup to the Nuremberg trials when he presses the need for genocide to be recognised as the prevailing Nazi crime, and one that predates the war itself. In a fascinating passage, Sands confesses that Lauterpacht\u2019s suspicion of it has emerged as justified in more recent genocide hearings, when the need to prove victim solidarity and activate a group identity has sometimes reinforced wrongs and made political reconciliation all but impossible.</p> <p>Alongside his grandfather \u201cby blood\u201d Leon, the two other Jews from Lw\u00f3w, Lauterpacht and Lemkin, take on something of a professional grandparental mantle for Sands. He pores over what he calls the \u201cmuck of evidence\u201d for them as assiduously as he does for his own family. Sands has a lawyer\u2019s zeal for evidence, engaging in far-ranging detective work and sifting what he finds with masterly forensic probing. He can magic whole histories of wartime heroism out of addresses eight decades old. Or, chasing the lead of a faded photograph, he can unearth possible alternate grandparents and illicit liaisons to be verified only by DNA tests.</p> <p>Sometimes the sheer energy of his evidential eye suggests he\u2019s ready to try the Holocaust\u2019s perpetrators all over again \u2013 not so much out of rage or righteousness, but because the evidence of their crimes is so overwhelming. At Treblinka, the death camp the Nazis tried to bury, he sees the stamp of Hans Frank\u2019s general government, which had jurisdiction over Lemberg as well as Treblinka, alongside that of the camp commandant, Franz Stangl. It is \u201ca black sign, indelible and definitive as to the matter of responsibility\u201d.</p> <p>Sands\u2019s portrait of Frank, the lawyer who went wrong, and his trial at Nuremberg supply the final powerful strand of this narrative.

      "body": "<h2>Wallander</h2> <p>9pm, BBC1<br />Starring a lugubrious-looking Kenneth Branagh, this is the fourth and final series based on Henning Mankell\u2019s novels. It sees the detective brought in to investigate the case of a Swedish national who has gone missing in Cape Town, which turns out to be part of a complex conspiracy, giving Wallander plenty to sink his existential teeth into. The extent of the sorrowful saga dawns against the abundantly shimmering, photogenic backdrop of South Africa. <em>David Stubbs </em></p> <h2>RHS Chelsea Flower Show 2016 </h2> <p><strong>5.30pm, BBC1</strong><br />It\u2019s the 103rd year of the Chelsea Flower show and Sophie Raworth and Joe Swift present the first instalment of the annual bloomfest. Before they get down to the relaxing business of admiring flowers, Raworth and Swift look at how much work goes into the three weeks of setting up the show. Once everything\u2019s ready, they\u2019ll be previewing some of the big hitters of this year\u2019s show. Coverage continues all week. <em>Hannah Verdier </em></p> <h2>World Cup 1966: Alfie\u2019s Boys</h2> <p>8pm, BBC2<br />With another international football tournament approaching, it\u2019s time, once again, to get misty-eyed about all England\u2019s yesterdays. This paean to 1966 and all that is helmed by David Jason, ensconced in a leather armchair, eyes twinkling like a kindly national uncle. The tournament\u2019s nearly man Jimmy Greaves is a gruff counterpoint to the occasionally cloying tone, half-jokingly recalling 1966 as \u201ca bloody awful year\u201d. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p> <h2>From EastEnders To Hollywood: Antonia Bird </h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC4<br /></strong>A profile of the director Antonia Bird, who died from thyroid cancer in 2013 at the age of 62 but left behind an admirable legacy. She was named resident director of the Royal Court theatre aged just 27 and went on to direct early episodes of EastEnders and Casualty, before cinema beckoned with movies such as Ravenous and Priest. Kay Mellor, Irvine Welsh and frequent collaborator Robert Carlyle all hail her talents here. <em>Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2>Horizon: E-Cigarettes \u2013 Miracle Or Menace? </h2> <p><strong>9.30pm, BBC2<br /></strong>The question posed by the subtitle feels provocative: few of the claims made for or against electronic cigarettes in the film seem as extraordinary as the fact that the answer wasn\u2019t figured out before they were allowed on sale. Michael Mosley meets people who believe that vaping could save millions of lives, and those who think it might be as dangerous as tobacco. In search of the truth, Horizon conducts its own experiment. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2>The Secret History Of Isis </h2> <p><strong> 9pm, PBS America</strong><br />This new doc from veteran US film-maker Michael Kirk explores an organisation that has gained a chilling ubiquity in recent years. The story of Jordanian radical Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the petty criminal and would-be al-Qaida recruit who went on to form his own terror group, is interspersed with insights from former US government and CIA officials, some more disillusioned than others with both the Bush and Obama administrations. <em>Hannah J Davies </em></p> <h2>Queen Of The Baboons </h2> <p><strong> 8pm, Nat Geo Wild<br /></strong>The average female baboon doesn\u2019t get more than 14 birthday parties in the backwaters of Botswana, but \u201cQueen\u201d Tubu did. Last seen sloping off to die aged a stupendous 25, here\u2019s her alternately child-friendly and rather grim story; whether mourning her mangled relatives (\u201cThe mess of fur and flesh was her mother\u201d) or dodging suitors, who either want to duff her up or give her some sweet monkey love, often on the same day. <em>Ali Catterall</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c8cf969aece4fc2b96a870e825e076b6dfa21c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c8cf969aece4fc2b96a870e825e076b6dfa21c2/0_98_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Judi Dench and Celia Imre in The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Judi Dench and Celia Imre in The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/FOX SEARCHLIGHT PICTURES/Sportsphoto Ltd./Allstar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Film Choice</h2> <p><strong>Evolution<br />(Ivan Reitman, 2001), 2.30pm, Channel 4</strong><br />An asteroid crashes to Earth, bearing an unwelcome payload of rapidly evolving alien life forms. Pitted against these lovingly computer-generated creatures are a trio of Earthlings \u2013 Prof David Duchovny, a gleefully over-the-top Doc Orlando Jones and brainy clutz Julianne Moore. The jokes are often to do with bottoms, but also poke enjoyable fun at the Alien films, Independence Day et al. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <p><strong>The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel<br />(John Madden, 2011), 8pm, Channel 4</strong><br />Madden\u2019s twinkly comedy, based on a Deborah Moggach novel, takes an A-list of aged Brit thesps \u2013 Maggie Smith, Judi Dench, Bill Nighy, Tom Wilkinson etc \u2013 and plonks them in a crumbling hotel in Rajasthan as economic migrants seeking a cheaper retirement. The contrived antics don\u2019t quite do the illustrious cast justice but were charming enough to prompt a sequel. <em>PH</em></p> <p><strong>Kelly + Victor<br />(Kieran Evans, 2012), 2.10am, Film4</strong><br />Unlike the glossy, silly Fifty Shades Of Grey, Kieran Evans\u2019s beautifully crafted sadomasochistic liaison feels torn from the hearts of real people. Antonia Campbell-Hughes and Julian Morris are almost painfully convincing as Kelly and Victor, whose disturbing relationship brings some kind of escape from lives teetering on the brink.</p> <h2>Today\u2019s live sport</h2> <p><strong>Tennis: The French Open, 9.30am, ITV4<br /></strong>The first day of the grand slam tournament from Roland Garros. <br /><strong>Test Cricket: England v Sri Lanka 10.30am, Sky Sports 2<br /></strong>The fourth day from Headingley.</p> <p><strong>Scottish Football: Play-offs 2.30pm, BT Sport 1<br /></strong>The Premiership play-off final.</p> <p><strong>International Football: England v Turkey 4.30pm, ITV<br /></strong>England\u2019s Euro 2016 preparations continue at the Etihad Stadium.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-22T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p><strong>The Guinea Grill, 30 Bruton Place, London W1 (020 7499 1210). Meal for two, including drinks and service: \u00a3160</strong></p> <p>If the <a href=\"http://www.theguinea.co.uk/\">Guinea Grill</a> in Mayfair was a new opening it would be hotter than the cooking range by the dining room door over which they flame their steaks. It would be full of bloggers holding their smart phones high and flat over plates of prime Scottish beef, and lifestyle journalists swooning at the commitment to old-fashioned virtues; to the application of frilly paper collars around steak and kidney pies. It would attract a mixed crowd, in for the night from Peckham and Hackney, giving it a lot of love. Some of that crowd might even possess ovaries.</p> <p>Instead, it has been here since 1952 and the dining room tonight is filled almost exclusively by men. Throughout the evening I spy just two women, one of them sitting opposite me. These men are greying, thickening at the waist \u2013 hello friends \u2013 shovelling away slabs of grilled animal and emptying bottles of alcohol-heavy claret as if tomorrow isn\u2019t a school day. Old oil paintings and watercolours \u2013 glaucoma-ed landscapes, shaggy-pelted cattle, plants with long Latin names \u2013 stare down from the half-panelled walls. Waiters in white jackets dip in and out of the breaks in anecdotes, which are not so much being told, as slapped down on the table for measurement and comparison.</p> <p>I had been to the Guinea Grill once before, many years ago. I was brought here by a Radio 4 producer of the old school, who believed most things could be solved via the committed application of grilled animal and red wine. I hadn\u2019t thought of it since, until the recent news that the landlord of nearly 30 years \u2013 it\u2019s that sort of place \u2013 was leaving. He was to be replaced by a chap called Oisin Rogers. If London has a star pub landlord, it\u2019s Rogers. He ran <a href=\"http://www.theship.co.uk/\">the Ship in Wandsworth</a> and, through innovation and smarts, turned it from familiar boozer barn to a player in the city\u2019s restaurant business. After a decade there the brewery, Young\u2019s, moved him to the <a href=\"http://www.thecanonbury.co.uk/\">Canonbury in Islington</a>. Now, a year later, he is here.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c76cf848ed46c4c00cc69f0e68de1b5ce39d8f1a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c76cf848ed46c4c00cc69f0e68de1b5ce39d8f1a/9_240_4927_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"prawn cocktail in a tall glass with a wedge of lemon\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A prawn cocktail done right is a beautiful thing\u2019: Jay Rayner.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He has the kind of personality that transmits itself through social media. It is only when he introduces himself that I realise we have never actually met before in person. He is a compact man, in a light oak tweed suit, who clearly attends to the details. He has the softest of voices that transmits the words \u201ceverything in here will be fine\u201d no matter what he happens to be saying. He is certainty in a three piece.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This is an altar to steak from a time when such a place was a rarity</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He tells me his job is to let the Guinea Grill continue being itself and I do not doubt him, for it really is a class act. Yes, it recalls a mythologised age of chaps in open-topped roadsters, who smoked rakishly, and thought they knew how to show a girl a good time. Except I imagine those men were all awful shits and the food in those places was lousy. Here, it isn\u2019t and the men seem jolly enough.</p> <p>Allow the head waiter to give you the speech by the cold cabinet of raw beef; to talk up the virtues of sirloin over rump, of ribeye over fillet. Let him tell you that they recommend nothing more than medium rare, even though these days we know these things. This is an altar to steak from a time when such a place was a rarity and they were one of the few games in town. London has caught up with the Guinea Grill, but it deserves respect for carrying the flame throughout all these cold and steak-empty years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fd6de099a7cd3ba12388c4bc4cbdacd2f8bc9494\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd6de099a7cd3ba12388c4bc4cbdacd2f8bc9494/0_187_5616_3370/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The sort of thing tourist buses should stop in front of\u2019: mixed grill.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The sort of thing tourist buses should stop in front of\u2019: mixed grill.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not a word of the menu will surprise you, but then no one comes here for surprises, unless it\u2019s the discovery that a prawn cocktail done right is a beautiful thing: the nest of crisp iceberg lettuce, the prawns with the pertness of a baby\u2019s buttock, the slather of Marie Rose with just the hint of fire from Tabasco as though offering you a glimpse of ankle. The smoked salmon is London cure, by Forman\u2019s \u2013 well of course it is \u2013 and laid flat across the plate in a perfectly sliced single layer. The lemon is muslin wrapped. The shallots are finely chopped. The caper berries are plump. The bread is pumpernickel. The customers are happy.</p> <p>A sirloin steak is thick cut, medium rare as promised, but properly seared until the outer layer on the ribbon of fat gives a light crack beneath your teeth. The Guinea mixed grill is the sort of thing open-top tourist buses should stop in front of. There is a slice of rump, cut thinly, but still slightly pink in the middle. There is a big old rectangle of calf\u2019s liver, black and charred without, but still the right colour within and dressed with garlic and parsley butter. There is ox heart and lamb\u2019s kidney, a perfect meaty pork sausage and a fried egg.</p> <p>They also serve a grilled field mushroom with half a semi-roasted beef heart tomato. They do this silver-service, the attentive waiters chasing them round the oval platter with spoon and fork; one endless match, to be re-fought night after night. I do not eat the hot, undercooked tomato and I can\u2019t imagine anybody else does. The kitchen must be littered with tomatoes that have made the round trip, unmolested. They do a peppercorn sauce that lubricates the steak, and a fine side of peas with bacon. A bowl of fried onions and shallots, like tangled shoelaces, is a must; the slightly undercooked chips, less so.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"584742b2ace62eae71c53dd9ad5283a3e0d893e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/584742b2ace62eae71c53dd9ad5283a3e0d893e1/450_645_4512_2707/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Desserts are terrible\u2019: cherry cheesecake.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Desserts are terrible\u2019: cherry cheesecake.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But more important than all of this is the staff: chaps who have been here for years and who will doubtless be here for years to come; who dance with and around each other, as your dinner, mostly plated tableside, arrives in part-work. I search the wine list for a light red. Finding nothing, I am offered an off-list Fleurie, and it is almost perfect. Only almost because it\u2019s \u00a338.</p> <p>So, any downsides? Well obviously those prices \u2013 \u00a313 for the prawn cocktail, \u00a333 for the 12oz steak \u2013 which will make you feel like you\u2019ve been spanked by matron. Then again that\u2019s an experience most of the chaps in here tonight would probably enjoy. And the desserts are terrible. The bought-in sticky toffee pudding is an overly light sponge. The cherry cheesecake, apparently made on site, is not something I\u2019d own up to. But I forgive them all this, simply for still being there, and for being great at what they do. Stand still for long enough, as the Guinea Grill has, and eventually everything comes back blissfully into fashion.</p> <h2>Jay\u2019s news bites</h2> <p>\u25a0 Another great standard bearer for steak throughout the dark years was Popeseye, named after a cut of rump. From the original in Putney they have grown to three outlets, but the idea is the same: rump, sirloin, ribeye and fillet steaks, in cuts up to 30oz. There are chips, wine and mustard. And that\u2019s about it. The whole thing\u2019s a bit old school and gloriously so (<a href=\"http://popeseye.com/\">popeseye.com</a>).</p> <p>\u25a0 Cult baker Richard Bertinet has developed a sliced sourdough tin-baked loaf for sale in Waitrose. It\u2019s preservative free, weighs in at 1kg and will apparently last for a week. It costs \u00a33.55 and will initially be available at six branches of the supermarket, as well as in Bertinet\u2019s own shop in Bath (<a href=\"http://www.thebertinetkitchen.com/\">thebertinetkitchen.com</a>).</p> <p>\u25a0 A new restaurant called Legs is to be launched in Hackney by Australian chef Magnus Reid. Apparently it\u2019s named after a piece of wine terminology. Will reviewers be able to avoid the obvious gag: \u201cThis week I went to the opening of Legs\u201d? I hope that, now the joke is done, we can all move on (<a href=\"http://www.legsrestaurant.com/\">legsrestaurant.com</a>).</p> <p><em>Email Jay at </em><a href=\"mailto:jay.rayner@observer.co.uk\"><em>jay.rayner@observer.co.uk</em></a><em> or f</em><em>ollow him on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jayrayner1?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@jayrayner1</a></em></p>",

She darted out from behind a parked lorry and into the cycling lane. I only had a second to hammer on the brakes, but it wasn\u2019t enough and the two of us went sprawling. I did the full 180 over the handlebars and ended up on the road like a starfish, while she was knocked sideways. Fortunately, other than some bruises and twisted handlebars, both of us were fine. But it all happened so quickly I kept wishing I had had a chance to film it so I could watch it over. If only I\u2019d had one of these new cameras attached to my bike. </p> <p>It\u2019s the latest gadget from Cycliq, maker of innovative cycling accessories. The Fly12 is a neat combination of a full HD camera and front light. It has a remarkably wide-angle lens and the sound recording is crystal clear. You charge the unit up by connecting it to your computer, if you use it in camera-only mode it will record for up to 10 hours on to a 16GB micro SD card. The Fly12 saves the action in a continuous series of loops so you never need worry about running out of memory. If there is an accident, the device will automatically save the footage. It\u2019s also weatherproof and boasts a bike alarm. If your bike is moved without your knowledge the unit starts beeping and sends a message to your smartphone. </p> <p>It\u2019s all very clever, but where it really gets special is when used in tandem with the free CycliqPlus companion app. Using WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity, your video can be viewed, edited and shared instantly on your phone. You can even integrate it with Strava so that all your ride details, such as speed, power, heart rate and map location are overlaid on to the final edit. Fly12 purchasers receive three months free Strava Premium membership.</p> <p>So, fun for you \u2013 and just imagine the joy on your partner\u2019s face when you sit them down to watch your 10-hour ride from the weekend... <br /></p> <p><em> The unit costs \u00a3249.

      "body": "<h2>What do my pet rats say about me?</h2> <p>\u201cThey say I\u2019m caring. Rats are the ideal pet for me, as they fit around my life and are always happy to see me.\u201d</p> <h2>And what they really say</h2> <p>In this aesthetic age of hipster kittens and cute cockapoos, when pets are ranked according to their Instagram-appropriateness, some of us feel that rats are not getting their due. Rats might not look sweet in a teacup or a knitted tutu, but they make great pets: they\u2019re super-friendly, very clever and like to scrabble around in your jumper before popping up at your neck, like a wriggly scarf. I know this because, when I was 20, I had a pet rat. I called him Barney after the lead singer of New Order. Barney died in unfortunate circumstances (another story), but he was proper fun while he lasted.</p> <p>Anyway. Donna is a rat breeder, a woman who understands rats. She is clearly happy to hold them, fine about them rootling in her hair (rats love walking over your head). I have no doubt she enjoys chasing them around the sofa. Donna has made nice big cages for her rats, but they\u2019ll still need exercise. Rats like to look around, though they won\u2019t run across rooms. They\u2019ve been hunted for too long; they stick to the edges.</p> <p>Rats are curious, and you can easily take one on a trip. You just hide it in your coat. I once took Barney to McDonald\u2019s, but we were thrown out for being vermin (the cheek!). I didn\u2019t mind: I could never get through a bag of chips without Barney swiping at least half of them. Rats are ultra-quick thieves, ninja nickers.</p> <p>Judging by her clothes, Donna is not a goth (rats are a goth clubcard in animal form), so we can say her rats show that she is kind and caring, and that she looks beyond the obvious. She knows that appearances don\u2019t matter as much as affection. She and her rats look happy, just as cute as can be.</p> <p><br /><em>If you would like Miranda to cast an eye over your favourite possession, email a photograph to </em><a href=\"mailto:magazine@observer.co.uk\"><em>magazine@observer.co.uk</em></a></p>",

      "body": "<p>In the same way I anticipated becoming more rightwing as I grew older, I expected my views on <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/abortion\">abortion</a> to change after I had a child. But no. In fact the idea of doing this babying against my will \u2013 of haemorrhaging this quantity of love, of spending the entire weekend of 14 May weeping to Abba\u2019s \u201cSlipping Through My Fingers\u201d, of having to ask for so much help \u2013 the idea of giving birth to a child that wasn\u2019t wanted has made me appreciate abortion even more.</p> <p>I love abortion the way I love liver transplants and antidepressants. I love that it saves people. I love that it rescues women from lives they are not prepared to live, from poverty, pain and death. I love that I live in a country and a time when we can choose to have children and how to plan our lives. Lives that include sex, unplanned and sometimes silly, sometimes regrettable. I love that abortion allows women to control their own reproduction when a condom breaks, or when that\u2019s what they need to tell their sister.</p> <p>We have the right to prevent pregnancy, to get pregnant, and to terminate a pregnancy \u2013 the same right that ensures nobody is prohibited from reproducing and that nobody is forced to have an abortion against their will. Which is why, rather than \u201cmutinying\u201d <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3593847/I-ve-wrong-insists-midwives-chief-abortion-storm-no-idea-members-didn-t-ask-Board-axing-time-limit.html\">(as reported by the <em>Daily Mail</em></a><em>)</em> after their union boss signed them up to BPAS\u2019s (British Pregnancy Advisory Service) <a href=\"http://www.wetrustwomen.org.uk/\">We Trust Women campaign</a> to decriminalise abortion, members of the Royal College of Midwives should be in favour of helping their patients have children when they choose.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I love abortion \u2013 I love that it rescues women from lives they\u2019re not prepared to live</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Their concerns, that if the abortion time limit were to be removed then some women would terminate at any time up to nine months, are unfounded. Less than 0.1% of all abortions take place after 24 weeks gestation \u2013 there\u2019s no evidence that removing criminal sanctions leads to an increase in later terminations. Women know what they\u2019re doing, and what they want.</p> <p>This right, to control our own reproduction, is at the core of women\u2019s long and tedious fight for equality. So the fact that abortion remains in criminal law in the UK is not just shocking, but also\u2026 embarrassing. For a country that sees itself as modern, as progressive, how illogical it is that women\u2019s bodies are still being regulated by a law passed before they were given the vote.</p> <p>Rather than trusting a woman to make the choice about whether she is ready to have a baby, the decision is in the hands of doctors. Two doctors. If they don\u2019t give a woman legal authorisation to have an abortion (or if she doesn\u2019t get that authorisation in time), then she must either continue the pregnancy against her will or illegally induce a miscarriage herself and face prosecution. Last December a <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3364345/Mother-forced-miscarriage-32-weeks-pregnant-jailed.html\">young woman from County Durham</a> was sentenced to two and half years in prison. The pills she used are now widely available online.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video element--supporting\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2015/may/06/us-anti-abortion-movement-exporting-tactics-to-uk-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/485ye\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2287454\"            data-video-name=\"The terrifying American anti-abortion movement is exporting its tactics to the UK \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            data-video-poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/5/1430840127119/A-masked-man-holds-up-a-b-001.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-456621564\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/5/5/1430840127119/A-masked-man-holds-up-a-b-001.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2015/05/05/1500505JessicaValentiCIF_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2015/05/05/1500505JessicaValentiCIF.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2015/05/05/1500505JessicaValentiCIF_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2015/05/05/1500505JessicaValentiCIF_synd_768k_vp8-1.webm\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=10330484&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/video/2015/may/06/us-anti-abortion-movement-exporting-tactics-to-uk-video\">The terrifying American anti-abortion movement is exporting its tactics to the UK</a> says The Guardian\u2019s Jessica Valenti</figcaption> </figure>   <p>Today organs cannot be taken from the dead body of someone who made clear they did not wish to donate even if they\u2019ll save another person\u2019s life, BPAS notes, explaining why abortion laws are at odds with fundamental legal principles: \u201cYet a living woman can be compelled to sustain a foetus against her will from the moment a fertilised egg implants in her womb.\u201d</p> <p>A third of women in the UK will have an abortion, and two-thirds of people believe that abortion should be allowed according to a woman\u2019s choice. To the third who don\u2019t, believing perhaps that women granted easy access to abortion will use it, as a number of pious letter writers have said to me, as \u201clazy birth control\u201d, I would direct them to new research that shows <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/blogs/xx_factor/2016/05/11/abortion_rates_are_constant_in_developing_countries_while_developed_ones.html\">anti-abortion laws do not reduce abortion rates</a>. Criminalising it \u2013 rather than preventing abortion, rather than punishing a woman by making her raise an unwanted child (regardless of the plans of the father) \u2013 drives them to terminate the pregnancy through illegal methods. It drives them to a laptop at 5am, to a box of pills, to the feeling that she\u2019s quite, quite alone.</p> <p>I\u2019m surprised at the mutinying midwives, people who have seen the blood and passion of birth a hundred times over, who should know the gravity of reproductive choice. The word midwife means \u201cwith woman\u201d. To support the criminalisation of abortion seems in clear opposition to that role. Instead of standing with women, it is pushing them away.</p> <p><em>Email Eva at <a href=\"mailto:e.wiseman@observer.co.uk\">e.wiseman@observer.co.uk</a> or follow her on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EvaWiseman?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@EvaWiseman</a></em></p>",

But inside, the bold lines, stylish materials and careful use of bright colours against mainly white walls is a world away from the run-down repossession that the pair first looked round. \u201cThere was a pasta dish in the oven that had been left there for two months,\u201d remembers Johan.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5be01ec0800891feafd587981e63d2592d03f0e7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5be01ec0800891feafd587981e63d2592d03f0e7/0_245_5440_3264/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018We didn\u2019t want a Victorian terrace and couldn't afford one round here\u2019: Anita and Johan in the kitchen.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We didn\u2019t want a Victorian terrace and couldn\u2019t afford one round here\u2019: Anita and Johan in the kitchen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Local estate agents say that the housing crisis has erased any middle-class snobbery that might have existed a decade ago about buying a former council house. Johan admits that the community sees the arrival of their new, young neighbours as gentrification, but says: \u201cThere is a sense of pride that people are doing up the houses and taking care of the area.\u201d</p> <p>The pair invested in features such as the kitchen table, designed to be an exact fit for the room, and brass and wooden bannisters. More expensive materials, such as marble were used \u201cin small doses, for bits you touch\u201d. Storage is cleverly hidden under the stairs, in the ground-floor laundry room and built-in cabinets: the couple claim they generally manage to keep their compact house almost as immaculately tidy as it is on the day that I visit.</p> <p>They met when Johan moved to London from Denmark to study architecture. He says his high-quality, design-led furniture choices, including Le Corbusier lighting and a black <a href=\"http://www.design-museum.de/en/collection/100-masterpieces/detailseiten/b3wassily-marcel-breuer.html\">Wassily chair</a> by the designer Marcel Breuer which he has had since he was 16, are all down to his \u201cDanish ethos\u201d. \u201cIf I buy a piece of furniture, it will stay with me for the rest of my life,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c3883bcf6fa94d1530647bb382d9863329eaf90\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c3883bcf6fa94d1530647bb382d9863329eaf90/0_365_3420_4484/763.jpg\" alt=\"New look: high ceilings and windows in internal walls usher in the light.\" width=\"763\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">New look: high ceilings and windows in internal walls usher in the light.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The entire renovation, which included stripping the carpets and remodelling the attic to expose the loft beams, cost around \u00a380,000. Handily for them, they didn\u2019t have to pay architect\u2019s fees. Now Johan, Anita and their dog are planning to stay in the house for as long as they can, and the couple often invite their friends over to enjoy it with them.</p> <p>\u201cIt feels like you use the whole house, not just one room,\u201d says Anita. \u201cThe Danish culture is to socialise a lot more in your own home.\u201d Johan says that now the project is finished, it\u2019s time to make the most of what they have created. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t need to be changed for 50 years. If we manage that, we feel like we\u2019ve done our part.\u201d</p>",

Sometimes not even the smartest computerised system can do it.</p> <p>With practice, the brain can spot distinctions so subtle they\u2019re impossible to describe. In an experiment, humans and computers were asked to spot rocks and mines using sonar detection systems in a submarine. In time, sonar operators could tell if an object was a mine or a rock, but they couldn\u2019t explain why.

      "body": "<p>Most of us are trapped in rectangular living, trying to retrofit eco-efficiency, but we could be enjoying life in a geodesic freedome. For starters, freedomes are inherently efficient: they need no intermediate columns or supporting walls. After all, a geodesic line is the shortest line between two points on the surface of a spheroid, and the sphere is nature\u2019s most efficient shape.</p> <p>Buckminster \u201cBucky\u201d Fuller, who created the Montreal Biosph\u00e8re in 1967, was the foremost pioneer of geodesic domes, the master of tensegrity \u2013 tensile integrity \u2013 and the reason why geodesic structures are forever associated with eco living.</p> <p>Out of 90 pavillions built for Montreal\u2019s 1967 World\u2019s Fair, only two are standing. And one is Bucky\u2019s famed geodome, now known as the Montreal Biosph\u00e8re, minus its acrylic shading canopy (which was lost to fire in the 1970s).Intended to be built in the middle of nowhere by inexpert hippies (kits were sold through the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/05/stewart-brand-whole-earth-catalog\"><em>Whole Earth Catalog</em></a>) the domes were designed to be durable and able to withstand high winds. But \u201canticipatory architects\u201d, designing after the oil shock for tough times ahead, loved their efficiency. Domes use a third less material in construction, and 33%-50% less energy than conventional houses, according to 1980s research. But this was probably the last time they were popular as residences. These days we are more familiar with them as showcase structures, such as <a href=\"http://www.edenproject.com/\">the Eden project</a> or Disney\u2019s Epcot.</p> <p>Now it\u2019s time to break out and rediscover the freedoms of freedomes. At <a href=\"http://geo-dome.co.uk/\">Geo-dome</a> you\u2019ll find kits.

Your geodome won\u2019t provide all the answers, but it gives you a harmonious space in which to ponder the future.</p> <h2>The big picture: Flood House</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7e07f4602b7ef615991c7b1162e46b5a5b716a4c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e07f4602b7ef615991c7b1162e46b5a5b716a4c/0_624_2299_1379/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Flood House, a floating weather station, at low tide in front of a pier\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Weather permitting: Flood House, the floating weather station.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Brotherton-Lock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Arts programme <a href=\"http://radicalessex.uk/\">Radical Essex</a> aims to reclaim the county from perceptions generated by shows such as <em>The Only Way is Essex</em>.

      "body": "<p>For the past 20 years I\u2019ve put two ideas about power to the scientific test. The first is Machiavelli\u2019s: \u201cIt is better to be feared than loved.\u201d This thesis has not fared well in studies looking at who rises to power in organisations, schools, communities and military units. It isn\u2019t the coercive, manipulative Machiavellian who rises to power. Instead it is the empathetic, generous person who reaches out to others who gains esteem and rises up the ranks.</p> <p>Lord Acton\u2019s observation that \u201cpower tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely,\u201d however, is confirmed time and time again. As we enjoy elevated power, we are more likely to eat impulsively, have sexual affairs, violate the rules of the road, lie, cheat, shoplift, take sweets from children and communicate in disrespectful ways.</p> <p>Putting these two literatures together leads us to the power paradox. The socially intelligent practices that enable us to rise to power in the first place \u2013 empathy, sharing, open-mindedness, a focus on others \u2013 vanish when we get power. It isn\u2019t just politicians, kings of high finance or drug-addled rock stars who are vulnerable to falls from power. The power paradox can undermine the social life of any of us.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Romantic partners who express gratitude were more than three times less likely to break up</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>How can we avoid losing power and enjoy enduring respect, esteem and influence? One clue comes from studies of those in power. When we gain power our attention shifts from a focus on others to what is gratifying for us, leading quickly to the abuse of power. Transcending the power paradox is therefore quite simple: just focus on the interests, humanity and dignity of the people around you.</p> <p>This gives rise to the expression of gratitude, perhaps the most important basis of enduring power. For economist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/adam-smith-international-partner-zone\">Adam Smith</a>, gratitude \u2013 the feeling of reverence for what others give to us \u2013 is the glue to healthy communities: \u201cThe duties of gratitude are perhaps the most sacred of those which the beneficent virtues prescribe to us.\u201d Empirical science agrees: gratitude, even a simple \u201cthank you\u201d, is a basis of power.</p> <p>We can choose to express gratitude in so many ways \u2013 public recognition, expressing appreciation by email, by knowing eye contact, a deferential bow, and acknowledging what another person believes. My research has shown that even brief touches to a person\u2019s arm can communicate gratitude \u2013 they trigger activation in the reward circuits of the recipient\u2019s brain and soothe stress-related physiology.</p> <p>Expressions of gratitude create strong, collaborative ties and pave the way for greater influence. Studies find that individuals who express gratitude to others as groups are forming have stronger ties within the group months later. Romantic partners who express gratitude to their partners in casual conversations were more than three times less likely to break up six months later. When experimenters touch participants on the arm in a friendly fashion, those individuals are more likely to sign petitions and co-operate with a stranger. When teachers encourage students with a pat on the shoulder, those students are three to five times more likely to try solving hard problems. Simply being thanked for completed work led participants to be twice as likely to volunteer for more.</p> <p>Succumbing to the power paradox is the source of so many ills in our social life: anxiety, unethical behaviour and arrogance. But solutions can be found in quotidian practices focused on others, such as the simple \u201cthank you\u201d that punctuates our daily lives.</p> <p>The Power Paradox<em> by Dacher Keltner is out now (Allen Lane, \u00a316.99, or \u00a313.59 at </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/393435/\"><em>bookshop.theguardian.com</em></a><em>)</em></p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-22T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>After my boy died from meningitis in 1992, one of the things I wanted to do was compile and release a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Now-Time-Be-Various/dp/B0000083ND\">CD of WB Yeats poems</a> performed by musicians and artists in his memory. Bereavement causes peculiar reactions such as that. That is why I and my friend and co-producer Frank Dunne found ourselves in the lobby of the Savoy waiting to meet Richard Harris. He had agreed to recite a couple of poems for the project.</p> <p>We told the receptionist we had been invited to go to Harris\u2019s suite. After a few whispered exchanges on the phone we were informed that Mr Harris had changed his mind and therefore could we wait in the bar until someone came to see us? Frank and I sat down in the Art Deco American Bar, unsure what the news meant, but certain it was not good. We were going to get blown out. A flunkey was on the way down to give us the news.</p> <p>Then we saw an odd-looking gent peering in at us from the threshold. Whatever the bar dress code was, this man was breaking it. He wore shapeless grey jogging pants, a green rugby jersey, a white bathrobe tied at the waist and flipflops. It was Richard Harris and he was coming towards us.</p> <p>\u201cAre you the Yeats boys?\u201d he asked in a deep growling rasp. We said we were. \u201cMy voice has gone. I can\u2019t do it.\u201d He was a man you could describe as hoarse. But instead of turning on his heels, he pulled up a chair and sat down. He had, he explained, been up all night shouting at rugby on the telly from Australia. That was why his voice was shot.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It was dazzling storytelling. It was part performance, undoubtedly, but he just loved words, what they could do</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I like to think he sensed our disappointment and wanted to make amends, or maybe he had a couple of hours to kill. Whatever, he called over the waiter. \u201cThree bellinis,\u201d Harris croaked. \u201cI don\u2019t drink any more but these are good here \u2013 better than in Venice.\u201d Who were we to disagree?</p> <p>He spoke in a stage whisper, but he also had this habit of leaning in close and beckoning us to do the same, as if we were to be privy to the most extraordinary secrets. Three more bellinis. He talked of his own days playing rugby in Limerick, he talked of the remote parts of Donegal, he talked of his own poetry, and of sparring with Muhammad Ali at Ali\u2019s training camp in the hills. He called Brando \u201cMarlon\u201d. And on and on it went. It was dazzling storytelling. It was part performance, undoubtedly, with rehearsed punchlines, but he just loved words, what they could do, and he enjoyed his talent for using them well. Of the recording, he said nothing.</p> <p>After four or five rounds of bellinis, he announced he couldn\u2019t stay longer. \u201cCome back tomorrow, boys \u2013 we\u2019ll get it done then.\u201d The waiter said there was no bill. We stumbled out. Through the fug of my first \u2013 and so far only \u2013 pre-lunch bellini binge, I was unsure if I remembered the new arrangements correctly. Would it really happen?</p> <p>The next day we were shown straight to his suite. He was a man transformed, serious and engaged; at work. His own Yeats paperback was already out and annotated. We ran through the poems a couple of times. The room fell silent. Frank pressed \u201crecord\u201d. Harris nailed it.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>Most IQ tests involve answering a whole load of difficult questions. But here\u2019s one with just two. Best of all, they\u2019re simple:</strong></p> <p><strong>1. Does living in a crowded area get you down?<br /></strong><strong>(a) a lot (b) a bit (c) not at all</strong></p> <p><strong>2. Would you prefer to socialise with friends every day as opposed to just once or twice a week?<br /></strong><strong>(a) hell, yeah! (b) maybe a bit (c) no</strong></p> <p>If you said (b) or (c) for the first question and (c) for the second, then you are showing the response pattern typical of intelligent people. In general, living in an area with high-population density is associated with lower levels of life satisfaction. However, the study on which this quiz is based found that high-population density had a larger negative effect for the lower IQ group (an average of 81, as measured by a standard IQ test) than the higher IQ group (an average of 116). Standard IQ tests are designed so that the average for the population as a whole is 100.<br /></p> <p>What is more, hanging out with friends every day, as opposed to just a couple of times a week, is associated with greater life satisfaction among the lower IQ group but lower satisfaction among the brainboxes. Interestingly, these geniuses don\u2019t seem to be smart enough to recognise what makes them happy. The study found intelligent people tended to socialise more often than less intelligent people, even though they generally derived less pleasure \u2013 and more irritation \u2013 from doing so.</p> <p><em>A fully referenced version of this article is available at </em><a href=\"https://benambridge.wordpress.com/\"><em>benambridge.com</em></a><em>.

      "body": "<p>Of all the world\u2019s great cuisines served in the UK, Thai food has taken a surprisingly long time to get a 21st-century makeover. There are kimchi burritos, sourdough pizzas and North Carolina barbecues on many street corners \u2013 at least in major cities. But until recently Thai restaurants \u2013 even in hippest Hackney \u2013 have been conservative in their outlook: green and red curries, papaya salads, hot and sour soup. Not forgetting the ubiquitous pad Thai, that MSG-laden heap of peanut dust, noodles and slivers of flavourless meat that is guaranteed to cause you to slump, exhausted, into your bowl. The more interesting regional dishes have remained known mainly to Thais.</p> <p>\u201cPad Thai is not even a very traditional Thai dish,\u201d laughs Ben Chapman, co-founder of <a href=\"http://smokinggoatsoho.com/\">Smoking Goat</a>. \u201cIt was basically introduced by the Thai government [in the 40s] to get people to eat more rice noodles.\u201d</p> <p>For the past 18 months, in his tiny bar-restaurant on Denmark Street in Soho, London, Chapman has been doling out a different kind of Thai food. It comes cooked over hot coals and bristling with flavours: nahm yum scallops served on the half-shell; aged beef short rib with massaman and pickles; five spice pork belly. Later this year they will open another, bigger site on the other side of Soho.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8623dfcd75d7c8c9514310096fd6a030d848aa29\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8623dfcd75d7c8c9514310096fd6a030d848aa29/0_4300_6200_3719/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Signature dish: smoked goat shoulder with Thai herbs.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Signature dish: smoked goat shoulder with Thai herbs.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pal Hansen for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>They\u2019re perhaps the most prominent exponents of a new kind of Thai cooking, much closer to the food that many British tourists will have tasted in the north and northeast of Thailand.</p> <p>\u201cThe first time I ate good Thai food I fell in love,\u201d Chapman says. \u201cIt was food in glorious technicolour \u2013 spicy, umami, sour, sugar \u2013 all at the same time. To me that was astonishing. I wanted to eat it again, but there was nowhere in Britain I could, so I had to learn how to cook it.\u201d</p> <p>While the flavours are heavily influenced by northern Thai cuisine, many of the ingredients are adjusted for the UK. You\u2019ll be hard pressed to find a short rib in Chiang Mai, for instance. \u201cNone of it is verbatim Thai food,\u201d he says. \u201cFor example, our aromatics are very different. Their mint is much smaller and sweeter; here it\u2019s garden mint, which is slightly bitter. Coriander here is slightly soapy, whereas there it\u2019s brighter. In some cases you can work around it. If you are making a nam tok, for instance, a classic northern Thai dish, but you know your mint is weaker, you can use less of it and add sweetness to the stock instead.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3fd87aa087625be6a15d87d001e50cc3f4604b31\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3fd87aa087625be6a15d87d001e50cc3f4604b31/1744_2000_6009_3607/1000.jpg\" alt=\"From left, Mark Dobbie, Tom George and Andy Oliver of Som Saa.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Life after pad Thai: (from left) Mark Dobbie, Tom George and Andy Oliver of Som Saa.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Pal Hansen for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Commercial Street in east London, people are queuing for more than two hours for a table at <a href=\"http://www.somsaa.com/\">Som Saa</a>, another restaurant specialising in regional Thai dishes. Among the dishes the diners are waiting to sample are silky panang curries of braised beef cheeks and isaan hot soup that stops just short of blowing your head off. It\u2019s a wider menu than the one at Smoking Goat, taking in southern as well as northern regional Thai cuisine.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You put balls of meat on top of fruit with coriander and chilli. It\u2019s an amazing explosion of flavour and freshness</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The permanent site has just opened off the back of a successful stay at Climpson\u2019s Arch in Hackney. Founders Andy Oliver and Tom George funded the site through Crowdcube, which offered hungry diners the chance to get involved.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re writing a hypothetical business plan for a restaurant, it\u2019s much easier if you have a version of the restaurant that people can see,\u201d says Oliver. \u201cThen if they like it they can invest. It means we don\u2019t just have one big investor who comes down and says he doesn\u2019t like the tables or tells us to use cheaper prawns.\u201d</p> <p>Although they are ostensibly Smoking Goat\u2019s rivals, there is also a sense of esprit de corps. They have all known each other for years. Along with Peckham\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.thebeggingbowl.co.uk/\">Begging Bowl</a>, run by New Zealander Jane Alty, they are the leading lights of the new wave of regional Thai cooking. It might be an obvious thing to point out, but none of the people involved in this new wave seem to be Thai, though Chapman says he has plenty of Thai customers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"280641b618e5c86151df6009a4bdb1e7936e90f1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/280641b618e5c86151df6009a4bdb1e7936e90f1/0_180_5400_3240/1000.jpg\" alt=\"'Food comes cooked over hot coals and bristling with flavours': (from left) gaeng gari jay, gaeng juet het, sticky rice, pad pak, and nahm dtok pla thort\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Food comes cooked over hot coals and bristling with flavours\u2019: (from left) gaeng gari jay, gaeng juet het, sticky rice, pad pak, and nahm dtok pla thort.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Steve Joyce</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>All three restaurants are indebted to <a href=\"http://pokpokny.com/\">Pok Pok</a> in New York and the Australian chef David Thompson\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.comohotels.com/travel-and-media/press-release/david-thompson-feels-masterchef-effect-nahm\">Nahm</a>, which introduced regional Thai food at the higher end of the market in 2001 and is still going strong. Oliver and Alty worked there themselves.</p> <p>\u201cI always liked Asian recipes more than western ones,\u201d Oliver says. \u201cFrom a young age I was cooking Madhur Jaffrey\u2019s recipes, then I travelled round Asia at 19, trying everything. I took a graduate job after uni but packed it in to go to various kitchens \u2013 Moro, Maze, Bocca di Lupo \u2013 before David offered me a job at Nahm. I had no knowledge but a lot of enthusiasm. I never looked back.</p> <p>\u201cThe techniques are totally different. One of the first things you make is ma haw, which is minced pork and minced chicken that has been cooked with coriander, garlic, pepper, fish sauce, palm sugar and all sorts of other seasonings until it\u2019s almost like a caramel. You put balls of this on top of fruit with coriander and chilli. You could spend 1,000 years in a western kitchen and never even consider doing that. Three proteins mixed together is bizarre to a westerner, and the meat is overcooked by about 45 minutes by our standards. But the result is delicious. I like breaking the rules.\u201d</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 23 May 2016 to remove a reference to chef Seb Holmes, who no longer works with Ben Chapman.<br /></p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>Pieropan Soave Classico, Italy 2015 (from \u00a312.15, </strong><a href=\"http://etonvintners.com\"><strong>Eton Vintners</strong></a><strong>; </strong><a href=\"http://nywines.co.uk\"><strong>Noel Young Wines</strong></a><strong>) </strong>As a name, Soave promises so much: smooth, sophisticated, suave \u2013 a Marcello Mastroianni of a wine. Sadly, however, as Andrea Pieropan, one of two brothers running a family firm with their father in this corner of the Veneto in north east Italy, says, \u201cmost people know it for huge production\u201d and \u201cpoor, simple\u201d wines. Not so Pieropan, whose wines really do have something of La Dolce Vita about them, gentle but incisive dry whites that manage to be simultaneously mouth filling and mouth watering. That the region is still rather undervalued is good news for wine lovers, in that it keeps the prices down, relatively speaking: if it came from a starrier place, their straight Classico would be several pounds more expensive.</p> <p><strong>Pieropan Calvarino, Soave Classico, Italy 2013 (from \u00a314.95, </strong><a href=\"http://thewinesociety.com\"><strong>The Wine Society</strong></a><strong>; </strong><a href=\"http://invinitywines.co.uk\"><strong>Invinity Wines</strong></a><strong>) </strong>The twin jewels in the Pieropan crown are the single-vineyard wines, Calvarino and La Rocca, which have been among the very best whites in Italy for more than 40 years now. Calvarino came first, the fruit of a plot owned by the family since 1901, and, in 1971, the first wine in Soave (and one of the first in Italy) to be made from a single vineyard: a steep-sloped patch in the heart of the Soave zone planted to local grape varieties garganega and trebbiano di Soave. This is a wine that ages quite beautifully \u2013 in London a couple of weeks ago, Andrea showed vintages back to 1986, with each vintage adding an extra level of intensity but always showing the pure leafy green herb, almonds, pear and salty fresh minerals that are just starting to unfurl in the still-youthful 2013.</p> <p><strong>Pieropan La Rocca, Soave Classico, Italy 2013 (\u00a321.95, </strong><a href=\"http://slurp.co.uk\"><strong>Slurp</strong></a><strong>; </strong><a href=\"http://thewinesociety.com\"><strong>The Wine Society</strong></a><strong>) </strong>If Calvarino always has an air of spring about it, then La Rocca, a 100% garganega from a vineyard right by a medieval castle just east of Verona is deeper, more autumnal. In the younger vintages, it still carries a slight hint of the oak barrels in which it is made \u2013 and while still having that Pieropan signature of softly incisive acidity and salty freshness, it\u2019s slightly less appealing than the easy charm of Calvarino. By the time it reaches 20 years of age or more, however, (and there\u2019s no reason to think the 2013 won\u2019t last that long) it develops a fabulous spicy intensity: roses, honey, bitter herbs and almonds.</p> <p><em>Follow David on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daveydaibach\">@Daveydaibach</a></em></p>",

The answer to defeating the people smugglers cannot be indefinite detention. That is what the government is pushing. </p> <p>\u201cThe truth of the matter, this government has let delays blow out. They have not been transparent in terms of the treatment of people in our care. I sympathise with what Tim Costello is saying.</p> <p>\u201cThe best answer is to defeat the people smugglers and make sure that the people in our care, directly or indirectly, get proper resettlement.\u201d</p> <p>Shorten reiterated Labor\u2019s commitment to prevent drowning at sea, including by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jul/25/bill-shorten-wins-freedom-to-use-boat-turnbacks-but-leadership-split-on-issue\">use of controversial boat towbacks</a>, which he has been at pains to stress after the government spent two weeks on the campaign trail suggesting Labor\u2019s policies would lead to more boats of asylum seekers coming to Australia.</p> <p>At a doorstop in Sydney on Sunday, Malcolm Turnbull said: \u201cWell, I don\u2019t accept what Tim Costello says there.</p> <p>\u201cIt is absolutely critical that we maintain a secure border protection policy and that is why it is absolutely critical that people who seek to come to Australia through the services of people smugglers are not able to settle in Australia.\u201d</p> <p>The UN has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2016/may/18/australias-indefinite-detention-of-refugees-illegal-un-rules\">ruled that Australia\u2019s indefinite detention of refugees</a> on secret security grounds is arbitrary and illegal.
