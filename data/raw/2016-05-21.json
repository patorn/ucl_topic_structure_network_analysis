      "body": "<p>The New South Wales government <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/12/nsw-council-mergers-19-new-local-bodies-created-under-forced-plan\">has announced the creation of 19 new councils</a>, replacing 42 existing councils. It also announced in-principle support to reduce a further 23 councils to nine, pending court challenges.</p> <p>The process has been severely criticised, with anger about the limited consultation conducted by the state government, and strong opposition to larger councils in some communities.</p> <p>While announcing a series of amalgamations, the state government also dropped a number of other amalgamation proposals.</p> <p>A number of those rejected lay within key Coalition marginal seats. Kiama has avoided being swallowed up into Shoalhaven (within the seat of Gilmore) and the Hills Shire\u2019s hostile takeover of Hawkesbury (within Greenway) was defeated at the final hurdle. A merger of Tamworth and Walcha councils was rejected thanks to lobbying by local MP Barnaby Joyce.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/18/luke-foley-mike-bairds-forced-council-mergers-are-a-disgraceful-rort\">Mike Baird\u2019s forced council mergers are a disgraceful rort | Luke Foley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yet most amalgamations went ahead, including those in marginal seats. Liberal MPs on slim margins in <a href=\"http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/nsw/banks.htm\">Banks</a>, <a href=\"http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/nsw/reid.htm\">Reid</a>, <a href=\"http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/nsw/eden-monaro.htm\">Eden-Monaro</a>, <a href=\"http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/nsw/dobell.htm\">Dobell</a> and <a href=\"http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/nsw/robertson.htm\">Robertson</a> have all seen a number of their local councils amalgamated.</p> <p>There was clearly some community anger against amalgamations in places such as Kiama, but it\u2019s not yet clear whether this anger exists in other marginal seats, and whether it\u2019s enough to impact the federal election.</p> <p>The state government had a clear agenda of supporting bigger councils, but tried to cover that agenda by claiming that an independent tribunal had assessed councils\u2019 \u201cfitness\u201d \u2013 in reality most councils which were judged as \u201cunfit\u201d actually met all the financial criteria, and only failed due to their size.</p> <p>There is also clear evidence of partisan meddling in the proposed boundaries. While some new councils cover distinct communities, others don\u2019t. Botany Bay and Rockdale will be merged, despite little connection, instead of being merged with the eastern suburbs and Georges River councils respectively. This has the convenient effect of improving the Liberal party\u2019s position in neighbouring councils.</p> <p>The City of Parramatta\u2019s boundaries have shifted north, gaining some Liberal-voting suburbs on its northern boundary (in itself a reasonable new boundary) while cutting out Labor-voting Granville. This has the effect of making Parramatta (with all the benefits of covering Sydney\u2019s second CBD) a Liberal-leaning council while creating a similarly sized Labor-leaning council with much less financial power immediately to the south.</p> <p>All local councillors representing the 19 new councils created have been sacked (including this author\u2019s wife), and presumably those representing the nine other new councils will shortly follow. Elections for these new councils have been postponed to September 2017. This means that these communities will be without local elected representation for well over a year.</p> <p>Two million residents, or 27% of the entire state population, have been left without elected local representation for 15 months, and another 1.6m (about 21%) will be joining them soon. This leaves almost half of the state without local councils until September 2017.</p> <p>These new communities will be governed by government-appointed administrators (or as the former mayor of Leichhardt described them, \u201cLiberal party dictators\u201d), which could have a significant effect on the political direction of these councils.</p> <p>Local councils don\u2019t just pick up the rubbish \u2013 they are also political bodies that hold political positions.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/12/nsw-council-mergers-19-new-local-bodies-created-under-forced-plan\">NSW council mergers: 19 new local bodies created under forced plan</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All three councils amalgamated into the Inner West council were strongly opposed to the WestConnex motorway. Undoubtedly a newly elected super-council for this area would take a similar position, but in the meantime it seems very unlikely that the state government\u2019s administrator will permit the new council to take a position.</p> <p>These new councils will also have to make decisions about levels of service where it varies between the different parts of the new council \u2013 how often do the bins get picked up? What other local community services does the council provide, and does it outsource its operations? Handpicked state government administrators will likely take all of these highly political decisions, which will have an impact on the services provided to these communities.</p> <p>Even after this announcement, the process from here on is not yet clear. It appears that council elections will be scattered on three election dates in September 2016 (for unaffected councils), March 2017 (for councils who avoided amalgamation) and September 2017 (for the new councils). </p> <p>New South Wales will be talking about the future shape of its councils for a while to come.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-22T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>For David Haye nothing less than an \u201cexplosive knockout\u201d would suffice against Arnold Gjergjaj on Saturday night and that is what he delivered. Gjergjaj may have come into this fight undefeated and confident of putting on a \u201cspecial\u201d performance but he simply had no response to the force and fury unleashed upon him, with Haye wrapping up victory inside two rounds.</p> <p>This was Haye\u2019s second contest since returning to the heavyweight scene, following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/16/david-haye-kocks-out-mark-de-mori-boxing-comeback\" title=\"\">January\u2019s 131-second demolition of Australian Mark De Mori</a>, also at this venue, and in truth it was always going to be a case of when rather than if the 35-year-old secured the win that extended his overall record to 28 wins (26 by knockout) and two defeats. Gjergjaj may have won all 29 of his previous bouts, with 21 coming via knockout, but the bulk of his victims have been substandard and, bar one occasion, all been defeated in Switzerland, Gjergjaj\u2019s country of residence having moved there from Kosovo aged 14.</p> <p>\u201cThe Cobra\u201d is a hometown fighter with an undistinguished record and he crumbled in the bright lights of London.</p> <p>Haye was in control from the first bell, flooring Gjergjaj inside 40 seconds with a lightning fast left-right combination before patiently waiting behind a jab for another opportunity to hurt the 31-year-old.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/16/qa-david-haye-boxer-my-guiltiest-pleasure-crisps-late-at-night\">Q&amp;A: David Haye, boxer: \u2018My guiltiest pleasure? Crisps, late at night\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That came at the start of the second round and Haye yet again floored Gjergjaj, this time with a left jab. Yet again the man from Basel rose to his feet but he was clearly shaken, clearly out of his depth, and found himself with nowhere to go after Haye pinned him up against the ropes and unleashed a barrage of shots, the last of which was a chopping right.</p> <p>The referee, Terry O\u2019Connor, stopped the fight one minute and 35 seconds into the round.</p> <p>For Haye, this contest was not just about winning but also impressing as he looks to prove he has what it takes to return to the summit of the division. The former WBA champion\u2019s ability to do that had been questioned by Lennox Lewis, who feels Haye\u2019s decision to bulk up under his new trainer, Shane McGuigan, had taken away some of his trademark speed. The Bermondsey man came into this fight 13lb lighter than Gjergjaj but, at 16 stones, was a stone heavier than during his reign as champion. However, as was also the case against De Mori, Haye did not look compromised in front of a sell-out 02 Arena crowd, which included Manchester United\u2019s manager-in-waiting, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho.</p> <p>After two routine wins, it is now time for Haye to step up a level. He has made no secret of his desire to take on Anthony Joshua for the 26-year-old\u2019s IBF title. But Joshua\u2019s promoter, Eddie Hearn, has said that all-British dust-up is at least a \u201cyear away\u201d, so Haye confirmed here that he will stick by his word and face the veteran American Shannon Briggs in September.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/23/david-haye-plans-for-professional-boxers-compete-rio-2016-olympics-insane\">David Haye: plans for professional boxers to compete at Olympics are insane</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The former two-times world champion has literally pursued a fight with Haye, turning up uninvited at his promotional events, shouting abuse into his face, until the Brit cracked and agreed to take on the 44-year-old from Brooklyn on the basis they both triumphed here. Briggs faced Emilio Ezequiel Zarate on the undercard and won with ease, knocking out his Argentinian opponent with a viscous right to the side of the body two minutes and 22 seconds into the first round.</p> <p>Such was the power with which Briggs took out Zarate, to extend his 24-year career record to 60-6-1, that the loser required oxygen after a prolonged period lying on the canvas.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to seeing big fights next year but more immediately I\u2019ve got Briggs,\u201d said Haye. \u201cI\u2019ll flatten him in September.\u201d</p> <p>A battle with Briggs may not offer Haye a world title shot but it is sure to generate more interest than there has been around the De Mori and Gjergjaj fights. After all, this is a man who has shared a ring with the likes of George Foreman and Vitali Klitschko and, as his behaviour in recent weeks show, is not shy of saying and doing the sort of things that create headlines and puts bums on arena seats. There was more of the same here after Briggs had to be held back by security staff, after trying to confront Haye following his victory over Gjergjaj. \u201cLet\u2019s go champ,\u201d the American repeatedly chanted at ringside. An autumn clash between the pair is likely to be explosive in and out of the ring.</p>",

      "headline": "Flirting with Trump? No, the US will vote for a Boulder solution",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-22T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>The future is here and it works. Importantly, it is not a conservative future. Boulder, Colorado, is not as famous as San Francisco or even Palo Alto \u2013 but this city of some 100,000, where the high plains end and the Rocky Mountains begin, is the leading American urban area of the 21st century. It is a bewildering alchemy of 1960s hippy culture, frontier technologies, thoughtful urban planning and burgeoning service jobs ranging from diet counselling to advanced road bike maintenance. Boulder has become the exemplar of how rich and satisfying urban life can be. It is also a Democrat stronghold.</p> <p>It has been voted the US\u2019s brainiest city, its happiest city, the country\u2019s foodiest place and the number one city for health. It is a standing reproach to Donald Trump, and indeed Britain\u2019s rightwing Brexiteers who ape his thinking. The place is booming around values and principles to which they are hostile \u2013 but attracting families, entrepreneurs and innovators from all round the US because it is such a delightful place in which to live and work.</p> <p>Who wants to be in neighbourhoods that incorporate the values of Trump-style populists or their first cousins, the Brexiteers, where intolerance and hostility to others are the new normal? One Boulderite told me that after her five-year-old started using Trump\u2019s turns of phrase she now turns off the TV when he appears \u2013 she wants her daughter to be no part of anything he represents. No presidential candidate should say of his woman rival \u201c if she can\u2019t satisfy her husband, what makes her think she can satisfy America\u201d or of a heckler: \u201cI\u2019d like to punch him in the face.\u201d Five-year-olds pick up on such language fast.</p> <p>For Boulder above all is tolerant, the precondition for embracing the new \u2013 the cultural legacy of the hippy colonies who came here in the 60s. It doesn\u2019t regard climate change and concern for the environment as leftwing conspiracies, as Trump says \u201cbullshit, tax and a canard\u201d: it does all it can to make its city liveable \u2013 it was the first US city to levy a carbon tax in 2007. And while there is a vibrant entrepreneurial culture, nobody is so stupid as to think it\u2019s the result of being freed from suffocating government and regulation, as the ultra right insist. Whether it\u2019s the national agencies investigating quantum mechanics, the atmosphere, technology standards or astrophysics, Boulder is living proof of the thesis that wealth is co-created \u2013 between the public and private sectors.</p> <p>There are objections aplenty. Even fully paid-up admirers acknowledge that the place is a bit too pleased with itself. Trump would doubtless dismiss Boulder as the people\u2019s republic, scorning its efforts as political correctness gone mad: these are Bernie Sanders Democrats. Others would argue that too much from which Boulder benefits \u2013 its beauty, its access to one of the great open air wildernesses in the world, its plethora of high-tech public agencies that have attracted so many companies and its counter-cultural legacy \u2013 are all one-offs that can\u2019t be generalised into wider economic and social policies. Boulder itself is worried it is becoming a prisoner of its own success: house prices are soaring, for instance, and how does it ensure that the wealth is shared around?</p> <p>And yet. With so much pessimism that the west\u2019s economic model is broken, with economies bifurcating into a superclass of highly qualified high-tech professionals presiding over the mass of the population whose jobs are being automated and whose real wages are falling, Boulder and many towns like it provide hope that it can be different.</p> <p>The US\u2019s future, no more than Britain\u2019s, is not going to be relaunched on millions of blue-collar jobs in factories, even if Trump extends 500% tariffs to all Chinese manufacturing imports, renegotiates every US trade deal and forcibly repatriates 11 million illegal immigrants. The industrialised world is in the middle of an unprecedented digital revolution that is reinventing the way goods are made and services delivered: blaming the Chinese for \u201craping our country\u201d is not to confront the reality that manufacturing in the future is becoming ever more robotised \u2013 machines making machines.</p> <p>Moreover, as Martin Ford argues in <em>The</em> <em>Rise of the Robots</em>, robotisation is coming to white-collar work too: the thinking computer is in its infancy but already it can figure out standard legal agreements and even write articles in newspapers. Journalists and lawyers are as much at risk as truck drivers and factory workers. To compel Apple to make every iPhone in the US, Trump\u2019s answer to the challenge, is to miss completely the scale and profundity of what is happening .</p> <p>Which is why Sanders has done so well. You can either pull up the drawbridge, build 2,000- mile long walls and blame everything on foreigners \u2013 or try to shape the forces unleashed by digitalisation so they benefit everyone, which requires much more decisive and proactive public intervention than even Hillary Clinton contemplates. After all, there is plenty of wealth and infinite human need to be satisfied: what is required is to ensure the wealth is more evenly distributed. It\u2019s not only the rich who want to eat great food, hike along trails, wear attractive clothes, stretch their minds, stop worrying, live sustainably and not be lonely: it is everyone \u2013 and the jobs of the future lie in meeting these myriad needs. Some will even be done by immigrants.</p> <p>But this requires overhauling the way the US finances its infrastructure and nurtures its people. The country needs to repurpose its companies so they serve great needs rather than hoard $1.7tn in cash overseas. It can\u2019t allow its bridges, damns, tunnels, roads and water systems to decay in front of its eyes for fear of levying the taxes to pay for better. It can\u2019t permit its cities to become hazards to health and wellbeing. It must house its people. Public policy cannot be organised around looking after the interests of plutocrats: wealth creation requires well-funded public agencies alongside repurposed companies, together with consumers with the capacity to express their personal needs. It is time to tax \u2013 and time to spend.</p> <p>Trump will address none of that: <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-barry-goldwater-1156920.html\" title=\"\">Barry Goldwater</a> began a rightwing insurgency 50 years ago. It will be Trump\u2019s destiny to end it. He is opposed to all the good that a city like Boulder represents, and whose success \u2013 with the right national policies \u2013 could be reproduced more widely. In elections, the candidate who can own the future wins. Trump cannot own Boulder, or any of the culture or values that make it what it is. The US may flirt with Trump, but ultimately it will vote for more Boulders. It\u2019s the only possible future.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Tomorrow we turn the last corner into the final furlong. There will be precisely a month to go before Britain makes <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/eu-referendum\" title=\"\">its momentous choice.</a></p> <p>How stands the race? The money is saying that Remain is galloping towards the winning post. The bookies are lengthening their odds on a victory for the Outers and offering stingier rewards for a successful punt on In. The gambling community in the financial markets is betting the same way. The pound has been strengthening on rising expectations of a Remain vote. The clients of IG, a spread-betting firm founded by Ukipper Stuart Wheeler, make it an 80% chance that Britain will choose to continue with membership of the EU on 23 June.</p> <p>One explanation for this trend in sentiment is the state of the rival campaigns. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/mar/29/remain-campaign-failing-brexiters-wrong-but-passion\" title=\"\">In team</a> look professional, sound confident about their arguments, are consistent with their messages, have assembled a large cast drawn from many different parties and, even so, present a united face. The Outers have struggled to overcome the challenge of weaving a cohesive campaign from a quarrelsome gang of Ukippers and renegade Tory cabinet ministers. Their tunes are discordant and their strategy inconsistent. Their messaging has recently narrowed down to relentless \u2013 and increasingly wild \u2013 claims about immigration. They often sound like a campaign that expects defeat. There is also scope to wonder whether defeat for their side is actually the secret desire of some of the Outers. I think especially of Boris Johnson. Not being a complete idiot, he must be aware of the rule that the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2016/may/16/boris-johnsons-hitler-analogy-gains-little-newspaper-backing\" title=\"\">first person to bring Hitler into an argument</a> is automatically designated the loser of it. When he started going on about Adolf, was the former mayor of London trying to sabotage his own side? Many of his colleagues are utterly unconvinced that he sincerely wants Britain to leave the EU; everyone is in no doubt that he wants to be the next leader of his party. So it is not unreasonable to speculate that, for Mr Johnson, the dream result would be a narrow victory for Remain. That could pave his path to Downing Street, but wouldn\u2019t mean that he had to spend all his time at No\u00a010 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/28/if-britain-voted-to-leave-the-eu-what-would-happen-next\" title=\"\">unpicking our relationship with the EU</a>. That would be hideously complex and, as we know, detail is not his forte.</p> <p>Opinion polling is also shaping expectations about the outcome. Our latest Opinium poll indicates movement towards Remain. So have some other recent polls. Everyone says they are cautious about the polls, but they nevertheless influence perceptions. The most interesting result from our poll is not so much how respondents say they will vote, but what they expect the outcome to be. By a margin of more than two to one, they predict a victory for Remain. While three-quarters of Remain voters think their side will prevail, less than half of Leave supporters are anticipating a victory for their camp.</p> <p>So should the In crowd pre-order the victory party champagne? Absolutely not. There is no deadlier enemy of their cause than complacency.</p> <p>For a start, the polls may be wrong. In fact, some have to be because online surveys are producing dramatically different results from those conducted by phone. This has triggered lively debate among pollsters about which method is the more reliable. There are plausible arguments that online polls might be overstating the amount of support for Leave. Equally, there are plausible arguments that phone polls might be exaggerating backing for Remain. A frank answer has come from Martin Boon, head of <a href=\"http://www.icmunlimited.com/polls/\" title=\"\">ICM</a>, who observes: \u201cPolling has often depended on hidden error cancelling itself out, but it seems increasingly unlikely that pollsters can depend on that on this occasion. So you pay your money and you take your chance on what you believe.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s a leading pollster saying there\u2019s no certainty about which, if any, of the polls are getting it right. So, even the rival campaigns can\u2019t be sure where they really are. A senior strategist for one of the teams puts it well: \u201cIt is like playing a bizarre game of football where you don\u2019t know what the score is during the match because the referee doesn\u2019t let you know how many goals he has allowed until the final whistle is blown.\u201d</p> <p>Another reason for Remain not to be in the least bit complacent is what I\u2019ve previously dubbed the asymmetrical passion of the two sides. People who hate the EU tend to intensely hate the EU. That is a considerable motivator to cast a ballot. Few of those who favour Remain do so because they are bursting with love for the organisation. Rather, they think that it is a flawed club but one worth sticking with because, on balance, the downsides of membership are outweighed by the advantages. Many voters will fall into this category. For Remain to prevail, it has to mobilise these voters to cast their ballots. The grudging supporter of continued EU membership will be less likely to turn out if he or she is being told that they might as well not bother because the question is already settled.</p> <p>Victory for Remain is also highly dependent on persuading a lot of non-Tory voters to make the choice recommended by a Tory prime minister. The In team have been highly anxious about the attitude of the Labour leadership to the referendum. They now say that they are very encouraged that the party has started to get its act together since the local elections. Labour figures with experience of organising campaigns, such as the deputy leader <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/tom-watson\" title=\"\">Tom Watson</a>, have become fully engaged. One non-Labour strategist working for the In campaign recently spoke to me about the Labour effort in a tone of pleasant surprise: \u201cThey know how to organise a ground campaign.\u201d</p> <p>Yet there are continuing worries about getting non-Tory voters to the polls. One problem is the domination of the air war by blue-on-blue clashes. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/17/johnsons-obscene-remarks-may-have-ruined-his-chances-as-pm-says-heseltine\" title=\"\">Hezza savaging Bozza</a> is compelling entertainment for the media, but too much concentration on the slugfest between different factions of one party can leave non-Tory voters feeling disengaged. The pollster Michael Ashcroft has published fascinating snippets from focus groups that he\u2019s been conducting. He reports that a sample of voters in Glasgow were alienated from what seemed to them to be an argument between English people \u2013 and English people of a type they didn\u2019t like. \u201cI see it more as a leadership contest in the Tory party. When I see a choice that involved David Cameron, Bojo and Nigel Farage, I think \u2018that\u2019s a choice that doesn\u2019t involve me\u2019.\u201d There was an echo of that sentiment in a group the pollster convened in Birmingham. One participant complained: \u201cThose types of people are all samey \u2026 they all went to the same school.\u201d Another remarked: \u201cUsually I\u2019d say, \u2018What do the Tories want?\u2019 and do the opposite, but you can\u2019t even do that.\u201d</p> <p>There\u2019s an issue here for the broadcasters. They should remember that only 37% of people voted for the Tories at the last general election. Many more supported other parties. So a properly balanced debate is not merely having a representative of one blue faction grapple with a spokesperson for the other blue faction.</p> <p>A related challenge to the In campaign is media ennui. I read fellow political journalists groaning that there is still a month to go. We\u2019ve heard all the arguments by now, they lament, can\u2019t we just get the damn thing over with? This is a symptom of commentators\u2019 complaint, a potentially chronic condition that pundits must always try to guard against. Because we earn our living from paying close attention to politics, we can make the error of assuming that everyone else does, too. Most voters most of the time have more important things to worry about than politics. I agree with the strategist for the In team who remarked to me: \u201cMany people will only start to really pay attention in the last fortnight.\u201d</p> <p>This creates a conundrum. A lot of voters will really start to engage with the arguments just at the point when the media is thoroughly bored with reporting them. A low turnout, as some of the Outers have admitted, suits them. It does not at all favour the Remain cause. So one of their challenges is to find ways of re-presenting their big arguments in ways that are novel enough to encourage them to be reported.</p> <p>The In campaign believes it has won the most important argument \u2013 about the economy. George Osborne said as much in public a few days ago. I happen to agree. But the last thing he or anyone else on the Remain side should do is proclaim victory. Keep your smug face locked in a cupboard for the next month, George. The British people can be contrary when the mood takes them. Elites exuding any impression of entitlement are not fashionable at the moment. Any sense that the In campaign already feels entitled to claim victory in this referendum risks being punished at the polling booth.</p> <p>Whatever the bookies or pollsters or pundits are saying, voters have the last word. The In crowd should never, ever forget that.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Will Traynor, the handsome, wheelchair-using hero of the bestselling novel <em>Me Before You</em>, by British author Jojo Moyes, has already left millions of readers around the world sobbing and heartbroken. Now a leading West End director is inviting cinema audiences to go through it all again with the release of her first feature film.</p> <p>Thea Sharrock, who directed Tom Hiddlestone in Shakespeare\u2019s <em>Henry V</em> for the BBC in 2012, believes the fresh tears will be worth it, as the film offers a chance to pause and reflect on the real value of life.</p> <p>Her big-budget film version of the book stars Sam Claflin (best known for his role as Finnick Odair in <em>The Hunger Games</em>) as Traynor. It has a screenplay by Moyes and is out on 3 June in a bid to become the blockbusting weepie of the summer. True to the novel, which has so far sold six million copies, it tells an unconventional love story. At its emotional core are Traynor, a quadriplegic former jet-setting banker, and his hapless carer, Lou, who is played by <em>Game of Thrones</em> star Emilia Clarke.</p> <p>\u201cI wanted to stick to the universal theme of the simple and yet wonderful way these people fall in love, while creating a space for people to think about what matters,\u201d said Sharrock, adding that she sees the subjects of life-altering disability and the morality of euthanasia as difficult rather than \u201cdark\u201d.</p> <p>The director, known in theatre for directing Daniel Radcliffe in Peter Shaffer\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2007/mar/04/theatre\"><em>Equus,</em></a> and Benedict Cumberbatch in an award-winning revival of Terence Rattigan\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2010/jun/09/after-the-dance-theatre-review\"><em>After the Dance</em></a>, has kept Moyes\u2019s romance as streamlined as possible, focusing on its serious central issue: what might make life worth living if you are a wheelchair user?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Eh993__rOxA\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Eh993__rOxA?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\u201cI wanted to get across how rare it is that we allow someone into our lives and trust them to show us a different way to exist,\u201d said Sharrock, who watched the 1970 hit <em>Love Story</em> in preparation for filming. \u201cCrying in the cinema can be quite a release anyway, especially if there are a couple of laughs as well. It is a bit like yoga or a therapy session. It is so easy in modern life to lose sight of how we feel about things. It was never in my mind to pass judgment, though.\u201d</p> <p>Her aim, the director said, was to underline some important priorities: adventure and love. \u201cBy the end, the question becomes: who is it who saves who?\u201d Claflin was given the lead role after a number of actors with disabilities were considered. \u201cWe spoke to a few, but there were limited options, with due respect to those we saw,\u201d she said. \u201cTo be honest, it was always going to be a question of finding someone who would meet what the studio was going to require as well as what we needed. And I believe any really good actor should be able to give you what you need. To his credit, Sam took a lot of time with the physicality of the part. He gave it a huge amount of weight and, of course, we gave it a lot of attention on set.\u201d</p> <p>Sharrock, Claflin and Steve Peacocke, who plays Nathan, a trained nurse, researched the impact of quadriplegia together for the film. The three spent time in hospital talking to patients with spinal injuries.</p> <p>\u201cThere are no absolutes, but there are things that often happen and we wanted to get those across. It is really important to me that the film seems real to anyone who knows anything about this kind of disability. Over five months, Sam and I sent each other lots of cuttings and book recommendations to work out how to create this character who does not do what you necessarily expect.\u201d</p> <p>Few scripts revolve around characters with disabilities and Sharrock hopes her film will represent part of an experience that has been largely ignored in film.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54a71c042c18c9cfcc0d1e7ceea1846397ae0b40\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54a71c042c18c9cfcc0d1e7ceea1846397ae0b40/0_68_4928_2957/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Thea Sharrock directing the film Me Before You\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Thea Sharrock directing the film Me Before You</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Bailey/Warner Bros</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cMy nephew is in a wheelchair and I hope he will be pleased to see this shown in a way that does not make audiences too uncomfortable. If we had shown Will being taken in and out of his chair, or put in a hoist over a bath, the impression we would give is of difficulty. I wanted to make it more normal.\u201d</p> <p>The novel\u2019s open attitude to assisted suicide made the book controversial in some quarters, and Sharrock listened to rival views before she shot the film.</p> <p>\u201cWe did not want to be dismissive of either side,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are a few well-known cases where people have made these choices and on the wards people knew patients who had done so. They were able to say that they understood, but that was not their story.\u201d</p> <p>Pembroke in Wales doubles for the English town with a castle where the novel is set, while Mallorca stands in for exotic Mauritius.</p> <p>\u201cI chose Pembroke Castle because I wanted a place that would show how differently people can live in the same area,\u201d said Sharrock. \u201cI felt from the first with the script that there was a fairytale element to it, with class a big factor.\u201d</p> <p>The fairytale approach even dictated the use of light in the film.</p> <p>\u201cWe kept it as English-looking as we could, so there is a greyness of tone,\u201d said Sharrock. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to show gritty Britain, because this is not about that. Then when Lou takes Will on holiday, it had to look as if she had tried her absolute best for him.</p> <p>\u201cBy the end of the story, when you get to Paris, then the audience can take a massive breath and see lots of things are ahead that would not have been possible if they had not met.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p> A flash of colourful hen houses built and painted to resemble a row of miniature beach huts, just yards from the busy A12 on the way to Lowestoft, is the first clue that <a href=\"https://www.darshamnurseries.co.uk\">Darsham Nurseries</a> is not your average garden centre.</p> <p>\u201cSo many people tell me they spent years driving past without ever coming in,\u201d admits David Keleel, Darsham\u2019s owner. But now the car park is regularly full. Two years after expanding the formerly derelict nursery \u2013 which followed a three-year battle to get planning permission for a shop and cafe \u2013 it is firmly on the local map, but as a destination renowned for its food more than its roses.</p> <p>Blythburgh pork cheeks and sauteed monkfish liver are as likely to feature on the menu as the vegetables and herbs grown in raised beds in the ornamental vegetable garden, or <em>potager</em>, alongside the sun-drenched cafe. This approach has paid off. Last year, the cafe\u2019s Mediterranean-style food earned the plaudit of being in the UK\u2019s top 100 restaurants according to <em>Restaurant Magazine</em>.</p> <p>Darsham is far from alone in its transformation from a place to buy daffodil bulbs to a \u201cdestination\u201d garden centre. Commercial pressures and changing consumer habits mean garden centres have had to raise their game to survive. A report from market research specialist Mintel this year showed that in 2014 garden centres and DIY chains had less than 60% of the garden product market due to inroads made by the likes of Waitrose, Ikea or The Range, and the expansion of online specialists such as Crocus and Primrose. Supermarkets now account for 12% and Amazon 9% of sales.</p> <p>Garden centre sales are also highly weather-dependent, so this year\u2019s cold and showers in April put a dampener on sales in traditional categories, but boosted non-traditional ones, according to the latest figures from the Garden Centre Association. Sales of house plants were up just under 2%, while sales of outdoor plants were down by 17% on the year before. By contrast, catering sales at garden centres \u2013 now worth \u00a3200m a year \u2013 were up by 9%.</p> <p>Food is becoming so crucial to the survival of many garden centres that next month the Horticultural Trade Association will hold its seventh conference for garden centre managers to help them learn more about how to raise the standards of their food and service. Experts who will attend include Henry Dimbleby, the founder of the Leon restaurant chain, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/17/the-art-of-service-maitre-ds-secrets-fred-sirieix\">Fred Sirieix</a>, general manager of the Michelin-starred Galvin at Windows on the 28th floor of the London Hilton on Park Lane.</p> <p>\u201cI do think garden centres can learn a lot about customer service, from greeting shoppers to making sure they have an enjoyable experience, with expert advice to hand when they need it,\u201d said Sirieix, who has become a familiar face to millions as the maitre d\u2019 in Channel 4\u2019s restaurant-based reality show, <em>First Dates</em>.</p> <p>Also giving tips at the conference will be Mike Lind, managing director of the award-winning, independent, family-run <a href=\"http://www.monktonelmgardencentre.co.uk\">Monkton Elm </a>in Taunton, Somerset, who says discerning shoppers want a wider choice of food and drink. \u201cWe opened our new restaurant around this time last year in a response to customer demand,\u201d he said. \u201cIt has a brand new kitchen with state-of-the-art equipment, seats 350 and offers a much greater selection than we could before.\u201d</p> <p>However, Lind insists: \u201cOur food is of course complementary to the main garden centre, which still remains a great draw for gardeners.\u201d</p> <p>The UK\u2019s largest chain of garden centres \u2013 with more than 150 outlets \u2013 is Wyevale, which has splashed out on 65 refurbishments of existing restaurants and cafes over the last 18 months. It has experimented with branded coffee shops and an award-winning in-house artisanal cafe concept that includes on-site micro-roasted coffee.</p> <p>\u201cA strong food and drink offer sits at the heart of ensuring our customers enjoy their visit and cement our positioning as a leisure destination,\u201d said Alex Shattuck, food and beverage commercial director at Wyevale. \u201cRevenues have grown by 60% since 2011. We have seen a steady rise in the trend of customers starting the day at their local garden centre, with breakfast sales showing strong growth.\u201d</p> <p>But the lure of award-winning food in a garden centre is not always a successful formula, as the owners of the Petersham garden centre in Richmond, south-west London, found after opening their cafe in one of the old greenhouses. Australian chef Skye Gyngell was put at the helm and her Mediterranean food gained the restaurant a Michelin star in 2011. But she later quit, claiming that the star had become \u201ca curse\u201d that was difficult to live up to.</p> <p>Back in Darsham Nurseries in Suffolk, even Keleel seems surprised by the popularity of the cafe. \u201cPeople often ask me when we are going to be doing a cookery book, but nobody has yet asked about a gardening book,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 23 May 2016. An earlier version said that the Horticultural Trades Association would be holding its first, rather than its seventh, catering conference.<br /></p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-22T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Each new month seems to bring with it another well-intentioned report on death and end-of-life care. So far in 2016 we have had the <em>End of Life Care Audit: Dying in Hospital</em> from the Royal College of Physicians, a report from the British Medical Association (<em>End-of-Life Care and Physician-Assisted Dying</em>), and a review from the Care Quality Commission (<em>A Different Ending: End of Life Care</em>).</p> <p>These various reports are marked by a kind of cloying earnestness, or \u201cchronic niceness\u201d, in the phrase of the hospital chaplain the Rev Peter Speck. On 9 May we had the Dying Matters Awareness Week. The number of government agencies and charities jostling for ownership of death is growing steadily.</p> <p>Western ideas about death are informed by secularism and individualism. The current discussion on death and dying, however, has been hijacked by the extremists on both sides. In the barren and neglected middle ground are truths that we have conveniently ignored. As contemporary issues, assisted suicide and advance directives are both a symptom of a deeper malaise (namely the obsession with personal autonomy and control) and a distraction. They are a distraction because the real issues are elsewhere.</p> <p>Our sense of common decency \u2013 of kindness \u2013 has become sclerosed. Kindness was the ingredient most lacking in the care of patients at Stafford hospital. Can common decency be regenerated by regulation and government diktat? We have witnessed, to our cost, the poisonous effects of targets, and the paradox (pointed out by Onora O\u2019Neill) that new regulations of professionals lead only to increased suspicion, rather than more accountability.</p> <p>Death, we are constantly told, has become \u201cmedicalised\u201d. Roughly half of all people dying in Britain or Ireland do so in a general hospital. Just over 20% die at home, and only 5% in a hospice. Large general hospitals are the best place to be when you are very sick but are ill-equipped to meet the needs of the dying. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/jul/15/liverpool-care-pathway-independent-review\" title=\"\">Liverpool care pathway</a>, a rather quixotic, tick-boxy attempt to give hospice-type care to people dying in general hospitals, was an abject failure. Acute hospitals are criticised, with some justification, for failing to care properly for the dying, yet society has handed over most of the responsibility for such care to these institutions.</p> <p>We have thrust on to doctors and hospitals the messy, intractable and insoluble aspects of life, principally old age and death. Some patients and their families have wildly unrealistic expectations of medicine, and their frustration may occasionally prompt them to take legal action. Decisions that doctors used to routinely make themselves are now being made by the courts, and judges are likely to become increasingly involved in decisions relating to end-of-life care. The \u201clawyerisation\u201d of death is as great a concern as its \u201cmedicalisation\u201d.</p> <p>Julia Neuberger, who chaired the inquiry that recommended the scrapping of the Liverpool care pathway, warned: \u201cThere needs to be a proper national conversation about dying. Otherwise doctors and nurses are likely to become the whipping boys for our inadequate understanding of how we die.\u201d My only quibble with this powerful statement is that doctors and nurses already are, and have been for some time, the \u201cwhipping boys\u201d.</p> <p>Modern scientific medicine, for all its achievements, has never been so unsure of itself. We are now in a late period of doubt and uncertainty. Medicine has slowly, almost imperceptibly, been transformed from a profession into a service industry. I have witnessed a profound disconnect between our publicly proclaimed pieties and what we actually do every day in our treatment of the dying, which is notable not for kindness, but for evasion, humbug, and what Dr <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2010/jan/22/kieran-sweeney-obituary\" title=\"\">Kieran Sweeney</a> called \u201ca hesitation to be brave\u201d.</p> <p>A 2003 study from Johns Hopkins University examined doctors\u2019 preferences for their own care at the end of life. The overwhelming majority did not want cardio-pulmonary resuscitation, dialysis, major surgery or tube feeding.</p> <p>Kindness should be a common currency for all \u2013 not something to be doled out solely by the professionals. Could the perceived \u201cproblem\u201d with death be partly due to the fact that, after decades of our culture being dominated by individualism and consumerism, our respect for other people has diminished? We have witnessed the paradox of rising life expectancy accompanied by a contemporary culture obsessed with youth and beauty, dismissive of the old. The arid spiritual dwarfishness of materialism has hardly helped. We see ourselves, in the phrase of Ivan Illich, as \u201cbundles of diagnoses\u201d.</p> <p>Our ancestors in pre-industrial Europe \u201ctamed\u201d death by communality and ritual. In our atomised societies, death has replaced sex as the new taboo; the churches have emptied and people no longer know how to \u201ctame\u201d death or how to mourn.</p> <p>There is a perception \u2013 even a consensus \u2013 that death is a problem that medicine should somehow sort out, that a \u201cgood death\u201d is something that doctors should be able to prescribe, as we might prescribe a course of antibiotics. But our needs are spiritual, not medical. Medicine\u2019s dominion should be limited and explicitly defined. Medicine, and our culture, would be healthier and happier if we stopped expecting it to solve our existential problems, if we stopped thinking of our bodies as machines, and if we gave up our fantasies of control and immortality.</p> <p>We cannot, like misers, hoard health; living uses it up. Nor should we lose it like spendthrifts. Health, like money, is not an end in itself; like money, it is a prerequisite for a decent, fulfilling life. The obsessive pursuit of health is a form of consumerism, and impoverishes us. Medicine should give up the quest to conquer nature, and revert to its traditional, creaturely role of accompanying the dying: the doctor as amicus mortis. It is as difficult, however, to advise someone how to die, as it is to advise them how to live. Death cannot be sanitised or workshopped. We are frail and vulnerable animals yet we have come to believe that everything that happens to us \u2013 including death \u2013 is our fault, our doing, our responsibility. Human agency has replaced the power of nature, in Freud\u2019s words, \u201cmajestic, cruel and inexorable\u201d.</p> <p><em>Seamus O\u2019Mahony is a consultant physician at Cork University hospital.

Teenage hooliganism is nothing new. Youth clubs have been smashed up and street battles fought before now, without provoking speeches from MPs and moral outrage from magistrates. Indeed it is difficult to know what is more depressing: the violent behaviour of the youngsters or the self-righteous reaction of some adults.</p> <p>But two serious questions remain. The first is whether the affrays at Brighton, Bournemouth and Margate, like the earlier ones at Clacton, signal some new development of which society should be aware.</p> <p>The other question is how we can prevent such incidents from recurring. It is clearly undesirable that hordes of teenagers should invade seaside resorts in search of trouble \u2013 whether as jokers, spectators or participants.</p> <h2><strong>Key quote</strong></h2> <p>\u200b\u201cThrough the high gloss of the older Hemingway\u2019s retrospection we can see a young man who was brash, perhaps, but also brave, honest and passionate.

      "body": "<p>Researchers at the University of Florida have found a man-eating African species of crocodile among native populations in the state\u2019s swamps and Everglades.</p> <p>It is unclear how the Nile crocodile, <em>Crocodylus niloticus</em>, which can grow up to 5.5 metres (18 feet) in length and was blamed for at least 480 attacks on people and 123 fatalities in Africa between 2010 and 2014, arrived in the state.</p> <p>But DNA analysis has confirmed that three juveniles have been identified in the state, including one that was relaxing on a house porch in Miami. The local alligators do not prey on humans, but the unwelcome imports have unsurprisingly made headlines in the state.</p> <p>Kenneth Krysko, a herpetology collections manager at the Florida Museum of Natural History, confirmed that the specimens are linked to native populations in South Africa. He told the journal <em>Herpetological Conservation and Biology</em> that the species can survive and potentially thrive in sub-tropical Florida.</p> <p>\u201cThe odds that the few of us who study Florida reptiles have found all of the Nile crocs out there is probably unlikely. We know that they can survive in the Florida wilderness for numerous years, we know that they grow quickly here and we know their behaviour in their native range, and there is no reason to suggest that would change here in Florida.\u201d</p> <p><em>Crocodylus niloticus</em> is considered a generalist, unfussy predator, and has clearly adapted to the local food supply, from native birds, fish and mammals, including domestic pets, to the state\u2019s native crocodile and alligator. The researchers looked at one juvenile specimen that grew nearly 28% faster than wild Nile crocodile juveniles.</p> <p>The three captured specimens were genetically identical, suggesting they came from the same source. But that source remains mysterious \u2013 the reptiles do not match with any Nile crocodiles currently housed in US zoos.</p> <p>However, the study noted that large groups of Nile crocodiles have been imported from South Africa and Madagascar, both for display at places such as Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom, and to supply Florida\u2019s pet trade. Pet owners are the most likely source of introduction.</p> <p>Florida has the world\u2019s largest number of invasive species. The spiny lionfish, believed to have been released during Hurricane Andrew in 1992, has caused devastation to native populations of reef-dwelling fish across the Caribbean. There is also the Cuban tree frog, which has been found as far north as Jacksonville.</p> <p>Short of the latest visitor, the invasive species that attracts the greatest attention is the Burmese python. These monsters are now common enough for authorities to organise and license python hunts.</p> <p>The <em>Miami Herald</em> reported in March that biologists bagged more than 2,000 pounds of Burmese pythons \u2013 in just one county. One snake, measuring almost 5\u00a0metres and weighing about 63kg (140 pounds), set a new record for males caught in the wild in Florida. Using radio trackers, scientists found the snakes like to occupy gopher tortoise burrows, and found six males and a female squeezed into a \u201cmating ball\u201d. They are so numerous they have become one of the region\u2019s top predators. Research suggests the pythons are responsible for a sharp decline in the population of Everglades marsh rabbits and for a decrease in deer.</p> <p>\u201cThe ecological impact of these animals is just over the top,\u201d said Ian Bartoszek, a biologist at the Conservancy of Southwest Florida. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to get a sense they eat bigger up the food chain.\u201d</p> <p>But now the state has new worries. According to the University of Florida study, its Atlantic coast and the entire Gulf of Mexico coastline are favourable for Nile crocodiles.</p> <p>\u201cMy hope as a biologist is that the introduction of Nile crocodiles in Florida opens everyone\u2019s eyes to the problem of invasive species that we have here in our state,\u201d Krysko said. \u201cNow here\u2019s another one, but this time it isn\u2019t just a tiny house gecko from Africa.\u201d</p> <p>However, Allyson Gantt, a spokeswoman for Everglades National Park, where one of the reptiles was found, rejected the idea that any Nile crocs were still roaming in the park.</p> <p>Some Everglades visitors might not be aware of the differences between crocodiles and alligators, complicating efforts to confirm any remaining crocs. Crocodiles have angular snouts, and their lower teeth are exposed when their mouths are closed. Alligator snouts are rounded, with few exposed lower teeth. Nile crocs are usually bronze or brownish yellow; by contrast, alligators are blackish green.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Last year\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/shows-events/rhs-chelsea-flower-show\">Chelsea flower show</a> represented the high point of a certain kind of traditional English horticultural charm. Returning to Chelsea for the first time in a decade, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/may/17/dan-pearsons-garden-at-the-chelsea-flower-show\">Dan Pearson</a> won best in show for the Chatsworth Garden, inspired by the stately home and, in fact, including huge stones brought down from the garden on enormous lorries. A trout stream ran through moss and willow.</p> <p>It was a joy, but Chelsea as a whole met with criticism that it was growing tired, with a lack of fresh voices in design. \u201cWe found that the number of female designers was actually decreasing,\u201d says Matthew Appleby, deputy editor of <a href=\"http://www.hortweek.com/\"><em>Horticulture Week</em></a>, \u201cbut the membership of the Guild of Landscape Designers is more than half women. The <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/\">RHS</a> [Royal Horticultural Society] wondered why it was happening, and it was because they weren\u2019t putting female designers on their shortlist.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about time,\u201d adds gardening writer and Chelsea veteran Val Bourne. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of talent among the women, but the top jobs tend to go to men.\u201d</p> <p>This year there are six main show gardens designed by women, up from two last year. Jo Thompson is perhaps the best established of them. She has designed the Chelsea Barracks Garden, sponsored by Qataria Diar. Rosy Hardy has created Forever Freedom for Brewin Dolphin, and Catherine MacDonald has created a garden for growers Hartley Botanic. Jekka McVicar, the doyenne of herbs, has moved away from the show tents to bring to life \u201ca modern apothecary\u201d. Hay Joung Hwang, originally from South Korea, has created the Smart Garden, sponsored by electronics giant LG.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6210820319fb3956fa968a201eb447ca2466adb7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6210820319fb3956fa968a201eb447ca2466adb7/238_366_3146_1887/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Star of the show: Juliet Sargeant, who designed the Modern Slavery Garden at Chelsea Physic Garden, London.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Star of the show: Juliet Sargeant, who designed the Modern Slavery Garden at Chelsea Physic Garden, London.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nick Harvey/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Even more radically, and somewhat late, 2016 will see the first black female designer create a garden at Chelsea. Juliet Sargeant aims to raise awareness of modern slavery. Her garden \u2013 in the Fresh category \u2013 will have an oak at its centre to represent the tree under which William Wilberforce sat when he decided to abolish slavery.</p> <p>\u201cWhen I was invited to design the garden [my race] didn\u2019t even occur to me, but I suppose I am [the first black female designer],\u201d Sargeant says. \u201cAnd I do think that it\u2019s important to say something. The industry isn\u2019t as diverse as it could be, and we need to ask ourselves why that is.</p> <p>\u201cThe RHS is a very, very traditional organisation, but hopefully things will start to change. I see lots of young people from different cultures enjoying their gardens, but that interest isn\u2019t reflected at Chelsea.\u201d</p> <p>Her garden has not been simple, either. \u201cAs it\u2019s an anti-slavery garden, we wanted to check that everything in our garden was slave-free, but it\u2019s an incredibly hard thing to guarantee \u2013 the supply chains from around the world are so complex.\u201d</p> <p>With Diarmuid Gavin, Andy Sturgeon and Cleve West, all loaded with gold medals, making appearances, the bookies say the money is still on the boys, at least in the Show Gardens category. But the message couldn\u2019t be clearer: change is afoot in SW3.</p> <h2>Beyond the border<br /></h2> <p>Now in its fifth year, the Chelsea Fringe sees dozens of events around the country \u2013 and further afield \u2013 putting on horticultural talks, walks, meals, deals and every other kind of event (<a href=\"http://www.chelseafringe.com/\">chelseafringe.com</a>), while around the ground itself local businesses are competing for the Chelsea in Bloom prize.</p> <p><em>The Chelsea flower show runs from 24-28 May</em></p>",

What gets Eurosceptics out of bed in the morning is getting shot of the sort of regulations that European Free Trade Area countries such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/27/norway-eu-reality-uk-voters-seduced-by-norwegian-model\" title=\"\">Norway and Switzerland</a> must accept. Meanwhile, Singapore is successful because it is a small country within a large Asian trade area called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/feb/03/opportunities-fears-asean-prepares-single-market\" title=\"\">Asean</a>, not a big country like the UK outside one.</p> <p>Despite this, the out campaign is still within striking distance in England, at least in online polling. That would suggest something is badly misfiring in the remain camp and that instead of just demoralising the outers, Cameron\u2019s \u201cBullingdon boy\u201d tactics are also dispiriting his own side. The biggest danger for remain has always been a low turnout among Europe-friendly voters. Only a positive campaign galvanises the people, and this is the campaign that is now desperately required.</p> <p>The positive case for Europe\u2019s achievements runs like this. For more than 60 years, the EU, and its various forerunners, has allowed cooperation between \u2013 eventually \u2013 28 countries and a single market of 500 million people. These are not inconsiderable gains. They are incredible feats, which have contributed to European peace, stability and economic progress.</p> <p>The benefits that have been secured through \u201csocial\u201d Europe are also substantial to working people and to family life, while Europe\u2019s cohesion in pushing forward a green agenda has been positive in forcing international agreement on climate change. The fact that these are Europe\u2019s achievements does not mean they would disappear overnight if out were to prevail. But they would be placed in doubt.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/oct/27/norway-eu-reality-uk-voters-seduced-by-norwegian-model\">We pay, but have no say: that\u2019s the reality of Norway\u2019s relationship with the EU | Espen Barth Eide</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And so to the elephant in the room: immigration. I\u00a0have been waiting for someone in this campaign to declare it a positive rather than a negative. There is not a family in Scotland that does not have relatives scattered to the four corners of the globe, and therefore not a family that does not understand the benefits these Scots have brought to their new homes overseas.</p> <p>It is time for an argument that presents immigration and immigrants as a good thing.

Virtually everybody in Scotland wants them to be allowed to stay.</p> <p>Thankfully, the EU debate in Scotland has been largely free of the overblown rhetoric emanating from the south. That rational discussion has been greatly assisted by Ukip being dusted off yet again by the Scottish electorate in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/04/local-elections-2016-explained-voting-on-5-may\" title=\"\">recent elections</a>.The SNP will present the case for Europe steadily and positively and will also make it clear that it would be unacceptable for Scotland to be dragged out of Europe against the will of the people. The world is full of rich irony and unintended consequences. In the Scottish referendum of 2014, the prime minister asserted that a vote for independence would jeopardise Scotland\u2019s place in Europe. Two years on, and with four weeks to go in another referendum, it may be that only a vote for Scottish independence can secure it.</p> <p><em>Alex Salmond is MP for Gordon </em></p>",

      "body": "<p>In 2011 I made an uncomfortable discovery about my family history. I had a famous great-great-great uncle, I learned: Angus McMillan. He was an explorer of early Australia, but in recent years he has also been identified as the man responsible for a series of massacres of the Gunai (sometimes referred to as the Gunaikurnai) people of Gippsland in the south-eastern state of Victoria.</p> <p>These attacks were cold-blooded and without mercy. Men with guns descended upon unsuspecting encampments, killing men, women and children; they were killed, as one settler wrote later, \u201cwhenever [the Gunai] can be met with\u201d. In the first 10 years of settlement in Gippsland, the Gunai population fell by more than 90%, to little more than 100 individuals.</p> <p>McMillan had fled Scotland during the time of the Highland Clearances but, in a cruel irony, he went on to enact brutal clearances of his own upon his new country, the worst at Warrigal Creek in 1843, where 80 to 200 members of the Bratowooloong clan were killed in revenge for the murder of a single white settler.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"70853b9ab0f97821b41695ab752a4f5ff3198e36\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/70853b9ab0f97821b41695ab752a4f5ff3198e36/0_188_1500_1875/800.jpg\" alt=\"Cal Flyn hopes her visits will help heal the inherited wounds\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cal Flyn hopes her visits will help heal the inherited wounds</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>My relative has come to embody some of the very worst excesses of Australian colonial history. And that is saying a lot for a country in which 20,000 of its Indigenous people are estimated to have died during the \u201cfrontier wars\u201d, and where, until relatively recent history, tens of thousands of Aboriginal children were separated forcibly from their families and re-homed in orphanages or with white foster families.</p> <p>On Thursday Australia will celebrate \u2013 although celebrate is perhaps the wrong word \u2013 an occasion known as National Sorry Day. This annual event is held as a gesture of apology to the Aboriginal population for the havoc wreaked upon their people by colonialism: in previous years, it has been marked by people marching through the streets, or by distributing black roses. Flags are lowered to half-mast, while above cloud-written apologies are writ large across the sky: \u201cSORRY\u201d. There is much to be sorry for.</p> <p>Learning of my link to this disturbing chapter in our colonial history left me in a state of shock. I knew there had been some awful injustices in the British colonies, but to find such a vivid example in my own family tree was something else entirely. Since 2011 investigating this grisly episode has become a growing preoccupation, and one that finally drove me to travel to the other side of the world. I wanted to uncover the truth of McMillan\u2019s actions and to meet face-to-face the Indigenous group who suffered at his hands.</p> <p>I have now visited Gippsland three times, and there I met local historians, Gunai elders and those who work for the benefit of that community. The conversations we\u2019ve had have required me to listen, and be humble. They have not always been easy, for the story of McMillan, and what came after him, is not a pleasant one.</p> <p>Like many Indigenous peoples, the Gunai community today struggles with problems of addiction and violence \u2013 what some might call \u201cdiseases of despair\u201d. In many ways, the overt violence of McMillan and his men did not have the worst impact, that came from the policies of \u201cassimilation\u201d that were later enacted upon the much weakened survivors: confinement to Christian missions, the banning of traditional customs, the breaking apart of families and other misguided attempts to \u201ccivilise\u201d a culture that had pre-dated the settlers by tens of thousands of years.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2015/jun/05/myall-creek-here-in-1838-a-that-would-not-be-forgotten-took-place\">Myall Creek: here, in 1838, a crime that would not be forgotten took place</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For Australia\u2019s Indigenous people, deep social problems arrived with the settlers and never departed. Life expectancy for this group is still 10 years lower than the Australian average, and the unemployment rate is three times higher. Indigenous children are 10 times more likely to be taken into care and 30 times more likely to suffer from malnutrition. Indigenous individuals are 15 times more likely to be imprisoned, eight times more likely to die from alcohol-related causes, and more than twice as likely to commit suicide.</p> <p>They also suffer from endemic levels of racism: a 2012 survey of Indigenous people in Victoria found that 97% of respondents had been targets of verbal or physical abuse or discrimination over the previous year; 84% had been verbally abused; 67% had been spat at or had objects thrown at them; 66% told that they \u201cdid not belong\u201d in their home towns; and 70% had suffered eight or more incidents over that single year.</p> <p>With these statistics at the forefront of my mind, I was staggered by the gracious welcome I received from the Gunai community, many of whom were generous enough not only to meet me but to discuss in great depth the human consequences of McMillan and his peers\u2019 actions, and the longer-term consequences. Ricky Mullett, for example, now the chief executive of the Gunaikurnai Land and Waters Corporation (the body set up to manage what has been accepted by the court to be the Gunai people\u2019s native territory), took me to a number of sites where massacres took place before putting me up at his own home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"726e47b0a2d4670ef65ea73a6fce5e1f2e60d28e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/726e47b0a2d4670ef65ea73a6fce5e1f2e60d28e/0_84_1992_1195/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sorry Day in Sydney in 2000.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sorry Day in Sydney in 2000.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rob Griffith/Associated Press</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I can only hope my efforts have made a small contribution to repairing old damage. I have written a book, Thicker Than Water, about my experience in the hope of furthering awareness and understanding of these dark, historical secrets.</p> <p>For despite the advent of National Sorry Day, the \u201cnative title\u201d legislation that returned ownership of land to the Gunai, and the admission of collective guilt and responsibility they imply, there is still a vocal segment of Australian society that makes great efforts to downplay the significance and impact of frontier violence and assimilation policies, and denies the obligation of today\u2019s generation to accept blame for the behaviour of their predecessors.</p> <p>A great many of our political conversations today seem to revolve around such questions of collective colonial guilt. Should reparations be paid to the descendants of slaves? Should the British Museum return its ill-gotten gains? Must Rhodes fall?</p> <p>In Gippsland, an analogous discussion is under way. Russell Broadbent, the Liberal MP for the McMillan electorate in Victoria, has asked the Australian Electoral Commission to rename his seat. \u201cIt would send a message of practical reconciliation,\u201d he explained recently. \u201cIt would send a message that we actually care about these issues and, if we are not responsible to our past, we don\u2019t understand our past, we can\u2019t get on with our future.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/mar/31/sydney-honours-black-diggers-with-anzac-memorial-but-how-will-we-remember-the-frontier-wars\">As Sydney honours black diggers, how will we remember the frontier wars? | Larissa Behrendt</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The request has met with a mixed response. Some have argued, not unreasonably, that erasing a name will not erase the past: it is a whitewash, perhaps, of a different kind. But although I understand their arguments, I disagree. It is a gesture, only. Of course it is. Yet many gestures \u2013 like National Sorry Day \u2013 are important and meaningful.</p> <p>My journey to Gippsland, to meet the descendants of the victims of my relative, was a gesture too: I could not hope to undo the past. And yet to me \u2013 and, I hope, to those that I met \u2013 it was an extremely moving and meaningful experience, and one that left me with a better understanding of how such atrocities take place, and how we might hope to repair the damage they leave behind.</p> <p><em>Thicker Than Water by Cal Flyn, is published on 2 June.</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>It was all going swimmingly until Piers Morgan got involved: \u201cShame on any male member of Muirfield who doesn\u2019t immediately resign. You\u2019re as sexist as your ghastly, dinosaur-ridden golf club,\u201d said the former editor of the <em>News of the World</em>. For a moment I was almost about to cheer the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers for standing up for their principles. Happily, the moment soon passed.</p> <p>Muirfield in East Lothian says it is home to the world\u2019s oldest golf club, although Royal Burgess just down the road has also laid claim to that title. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/19/muirfield-golf-club-votes-to-continue-excluding-women\" title=\"\">Muirfield\u2019s decision last Thursday</a> not to amend the constitution of the club to permit women members was the result of a secret ballot of 616 members in which 397 of them voted for change and 219 opted for the status quo. The pro-women lobby had required a two-thirds majority but had fallen 14 votes short.</p> <p>Universal condemnation ensued and reprisals were swift. The Royal &amp; Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews, which administers the game throughout most of the world, immediately removed Muirfield from its roster of courses deemed good enough to host the Open championship. Royal Troon, another male-only club is expected to suffer a similar fate if it too denies women the right to full membership.</p> <p>Much of the condemnation throughout Scotland has been a long time coming. Until very recently a pattern of discrimination underpinned membership of Scotland\u2019s finest golf clubs and was accepted with a sigh and a shrug. \u201cOh well, you know, what can we do it\u2019s just a bunch of pish-stained old buffers and blazered buffoons hanging on to a passing way of life.\u201d The R&amp;A itself only accepted women as equal members just under two years ago after being embarrassed into action by Alex Salmond. Scotland\u2019s former first minister, a keen golfer, publicly rejected an invitation to attend the Open the last time it was held at Muirfield in 2013.</p> <p>For many golfers, social exclusion founded on an almost comical sense of elitism, are important reasons for wanting to join a golf club. What would be the point of waiting for years to have your membership accepted and then discovering that the sods let anyone join? Glasgow\u2019s Jewish community had to build its own course on the south of the city because few of them were ever accepted as members. Until recently, some of these same clubs also discriminated against Catholics.</p> <p>In these places a certain type of chap, perhaps not getting things all his own way at work or feeling inadequate in his relationships with women, feels that by putting on a silly blazer and sitting in leather armchairs with other chaps he can restore his lost manliness.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/19/muirfield-golf-club-votes-to-continue-excluding-women\">Muirfield loses right to hold Open after voting to remain men-only</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There has been some sympathy for the Muirfield members. It\u2019s a private club, built on its own land and not in receipt of public money. Many of those members who voted to exclude women are probably not sexist and do not treat women as second-class citizens. A degree of resentment at the influence of outsiders with a dubious agenda will have partly informed their decision. And what do we have to say about the existence of some all-women golf clubs and all-women gyms?</p> <p>It\u2019s not really the same, though. Golf has become one of the cornerstones of tourism in Scotland and our championship golf courses are not simply vital to the economy; they are sources of national pride. That several of them didn\u2019t just exclude women but took pride in doing so made a mockery of successive Scottish governments\u2019 messages of fairness and equality in their cultural and social agendas. If it was known that Muirfield\u2019s constitution also included clauses discriminating against black people, gay people, Muslims or Catholics a way would have been found long before now to have it shut down.</p> <p>There has been a sharp increase in the numbers of women seeking to play golf as a pastime and as professionals. What do we say to them? <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/20/england-melissa-reid-wins-turkish-open\" title=\"\">Melissa Reid</a>, the British golfer who plays on the European Women\u2019s Tour, expressed this eloquently in the <em>Times </em>on Friday: \u201cThe history of women\u2019s golf is one of overcoming challenges in so many circumstances, but just when you think you are becoming equal you are faced with something like this. An opportunity has been lost.\u201d</p> <p>The membership of Muirfield is made up of some of the most influential members of Scottish society. You\u2019ll find judges, lawyers, police chiefs, senior physicians and entrepreneurs among its membership. The extent to which they carry their attitudes about women into their places of work ought to trouble us all. In time, Muirfield will probably have another vote and by then the passing of another few years will have diluted opposition to women and lead to change. In the meantime, the Scottish government and local authorities could make life uncomfortable for the members of the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers. Companies which bid for public sector contracts are penalised if they don\u2019t pay the Living Wage and are also expected to have signed up to minimum standards of fairness, equality and inclusiveness. Those deemed to have discriminatory practices are marked down. If any of their directors were known to be members of Muirfield or Royal Troon or any other club which discriminates against women they could be similarly sanctioned. I wouldn\u2019t hold my breath.</p> <p>Elitism, unearned privilege and discrimination are still rampant in Scottish society from land ownership to the tiny favoured few with the right sort of education and family connections who run our judiciary and our civil service. Women in Scotland are still paid significantly less than their male counterparts and find it much more difficult to gain directorships in business. They are still woefully under-represented in parliament. On average women in Scotland earn \u00a3175.30 per week less than men. The <a href=\"http://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/bulletins/annualsurveyofhoursandearnings/2015provisionalresults\" title=\"\">Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings</a> which compiled these statistics says \u201cthere are a few extremely high earning staff, most of whom are men, and many women are clustered in the lowest paid professions\u201d.</p> <p>Giving the Muirfield members a right good kicking won\u2019t significantly alter this. In permitting such anti-women attitudes in these clubs to exist for generations though, it\u2019s not difficult to see why gross inequality in the workplace still exists.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Under the guidance of my A-level French teacher, in 1985, I read Emile Zola\u2019s short and brutish novel, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/01/therese-raquin-emile-zola-review\"><em>Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin</em></a>. I can\u2019t claim to have been a very knowing teenager but, even so, I remember wondering then at the motivation of those who had set the syllabus. Did they intend simply to educate us in the ways of 19th-century naturalism or was it that, as seemed increasingly likely, they hoped to put us off adulterous sex for life?</p> <p>The murder of the milksop husband, Camille, by his friend, Laurent. The bite Camille gives Laurent\u2019s neck in the moments before he dies. The way guilt then destroys Laurent\u2019s relationship with Camille\u2019s wife, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se, in spite of the fact that their relationship \u2013 she watched as Camille was drowned \u2013 has been bound \u201cby blood\u201d. These were not, I found, things it was easy to forget.</p> <p>I don\u2019t know if Stuart Urban, the writer of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/30/the-secret-review-infidelity-its-what-god-would-have-wanted\">ITV\u2019s <em>The Secret</em></a>, is a fan of Zola. But it was of <em>Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Raquin</em> that I thought as I watched the final episode of his series on Friday. The similarities, as they\u2019ve been throughout, were striking. <em>The Secret</em>, too, is about lovers who conspire to murder, only to find that freedom has a price. Desire is the first thing to curdle and, soon after it, trust.</p> <p>In Zola\u2019s novel, Th\u00e9r\u00e8se and Laurent cannot escape the gaze of Camille\u2019s disabled mother and her sinister cat, Fran\u00e7ois, whereas in <em>The Secret</em> it\u2019s the eyes of God that follow its devout protagonists around. Nevertheless, the consequences are the same: something has to give. In <em>Th\u00e9r\u00e8se</em> the lovers commit suicide. At the end of <em>The Secret</em> one of them confesses his crime to the police.</p> <p>There is, however, one very important difference between the two stories, which is that while Zola made his up, Urban\u2019s is based on real events. In 1991 Trevor Buchanan and Lesley Howell were killed in Coleraine, Northern Ireland, by Colin Howell and Hazel Buchanan (later Stewart), and their deaths made to look like suicide.</p> <p>For some years <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/nov/18/northern-ireland-dentist-admits-murder\">Howell and Stewart</a> seemed to have got away with it. But in 2009, long after their relationship had ended, Howell finally admitted what he\u2019d done, first to the elders of his church, and then to police. Charged as his accomplice, Stewart pleaded not guilty. She was convicted the following year, in 2011. Both are now serving life sentences.</p> <p><em>The Secret</em>, which detailed these events with some fidelity, was undeniably gripping television, and not only thanks to its gothic storyline; James Nesbitt and Genevieve O\u2019Reilly (as the killers) turned in performances that are likely to see them nominated for awards. All the same, it was not a series into which any viewer with half a conscience could sink indulgently, glass of Friday white in hand.</p> <p>A few days after the first episode screened, Howell\u2019s daughter, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/02/the-secret-my-family-traumatised-murder-tv-drama-bereaved\">Lauren Bradford, wrote of her distress at the series</a>, and at its producers\u2019 lack of concern for her family\u2019s grief. How to abandon oneself to the tension that threaded through every scene without feeling complicit in what she had called exploitation? ITV responded by saying that it believed it had been sensitive, that it had, for instance, offered the family a chance to see the series before it aired. But Bradford\u2019s circumspect, un-histrionic tone stayed with me. In its measured quietness was devastation.</p> <p>Following an intervention by her MP, <a href=\"http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-05-12/david-cameron-says-itvs-the-secret-based-on-real-life-murder-case-will-be-investigated\">David Cameron has agreed</a> to see if more can be done to help families in cases like these. But what can be, really? The answer, probably, is nothing \u2013 for which, I am mostly grateful. Balance the need to protect victims\u2019 families against the need to understand, and the latter will always win; the idea of shutting down artistic investigation, regarding it only as salacious and invasive, is not one any sensible person can entertain.</p> <p>Think of Gordon Burn\u2019s book about Peter Sutcliffe or, more recently, Helen Garner\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/08/this-house-of-grief-helen-garner-review\"><em>This House of Grief</em></a>, an account of the trial for murder of Robert Farquharson, an Australian man who drowned his three children. The result of many years\u2019 work, both are restless, questing narratives that somehow bring the unfathomable and the horrifying momentarily to heel. Television can\u2019t be anything like as thorough or as lightly shaded, but it can, if it comes at these things from an angle, shed light on an aspect of a case, something ITV proved itself with its trilogy of dramas about the Yorkshire Ripper, the Moors murderers and Fred West (made in 2000, 2006 and 2011, respectively). In spite of the controversy they stirred at the time, it\u2019s hard to think of more careful films than these, no murders or sex to be seen, each telling its story not from the perspective of the perpetrator but from a minor character, someone involved but also a little apart.</p> <p>Turn back to <em>The Secret</em>, and it\u2019s hard, if not impossible, to mount a similar defence. We were with Howell and Stewart almost all the time: inside their heads, their bedrooms, their underwear. The scene in which Howell, who was a dentist, sedated Stewart so he could have sex with her \u2013 a rubber mask over her mouth, she moaned with pleasure as he brought her to orgasm under the influence of gas and air \u2013 seemed gratuitous to me (and all the more so when it was duplicated moments later). As a result, the series brought no wider understanding, for all that, in seeking to understand how a man might keep such a dreadful secret. It emphasised, among other things, that Howell liked to keep his Bible in close proximity to his porn mags.</p> <p>The Baptist community, with its ecstatic hymns \u2013 \u201cDraw me nearer to Thy precious bleeding side!\u201d \u2013 was a mere sideshow, and an almost comical one at times. What had formed him? We never found out.</p> <p>Then there is the issue of time. How long is long enough? When ITV screened its film about the Moors murders, 40 years had passed; its Yorkshire Ripper drama was shown 19 years after Peter Sutcliffe\u2019s conviction, its Fred West series 11 years after his death. Five years does not seem, to me, to be very long at all in this context, and if this is a precedent, it is worrying.</p> <p>A bigger question, though, is why Urban could not have used elements of the Castlerock murders in some other story, thus rendering its protagonists and their families unrecognisable. In part, this may have to do with the flop-bound ITV\u2019s loss of faith in its ability to make a certain kind of drama right now. More likely, though, its roots lie in the belief that we live in a reality-led world, that audiences are more likely to fall for a story that is true.</p> <p>If this is so, do they have any idea how wrong they are? People like to say that the truth is stranger than fiction. Sometimes, though, fiction has a \u201ctruth\u201d that fact lacks. After all, Laurent and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se have lived and died in my mind\u2019s eye these past 31 years.</p>",

He said: \u201cThere really isn\u2019t any doubt that what they are appealing to here is straightforward prejudice. I can\u2019t imagine what the sizeable, law-abiding, industrious Turkish community in the UK must feel when they hear this.</p> <p>\u201cThis appears to be a straightforward admission that the Leave campaign has lost on every rational argument and now it is simply trying to stoke the fires of prejudice.\u201d</p> <p>Europe minister David Lidington said it was \u201ccomplete fantasy\u201d to suggest that Turkey or Albania would become members of the European Union within five years. \u201cIt is ridiculous,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The shadow justice secretary, Lord Falconer, said he was concerned by Vote Leave\u2019s indifference to the damage to community relations caused by its claims. \u201cIt is dangerous and inflames racism to imply many of the Turks who are coming may be criminals with guns,\u201d Falconer said. \u201cI\u2019m really concerned about the way the Brexiters appear utterly indifferent to the long-term damage they are doing.</p> <p>\u201cArgue their case by all means, but don\u2019t descend into the gutter and poison good community relationships. Gove is showing no integrity whatsoever in what he says in the referendum debate.\u201d</p> <p>Vote Leave countered that the home secretary, Theresa May, had herself raised concerns about Turkish organised crime in April.</p> <p>The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, will throw City Hall behind the Remain campaign on Monday, with a major social media drive, a series of set-piece speeches and newspaper advertising. From Sunday, the European Union flag will also be flown outside the mayor\u2019s headquarters to symbolise its new position on the referendum.</p> <p>On Friday, Gove, who is justice secretary, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/20/eu-immigrant-influx-michael-gove-nhs-unsustainable\">argued that Turkey and four other countries could join the EU as soon as 2020</a> and lead to 5.2 million extra people moving to the UK, a population the size of Scotland or four cities the size of Birmingham, putting intolerable pressure on the NHS.</p> <p>In Vote Leave\u2019s latest analysis it warns that Turkey will join the EU \u201cin the next few years\u201d and that its population is set to hit 82 million by 2020, many of whom will seek to come to Britain. It is claimed that, as well as threatening the UK\u2019s security, the growing Turkish population in the UK will cost NHS maternity services an extra \u00a3400m within 10 years of the country joining the EU.</p> <p>Mordaunt said: \u201cWe are currently sending over \u00a31bn to Turkey to help it to join the EU. We must recognise the huge strain this will place on our NHS as more people come here, without giving it any chance of planning for such increased demand. Expansion is at the EU\u2019s core. We have to be honest about the cost of EU membership for our public services today and in the future: and particularly what this will mean for the NHS unless we take back control and Vote Leave on 23 June.\u201d</p> <p>Professor Martin McKee, professor of European public health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, condemned Vote Leave\u2019s claims about the future of the NHS. \u201cIt is unacceptable for Leave campaigners to keep dragging the NHS through the mud,\u201d he said.</p>",

His Nobel prize for chemistry is being sold by his family and is expected to fetch between <a href=\"https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/23576/lot/112/\" title=\"\">\u00a3200,000 and \u00a3400,000</a>, Bonhams said.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"9026fba776f8dce2e517e9c6969aca09010b4dd5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9026fba776f8dce2e517e9c6969aca09010b4dd5/388_540_1944_2430/800.jpg\" alt=\"Francis Aston\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Francis Aston. His Nobel prize medal is for sale at Bonhams.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The sale, which will also include bundles of letters, notebooks and other medals won by the Cambridge researcher, will highlight the work of a scientific genius who is largely unknown today, even in his own country. His research paved the way for the creation of modern nuclear physics and the atom bomb, developments that were predicted by Aston with remarkable foresight almost a century ago.</p> <p>In the Nobel acceptance lecture that he gave in December 1922, Aston argued that the discovery of isotopes showed that the nucleus of an atom must be bound by a force of enormous energy. \u201cShould the researcher of the future discover some means of releasing this energy in a form which could be employed, the human race will have at its command powers beyond the dreams of scientific fiction,\u201d he told his audience in Stockholm. Doubtful at the time if it would be possible to control nuclear energy, by 1936 he had become much more certain. \u201cOne day man will release and control its almost infinite power. We can only hope he will not use it exclusively in blowing up his next door neighbour.\u201d</p> <p>Aston died in Cambridge at the age of 68 in November 1945, three months after Hiroshima was destroyed by an atomic bomb that his pioneering work had helped to create.</p> <p>Born to a well-off Birmingham family, Aston carried out most of his pioneering work at the Cavendish laboratory in Cambridge, where he worked from 1909. His early work suggested that atoms of one or two rare elements might have different isotopes \u2013 in other words they exist with different masses \u2013 and so he designed a highly accurate mass spectrograph to pinpoint these differences.</p> <p>Far from showing that the existence of isotopes was rare, however, his research indicated they were commonplace. \u201cRespected atoms like chlorine and mercury have fallen to pieces into a shower of isotopes during last week alone,\u201d he wrote to his sister in December 1919.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"a80386383fd03a8d9cfa2e81c2318ba21057e89e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a80386383fd03a8d9cfa2e81c2318ba21057e89e/0_0_2765_2744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Nobel prize medal for chemistry awarded to Francis Aston in 1922\" width=\"1000\" height=\"992\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Nobel prize medal for chemistry awarded to Francis Aston in 1922.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The nucleus of the atom was more complex than previously realised. As one German physicist wrote to Albert Einstein to tell him of Aston\u2019s work: \u201cThe era of nuclear speculation begins!\u201d</p> <p>In the end, the explanation for the existence of isotopes was provided in 1932 with the discovery of the neutron. Different numbers of neutrons in an element\u2019s nucleus explained the existence of isotopes, an understanding that was crucial in the subsequent harnessing of nuclear power.</p> <p>Apart from his painstaking scientific work, Aston was a fanatical cyclist, on one occasion cycling 200 miles in 22 hours. He built one of the very first motorcycles and later competed in some of the world\u2019s first motorcycle races. He also travelled to Hawaii and learned how to surf \u2013 which probably made him the first, and only, surfer dude of Edwardian society. He was an accomplished climber and also proved to be an expert on the stock market, turning his Nobel prize money into a substantial portfolio.</p> <p>He never married \u2013 \u201cprobably because he never gave himself time to settle down,\u201d said Matthew Haley, of Bonhams. As a result, most of his estate went to Trinity College, Cambridge.</p> <p>As to the purchaser of Aston\u2019s medals and notebooks, these are likely to go to a private investor, Haley added. \u201cThe techniques that he developed are now crucial to understanding climate change, locating oil deposits, forensics and many other modern technologies. There will be no shortage of entrepreneurs who would like to have his medals and notebooks in their possession.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>\u201cPrison works,\u201d Michael Howard, then home secretary, declared to the Conservative party conference in 1993. Except \u2013 as we knew even back then \u2013 too often it doesn\u2019t. Almost half of offenders <a href=\"http:/www.justice.gov.uk/consultations/docs/breaking-the-cycle.pdf\" title=\"\">re-offend within a year</a> of release from prison, at a cost of at least \u00a39.5bn a year.</p> <p>Howard set the tone for the two decades of criminal justice policy that followed. Virtually every justice secretary since then has, at least implicitly, signed up to his doctrine. Prisoner numbers have soared: we now have the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/08/uk-prison-population-is-biggest-in-western-europe\" title=\"\">largest prison population in western Europe</a>.</p> <p>Of course prison is the right place for dangerous offenders. But our prisons are crammed full of too many people serving short sentences for minor crimes. They often have a multitude of other problems: homelessness; mental health issues; drug or alcohol addiction; learning disabilities. A quarter of adults in prison have been in care as children.</p> <p>Short sentences disrupt what little stability offenders may have had in their lives, whether family relationships or work. And they invariably fail to provide any means to address the factors associated with minor offending like poor mental health or substance abuse.</p> <p>Little wonder then that recidivism rates for those serving short sentences are even worse than for prisoners serving sentences of more than a year. The situation for women is particularly bad: the vast majority of women in prison have committed non-violent offences, and six in 10 have dependent children. Their children are often taken into care as a result: a perniciously effective way of ensuring a self-perpetuating intergenerational cycle of offending.</p> <p>There has long been strong evidence that suspended and community sentences are both vastly cheaper and more effective in rehabilitating low-risk offenders. Yet ministers from all parties have failed to reform sentencing for fear of looking soft on crime. Kenneth Clarke was the first justice secretary to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2010/oct/20/kenneth-clarke-pledges-cut-prison-population\" title=\"\">pledge to cut prison numbers in 2010</a>, but after being attacked by some in the press for being \u201csoft on the causes of crime\u201d was swiftly moved out of post.</p> <p>The government\u2019s proposals for prison reform, announced in last week\u2019s Queen\u2019s Speech, mark a break from the past. Governors of six \u201creform prisons\u201d will be given new freedoms over budgets and the running of their prisons. There will be a greater emphasis on life after prison, with improvements to the shockingly bad existing education provision found in most prisons described on these pages by Peter Stanford, and prisoners will be able to access the internet to support independent learning and contact with families. Prisons will be held accountable through league tables that compare reoffending rates, literacy levels and employment outcomes for prisoners who have been released.</p> <p>There is much here to be welcomed. But there are also significant risks to the government\u2019s stated objective of improving outcomes for offenders once they are released.</p> <p>Justice secretary Michael Gove has drawn inspiration for his \u201creform prisons\u201d from his expansion of academy schools while he was at the education department. But are we really to believe ministers will allow prison governors to take risks with their new freedoms, given how risk-averse they have been in this area in the past? And, even more importantly, is it really prison governors\u2019 lack of freedom that is the main factor in preventing prisons from playing a rehabilitory role? The most immediate problem facing the prison system is overcrowding. Many prisons are now operating at more than 150% of capacity. The prisons <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/may/19/gove-prison-reform-cuts-budgets-deaths-custody\" title=\"\">budget has been cut by a quarter since 2010</a>, and the number of prison officers has fallen by a third, with many of the most experienced officers taking redundancy in recent years. This has resulted in intolerable conditions in many of our prisons: violence and drug dealing are rife; suicides are at their highest rate in years; and one in five prisoners in prisons inspected last year said they spent at least 22 hours a day locked in their cells. Overcrowding will stymie any attempt at progressive reform.</p> <p>The key to reducing overcrowding is sentencing reform. A significant proportion of prisoners is made up of people churning in and out of prison for those short sentences that are so ineffective and expensive. As the Howard League for Penal Reform has argued, we should stop handing out custodial sentences of less than a yearr: if a crime is not serious enough to merit a prison sentence of longer than a year, offenders should as a default be receiving community sentences. But sentencing reform is conspicuously absent from the government\u2019s agenda. Gove has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/01/gove-prison-reform-reducing-inmate-numbers\" title=\"\">denied overcrowding is a problem</a>, or that it would be a good thing to reduce the overall prisoner numbers.</p> <p>A high quality, innovative probation service is also critical to prison reform because of its role in overseeing community sentencing and supporting the reintegration of prisoners into the community. But Chris Grayling, Gove\u2019s predecessor, decided to apply the approach he previously took with the Work Programme to the probation service. As a result, probation services have been contracted out, mainly to private companies like Sodexo, who have promised to deliver more for less. This has happened <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/may/20/mps-warn-probation-service-privatisation\" title=\"\">despite the serious concerns raised by many</a>, including the Public Accounts Committee. One year in, the National Audit Office has noted the reforms <a href=\"https://www.nao.org.uk/report/transforming-rehabilitation/\" title=\"\">risk hindering the development of innovative approaches to tackling reoffending</a>.</p> <p>The prime minister clearly sees prison reform as central to the social legacy he wants to be remembered for. Yet prisons and probation are fundamentally end-of-the-road services. They cater for the symptoms of societal dysfunction and disadvantage that should have been tackled much earlier. Yes, we need a prison and probation service that is more effective at preventing reoffending: but there should be at least as much focus on preventing the social causes of crime in the first place.</p> <p>On this, the government is failing measurably. Even while it claims to be concerned with improving children\u2019s life chances, the poorest councils have faced the sharpest cuts, affecting vital services such as children\u2019s centres, special educational needs and child mental health services. It has cut in-work benefits for families with children, while delivering an expensive, across-the-board tax cut that most benefits the affluent.</p> <p>The government deserves credit for recognising, at long last, that prison doesn\u2019t work.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-22T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Robin Wright, currently playing the scheming first lady Claire Underwood in long-running TV drama <em>House of Cards </em> swung by the <em>Guardian</em>\u2019s offices in New York last week on a mission to draw attention to the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/17/robin-wright-stand-with-congo-campaign-mining-house-of-cards\">mining of \u201cconflict minerals\u201d in the Democratic Republic of Congo</a> \u2013 and the war it continues to spark. She has produced a documentary on the subject, <em>When Elephants Fight</em>, and her words echoed those of Joseph Conrad in <em>Heart of Darkness</em> more than a century ago, describing the conflict as \u201cthe most vile scramble for loot that ever scarred the face of human consciousness\u201d.</p> <p>Wright is championing an international effort, known by the hashtag <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/standwithcongo\">#StandWithCongo</a>, which is working to break a cycle of internal conflict and foreign wars that has cost more than five million lives. The movement takes aim close to home \u2013 at US tech and electronics companies whose demand for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/rare-earth-metals-upgrade-recycle-ethical-china\">rare-earth metals</a> used in the manufacture of computers and mobile phones has aggravated the region\u2019s violence and corruption. \u201cI felt a personal responsibility to step up, take action, create a voice,\u201d Wright said. \u201cWe are using these devices all day, every day, for our convenience, and it\u2019s perpetuating a war. I find it unacceptable that as consumers we allow this to go on.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/17/robin-wright-stand-with-congo-campaign-mining-house-of-cards\">Robin Wright targets Congo's 'conflict minerals' violence with new campaign</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But is Wright more than a mid-career actor with a new stage and a new cause? And why Congo? John Prendergast, director of African affairs at the National Security Council during the Clinton administration, who has worked with George Clooney in Sudan and is now a director of the <a href=\"http://www.enoughproject.org/\">Enough Project</a>, dedicated to crimes against humanity, says the Hollywood focus on the country \u201cisn\u2019t a really recent phenomenon. Congo is the deadliest war in the world since world war two. My question would be, why not Congo?\u201d</p> <p>Wright drew attention to an Amnesty International investigation that traced cobalt used by tech manufacturers including Apple and Microsoft to Congolese mines that use child labour in dangerous conditions. A ranking of electronics companies compiled by the Enough Project placed <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/nintendo\">Nintendo</a> at the bottom. \u201cThey simply don\u2019t care,\u201d Wright said.</p> <p>Nintendo countered, saying it took its social responsibility as a global company \u201cvery seriously\u201d and had banned suppliers from using \u201cconflict minerals\u201d in its supply chain.</p> <p>Separately, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers\">Panama Papers</a> traced some Congo mining interests through the British Virgin Islands to companies set up by the Israeli billionaire Dan Gertler, a friend of the Congo president, Joseph Kabila, that are reputed to be central to mining deals in 2011 that robbed the Congolese people of more than $1bn (\u00a3690m).</p> <p>The Congo isn\u2019t Wright\u2019s only current concern. In recent weeks she launched herself into Hollywood\u2019s campaign for equal pay for equal work when she revealed that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/18/robin-wright-fight-equal-pay-house-of-cards\">she threatened <em>House of Cards</em> producers with public exposure</a> when she discovered that co-star Kevin Spacey received $500,000 per episode in 2014 while Wright was paid $420,000 per episode in 2015. \u201cI was like, \u2018You better pay me or I\u2019m going to go public,\u2019\u201d Wright said last week at the Rockefeller Foundation in New York. \u201cAnd they did.\u201d Wright later explained she\u2019d seen statistics showing that her character was more popular than Spacey\u2019s for a period of time. \u201cSo I capitalised on it.\u201d</p> <p>Before playing Claire Underwood, Wright was best known as Buttercup in the cult favourite <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/nov/09/favourite-film-princess-bride\"><em>The Princess Bride</em></a>, and as Jenny opposite Tom Hanks in <em>Forrest Gump</em>. She began acting 31 years ago as Kelly Capwell, the \u201cdaddy\u2019s girl\u201d ingenue on the soap opera <em>Santa Barbara</em>. She has appeared in more than 40 films since, but it was, ironically, the TV screen that delivered unequivocal stardom.</p> <p>\u201cI feel as though I\u2019ve just graduated,\u201d she told <em>Vanity Fair</em> last year. \u201cI mean, I never went to college. I was pregnant at 23. You hear people say how they have \u201carrived\u201d, but it was just always there, waiting to come out. For me, it just took a long time. I\u2019m 48. I\u2019m finally a person. I think I\u2019m finally ready.\u201d</p> <p>Wright now adds her voice to a cast of women including Jennifer Lawrence and Meryl Streep who have spoken out about the pay gap. \u201cIt was a perfect paradigm. There are very few films or TV shows where the male, the patriarch, and the matriarch are equal.\u201d</p> <p>Wright\u2019s comments set off a firestorm, with many arguing that women shouldn\u2019t have to threaten employers with exposure to resolve pay disputes. \u201cWe can\u2019t forget that this represents a small and elite group of largely white women who have documented proof of their success,\u201d noted <em>Forbes</em> columnist Ruchika Tulshyan. \u201cFor the average worker, raising questions over pay could see them being ostracised or even fired.\u201d</p> <p>That, in turn, triggered anxiety that celebrity-branded feminism might be a failure on its own terms. \u201cIndividual celebrities are great at putting an appealing face on social issues,\u201d wrote Andi Zeisler, author of <em>We Were Feminists Once</em>. \u201cBut the celebrity machine is one that runs on neither complexity nor nuance, but on cold, hard cash.\u201d</p> <p>She continued: \u201cEmphasising the personal empowerment of individual actors, comedians and pop stars \u2013 whether for itself or in relation to others \u2013 only serves to pull focus from the ways in which their industries make money from stereotyping and devaluing women.\u201d And that, in turn, caused <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2016/may/18/stop-telling-women-theyre-doing-feminism-wrong\">Suzanne Moore in the <em>Guardian</em></a><em> </em>to muse that \u201cthe assumption that any celebrity who says something vaguely feminist is somehow a hypocrite is ludicrous. It is a way of discrediting women. It happens a lot.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/commentisfree/2016/may/18/stop-telling-women-theyre-doing-feminism-wrong\">Stop telling women they\u2019re doing feminism wrong</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This back and forth was somewhat undermined by Wright herself. In an industry where men are regarded as bigger box-office drivers than women, the pay scale differential may simply be a matter of market forces. In the case of the <em>House of Cards</em>, she implied, they worked in her favour.</p> <p>This was a game which, for many years, she decided not to play. Wright and ex-husband Sean Penn had abandoned Los Angeles to raise a family in San Francisco and to avoid the \u201cbubble of celebrity\u201d. (In a telling coincident, at the Cannes film festival last week Penn screened his latest directorial effort, <em>The Last Face</em>, starring Charlize Theron and Javier Bardem, about lovestruck aid workers in war-ravaged Africa. The film meditates on the dangers of mixing charity and social-conscientiousness with entertainment. The <em>Hollywood Reporter </em>called it a \u201cstunningly self-important but numbingly empty cocktail of romance and insulting refugee porn.\u201d) After repeated breakups and reconciliations, Wright and Penn divorced in 2010. \u201cI believe we were together not only to have our beautiful children but to learn how to love \u2026 for the next time around, the right way,\u201d she told <em>Vanity Fair</em>. \u201cAnd then, what I\u2019m looking for in people now,\u201d she adds, \u201cis kindness.\u201d</p> <p>Wright is currently with Ben Foster, an actor 13 years her junior. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s not ladylike [to say] but I\u2019ve never laughed more, read more or come more than with Ben. He inspires me to be the best of myself. There\u2019s so much to learn. It\u2019s endless. How great! It took me a long time to grow up. Love is possible as life is possible.\u201d</p> <p>Wright said the inequality in her pay package came after years of part-time work. \u201cI wasn\u2019t building my salary bracket. If you don\u2019t build salary bracket with notoriety and presence, you\u2019re not in the game any more. You become a B-list actor \u2026 You\u2019re not box office material. You don\u2019t hold the value you would have held if you had done four movies a year, like Nicole Kidman and Cate Blanchett did, during the time I was raising my kids. Now I\u2019m kind of on a comeback at 50 years old.\u201d</p> <p>No wonder, then, that Wright likes to temper the potential superficialty of one profession \u2013 next year she\u2019ll appear in a film adaptation of the TV series <em>Wonder Woman</em> \u2013 with a grounded, life-and-death real-world issue. Wright told the <em>Guardian</em>\u2019s Ed Pilkington her decision to get involved with the effort to help with the Congo and the Enough Project came after visiting women who\u2019d been raped by soldiers.</p> <p>\u201cSome had had six or eight surgeries to rebuild their reproductive system,\u201d Wright reported. \u201cThey were not able to stand sometimes for a year and a half. To hear their harrowing stories, and then to ask as an American travelling abroad, \u2018What can I do, measly old me, I have no idea what you\u2019ve been through.\u2019 They all said the same thing: \u2018Can you be our voice? We don\u2019t have a voice here.\u2019 That\u2019s when we decided to amplify that voice for them, back in America.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The Wright File</strong></p> <p><strong>Born </strong>8<strong> </strong>April, 1966 in Dallas, Texas, but raised in San Diego. Her mother was a cosmetics saleswoman and her father worked for a pharmaceutical company. She began modelling at 14 and, after leaving school, got a part in the soap opera <em>Santa Barbara</em>, where she met her first husband. Wright later moved into film, starring in the <em>Princess Bride, Forrest Gump</em> and the <em>Girl with the Dragon Tattoo</em>. She married (and eventually split from) Sean Penn, with whom she has two children.</p> <p><strong>Best of times </strong>Winning the Golden Globe award for best actress (television series drama) for her role as Claire Underwood in <em>House of Cards</em>. Wright was the first actress to win a Golden Globe for a web television series.</p> <p><strong>Worst of times</strong> Her divorce from Sean Penn, after 13 years of marriage and numerous separations</p> <p><strong>What she says</strong> \u201cI feel as though I\u2019ve just graduated. I mean, I never went to college. I was pregnant at 23. You hear people say how they have \u2018arrived\u2019, but it was just always there, waiting to come out. For me, it just took a long time. I\u2019m 48. I\u2019m finally a person. I think I\u2019m finally ready.\u201d Vanity Fair</p> <p><strong>What others say</strong> \u201cIt\u2019s just so clear she\u2019s an amazing actress, one of the best we\u2019ve got. But she was in movies that were not home runs.\u201d Jodie Foster, who directed Wright in an episode of <em>House of Cards,</em> Vanity Fair</p>",

      "headline": "The Observer view on the GM crops debate",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-22T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>For a generation, a campaign by the green movement against the growing of genetically modified crops has held sway across Europe. These foodstuffs are a threat to health, the environment and the small independent farmer, NGOs have argued. As result, virtually no GM crops have been grown on Europe\u2019s farms for the past 25 years. Yet hard evidence to support what is, in all but name, a ban on these vilified forms of plant life is thin on the ground. In fact, most scientific reports have indicated that they are generally safe, both to humans and the environment.</p> <p>This point was endorsed last week when a 20-strong committee of experts from the US National Academies of Science announced the results of its trawl of three decades of scientific studies for \u201cpersuasive evidence of adverse health effects directly attributable to consumption of foods derived from genetically engineered crops\u201d. It found none. Instead the group uncovered <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/18/gm-food-is-generally-safe-for-humans-and-the-environment-report-says\" title=\"\">evidence that GM crops have the potential to bestow considerable health benefits</a>. An example is provided by golden rice, a genetically modified rice that contains beta carotene, a source of vitamin\u00a0A. Its use could save the lives of hundreds of thousands of children who suffer from vitamin\u00a0A deficiency in the third world, say scientists.</p> <p>The publication of the NAS study is timely. New techniques \u2013 in particular the gene-editing technology CRISPR \u2013 promise to make the genetic manipulation of plants even easier to achieve in the near future. There is therefore an urgent need for Europe to reappraise its opposition to GM crops at a time when the rest of the world is embracing the technology. Europe is already becoming a backwater for new breeding technologies and needs to move swiftly to prevent this situation worsening, UK scientists warned last week. The restrictive regulations that are blocking the growing of GM crops need to be stripped away as soon as possible.</p> <p>The importance of changing attitudes to GM crops is equally pressing for the green movement. Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth and other NGOs are happy to accept scientific consensus when it suits their purposes. They triumphantly quote academic research that backs their claim that climate change, brought about by increasing use of fossil fuels, now threatens major changes to sea levels, coral reefs, shorelines and global temperatures. Yet they are equally willing to say that scientists \u2013 who they are pleased to endorse as a profession elsewhere \u2013 are utterly wrong about GM crops. This is a dishonest act of cherry picking that makes a nonsense of the green movement\u2019s claim to hold a superior moral position about the health of the planet..</p> <p>The green movement also complains that GM crop technology is the prerogative of big industry and should therefore be treated with suspicion. But it is the very actions of NGOs \u2013 who have demanded strict regulations to block GM crop cultivation \u2013 that have achieved this state of affairs. Only major corporations, with large legal departments, can afford to get their products into the field while small outfits \u2013 often those with novel technologies that could help starving countries \u2013 are thwarted by cumbersome regulations.</p> <p>Last week\u2019s NAS report was not a total vindication for the growing of GM crops, of course. Their use, said the study, was found to bring generally positive economic outcomes for farmers \u2013 by decreasing crop losses and insecticide use while providing food that was no less safe than conventional food. However, it was also noted there was a major problem with the development of herbicide-resistant weeds. This latter issue requires close monitoring but it is certainly not a cause for outlawing an entire scientific technique. We need to regulate products not the processes that are used to create them.</p> <p>This last point is illustrated by the host of crops being developed through genetic modification that promise to make lives better for Earth\u2019s population as it swells towards 11 billion by the end of the century. An example is provided by one crop \u2013 now ready for trials \u2013 which has been engineered to grow omega-3, a fatty acid food supplement said to have considerable health benefits but whose sources, mainly fish and other sea creatures, are now being over-exploited. Thus the health of both humanity and the planet could be improved by a single plant. GM crops are not the only way to solve humanity\u2019s woes but they have considerable potential. The inference is therefore clear. We can no longer afford to turn our backs on the cultivation of genetically modified crops in our fields in coming years.</p>",

      "headline": "US capitalism in crisis while most Americans lose out",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-22T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Crisis always brings opportunity. And right now, we are having a crisis of capitalism unlike anything experienced during the last four decades, if not longer. The evidence is everywhere \u2013 in rising inequality, in the division of fortunes between companies and workers, and in lethargic economic growth despite unprecedented infusions of monetary stimulus by the world\u2019s governments (a huge $29tn in total since 2008). Eight years on from the financial crisis and great recession, the US, UK and many other countries are still experiencing the longest, slowest economic recoveries in memory.</p> <p>This has, of course, diametrically shifted the political climate, creating a paradigm of insiders versus outsiders. In the US, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders are different sides of the same coin; in Britain, Jeremy Corbyn is an equally dramatic response to establishment politics. The challenges to the political and economic status quo are not going away anytime soon. A recent Harvard study shows that only 19% of American millennials call themselves capitalist, and only 30% support the system as a whole. Perhaps more shocking, the numbers are not much better among the over-30 set. A mere half of Americans believe in the system of capitalism as practised today in the US, which is quite something for a nation that brought us the \u201cgreed is good\u201d culture.</p> <p>In some ways that is no surprise because, as I explore in my new book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Makers-Takers-Finance-American-Business-ebook/dp/B014BR46P2\" title=\"\"><em>Makers and Takers: The Rise of Finance and the Fall of American Business</em></a>, the system of market capitalism as envisioned by Adam Smith is broken \u2013 the markets no longer support the economy, as a wealth of academic research shows. Market capitalism was set up to funnel worker savings into new businesses via the financial system. But only 15% of the capital in the financial institutions today goes towards that goal \u2013 the rest exists in a closed loop of trading and speculation.</p> <p>The result is much slower than normal growth, which holds true not just in the US but in most advanced economies and many emerging ones. The politics of the day \u2013 populist, angry, divisive \u2013 reflect this, in the US, Europe and many parts of the developing world as well.</p> <p>But the bifurcation of our economy and the resulting fractiousness in politics has become so extreme that we are now at a tipping point. And as a result, we have a rare, second chance to change the economic paradigm \u2013 to rewrite the rules of capitalism and create a more inclusive, sustainable economic growth .</p> <p>Doing so will require a series of both technocratic and existential changes \u2013 everything from rethinking the nature of how companies are run (and for whom), crafting smarter national growth strategies and rewriting the narrative of trickle- down economics, which is now so clearly broken yet continues to guide the majority of economic policy decisions taken by our leaders.</p> <p>But before we can do all these things, we need to understand where we are and how we got here. Our economic illness has a name: financialisation. It\u2019s a term for the trend by which Wall Street and its way of thinking have come to reign supreme in America, permeating not just Wall Street but all American business. It includes everything from the growth in size and scope of finance and financial activity in our economy to the rise of debt-fuelled speculation over productive lending, to the ascendancy of shareholder value as a model for corporate governance, to the proliferation of risky, selfish thinking in both our private and public sectors, to the increasing political power of financiers and the chief executives they enrich. All of which have led to a false sense of prosperity driven by market highs rather than real Main Street growth.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We speak about social \u201ccapital\u201d and securitise everything from education to critical infrastructure to prison terms</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s a shift that has even affected our language, our civic life, and our way of relating to one another. We speak about human or social \u201ccapital\u201d and securitise everything from education to critical infrastructure to prison terms, a mark of our burgeoning \u201cportfolio society\u201d.</p> <p>Although the American financial sector dwarfs any other by sheer size, the UK is in some ways even more financialised than America, given the City of London\u2019s outsized role in the national economy. It\u2019s perhaps no surprise then that much of the most cutting-edge thinking on the topic is being done by Britons such as Sir Paul Tucker, the former deputy governor of the Bank of England, the current Bank of England chief economist Andy Haldane, and former FSA chair Lord (Adair) Turner. \u201cThe trend varies slightly country by country but the broad direction is clear: across all advanced economies, and the US and the UK in particular, the role of the capital markets and the banking sector in funding new investment is decreasing. Most of the money in the system is being used for lending against existing assets,\u201d says Turner, whose recent book, <a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/10546.html\" title=\"\"><em>Between Debt and the Devil</em></a>, explains the phenomenon in detail.</p> <p>In simple terms, what this means is that rather than funding the new ideas and projects that create jobs and raise wages, finance has shifted its attention to securitising existing assets (such as homes, stocks, bonds and such), turning them into tradeable products that can be spliced and diced and sold as many times as possible \u2013 that is, until things blow up, as they did in 2008. In the US, finance has doubled in size since the 1970s, and now makes up 7% of the economy and takes a quarter of all corporate profits, more than double what it did back then. Yet it creates only 4 % of all jobs. Similar numbers hold true in the UK.</p> <p>How did this sector, which was once meant to merely facilitate business, manage to get such a stranglehold over it? Bankers themselves are often blamed but in truth the trend of financialisation was enabled by policymakers and the decisions they took from the 70s onwards, as postwar growth began to slow. In the US, interest rate deregulation under the Jimmy Carter administration, which was supported by a coalition of left and right political interests, led to the possibility of financial \u201cinnovations\u201d such as the spliced and diced securities that blew up the world economy in 2008.</p> <p>Reagan era shifts allowed banks and corporations alike to become larger and more financialised, and further Bill Clinton era deregulation threw kerosene on the fire. The legacy of her husband\u2019s laissez-faire economic policies is one reason Hillary Clinton isn\u2019t gaining more political traction. One of the most perverse effects of financialisation is that companies across all industries have come to emulate finance. It\u2019s no wonder \u2013 profit margins in finance tend to be much higher than in other industries, and the Copernican shift towards the markets has led us to revere the industry as the top of an economic hierarchy of services that we graduate to after passing through the lower phases of agrarian and manufacturing economies.</p> <p>American corporations now get about five times as much of their revenue from financial activities such as offering credit to customers, tax \u201coptimisation,\u201d and trading, as they did in the 80s. Big tech companies underwrite corporate bond offerings the way banks do. Traditional hedging by energy and transport firms has been overtaken by profit-boosting speculation in oil futures, a shift that actually undermines their core business by creating more price volatility. The amount of trading done by these organisations now far exceeds the value of their own real-world investments, a sure sign of financialisation)</p> <p>British firms are very much a part of this trend. The recent history of BP (British Petroleum) is a perfect example not only of the rise of financial activities as a percentage of business but also of the perverse effect that financialisation can have on corporate culture: a focus on trading can lead to excessive risk-taking, and an overemphasis on short-term profit can undermine a company\u2019s financial future. BP was, from the 90s, an extremely balance-sheet focused company, becoming one of the most aggressive corporate costcutters of the era. This ultimately led whistleblowers to accuse the company of skimping on maintenance and using outdated equipment, even as it encouraged traders in its burgeoning US office to take bigger risks in search of trading-desk profits.</p> <p>The strategy exploded in 2005 and 2006 when BP suffered a number of back-to-back disasters, including a refinery explosion in Texas City, Texas, an oil spill at Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, and accusations of manipulating energy markets via its US trading arm. In a move that echoed the manipulation of the California energy markets a few years earlier, Houston-based traders for BP US had used company resources to purchase a large quantity of propane gas, which they later sold to other market players for inflated prices, costing consumers $53m in overcharges. The company eventually had to pay back that amount, as well as a criminal penalty of $100m, and another $125m in civil charges to the CFTC (the Commodity Futures Trading Commission). The environmental disasters resulting from the explosion and Alaskan leaks cost tens of millions of dollars more in criminal and civil payments.</p> <p>Since then, BP\u2019s Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010 became the largest marine oil spill in the history of the world, costing the company more than $50bn in legal fees, penalties and cleanup charges. You would think that all of this would have caused a serious crisis of conscience within the company. Yet far from pulling back and focusing on the core business, BP has charged full steam ahead into trading, becoming one of the largest non-financial players in the field. The firm now obtains at least 20% of its income from dealing in swaps, futures, and other financial instruments, up from 10% in 2005, the last time it disclosed profitability figures for its trading division. So where do we go from here? How do we curb the 40-year trend of financialisation and its perverse effects on business and society? Some people, such as the British economic journalist Paul Mason, are relatively optimistic. His new book, <a href=\" https://www.amazon.co.uk/PostCapitalism-Guide-Future-Paul-Mason/dp/1846147387\" title=\"\"><em>Postcapitalism</em></a>, argues that we are at a tipping point in the process of financialisation, which has allowed capitalism to grow, like a virus, beyond its useful life span. He thinks that the technology-driven \u201csharing economy\u201d in which information is freer and capital is less important will empower workers to fight financial capitalists in a new and more powerful way.</p> <p>I\u2019m less optimistic. In my own reporting experience, I\u2019ve found Silicon Valley titans at the heart of the technology revolution to be just as rapacious and arguably even more tribal than many financiers. Uber looks to outsource, downsize and liquidate formal employees as much as possible. Apple, once one of the most admired companies on earth, is now one of the most financialised \u2013 over the last few years, Apple has issued billions of debt and made commitments to issue nearly as much as it has sitting in overseas bank accounts (some $200bn) to avoid paying more US taxes, and used the money to do buybacks that artificially jack up the price of its sagging stock. I think that changes in our current dysfunctional economic paradigm won\u2019t just happen but will require several shifts, both practical and existential. There is plenty of low hanging fruit to be plucked in the form of tax code changes that would incentivise savings and investment rather than debt \u2013 which is the lifeblood of finance.</p> <p>We should reform business education to focus more on industry rather than finance (amazingly, given what we have been through in the last eight years, \u201cefficient\u201d markets theory is still the core of most MBA curriculums). We should rethink for whom companies should be run \u2013 workers, consumers and civic society as well as shareholders (many top performing firms already have that mandate). And we should certainly reform the financial system itself, reducing leverage, increasing capital holdings, and ending the culture of \u201cexperts\u201d in finance.</p> <p>Indeed, we should open the conversation about how and for whom the financial system should work to a much broader group of people \u2013 far beyond the small priesthood of financiers, politicians, and regulators who tend to share the same finance-centric view of the economy. \u201cWe need to stop treating banking as if it\u2019s a business unlike any other,\u201d says Stanford professor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/audio/2013/aug/15/politics-weekly-podcast-anat-admati\" title=\"\">Anat Admati</a>, whose book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Bankers-New-Clothes-Whats-Banking/dp/0691162387\" title=\"\"><em>The Bankers\u2019 New Clothes</em></a>, suggests a number of smart ways to reform and simplify the financial sector.</p> <p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we need a new narrative about our financial system and its place in our economy and society. As the crisis of 2008 and its continuing aftermath have surely shown us, we are at the end of what financialisation can do for growth. We need a new model, one that will enrich the many rather than the few, in a more sustainable way. We need markets that are structured fairly, with the kind of equal access that Adam Smith described in <em>The Wealth of Nations</em>. We need a political economy that isn\u2019t captured by moneyed interests. And we need a financial sector that supports, rather than hinders, our economy.</p> <p>Even if we don\u2019t understand the particulars of Wall Street, we all know at gut level that the current system isn\u2019t working. How could it be when 1% of the population takes most of the world\u2019s wealth, and a single industry that creates only 4% of jobs takes nearly 25% of US corporate profits? If we don\u2019t think hard about how to change things, the politics of the next four years may be far uglier than what we have seen so far.</p> <p><em>Rana Foroohar is Time magazine\u2019s economic columnist, global economic analyst for CNN, and the author of</em> Makers and Takers: The Rise of Finance and the Fall of American Business (<em>Crown Business</em>)</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How do we curb the 40-year trend of financialisation and its perverse effects on business and society?</p> </blockquote> </aside>",

Their fantasies fulfilled, the western tourists have left a ruined country behind without a guilty glance over their shoulder. Venezuela looks as if it has been pillaged by a hostile army, though there has been no war.</p> <p>It is not fanciful to imagine that the international community will need to launch a disaster appeal soon. Water is rationed, electricity is rationed and basic medicines are vanishing. Inflation is expected to hit 481% this year and 1,642% next year. The murder rate is the world\u2019s second highest.

Every oil-producing economy has been hit by falling prices, but none, not even states as ill-governed as Nigeria and Russia, has experienced the social collapse of Venezuela. Even they did not engage in the Weimar-scale money-printing of the Chavista regime. Even they, despite all the stout efforts of their leaders, were not as corrupt as the Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/corruption-index\" title=\"\">Transparency International</a> puts Venezuela among the top 10 most corrupt countries in the world. First Ch\u00e1vez and then Maduro did, indeed, redistribute oil wealth to the poor, but they distributed most of it to their clients.</p> <p>Why go on about the moral disgrace of western dupes? Isn\u2019t that a job for the \u201cTory press\u201d? Not so. We should have learned where the notion that there must be no criticism of \u201cour\u201d side leads. A generation of American conservatives is being disgraced right now for their failure to stand up to Donald Trump \u2013 whose paranoia and mendacity, incidentally, imitates the Latin American caudillos in the Peronist and Chavista mould.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/mar/06/hugo-chavez-hollywood-tribute\">Sean Penn, Michael Moore and Oliver Stone pay tribute to Hugo Ch\u00e1vez</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The thoughts of Venezuelans, who watched as westerners treated their country as an ideological playground, cannot be dismissed lightly, either. \u201cThere should be a special circle in hell for them,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/author/thor-halvorssen/\" title=\"\">Thor Halvorssen</a>, the founder of the Oslo Freedom Forum, told me.

Halvorssen thinks the Chavistas would not have gone so far in debasing the constitution and looting the state if it had not been able to count on a herd of bovine leftists mooing down all who raised concerns about fundamental rights.</p> <p>These are the worst leftists imaginable as they show solidarity with oppressive states rather than oppressed peoples. So they stayed silent when Ch\u00e1vez \u2013 in the words of the International Trades Union Confederation \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/dont-forget-theres-a-dark-side-to-hugo-chavezs-venezuela-8213593.html\" title=\"\">engaged in persistent discrimination</a> against organised labour. They neither knew nor cared that corruption is the most brutal of burdens on the poor because the poor cannot pay bribes to obtain the services they should receive by right.</p> <p>If free trade unions were suppressed in the west, and leaders of the opposition arrested, if western governments \u2013 to borrow Human Rights Watch\u2019s words about Venezuela \u2013 sought to <a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/07/17/venezuela-concentration-and-abuse-power-under-chavez\" title=\"\">\u201cintimidate, censor, and prosecute critics\u201d</a>, the Seumas Milnes and Oliver Stones would scream their heads off.</p> <p>That they screamed at the regime\u2019s critics instead shows how deep a leftwing version of racism has sunk. Sex tourists need to believe that the women they buy are not like the women at home, who reject them as ugly and dull. These girls just want to have fun. Radical tourists need to believe foreigners do not want the rights they themselves take for granted at home. As they ask others to act out their \u201canti-imperialist\u201d fantasies, they manage the unique and uniquely degrading feat of combining the delusions of the client, the neediness of the prostitute and the lies of the pimp.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Anyone who wants a glimpse of what kind of country Austria might turn into after this weekend\u2019s presidential elections could do worse than visit the town of Wels in Upper Austria.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/20/young-austrians-on-presidential-runoff-freedom-party\">'People have lost hope': young Austrians on the rise of the far right</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A majority vote tonight for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/19/norbert-hofer-austria-presidential-hopeful-rightwing\">Norbert Hofer of the Freedom Party (FP\u00d6)</a> would not only confront the EU with a far-right president in its midst for the first time, but could send Austria on a journey towards becoming an autocratic, illiberal state more akin to Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Hungary than Angela Merkel\u2019s Germany.</p> <p>As polls opened in Austria on Sunday morning, there are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/25/austrian-far-right-partys-triumph-presidential-poll-turmoil-norbert-hofer\">fears that Hofer could use the instruments of the president\u2019s office</a> \u2013 previously interpreted as a mainly ceremonial role by the centrist politicians who have held the post in the past \u2013 to dissolve the government and usher in a chancellor from his own party, which is currently leading in the polls. In a TV debate, Hofer ominously said: \u201cYou will be surprised what can be done [by a president].\u201d</p> <p>In Wels, a community of 60,000 that was a capital city in the days of the Roman empire, the nightmare of Austrian liberals has already become a reality. A stronghold of the social democratic SP\u00d6 party since the end of the second world war, the city elected its first rightwing mayor last year. In last month\u2019s first round of the presidential election, 39% of Welsians voted for the rightwing Hofer, four percentage points more than voted for the right in the country as a whole.</p> <p>The town\u2019s new mayor, Andreas Rabl, has an appeal similar to that of the presidential candidate: a youthful, 44-year-old lawyer with a penchant for bright blue socks, he looks and sounds nothing like the beer hall rabble-rousers who have previously dominated the party in the regions. Rabl even owns a collection of paintings by the Viennese actionist painter Hermann Nitsch \u2013 an artist so lacking in folksy Alpine appeal that the Freedom party in Lower Austria has been trying to close down a museum dedicated to his work.</p> <p>When the Freedom party last rose to prominence, entering government under its late leader, J\u00f6rg Haider, in 2000, it was still firmly rooted in Carinthia, in the deep rural south. Under the party\u2019s current leader, Heinz-Christian Strache, and Hofer, who is one of Strache\u2019s close allies, the FP\u00d6 has expanded, managing to win voters both in Vienna\u2019s working-class districts and more bourgeois areas such as the Wels town centre.</p> <p>The party has tried to shed memories of its antisemitic history, with Strache and Hofer repeatedly paying visits to Israel. Instead, the Freedom party has focused on an anti-Islam, anti-refugee message. \u201cIslamism is the new fascism,\u201d Strache has said.</p> <p>Yet once in office the party draws from a more conventional rightwing playbook. In Wels, which has a proportionally higher migrant population than other parts of Austria, Rabl has introduced a \u201cvalue codex\u201d for nurseries, which prescribes that children aged four to six should be able to recite by heart five German-language poems and five songs. Migrants who refuse to send their children to nursery face cuts in benefits.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ad65b5dc7c039c0ac5edbf6dadd01dcc6b25330\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ad65b5dc7c039c0ac5edbf6dadd01dcc6b25330/0_62_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Supporters of Austrian far-right Freedom party at a rally in Vienna\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Supporters of Austrian far-right Freedom party at a rally in Vienna.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leonhard Foeger/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the same time, Rabl has vouched to cut down the operational deficit of his social democrat predecessors, promising to save the city 40m euros per year. The Alter Schlachthof, a cultural centre with a youth club and a workshop for women which are used by many of the town\u2019s minorities, faces a 10% cut in its budget. One of the eight youth worker jobs has been cut.</p> <p>His proudest achievement is hard to miss. The annual maypole has been moved from a corner next to the town hall into the centre of the town square. Its raising was celebrated with a festival, including a dance by performers in dirndls and lederhosen.</p> <p>The global rise of a new populist right \u2013 from America\u2019s Donald Trump via France\u2019s Marine Le Pen to Britain\u2019s Brexit campaign \u2013 is often attributed in part to a fear of globalisation and its symptoms, from migration movements to increased job insecurity. At a political debate at Vienna\u2019s Burgtheater last Tuesday, journalist Barbara Coudenhove-Kalergi suggested that \u201cwe in the arts have only benefited from globalisation. Yet, if an electrician is worried about an Afghan or a Syrian taking his job, he may have a point.\u201d</p> <p>However, a visit to Wels suggests that frustration with an ossified and incestuous political system may also be a factor. In February 2015, it emerged that a cashier at Welldorado, a municipal swimming pool and sauna, had been embezzling money for eight years. Over the course of a few months, the damages rose from \u20ac10,000 (\u00a37,697) to more than \u20ac370,000.</p> <p>In a small town such as Wels, it didn\u2019t take long to trace the root of the scandal to the governing party: the cashier\u2019s line manager turned out to be the brother of Hermann Wimmer, the Social Democrat mayoral candidate. At the 2015 mayoral elections, the party, which had still gained 60% of the vote in 2003, crashed to a sobering 27%.</p> <p>A sense of stasis and entitlement is mirrored at a national level, where the centre-left SP\u00d6 and the centre-right \u00d6VP have ruled in a \u201cgrand coalition\u201d for 24 of the past 30 years. If Austria\u2019s party membership rate is almost <a href=\"http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/europpblog/2013/05/06/decline-in-party-membership-europe-ingrid-van-biezen/\">four times that of the European average</a>, it is partly because most public sector jobs look inaccessible to anyone without a membership card from one of the big political groups.</p> <p>New chancellor Christian Kern, brought in after the SP\u00d6\u2019s disastrous performance in the first round of the presidential election forced Werner Faymann\u2019s resignation, has given many liberals hope that social democracy can regain its dynamism. But Kern, who has been parachuted in from managing the federal railway company and hasn\u2019t previously held a ministerial office, also provides an easy target for those who believe Austrian politics remains racket.</p> <p>Basking in the sunshine in the beer garden of the Hotel G\u00f6sser in Wels, pensioner Anton Rosinger says he had always been a \u201cSozi\u201d in the past, but felt that the Social Democrats in the town needed to be punished for their incompetence. His wife says she voted for the FP\u00d6 because \u201cI want to see if things can work differently. I know it probably won\u2019t, but I had to try.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIf we get Hofer and Strache,\u201d Rosinger said, \u201cthat won\u2019t be the end of the world. In America, that\u2019s where you get real Nazis these days. They don\u2019t ban them over there. Here, that scene is very small, perhaps a swastika here and there. But Austria is a small country. Compared to that Trump, Strache is a little boy.\u201d</p> <p>He doesn\u2019t approve of those who rail against refugees, and complains about states like Britain or Poland, who he says want to get \u201call the benefits from the EU, but want to do none of the heavy lifting\u201d. Between September last year and January, an estimated 40,000 refugees passed through the town, but only 450 asylum seekers have been sheltered in and around the city.</p> <p>Though numbers have dropped off since the closure of the Balkan route on the initiative of Austria\u2019s foreign minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/05/rebel-austria-accuses-eu-human-trafficker-sebastian-kurz-angela-merkel\">Sebastian Kurz</a>, there are plans to build a new container village for around 300 asylum seekers on the site of an old army barracks on the outskirts of the town. Rabl has threatened a protest march on the motorway to block their arrival. \u201cMany people in Austria have forgotten that their ancestors were once refugees too,\u201d says Rosinger.</p> <p>A few streets away, the mood is less forgiving. Propping up an outdoor bar in the middle of the town square drinking white wine spritzers, a group of men in their 40s rail against the government, which is \u201cout to bugger us all\u201d. Taxes, petrol prices, public sector pay and immigration, all are too high: \u201cWe get all these rats coming into our country. They don\u2019t want to work, they just want to rape. Some of them want to integrate, but they are in a minority \u2013 that\u2019s the problem.\u201d</p> <p>They have been impressed with what Rabl has done since coming to office, and have high hopes for Hofer, whom the latest polls put in a slight lead ahead of his rival Alexander Van der Bellen, an academic and former Green party spokesperson who is running as an independent.</p> <p>Their only fear is that Austrians may not be brave enough to vent their anger at the voting booth. \u201cWe are a country of cowards. At least the English know how to defend themselves with their referendum; we don\u2019t have the spine. In Vienna, we Austrians beat the Turks in 1683, but now the Turks rule Vienna like it\u2019s theirs.\u201d</p> <p>All of the men declined to give their names, citing business interests. Still, one of them said that since the Freedom party had been in charge in Wels, it was easier to say such things out loud.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Canada\u2019s prime minister, the Liberal <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/justin-trudeau\" title=\"\">Justin Trudeau</a>, had what we might call an interesting moment in the House of Commons in Ottawa last week. Trudeau, impatient to get a vote started (on assisted death legislation), strode over to a scrum of stalling politicians, pulling chief opposition whip Gordon Brown towards his chair, allegedly shouting at others: \u201cGet the fuck out of the way\u201d, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/19/justin-trudeau-apology-elbowgate-canada-parliament-critics\" title=\"\">sharply elbowed New Democratic party MP Ruth Ellen Brosseau in the chest</a>. Brosseau was clearly shocked by the incident and left before the vote, with Trudeau later apologising for \u201cimpacting\u201d her.</p> <p>\u201cImpacting\u201d is one way of putting it, though it\u2019s clear from the footage that what happened to Brosseau was unintentional. So this wasn\u2019t about women politicians being molested or made to feel unsafe (a contention farcically milked by Trudeau\u2019s opponents in the aftermath). Trudeau didn\u2019t realise who was behind him or even that he was elbowing anyone.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/may/19/canada-justin-trudeau-physical-altercation-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4jcxv\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2508516\"            data-video-name=\"Canadian PM Justin Trudeau apologises after physical altercation in parliament \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"Reuters\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-573d2432e4b0451a6f482773\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/19/160519trudeau_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/19/160519trudeau_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/19/160519trudeau.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/19/160519trudeau_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/19/160519trudeau_small.3gp\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/may/19/canada-justin-trudeau-physical-altercation-video\">Canadian PM Justin Trudeau apologises after physical altercation in parliament</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>However, how about what <em>was</em> intended? Why was Trudeau, a\u00a044-year-old politician, having a foul-mouthed tantrum over a (reportedly brief) delay to the start of a Commons vote? What made him think that he was free to manhandle Brown, or, indeed, anyone else? Crucially, has <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/29/justin-trudeau-popular-world-canada-reserving-judgment-prime-minister-political-resume\" title=\"\">Canada\u2019s Sun King </a>revealed a little too\u00a0much?</p> <p>This isn\u2019t an exclusively Canadian issue \u2013 not after the almost-blanket western dribbling over <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/20/justin-trudeau-set-to-become-pm-as-liberals-sweep-board-in-canada-election\" title=\"\">Trudeau, son of former PM, Pierre</a>, and \u201chip\u201d beacon of genial liberalism, hailed as a happy contrast to the repressive, divisive, socially stiff previous <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/true-north/2015/oct/14/canadas-real-barbarism-stephen-harpers-dismembering-of-the-country\" title=\"\">Conservative leader Stephen Harper</a>. However, even before The Elbow Cometh, the honeymoon was over. The cult of Trudeau was becoming too dominant; there were too many cutesy photo-ops, too much style over substance, and not enough hard government graft, his oft-cited likability starting to grate. So far, so normal for a new leader \u2013 the celestial glow and heavenly choir were always going to depart at some point. Still, there\u2019s no discounting the shock of seeing someone of Trudeau\u2019s rank manhandling others to make them do his bidding faster.</p> <p>It is usually assumed that people behave even worse in private than they do in public. I\u2019m not implying that Trudeau is battering politicians or anybody else behind closed doors. That would be ludicrous. However, his behaviour still speaks volumes: it was a display of impatience, immaturity (as long charged by his political enemies) and an overinflated sense of\u00a0entitlement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/20/elbowgate-justin-trudeau-canada-honeymoon-politics-over\">Elbowgate: is it the end of the Justin Trudeau honeymoon? | Stephen Maher</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The last shouldn\u2019t be a surprise \u2013 it would be more surprising if Trudeau did not have a sense of entitlement. Take away the liberal giftwrap, and he\u2019s the son of a former leader, the product of a political dynasty as much as George W Bush. This isn\u2019t news. Nobody minded. I\u2019m sure many liked the nostalgic sprinkle of stardust (Pierre! Margaret!) that Justin Trudeau brought to the table. However, entitlement is a different matter: no one votes for that. And no one votes for out-of-control petulance.</p> <p>Which is why whom Trudeau \u201cimpacted\u201d is a side issue. I\u2019m not diminishing what happened to Brosseau. Men are always going on about how a kick to the crotch hurts: believe me, a sharp jab to the breasts isn\u2019t an umbrella-strewn cocktail. However, that was an accident. It was what Trudeau intended to do that mattered. This wasn\u2019t a leader asserting his authority \u2013 this was a little emperor stamping his foot because things weren\u2019t going his way fast enough. This was: \u201cDo as I say, I\u2019m very important, and always have been.\u201d The kind of behaviour that has spoiled rich kid written all over it.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/20/elbowgate-justin-trudeau-canada-honeymoon-politics-over\" title=\"\">Will Trudeau\u2019s term be overshadowed</a> by this? Let\u2019s hope not \u2013 and it\u2019s unlikely to be. It\u2019s early days, and Trudeau has plenty of time to make up for his mistake. However, mistake it was, and an illuminating one.</p> <h2>Uh-oh \u2013 nuclear Kim is trying to quit</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c77cf883c268dc81b6aa25945aa8658aa535b7d7\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c77cf883c268dc81b6aa25945aa8658aa535b7d7/0_159_2500_1500/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Supreme gasper\u2019: Kim Jong-Un indulges his former habit at a hospital in Pyongyang.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Supreme gasper\u2019: Kim Jong-Un indulges his former habit at a hospital in Pyongyang.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: KNS/AFP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In the week of the introduction of standardised cigarette packets, it\u2019s also been announced that Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un has quit the fags in support of North Korea\u2019s anti-smoking policies.</p> <p>This is devastating news for those of us who, the odd bit of despotism aside, were fans of the Supreme Gasper\u2019s defiant smoking style. Not for Kim, the westerner\u2019s shame-faced query about whether it was OK to smoke on your garden decking, or self-conscious \u201csmirting\u201d on pavements outside restaurants. Kim would puff anywhere \u2013 in a famous incident in 2013 he even had a cigarette going when he was testing out some new exercise machines.</p> <p>However, alarm bells are ringing shrilly across the globe at the news that Kim has given up. As anyone who\u2019s given up smoking will know, tempers can fray during the process. A\u00a0happily smoking supreme leader was nerve-racking. Now that Kim has jacked in the snouts, let\u2019s hope North Korea has a large supply of Nicorette patches, and that no one leaves him alone near any super-special flashing red buttons.</p> <h2>Every little black cab helps</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20b1d3d487ddcd4ba395ec7582568ba6834effd0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20b1d3d487ddcd4ba395ec7582568ba6834effd0/714_219_3329_1997/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Ferried around\u2019: Tesco Bank boss Benny Higgins.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Ferried around\u2019: Tesco Bank boss Benny Higgins.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tesco Bank/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tesco Bank boss Benny Higgins is reported to have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/20/tesco-bank-boss-benny-higgins-spent-more-than-18000-pounds-on-taxis\" title=\"\">spent more than \u00a318,000 on London cabs</a> over eight months, despite the company\u2019s new cost-cutting measures. For that money, you\u2019d like to imagine that Higgins didn\u2019t even walk to the bathroom by himself, that he was driven right up to the urinal.</p> <p>However, Higgins seemed to have had a smashing time, being ferried around the capital \u2013 museums, opera houses, restaurants in Belgravia. Just the average London tourist itinerary then, if the tourist earned millions a year.</p> <p>I\u2019m sniping, but a little bit of me understands. Like Higgins, I grew up in that terrible dark savage place known as Not London, and I know how easy it is for people like us to become intoxicated by the allure of London black cabs. Years ago, during a very busy work period, I had to get black cabs all the time.</p> <p>It was horrifically expensive and I\u00a0barely claimed any of the cash back owing to my patented filing system of stuffing receipts in an open handbag, but still I loved it. All that self-important frenzied hailing made me feel like a proper \u201cmedia person\u201d for the first time. Much as I like minicabs, it\u2019s just not the same.</p> <p>Sure, other cities have black cabs too, but there\u2019s something about London ones, where the glamour sucks you in, changes a person. So yes, that\u2019s a big cab bill by anybody\u2019s standards, but I\u00a0can\u2019t help but sympathise. I have an image of Higgins sat on the back seat, thinking, \u201cOoh, this is the life, I finally feel as though I\u2019m the boss of Tesco Bank.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Eight-year-old Houmam Al Elfi knew nothing of the politics of war, refugees and migration. He was too young to be sure why his family fled from their home in Homs, Syria, four years ago as the city was pounded to rubble, or what they were doing living in hiding in France. All he knew was he wanted to go to school.</p> <p>Today Houmam is attending lessons near B\u00e9ziers after a decision to expel the Al Elfi family was overturned when the plight of Malek, 41, Khaldieh, 32, and their children Hisham, 15, Fata, 12, and Houmam <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/17/refugee-family-fled-syria-france-face-explusion-dublin-regulation\" title=\"\">was highlighted by the <em>Observer</em>.</a></p> <p>Local campaigners who supported the family and raised a petition to halt their being thrown out of France were celebrating after the prefecture authorised the family to claim asylum in France.</p> <p>Khaldieh, who had suffered a miscarriage on the long journey into exile and was terrified of the French police finding them, could not hide her relief. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful decision for my family and I can only thank all those who supported us,\u201d she said. \u201cNow we want to have a normal life for our children, who have four years to catch up on. We have much to do to rebuild our lives here in France.\u201d</p> <p>She said the family was working hard to learn French. \u201cWe are all happy, especially the children who are back at their studies and will do their best to succeed.\u201d</p> <p>Lynda Scott, of the group Languedoc Solidarit\u00e9, which supported the Al Elfis, said: \u201cThe moment the family got the \u2018yes\u2019 decision from the prefecture, their mood changed completely. Before, there was pain, sadness, eyes with no light or hope in them. Now there\u2019s a spring in their step, a sense of what may be.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Tristram Hunt\u2019s argument that Labour should respect not challenge white working-class xenophobia is nostalgic paternalism (\u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/15/therell-always-be-an-england-tristram-hunt-labour-patriotism\" title=\"\">There\u2019ll always be an England ... and Labour must learn to love it</a>\u201d, In Focus, last week). It is not crassly materialistic\u00a0or \u201cmetropolitan squeamishness\u201d to oppose the visceral racism underlying Brexit anti-immigration discourse.</p> <p>Recent research from the London School of Economics proves that European workers have brought in tax income and economic growth far outweighing their costs, and that their presence has not led to significant job losses or wage cutting. They enhance rather than undermine public services such as the NHS and social care.</p> <p>Culturally and socially we are enriched, not threatened, by their presence \u2013 as with previous waves of immigration.\u00a0Hostility to this is not some organic expression of English identity but the outcome of decades of inflammatory media distortion and political opportunism, building an atmosphere of ignorance along with the dehumanisation of immigrants and refugees.\u00a0</p> <p>Labour\u2019s role is not to pander to this scapegoating but to provide the real facts about migration, such as that millions of Britons work, study or are retired in Europe.</p> <p>Labour should not promote narrow, backward-looking English nationalism but the working-class tradition of solidarity and the socialist value of\u00a0internationalism.\u00a0<br /><strong>Gideon Ben-Tovim</strong><br />Senior fellow in sociology<br />University of Liverpool\u00a0</p> <p>If one of Tristram Hunt\u2019s students based a whole thesis on one quote, out of context, it would certainly be failed. Labour lost in Harlow in 2015, as in the country generally, for many reasons, but primarily because it had still not adequately refuted the lie that the 2008 global financial crash was caused by Gordon Brown\u2019s profligacy, while its \u201causterity light\u201d programme did not inspire voters that the party had a viable alternative.</p> <p>In the recent local election in Harlow, Labour held all its seven seats, retaining its overall council majority of five. It pushed Ukip into third place overall, and had Ukip\u2019s two sitting councillors been up for re-election this year, Labour would have regained their seats. So much for Labour alienating its traditional working-class voters!</p> <p>As a party member since before even Jeremy Corbyn was born, I have this message for all the plotters and the naysayers: every negative statement you make about not winning in 2020 helps to make it a self-fulfilling prophecy. Stop it! Have constructive debates about policies, of course, but be positive, united and comradely in the process.</p> <p>Incidentally, what Emily Thornberry\u00a0should have done was to knock on the door of the St George\u2019s flag house and have a chat with the occupier. It could have been enlightening for both\u00a0parties.<br /><strong>Frank Jackson</strong><br />Harlow Labour Party</p> <p>Labour has lost its traditional working-class voters because of a loss of trust brought about by the experience of Labour governments being tied to pro-business policies in office, and forgetting practical ideas to satisfy working-class aspirations, such as the repeal of anti trade union legislation, building council houses and providing support for manufacturing.<br /><strong>Ian Hughes</strong><br />Bridgend</p>",

Whether it\u2019s controversial policing tactics or public outcry at the sentences handed out to high profile offenders \u2013 crime and justice provoke passionate debates.</p> <p>A criminology course enables students to examine these issues with a scientific eye. Degree programmes explore the causes of crime, the impact it has, and how society can try to prevent it. This might involve exploring contemporary methods of policing as well as government policies.</p> <p>Criminology overlaps with several academic disciplines, including sociology, psychology, law and social policy. As a student, you could find yourself analysing the thought processes of a serial killer, the rituals that take place in prisons or the treatment of minority groups within the criminal justice system. Many universities will allow students to specialise in a particular area of criminology \u2013 from public and media perceptions of crime, to cybercrime, trafficking or looking at how crime is measured.</p> <p>Aside from essay writing and exams, lots of courses will also have a practical element. Expect field work and plenty of visits to prisons, courts and police establishments. Course tutors might also ask you to examine case files or learn through simulated forensic investigations.</p> <p><strong>What skills will I gain?</strong></p> <p>Graduates will leave with an understanding of the social and justice issues surrounding crime. They will be capable of digesting large volumes of information and forming a judgement. They will also be adept at presenting different ideas and arguments.</p> <p>The mix of hands-on and written work will develop analytical, problem-solving and communication skills. Many students will conduct their own research as part of their degree, which will allow them to build a familiarity with different research methods, an ability to work independently and demonstrate attention to detail. </p> <p><strong>What job can I get?</strong></p> <p>There are lots of options within the public, private and voluntary sector. Many graduates pursue a career within the criminal justice system, working in roles such as police officer, probation officer, prison governor, case review manager for the criminal cases review commission or in the field of forensic accounting. A career in public policy - either in the civil service, thinktank or charity - is also an option.</p> <p>Having developed an understanding of the social issues surrounding crime, a criminology graduate may be well suited to a career in welfare, for example social work, or a role in victim support or drugs rehabilitation. </p> <p>Some graduates choose to further their studies with a postgraduate qualification. Master\u2019s courses in criminology can allow graduates to specialise in areas such as forensic psychology or criminal justice. Criminology also lends itself well to a career in law, and some graduates take a graduate diploma in law.</p> <p>Whatever career you decide to pursue, the skills developed through a criminology course - such as analysis and critical thinking - are likely to be valued by employers across the graduate jobs market.<br /></p>",

But it is no good calling for more money for services without attending to the causes. Widespread social insecurity is bad for health \u2013 mental and physical.</p> <p>The canary in the mine is the phenomenal explosion of despair among teenage girls, who are turning up to hospital emergency departments, self-harming and suicidal. As community child and adolescent mental health clinics turn patients away, more of them are admitted in crisis to general hospital wards, with patchy mental health expertise to call on. Norman Lamb MP was a coalition government mental health minister when these trends began, so it is rather weak of him now to complain that \u201crationing of care in such a vital area of care is scandalous\u201d. While most political pressure will be on community funding, what is urgently required is specially skilled mental health and social service professionals in hospital paediatric departments.</p> <p>Though tax havens, state terrorism, migration, global warming and inequality may be far from their minds, these young people are warning us of the danger we all face: the vicious cycle in which people across the social spectrum become less interested in the public good that they are expected to pay for in taxes, because they can see nothing good in it for them. The poison in the social atmosphere that is hitting teenagers is their unprecedented lack of prospects in education, employment and housing.<br /><strong>Dr Sebastian Kraemer</strong><br />NHS consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist, 1980-2015<br />London SW2</p> <h2><strong>A quick swipe can stop touts</strong><br /></h2> <p>Secondary sale of tickets for big events has been set up to facilitate the tout industry (\u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/15/shady-world-of-the-ticket-touts\" title=\"\">How ticket touts are bleeding fans dry</a>\u201d, Special Report, last week). It makes no difference to performers, as they get the same cut from the original ticket price whether or not touts are involved. If performers care about fans they should insist that ticketing for any gigs mirror the simple and transparent system for buying cinema tickets online. Payment is taken from the credit card, then the ticket is collected when your credit card is swiped at the venue. There is no possibility of ticket transfer unless you trust a friend to use your credit card.

My Mexican wife and I\u00a0have survived 40 such years. The upside is that, like travel, cross-cultural marriage broadens the mind, and the children, ideally bilingual, learn to function across cultures as cosmopolitan world citizens. <br /><strong>Joseph Palley</strong><br />Richmond, Surrey</p> <h2><strong>High value of online petitions</strong><br /></h2> <p>Catherine\u2019s Bennett\u2019s criticism of online petitions as clickbait is unjust (\u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/14/e-petitions-laura-kuenssberg-bbc-political-editor-female-jeremy-corbyn-38-degrees?CMP=share_btn_gp\" title=\"\">People power can be toxic: sign here if you agree</a>\u201d, Comment, last week). Organisations such as 38\u00a0Degrees have achieved some remarkable results by informing, encouraging and mobilising vast numbers of people who would otherwise succumb to apathy in the face of toxic corporate and rightwing self-interest. It is a sad fact of modern-day life that only a small minority of people take an active and regular part in campaigns that promote a fair and compassionate society. Online petitions make ordinary people feel as if they have a voice, so it\u2019s at least one step better than indolence.</p> <p>I don\u2019t like the tone or purpose of the petition to sack Laura Kuenssberg, but unfortunately there are always going to be some, like \u201cJoe\u201d, who use (misuse?) petitions in this way and the websites cannot easily prevent them without losing their valuable impartiality. I would have gladly signed a petition to sack the odious Jeremy Clarkson and felt justified in doing so. Would that campaign have been \u201cunfair and ugly\u201d?<br /><strong>Michael Pollard</strong><br />Wareham, Dorset</p> <h2><strong>BA\u2019s i360 boon to Brighton</strong><br /></h2> <p>The letter \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/07/uk-life-sciences-health-wealth-would-benefit-from-staying-in-eu\" title=\"\">Council spending on towers</a>\u201d (8 May), contains misleading information. First, the public funding referred to comes from the Public Works Loan Board, which funds projects that generate a commercial return. It is not local taxpayers\u2019 money, nor was it a case of the council choosing to fund British Airways i360 instead of paying for local services.</p> <p>The statement that this arrangement will cost residents \u00a31.4m a year is false; in fact, quite the opposite is true. Brighton and Hove city council will earn about \u00a31m a year from brokering the loan, which will be reinvested back into the city at a time of public cuts. In addition, 1% of British Airways i360\u2019s ticket sales will be paid to the council in perpetuity, even after the loan has been repaid.</p> <p>We also estimate that the attraction will bring \u00a325m per year in economic benefit to the city; it will support local businesses and generate hundreds of new jobs that pay the living wage. <br /><strong>David Marks</strong><br />Chairman, Brighton i360</p> <h2>Age does not dictate politics<br /></h2> <p>I will be 72 by the date of the EU referendum and am getting tired of reading articles that seem to portray everyone of my age as a reactionary isolationist (\u201c\u2018<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/14/eu-referendum-youth-vote-registration-countdown?CMP=twt_a-politics_b-gdnukpolitics\" title=\"\">Our grandparents should not be deciding our future</a>\u2019\u201d, News, last week).

When that 7-0 defeat happens at your home stadium, you can lift the embarrassment level up a notch.

Three minutes in, Dax McCarty, 5ft 8in in his stockinged feet, scored the Red Bulls\u2019 first, from a corner, heading past Josh Saunders as the NYC FC defence stood and watched. Five minutes before the break, Mike Grella left Federico Bravo on his backside and crossed for Bradley Wright-Phillips to make it two. It was just so easy, and when Wright-Phillips scored the third goal in first-half stoppage time, the game was done.</p> <p>Patrick Vieira, not one for ranting and raving, didn\u2019t mince his words. \u201cIt\u2019s been a disaster,\u201d Vieira admitted during the half-time break. \u201cI think we didn\u2019t play at all, and nothing more to say. It\u2019s been a really bad first 45. We didn\u2019t turn up; we didn\u2019t play, and we couldn\u2019t live with the importance of the game.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/19/patrick-vieira-new-york-city-fc-third-rail\">Patrick Vieira, New York City FC and the Third Rail</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Oh, but it was about to get a lot worse. NYC FC barely mustered an attack in the second half \u2013 and they kept making the same mistakes in defence. Concede a cheap corner, forget to pick up, and watch helplessly as the Red Bulls rack up the score. Ronald Matarrita barely got off the ground as McCarty planted another header past Saunders for 4-0. Alex Muyl, who replaced Wright-Phillips, made it five after another terrible piece of defending. And then, with the game petering out into an embarrassing 5-0 defeat, the home side managed to give up two more goals from corners. </p> <p>Had Lloyd Sam shown a touch more composure in the six-yard box, it could have been more. But the sad truth was, the visitors didn\u2019t have to excel. They showed energy, pressed high, and got the ball in the danger zone. Jesse Marsch\u2019s team were dominant, and finally showed the form of last year, when they won the Supporters\u2019 Shield, but there was no wonder-strike from 30 yards, no piece of individual brilliance \u2013 and no red card or dodgy decision as a mitigating factor. Red Bulls played very well, and more power to them, but this was all about the deficiencies of New York City FC.</p> <p>Some of the individual displays were abject. Matarrita had a horror show at left-back. Bravo practically lay down and took a nap as Grella went past him for the second. Josh Saunders looked his 35 years of age. Andrea Pirlo made two lovely passes in the first half but did little else. David Villa huffed and puffed, but even he couldn\u2019t make it happen. You could practically hear the disgruntlement when Frank Lampard entered the field. It said much about the home supporters\u2019 state of mind.</p> <p>At least we saw a bit of history. The Red Bulls had never won 7-0 in MLS \u2013 their biggest previous win was 6-0 over Real Salt Lake in 2006. At 5-0 they looked like they\u2019d had enough. But the other two substitutes, Gonzalo Veron and Gideon Baah, fancied a piece of the action. They were allowed to seize it.</p> <p>If New York City go on to lift MLS Cup, we might look back and laugh at that 7-0 home reverse in May. Vieira said afterwards: \u201cIt\u2019s always good [better] to lose one game 7-0 than seven games 1-0.\u201d But this was an embarrassment. Vieira has serious work to do.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-22T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>At times like this it is impossible not to spool back to May 2013, and the sight of Sir Alex Ferguson centre stage at Old Trafford, standing in the rain surrounded by the absolute and unconditional admiration of everyone inside the stadium as he made one crucial political point in his farewell speech. \u201cI\u2019d also like to remind you that when we had bad times here, the club stood by me, all my staff stood by me, the players stood by me. Your job now is to stand by our new manager. That is important,\u201d he stressed. The crowd applauded with recognition and respect. He knew. Of course he knew. Nobody knew better than him.</p> <p>In fairness they tried. United\u2019s hierarchy tried and the majority of the support base tried to stand by those who followed in his wake. For 10 distinctly uncomfortable months they tried not to be too uppity about the fact David Moyes was handed a mantle <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/22/david-moyes-sacking-manchester-united-manager-brutal\" title=\"\">that was too onerous to bear</a>. For two seasons they have watched Louis van Gaal do things his way \u2013 not a way in isolation that was compatible enough with United to be classified as successful.</p> <p>In many respects, Van Gaal has been everything Moyes was not, and that is the whole point. Where Moyes had spent his entire managerial career in the north-west of England, Van Gaal\u2019s gilded CV made him a grandee at Ajax, Barcelona and Bayern Munich. Where Moyes had a style that was determined and canny and punched above its weight, Van Gaal was educated in the cultured Dutch school. Where Moyes had won what is now League One with Preston North End, Van Gaal possessed a trophy cabinet that commanded respect, with seven league titles from four different clubs, cups in three different countries, and a Champions League title.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/21/jose-mourinho-to-be-appointed-manchester-united-manager-next-week\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho set to be appointed Manchester United manager next week</a> </p> </aside>  <p>All the signs suggested Van Gaal, fresh from a display of his managerial prowess <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/09/argentina-holland-world-cup-semi-final-match-report\" title=\"\">at the 2014 World Cup</a> that arguably made him the coach of the tournament, would bowl into Manchester with big ideas, big personality and make everything better. However, in one piercing reality, Van Gaal and Moyes have been thrust into the same boat. Ejected prematurely from Old Trafford in the post-Ferguson years, reputations dented by an experience that underwhelmed, it has not been anything it was cracked up to be. United\u2019s Van Gaal era will be remembered as a bizarre cocktail that did not have much of a kick after all.</p> <p>Triumph in the FA Cup has not been enough to save him. Slipping back out of the Champions League qualification places was never going to reflect well. But equally dispiriting was a brand of football that might have been indulged in his first season while he was having to rebuild but in his second has too often been alien to the United DNA and even \u201cboring\u201d (Peter Schmeichel\u2019s damning choice of word, no less). The board stood by him during a disastrous December when they could not win a game but clearly faith in Van Gaal\u2019s capacity to revive United to the point they could challenge for the most important honours could not be sustained. The mood that provoked some fans to boo him as he stepped up to speak before the lap of appreciation at the last home game of the season revealed problems the FA Cup alone could not fix.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e8dcad9eae1fd60bc09018a64dcb87f7df3a6746\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e8dcad9eae1fd60bc09018a64dcb87f7df3a6746/0_98_3754_2253/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Louis van Gaal with Angel di Maria\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Louis van Gaal\u2019s failure to get the best from \u00c1ngel di Mar\u00eda and his willingness to sell the Argentinian after one season rang alarm bells.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Peter Powell/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Van Gaal, this singular man, who has at times in a 30-year management career inspired some outstanding teams, and at others had no qualms about entering into a footballing conflict, has always insisted on doing things his own way.\u00a0That, perhaps, was his undoing. If a manager\u2019s philosophy and a club\u2019s culture are thrown into a melting pot, the key is to find the right balance for the chemistry to work.</p> <p>All managers have to try to crack that critical first-impression exercise of working out where on the spectrum between his way and the club\u2019s way he wants to pitch himself early on. It is what Claudio Ranieri did so superbly this season. It is what Pep Guardiola and Antonio Conte will aim to get right this summer.</p> <p>It is worth revisiting the fable of \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda, the record signing who disappeared without ceremony. Eleven months after he joined to great acclaim Di Mar\u00eda failed to board a flight to the United States for the club\u2019s pre-season tour and within a matter of days <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/06/angel-di-maria-champions-league-psg-manchester-united\" title=\"\">he was sold to Paris Saint-Germain</a>. A record signing with pedigree being sparingly used, positionally challenged and quickly discarded within a year? Alarm bells duly clanged. No second-season chances. No sense of working with a major talent to try to give him the platform to express himself. All very awkward.</p> <p>The Argentinian later explained that it was the manager\u2019s \u201cphilosophy\u201d that he couldn\u2019t handle. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to adapt to Van Gaal,\u201d he said. \u201cI had a number of flare-ups with him.\u201d There, in that admission, is a nerve being struck that gets to the heart of United\u2019s difficulty in trying to move forward with this strident 64-year-old Dutchman. This notion of adapting to Van Gaal, of that being a sort of one-way-traffic requirement, has been the undercurrent throughout these two years.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"73e0867ac4a99cc1b2379de78692ee5ab0fbd6b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/73e0867ac4a99cc1b2379de78692ee5ab0fbd6b8/0_37_2289_1437/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Memphis Depay\" width=\"1000\" height=\"628\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Memphis Depay was signed by Louis van Gaal but has made minimal impact at Manchester United.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lee Smith/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some players have fared better than others with that, particularly the youngsters who have added freshness to United\u2019s attack during the better times this season. The emergence of Anthony Martial, Jesse Lingard and the whirlwind promise of Marcus Rashford will stand United in good stead. But the flipside is embodied by two Dutchman who fared so well under Van Gaal at the last World Cup so presumably knew exactly what to expect. Robin van Persie fell from grace and left, and Memphis Depay has made a minimal impact.</p> <p>So now, after two clunky goes in the post-Ferguson years United must try again to find a smoother fit. United\u2019s executive vice-chairman, Ed Woodward, obviously wanted Van Gaal to succeed. There is pressure to create a template that is more long term, more respectable than the loose hire-and-fire circus the majority of clubs operate in. Everybody knows United want an ambitious, exciting playing style to stir the senses. They also want to have strong values, with long-term trust in their staff if at all possible.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/21/crystal-palace-manchester-united-fa-cup-final-match-report\">Manchester United win FA Cup as Jesse Lingard sinks Crystal Palace</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Firing up both those two elements simultaneously has basically proved to be too much for United under Van Gaal. Avoiding the quick-cycle turnover of managers may well be part of their thinking but it is easier said than done. There is not exactly a convincing shortlist of managers with the profile to come in, reboot Manchester United, and stay for ages; Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s record does not suggest longevity.</p> <p>Van Gaal has said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/mar/19/louis-van-gaal-manchester-united-last-job\" title=\"\">this would be his last job</a>, though an unhappy ending may force him to reconsider. After a colourful career, if this really is retirement from the management game, it is a sorry way to go, but one that feels inescapably of his own making.</p>",

But who is out? And what does it mean for them and for J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann\u2019s plans for 2018?</p> <p>Well, let\u2019s look at who didn\u2019t make it out of the provisional 40-man roster \u2013 where the two biggest surprises were the exclusions of NYC FC\u2019s Mix Diskerud and Seattle Sounders w\u00fcnderkind Jordan Morris.</p> <p>Diskerud has had a better start to 2016 after an underwhelming 2015 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/22/mls-players-mix-diskerud-overrated-players-poll\">earned him the unwanted title of \u201cmost overrated\u201d</a> player in the league, as voted on anonymously by his peers. Perhaps he falls somewhere between the utilitarian values offered by Kyle Beckerman or Perry Kitchen, and the creative X-factor of Darlington Nagbe. That\u2019s not to mention the additional overshadowing presence of Jermaine Jones, who has blindsided his way back into the picture with his forceful performances for surprise MLS leaders Colorado Rapids.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/21/us-soccer-jurgen-klinsmann-copa-america-roster\">USA coach J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann names Christian Pulisic in Copa Am\u00e9rica roster</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Morris, on the other hand, might have noted <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/16/jozy-altidore-copa-america-hamstring-injury-usa-soccer\">the loss of Jozy Altidore to injury</a> and assumed that, even with Christian Pulisic stealing his thunder as the next great American hope, there would now be room for him to take another step in his professional apprenticeship. Perhaps if Klinsmann was not under <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/mar/26/underwhelming-results-becoming-alarmingly-routine-for-klinsmanns-usa\">the degree of scrutiny he has found himself</a> under after an abject 2015, that might have been the case. But with the relative callowness of Bobby Wood and Gyasi Zardes in the roster, the coach has gone for the experience and current domestic form of Wondolowski. So Morris will have to settle for showing his worth for Seattle while Clint Dempsey steps up for USA in the Copa.</p> <p>Another notable omission, who might have hoped his recent career choices would have arrested a plummeting national reputation, is Omar Gonzalez. Gonzalez left the LA Galaxy for Mexico\u2019s Pachuca in the off-season and looks to have sharpened up on his sometimes infuriating lack of focus. But the solidity of his erstwhile defensive partner during 2014 World Cup qualifying, Matt Besler, has earned the Sporting KC man a spot, while there\u2019s also no place for \u201cthe next Omar Gonzalez\u201d, Matt Miazga. He now faces the lottery of seeing what a new club coach wants to do with his fringe players at Chelsea next season.</p> <p>No other huge surprises in defense \u2013 Steve Birnbaum had taken his national team chances when they came, while Edgar Castillo hadn\u2019t. Ditto Geoff Cameron and John Brooks (in), and Ventura Alvarado and Kellyn Acosta (out). Acosta\u2019s time will come, but you wonder if we\u2019ve seen the last of Eric Lichaj and Tim Ream. Ream has been a perennial fringe player, who\u2019s been diligent and dogged in his English Championship career, and similarly careful and solid in his international appearances, without ever quite making a compelling case for himself. Lichaj on the other hand, just feels as if he has too many players ahead of him in the pecking order.</p> <p>Spare a thought perhaps for Brad Evans. The Seattle man has been the type of player who you\u2019d always imagine to be pushing for a place as a kind of Swiss Army knife option in defense, but evidently Klinsmann feels he has the coverage there.</p> <p>Ethan Finlay need not be too disheartened at missing out on a call-up that\u2019s still a little early for the particular trajectory he\u2019s on. Danny Williams, on the other hand, was probably a few injuries to other players away from ever making the final 23, and Alfredo Morales, likewise would have raised more eyebrows than hopes if he\u2019d parlayed his various cameos into a roster slot. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/mar/26/underwhelming-results-becoming-alarmingly-routine-for-klinsmanns-usa\">Underwhelming results becoming alarmingly routine for Klinsmann's USA</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nick Rimando, who along with David Bingham of San Jose, was one of two goalkeepers to miss out. The perennial third choice behind Guzan and Howard, Rimando has had the misfortune to be a strong player in a heavily contested position at national level, and it\u2019s sad for him that he\u2019ll be missing out on a tournament farewell, even if he\u2019d have likely watched most of it from the bench.</p> <h2><strong>Beyond the provisional roster</strong></h2> <p>It\u2019s also worth looking at the some players who are in the roster for the time ever for this weekend\u2019s friendly against Puerto Rico. Paul Arriola, Amando Moreno, Fabrice Picault, Caleb Stanko, and Zack Steffen will be intriguing fringe prospects to assess over the next couple of years. They were always ineligible for the Copa, by dint of not featuring in the 40-man provisional roster, but could shape the team before the 2018 World Cup arrives. </p> <p>Arriola and Moreno are different versions of \u201cthe one that got away\u201d. Both ended up in Tijuana from MLS teams \u2013 Arriola\u2019s defection from the Galaxy youth ranks actually helped institute the LA II team up in Carson, as the Galaxy belatedly realized that unless they offered credible paths to bridge youth prospects to the first team, they would lose them to their ambitious neighbors to the south. Moreno, meanwhile, was a talented but immature player when the Red Bulls got rid of him a couple of seasons back. It\u2019s to his credit that he\u2019s found a toehold in a more challenging playing environment. Whether either sees the field this weekend it\u2019s good to see them noticed.</p> <p>Picault (St Pauli), Stanko and Steffen (both at FC Freiburg) are all on the German-American conveyor belt that has shuffled players forward for consideration in Klinsmann\u2019s time in charge. Whether any or all of them go further than this team camp is another matter, but Stanko and Steffen will have plenty of chances to prove themselves at the highest level next year, after Freiburg\u2019s promotion to the Bundesliga.</p> <p>Other credible contenders never got as far as this weekend\u2019s roster or the provisional 40. Some are understandable \u2014 you could compile a compelling highlight reel of Brek Shea contributions to games, but it\u2019s harder to justify any claim that he\u2019s mastered the role of attacking full-back. But the continued absences of New York Red Bulls midfielders Dax McCarty and Sacha Kljestan from team camps, and now the Copa, suggest that the window has closed on the industry of McCarty and the intelligence and forcefulness of Kljestan. The continued presence of Mix Diskerud at the expense of the latter, is one of the abiding minor mysteries of Klinsmann\u2019s reign, though of course Diskerud too finds himself on the outside looking in after this weekend.</p> <p>Others have come and gone. Just as he was at the World Cup, Aron Johannsson might have been the default option to replace Altidore, were it not for the fact that Johannsson is injured himself right now.</p> <p>Some of these players will emerge in the wake of Copa America, some will drift permanently out of contention. But for now, every one of these players will have a summer to fret about the fact that the national spotlight is currently focused elsewhere.</p> <h2>USA squad for Copa Am\u00e9rica</h2> <p><strong>Goalkeepers:</strong> 1-Brad Guzan (Aston Villa), 12-Tim Howard (Colorado Rapids), 22-Ethan Horvath (Molde IK)</p> <p><strong>Defenders:</strong> 5-Matt Besler (Sporting KC), 3-Steve Birnbaum (D.C.

      "body": "<p>Richard III brings the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07bqgjn\">BBC\u2019s Hollow Crown cycle</a> to a fine climax. It also confirms that Benedict Cumberbatch is a highly physical, as well as a natural Shakespearean, actor. Watching him wrestle his way into his clothes in the opening soliloquy, I was reminded of his superb performance as the creature in the National Theatre\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2011/feb/24/review-frankenstein-olivier-theatre-boyle\">Frankenstein</a>. On stage, we witnessed the tortured birth of a monster; here we see Richard acquiring a new identity as he gets laboriously dressed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2016/may/07/shakespeare-game-of-thrones-bbc-hollow-crown\">Shakespeare outdoes Game of Thrones in the BBC's Hollow Crown</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cumberbatch starts with two great advantages. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/theatreblog/2016/may/14/hollow-crown-shakespeare-swordplay-punch\">previous episode</a> enabled him to lay the ground for Richard\u2019s throne-hungry mania. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/mar/31/best-shakespeare-productions-richard-iii-mckellen-olivier\">Like Olivier in the film of Richard III</a>, he also uses the camera as a close bosom friend. Having wooed Phoebe Fox\u2019s Lady Anne \u2013 an episode that here takes place in a forest glade \u2013 he confides to the camera, and thereby to us, his rasping astonishment at her pliability. </p> <p>In fact, Cumberbatch takes us stage by stage through Richard\u2019s systematic progress to power. The dominant image of the production is of Cumberbatch\u2019s index finger tapping a chessboard, as he works out how to remove the pieces that stand between him and the crown. But it is a mark of Shakespeare\u2019s progress that the dramatist also allows us to see inside Richard\u2019s soul: Cumberbatch is especially good in the eve-of-battle soliloquy, where a character who might simply be a murdering monster pathetically realises \u201cthere is no creature loves me\u201d. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"75b50705dfe85a326a7fb1418b8af37039307cde\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/75b50705dfe85a326a7fb1418b8af37039307cde/0_269_4284_2570/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Keeley Hawes as Elizabeth, Judi Dench as Cecily and Phoebe Fox as Anne.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keeley Hawes as Elizabeth, Judi Dench as Cecily and Phoebe Fox as Anne.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Robert Viglasky/BBC/Carnival Film &amp; Television Ltd</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although Cumberbatch dominates the screen, this is far from a one-man show. Judi Dench brings all her clarity of speech and matchless sincerity to Richard\u2019s mother, who views her son with undisguised horror: when she asks \u201cWhat comfortable hour canst thou name / That ever graced me in thy company?\u201d you totally believe her. Sophie Okonedo\u2019s Queen Margaret stalks the action, right up to the climactic battle, like a vengeful ghost. Keeley Hawes turns Queen Elizabeth into a helpless pawn in Richard\u2019s power games. Anyone who has seen the previous episodes will also understand \u2013 in a way that is tricky when the play is seen in isolation \u2013 just what the women are talking about when they catalogue Richard\u2019s endless crimes.</p> <p>Dominic Cooke\u2019s direction makes this the most cinematic episode of the cycle. Once or twice, as in Clarence\u2019s dream, the use of flashbacks to illustrate past action distracts from the words. But I suspect Cooke has studied both Orson Welles\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/apr/14/best-shakespeare-production-henry-iv\">Chimes at Midnight</a> and Kenneth Branagh\u2019s <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/mar/28/best-shakespeare-productions-favourite-henry-v\">Henry V film</a> when it comes to the final battle scenes: we get a welter of blood and mud leading to a stunning crane shot depicting a ghastly patchwork quilt of corpses. One knew Cumberbatch was a fine actor. But this cycle also suggests Cooke has a future, should he want it, in the movies.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Wearing a sharp suit, Alan Pardew unveiled some even sharper and strangely alluring dance moves in his technical area when Jason Puncheon, a picture of shock and elation and local pride, blasted Crystal Palace into an improbable lead with 12 minutes left <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/21/crystal-palace-manchester-united-fa-cup-final-match-report\" title=\"\">in the FA Cup final</a>.</p> <p>But Pardew has never won a major trophy in his managerial career. He has been desperately close on two occasions now. It has been 10 years since the fourth official at the Millennium Stadium indicated that there would be four more minutes for Pardew\u2019s West Ham United to hold on to their 3-2 lead over Liverpool and Steven Gerrard responded by equalising <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/may/14/match.westhamunited\" title=\"\">with one of the great FA Cup final goals</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/21/crystal-palace-manchester-united-fa-cup-final-match-report\">Manchester United win FA Cup as Jesse Lingard sinks Crystal Palace</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This was not the right time \u2013 if there ever is a right time, that is \u2013 for Palace\u2019s 54-year-old manager to lose his composure on the touchline. With Palace\u2019s players wildly celebrating with their jubilant, disbelieving, wonderful supporters in the aftermath of Puncheon\u2019s spectacular goal, they needed direction from Pardew upon their return to the halfway line. Organise. Concentrate. Keep your heads. It\u2019s not over yet. Instead they got a performance that might have been appropriate during the preposterous pre-match ceremony.</p> <p>Palace were 1-0 up against Manchester United, 12 minutes away from winning a major honour for the first time in their 110-year history, and it was understandable that they were in dreamland.</p> <p>Unfortunately, though, that is where they stayed for the next three minutes. This was a nightmare of Palace\u2019s own making. A collective failure of concentration contributed to a sickening sequel to their 1990 heartbreak against these opponents and a defeat that will haunt them throughout a long summer. When underdogs lose, sometimes it is a hard luck story. Not here.</p> <p>Even after Juan Mata forced extra-time with his equaliser in the 81st minute, Palace ought to have won after United lost Chris Smalling to a red card. United ended the game with Daley Blind and Matteo Darmian at centre-back. But Palace blew it.</p> <p>This was only the second time that they have reached a domestic cup final. There was a carnival atmosphere amongst the Palace supporters before kick-off, beach balls bouncing around the place, shiny red and blue flags fluttering in the air, while one fan was so gripped by excitement that he turned up dressed as Juli\u00e1n Speroni (full goalkeeper kit, black wig with ponytail). \u201cThis mentality is unstoppable,\u201d read a banner in the Palace end.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/21/jose-mourinho-to-be-appointed-manchester-united-manager-next-week\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho set to be appointed Manchester United manager next week</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There had been a moment of drama before the teams trotted out to warm up, the sight of tears rolling down Wilfried Zaha\u2019s face briefly sparking fears that the Palace winger had failed a late fitness test on a mystery injury. It was a false alarm and Zaha lined up on the right against the club who let him return to Selhurst Park with barely a moment\u2019s thought.</p> <p>Yet Zaha was disappointing and so was Yannick Bolasie on the opposite flank. Pardew placed an emphasis on defensive qualities, opting for the robustness of Mile Jedinak and James McArthur in the middle but Yohan Cabaye could not assert himself and there were loud cheers when Puncheon replaced the Frenchman.</p> <p>Bolasie looked in the mood early on, forcing David de Gea to tip his header over, but in an often strangled contest, the isolated bursts of silky, coherent football came from United, who hit the woodwork twice in the second half. Marcus Rashford was a handful and Anthony Martial, Marouane Fellaini and Mata all threatened.</p> <p>Eventually Palace crept out of their half, Joel Ward picking out Puncheon on the left. The substitute\u2019s corner had been headed away by Fellaini; now he was alone in the United area, unnoticed and unmarked as he lashed a stunning volley inside De Gea\u2019s near post.</p> <p>The widespread assumption was that the team who scored first would win. Yet Wayne Rooney\u2019s cross dropped to Mata via Fellaini\u2019s head and the Spaniard squeezed a shot past Wayne Hennessey. Mata could later be seen asking Morgan Schneiderlin on the United bench if he had imagined that I, Pardew moment.</p> <p>Palace\u2019s heads might have dropped but they continued to play with resolve and they were favourites when United were reduced to 10 men just before the end of the first period of extra-time, Smalling earning a second booking for hauling down Bolasie.</p> <p>Belief restored, Palace had 15 minutes to find a winner. They pushed forward and a glorious chance went begging when Dwight Gayle went through, only for De Gea to deny the substitute with his legs.</p> <p>It was a pivotal moment. Let down by their lack of ruthlessness at both ends, Palace were floored when Jesse Lingard belted in his stunning winner for United. Some things are not meant to be. But Pardew will wince if he ever brings himself to watch that dance.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Jo Pavey\u2019s hopes of becoming the first British female athlete to compete in five Olympic Games were left dangling by a thread on Saturday night after she missed out on automatic qualification at the 10,000m trials. The 42-year-old had been flying in training before picking up a chest infection this month, which left her on antibiotics and unsure whether to compete until yesterday morning. But she was clearly below optimum strength on a blustery evening at Parliament Hill Fields in north London, as she was dropped by her British rivals shortly after halfway before finishing way down the field in a race won in staggering style by the unheralded Jess Andrews.</p> <p>However Pavey\u2019s Rio ambitions are not yet done for. She will now switch her attention to the 5,000m, an event she has run three times in the Olympics, and will work on honing her speed before the British trials at the end of next month. If Pavey makes it she will be the oldest British track athlete at an Olympics, beating the 110m hurdler Don Finlay, who competed in London in 1948 aged 39 years and 68 days. But it is beginning to look a distant prospect.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/20/jo-pavey-10000-metres-olympics-rio-athletics\">Jo Pavey faces tough 10,000m test to realise dream of five Olympics</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Encouraged by a 2,000 strong crowd, who swarmed around Highgate Harriers running club, roaring her on, Pavey was prominent from the start, tucking in behind the pacemaker Helen Clitheroe for the first three kilometres. But the effect of her illness became clear as Beth Potter, Kate Avery and Andrews all pushed past her shortly after halfway and she finished in 33min 22sec.</p> <p>\u201cYou feel bad saying this and making excuses because all the girls ran so brilliantly, but I have been ill for two weeks,\u201d explained Pavey. \u201cI just thought I may as well give it a gamble but it wasn\u2019t to be.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile the 23-year-old Andrews booked her place in Rio by running 17 seconds inside the qualifying time to win in 31:58, with a stunning run in only her second race over the distance. Behind her was the 2009 world champion, Linet Masai, from Kenya, as well as Potter, who took second place in the British team for Rio. As Andrews, who lives in Andorra and will marry the Irish cyclist Dan Martin later this year, explained, she has only recently rediscovered her love of the sport after being a promising junior. On this performance there looks like being a lot more to come.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"014ae55c613e1e63378780bd144111bee2cbf541\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/014ae55c613e1e63378780bd144111bee2cbf541/0_0_5208_3501/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jessica Andrews, who lapped Jo Pavey, right, savours her victory as she crosses the finish line.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"672\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jessica Andrews, who lapped Jo Pavey, right, savours her victory as she crosses the finish line.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI came in with the attitude that I\u2019ve got nothing to lose,\u201d explained Andrews. \u201cI\u2019m in good shape, training was going crazy good so I thought I\u2019d get on the start line and see what happens.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI felt out of love with racing,\u201d said Andrews, who said she had a vision she could be British champion last week. \u201cSo Dan and I spoke and I had a year of just relaxing. Then I decided to do some small fun races on Saturday or Sunday mornings, and I just loved it. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m off to Rio, it\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p> <p>There was also a major surprise in the men\u2019s race as the favourite, Andy Vernon, who was European 10,000m silver medallist in 2014, could only finish fourth behind Ross Millington. It means that Vernon will have to rely on the selectors\u2019 discretion to make the plane to Rio or try to qualify in the 5,000m.</p> <p>Vernon, the only British athlete in the field to have run under the Olympic qualifying time of 28 minutes, started sluggishly and was 20 metres down on the leading pack after the first mile. And while he gradually closed the gap on the leaders, when they pushed again he quickly went backwards. But, as he revealed afterwards, his uncharacteristic performance was down to a number of injuries since last September \u2013 including a hamstring problem that flared up 10 days ago.</p> <p>\u201cSince September my average mileage has been 30 to 40 miles per week when normally I\u2019d do close to 100,\u201d said Vernon. \u201cIt was always going to be difficult but I still believed in myself.\u201d Vernon, who trailed home in 28:48, also had a message for the selectors, who refused to select him for last year\u2019s world championships in Beijing.</p> <p>\u201cLook at what I\u2019ve done in the past,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve run 18 seconds under the qualifying time. I\u2019ve got time to prepare now, get fit and stronger and do the stuff I haven\u2019t been able to do.</p> <p>\u201cYou lose fitness but you don\u2019t lose class. And I know what level I can run at \u2013 if I can stay injury free it will be a different story come August.\u201d</p> <p>Millington, who finished in 28:20, now needs to run under 28 minutes before the end of July to qualify for Rio.</p> <p>Pavey, meanwhile, is not giving up on making the British squad either. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know where to go from here, but I\u2019m not going to give up on getting in the team yet,\u201d she said, the defiance evident in every syllable.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Labour is in danger of becoming \u201cirrelevant to the majority of working people\u201d because the party fails to represent their concerns about immigration, Europe, crime and welfare, according to a devastating new report into its electoral prospects.</p> <p>An inquiry established by Labour\u2019s former policy chief, the MP for Dagenham, Jon Cruddas, and backed by pressure groups from the right and left of the party, as well as the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2001/aug/13/thinktanks.uk\" title=\"\"> Fabian Society </a>and Co-operative party, concludes that, unless lessons are learned from last year\u2019s general <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/28/david-miliband-election-defeat-labour-party-ed\" title=\"\">election disaster</a> and this month\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/ng-interactive/2016/may/05/uk-election-results-tracker-2016\" title=\"\">local election results</a>, Labour\u2019s prospects will \u201cremain very poor\u201d.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s Future, Why Labour Lost in 2015 and How it Can Win Again, to be published this week, says the party is losing socially conservative voters to Ukip in droves, while appealing most to metropolitan liberals who tend to be better off and to have been to university.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s major challenge, the report argues, is to find a way to rebuild a coalition of support. It needs to \u201cstop patronising socially conservative Ukip voters and recognise the ways in which Ukip appeals to former Labour voters\u201d, the report says, adding: \u201cLabour is becoming a toxic brand. It is perceived by voters as a party that supports an \u2018open door\u2019 approach to immigration, lacks credibility on the economy, and is a \u2018soft touch\u2019 on welfare spending.\u201d</p> <p>At present, the report argues, Labour is \u201clargely a party of progressive, social liberals who value principles such as equality, sustainability, and social justice. It is losing connection with large parts of the voter population who are either pragmatists in their voting habits or social conservatives who value family, work, fairness and their country.\u201d It adds: \u201cLabour is becoming dangerously out of touch with the electorate and ... unwilling to acknowledge this growing estrangement.\u201d</p> <p>While it says Sadiq Khan\u2019s success in becoming mayor of London was a triumph, there is no reason to conclude that the party is on the brink of a national revival.</p> <p>\u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/07/sadiq-khan-elected-mayor-of-london-labour\" title=\"\">Khan won in London</a> with a strong mayoral campaign that married fairness themes with a pro-business and aspirational message. But just outside the M25, in socially conservative Thurrock, Labour continued to haemorrhage support, losing four council seats to Ukip in what is Labour\u2019s number eight target seat for the general election,\u201d the report says. \u201cLabour\u2019s performance in direct contests against the Conservatives was abject when compared with what would be expected of an opposition at this point in the electoral cycle.\u201d</p> <p>The study drew on extensive polling and analysis, and looked at Labour\u2019s performance among different \u201cvalue groups\u201d. First were the \u201cpioneers\u201d, of socially liberal, often metropolitan voters; the \u201cprospectors\u201d were pragmatic and aspirational, generally unattached voters who tend to choose the party that will do best for their financial circumstances; a third, the \u201csettlers\u201d, were socially conservative, concerned with home, family and national security. They tend to be older and are deserting the party.</p> <p>The report says that Labour is now as toxic in the south of England as the Tories are in the north: 43% of voters in the south said they would never vote Labour, while the same percentage in the north said they would never vote Tory. \u201cThe full significance of this for Labour is the fact that it must win 27 seats in the south to gain a majority of one [at the next general election] on a uniform national swing,\u201d the report says.</p> <p>It also finds that Labour is failing to appeal to the over-60s, the age group that is the likeliest to vote \u2013 45% say that they will never vote Labour and 30% say they will never vote for the Conservatives. \u201cUnless Labour detoxifies its brand with the grey vote, it will find it all but impossible to win a majority again,\u201d the report says.</p> <p>On a more optimistic note, it offers some hope to Labour in Scotland. Despite the party\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/06/holyrood-elections-see-rise-of-team-ruth-and-demise-of-labour-vision\" title=\"\">dreadful election performances</a> in recent elections there, the report finds that it is the least toxic party north of the border.</p>",

We are certainly not going to France looking <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/20/world-cup-2014-england-crash-out\" title=\"\">for revenge for 2014</a>.</p> <p>\u201cWe don\u2019t want the players to be fearful. This group doesn\u2019t have baggage. They aren\u2019t weighed down by the sins of the fathers. That\u2019s what our message will be. We want to go to France with a good football team, play well, and win matches.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/16/england-euro-2016-squad-23-picked-roy-hodgson\">England\u2019s Euro 2016 squad: the provisional 26 picked by Roy Hodgson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When it was suggested England often appeared to be behind the Germans and Italians in tournament strategy, the ability to stay in events for long enough to develop a playing style and impose themselves on opponents, Hodgson admitted he had only a limited grasp of what could be changed. \u201cI don\u2019t know what tournament strategy is,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThere are concepts that are thrown out there, but for someone to say to me that the Germans and the Italians are good at this and you\u2019re not, I\u2019d have to know what is meant by the term. As far as I am concerned you either win games or you don\u2019t. Most football success boils down to winning games, and I don\u2019t think tournaments are any different.\u201d</p> <p>England went out early in Brazil two years ago with a squad expected to do much better, an almost brutally truncated experience that Hodgson clearly remembers only too well. \u201cI am confident now, but I was confident for Brazil,\u201d he explained.</p> <p>\u201cThe facts suggest tournaments are decided on results. If you survive the tournament it means you\u2019ve played well and if you don\u2019t it means you\u2019ve played badly. The football truth is probably in between those two scenarios. Had <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/19/england-uruguay-match-report-group-d\" title=\"\">the ball not skidded off Gerrard\u2019s head</a> and played Su\u00e1rez onside, had we gone on to win that game 2-1, had we then <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/24/costa-rica-england-world-cup-group-d-match-report\" title=\"\">gone on to beat Costa Rica</a>, we might have been talking about a great tournament.</p> <p>\u201cTournaments have their own life, their own stories, it is three cup finals and you can be lucky, you can be unlucky. All we can do is prepare the best we can and make certain we reduce the chances of something hazardous happening to us. As far as I\u2019m concerned 2014 was a very different set of players, much more mature and experienced as a group. I am going into this tournament with another group of players. I believed that the team in 2014 would go far and we didn\u2019t. I believe this team will go far, so let\u2019s wait and see.\u201d</p> <p>Gary Cahill, who will captain the side in Sunday\u2019s friendly against Turkey, believes Harry Kane and Jamie Vardy will be able to pose problems for most defenders, having seen their ability at close hand in the Premier League.</p> <p>\u201cI have heard both players referred to as pests, but they are actually huge threats to any defence,\u201d the Chelsea defender said. \u201cThey are both very sharp and they both work hard too. They have certainly<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/feb/03/leicester-claudio-ranieri-unbelievable-jamie-vardy\" title=\"\"> produced in the Premier League this season</a>. I think we are blessed with some top quality striking talent.\u201d</p> <p>Having invited his captain to speak for a few moments while he got his breath back Hodgson was not sure he liked the sound of that. \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between having a good season in the Premier League and what\u2019s around at the top end of the international game,\u201d he interjected, perhaps fearful that his young strikers might get carried away with Cahill\u2019s praise.</p> <p>\u201cThese are young players making their first steps in a tournament, other countries have strikers who have done it all, if you think about Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Sergio Ag\u00fcero. I\u2019m just trying to be realistic. Jamie Vardy has had a great season but he will have to lift up a few more trophies before he can be compared to players of that stature.\u201d</p> <p>No one would argue otherwise, especially as Messi and Ag\u00fcero will not actually be appearing at Euro 2016. Hodgson is just being overprotective, as well as being careful not to take anything for granted. \u201cThe players I am working with are young, they are inexperienced, but they are playing a top level of football and they are playing against top level opposition every week,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIt could be argued that some of them will be better once they have got a tournament under their belts, but I think it would be wrong if we said this summer doesn\u2019t matter because it will only be a stepping stone.</p> <p>\u201cI do believe that a lot of these players will go on to future tournaments and be even better than they will be this time, but that belief doesn\u2019t alter our hopes, our ambitions and our dreams. It might be a bit unfair to put too much pressure on these players, they are not yet at the level of Messi or Ibrahimovic, they haven\u2019t got 100 caps. Most of them are at the start of their careers, and I am rather hoping they will be seen as players of potential, not as people who can right the wrongs of the last 40 years.\u201d</p>",

He might have had other injury problems in the past but as far as I\u2019m concerned a player can make a full recovery from a broken leg.</p> <p>\u201cDave Mackay broke his leg two years in a row and when he finally came back he was still the best player on the park. Jack needs to play, he wants to play and I need to see him play. Along with Jordan Henderson he is the reason why we\u2019ve<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/16/england-euro-2016-squad-23-picked-roy-hodgson\" title=\"\"> extended the squad</a>.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/16/england-euro-2016-squad-23-picked-roy-hodgson\">England\u2019s Euro 2016 squad: the provisional 26 picked by Roy Hodgson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hodgson will not necessarily give Wilshere 90 minutes on Sunday, but feels it is important to see him in action. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to assess either of them on training sessions alone, but I would like to give them both every chance <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/16/england-euro-2016-squad-marcus-rashford-jack-wilshere-andros-townsend-jordan-henderson\" title=\"\">to join the squad</a>,\u201d he explained. \u201cWe only have to finalise it by May 31st and our last group game is on June 20th, so we have a little time in which to work.</p> <p>\u201cJordan probably has more to prove than Jack, because initially the advice was that he would miss the tournament and he hasn\u2019t managed a game for his club yet, but he and Liverpool decided he could join us early for training rather than waiting until after the weekend [other Liverpool players involved in the Europa League final last Wednesday will join up with the England squad only after Sunday\u2019s game]. Jack is ready to play and has been champing at the bit. The only question for me to decide is whether he is fully fit and fully operational, and only a game will establish that.\u201d</p> <p>Hodgson has rarely made a secret of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/15/roy-hodgson-england-arsenal-jack-wilshere-squad-european-championship\" title=\"\">his admiration for the Arsenal player</a>, and barring any sort of accident or breakdown in Manchester on Sunday Wilshere appears a certainty to make the final cut.</p> <p>\u201cHe is a special English talent,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cHe isn\u2019t a clone of anyone else, he\u2019s a runner with the ball, a player who can beat opponents and change the tempo of a game. In my opinion a fit Jack Wilshere gives me an extra string to my bow, and it is not a gamble, because I do not intend to take him or Jordan Henderson unless they are fully fit.</p> <p>\u201cI understand that people will view it as a gamble because they haven\u2019t played many games recently, but I prefer to take the view that they will be fresher in that case, they won\u2019t be coming into a tournament tired after 55 matches. You can\u2019t have it both ways.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>It is hard to believe that just a few months back even die-hard Turkey fans had given up any hope of making it to Euro 2016. The Crescent Stars were joint last, level with Kazakhstan, three games into their qualifying group. Iceland and the Czech Republic had already built a healthy lead and the last time Holland had failed to book a place in a European tournament was 1984. There seemed no conceivable way that Turkey would be heading to France but their head coach, Fatih Terim \u2013 known as \u201cThe Emperor\u201d \u2013 is something of a specialist when it comes to fightbacks.</p> <p>When there is a siege mentality to create, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/jun/25/euro2008.turkey\">Terim is an expert</a>. The former Galatasaray manager <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/jun/26/euro2008.germanyfootballteam\">guided Turkey to the semi-finals</a> of Euro 2008 in his previous stint in charge of the national team. Then Turkey earned a reputation as the comeback kings, coming from behind against Switzerland, the Czechs and Croatia to record memorable victories.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/jun/25/euro2008.turkey\">Football: Euro 2008: Fatih Terim - a man made in modern Turkey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, Turkey\u2019s dreadful start to the Euro 2016 qualifiers left Terim exposed, with pundits calling for his head. But he remained steadfast, insisting his side would make it to France. After draws against Holland and Latvia, the mood of scepticism in Turkey deepened and the national team\u2019s prospects even more grim. They would have to beat the Dutch, Czechs and surprise leaders Iceland to stand any chance of even making the play-offs. And that is exactly what they did \u2013 but not without a degree of drama.</p> <p>First Holland <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/06/euro-2016-roundup-turkey-holland\">were beaten 3-0</a>. Then the Czech Republic were dispatched 2-0 in Prague but Terim\u2019s side still needed to win against Iceland and hope results from the other groups went their way to finish as the third-placed team with the best record. Turkey were drawing going into the 90th minute against Iceland when they were awarded a free-kick. Up stepped the captain, Selcuk Inan, to score and send his side directly to France, avoiding the play-offs all together.</p> <p>Since that dramatic late escape Turkey remain undefeated in their last 14 games going into Sunday\u2019s Euro 2016 warm-up against England. They are ranked 13th in the world by Fifa and boast arguably their strongest side ever. Spirits are high and the team are playing with the freedom of having no pressure or unrealistic expectations heaped on them.</p> <p>It is worth pointing out that this is a youthful side as Terim has dispensed with the old guard \u2013 with a few exceptions such as Barcelona\u2019s Arda Turan \u2013 and brought in a new generation, managing to get them to gel when it mattered most \u2013 their troubled qualifying campaign masks the fact that this is one of the more talented Turkey sides of recent times. Bayer Leverkusen\u2019s free-kick specialist Hakan Calhanoglu, Mainz\u2019s Yunus Malli and the Besiktas duo Oguzhan Ozyakup and Gokhan Tore have all seen their stock rise over the past few seasons. All are aged under 25.</p> <p>A surprise addition to the preliminary squad was the 18-year-old Emre Mor, who plays for Nordsj\u00e6lland in the Danish super league. \u201cHe is an exceptional talent. I watched him again and again but have yet to work with him so we will see what happens but he could add a lot to the team,\u201d said Terim when unveiling his Euro 2016 squad.</p> <p>The Turkish midfield possesses the right balance of youth and experience with Turan, Borussia Dortmund\u2019s Nuri Sahin and Mehmet Topal of Fenerbahce. Terim, however, has a quandary with his forwards. Does he stick with Burak Yilmaz, who now plays in China, or does he give the Besiktas striker Cenk Tosun a chance? \u201cI spoke to Burak, he has a problem with his hamstring but we have alternatives if he is unavailable. I have been impressed by Cenk and Mevlut Erdinc is an option,\u201d Terim said.</p> <p>There is even talk of ditching an out-and-out striker altogether and playing the attacking midfielder Malli as a false nine. Yilmaz has injury problems and Tosun played much of the season as second fiddle to Mario G\u00f3mez for the Turkish champions Besiktas.</p> <p>Terim also has problems in defence. At full-back Caner Erkin is almost certain to be first choice with Gokhan Gonul and Ismail Koybasi battling for a place on the right side.</p> <p>The centre-back positions, however, pose a dilemma \u2013 and here the tale takes a bizarre twist. The Bayer Leverkusen defender Omer Toprak will not feature since<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/nov/16/turkey-gokhan-tore-omer-toprak-hakan-calhanoglu\"> he was threatened at gunpoint by a friend of Tore in 2013,</a> following Turkey\u2019s defeat by Holland in their final 2014 World Cup qualifier.</p> <p>Tore, a former Chelsea youngster who now plays for Besiktas, had allegedly been stewing over a reported affair between his former girlfriend and a friend of Toprak. Accompanied by a sidekick whose identity remains unknown, Tore is said to have gained access to Toprak\u2019s hotel room whereupon, it is alleged, his friend walked over to Toprak, pulled out a gun and told him he would be shot if he did not lay flat on the floor.</p> <p>No one was hurt. The story remained largely forgotten until October\u2019s match against the Czech Republic, when Terim decided to recall Tore. Toprak has not featured for Turkey since. \u201cWe decided to pick Tore and, as you know, Omer Toprak has said what he has to say on the matter,\u201d Terim said.</p> <p>In Toprak\u2019s absence, Bursaspor\u2019s Serdar Aziz has been featuring recently alongside Topal, a defensive midfielder. Terim also has the Galatasaray veteran Hakan Balta and Caglar Soyuncu, a 19-year-old who has just earned a move to Freiburg, as options.</p> <p>Turkey habitually struggle getting to tournaments but once there they are there are usually competitive and exciting. Terim has guided Turkey to those semi-finals in Euro 2008 and Galatasaray to a Uefa Cup triumph in 2000. This may be a routine friendly for England \u2013 their first meeting with the Turks since <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/oct/11/minutebyminute.sport\">2003\u2019s goalless draw in Istanbul</a> \u2013 but a win or even a respectable draw in Manchester would mark the beginning of a bold new era for Turkey.</p>",

      "headline": "Confident Andy Murray ready to finally conquer clay at French Open",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-22T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>This is a French Open of quiet desperation for some, rising hope for others. But there is not a single serious contender who is not drenched in sweat worrying about the consequences, from Novak Djokovic and the all-time king of Paris, Rafael Nadal, to Andy Murray, who might yet emerge from the battle vindicated in his belief that he has finally conquered clay.</p> <p>The binding factor is age. They certainly are not old, but neither are they unaware of the young challengers gathering in increasing numbers behind them. All three will have seen Roger Federer, 35 in August, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/19/roger-federer-pulls-out-french-open\" title=\"\">walk away from a slam</a> for the first time in 17 years of extraordinary excellence, a creaking legend powerless to fight his own body\u2019s failings, and wondered quietly about their own strengths and weaknesses.</p> <p>Djokovic, the most dominant No1 in the Open era and 29 on Sunday, is the logical favourite. Yet he is vulnerable, carrying the weight of expectation that does not normally worry him. For all that the Serb \u2013 who opens against Lu Yen-hsun \u2013 exudes off-court calm, he knows his path to a first title in Paris to complete a career slam will take him through a relatively easy first week then on towards a potential fourth semi-final against Nadal, who is reaching for his 10th title and has his own issues.</p> <p>Djokovic, whose <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/03/french-open-novak-djokovic-rafael-nadal\" title=\"\">quarter-final victory last year</a> was his first over Nadal at Roland Garros, still has that history to contend with. Nadal, similarly, has to prove to himself and to his sport that he is not spent, that he can celebrate his 30th birthday here by doing the incredible at least one more time.</p> <p>The Spaniard, whose opening opponent is the big-serving Australian Sam Groth, is not ready to join Federer on the sidelines, temporarily or not. He is still hungry and his game is steadily coming back to him after a year when he became a target for every ambitious climber on the circuit.</p> <p>Murray brings the most encouraging form and energy to the second slam of the season. He beat <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/07/andy-murray-rafael-nadal-madrid-open-final\" title=\"\">Nadal in the semi-finals in Madrid</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/15/andy-murray-novak-djokovic-rome-claycourt\" title=\"\">Djokovic in the final in Rome</a>. Over the past 12 months, since making his clay breakthrough by beating Nadal in Madrid, he has an 85% winning record on the surface, better than anyone else. That in itself is remarkable for a player once perceived as a struggling clay-courter. Nadal, who should know, never thought that. In Monte Carlo this year, he dismissed the notion out of hand: \u201cAndy is a great player on any surface. He is a great player on clay.\u201d</p> <p>Murray might shy away from the description great just yet. But, after an early-season dip, he is playing his best for a little while, whatever the surface \u2013 and hopes to demonstrate it in the first round against Radek Stepanek, the veteran who was his second opponent on his Wimbledon debut in 2005. In Rome, Murray devastated Djokovic, who collapsed mentally in conditions both players regarded as dangerous.</p> <p>Murray, the acme of diplomacy, suppressed a smile and said: \u201cTo be honest, I think it was quite normal. He was probably going into the match a bit tired, as well, so he was quite frustrated from early on. But, from my side, I did a good job. I stayed solid the whole way through. Any time there was danger, I handled those situations well. I was pretty calm, made good decisions under pressure and that\u2019s what you need to do on clay.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t rush any of those points, I was nice and patient. My serve was huge for me \u2013 not just last week but through Madrid as well [where he lost to Djokovic in the final]. I need to serve well to beat the best players, but I\u2019ve made big improvements on that side of things and hopefully it keeps going that way.\u201d</p> <p>Murray has often gone deep in this tournament. This year, he senses he is better placed than ever to go the whole way. \u201cIt would be great to reach the final, but I\u2019m a long way from doing that. That is what has been nice for me the last couple of years in the clay season. I have been doing stuff I\u2019d never done before on this surface. It was nice at this stage in my career to achieve things that I\u2019d never done and maybe thought that I wouldn\u2019t. Like the Davis Cup, for example. That was something I never thought we\u2019d do and that made it more special.</p> <p>\u201cWinning in Rome \u2013 I\u2019d had some terrible times there over the years with injuries, with my back, so to win there was amazing, one of my nicest wins. I really enjoyed that.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the only slam [where] I haven\u2019t played the final. So if I could do that, I would have played in the final of pretty much all the major events bar Monte Carlo, I think. It would be\u00a0nice... but I\u2019m not here to just reach the final.\u201d</p> <p>That was a mildly chilling declaration. Murray, though, is now a quiet assassin, not the emotional ball of energy that flirted with great deeds and destruction in the space of a single rally sometimes. And he is in no doubt as to where his new perspective springs from.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s been great so far,\u201d he says of having his young daughter, Sophia, on tour with him and Kim, his wife. \u201cShe has travelled well, too, sleeping good, which makes a big difference. We have adjoining rooms so I sleep next door during tournaments. But, even when we\u2019re back home, she has been great. No complaints.</p> <p>\u201cI try to be home every night for bath time. I do as much as I can to help. Every week it\u2019s getting better, easier. Once she starts moving around, everyone tells me, that\u2019s when it gets more complicated.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s a lot more smiley than me, that\u2019s for sure.

      "body": "<p>Rugby\u2019s inclusion in the Olympic Games will transform the sport, tilt the balance of power, make the 15-a-side game more attractive and act as a magnet for leading players in other sports. They are the conclusions drawn by the sponsors of the World Rugby Sevens Series, HSBC, who have produced a report called the Future of Rugby.</p> <p>The final round of the series concludes at Twickenham on Sunday, with the Australian former rugby league player Jarryd Hayne, who also had one season in the NFL, in Fiji\u2019s squad.</p> <p>\u201cPlaying in the Olympics and for a gold medal is a big draw,\u201d said the former Australia captain, George Gregan, at Twickenham as an HSBC ambassador. \u201cI can see more and more rugby league players making the switch to sevens because it is easier for them to pick up than 15s as well as being an explosive and fast version of the game.</p> <p>\u201cI have been to a number of sevens events this year. The format is drawing more people into the game \u2013 men and women, boys and girls \u2013 and it is taking off in Australia in a big way. It is a fun game for kids based on skills and speed, and great to watch.\u201d</p> <p>The former Ireland captain, Brian O\u2019Driscoll, whose country has recently taken up sevens again, believes the full version of the game will benefit from the Olympic exposure.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone would agree that last weekend\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/14/saracens-racing-92-european-rugby-champions-cup-final-match-report\" title=\"\">Champions Cup final</a> was not an easy watch, even if the weather did not help,\u201d he said. \u201cSevens is all about attack and players are incredibly fit. Spectators want to talk about how fantastic an attack has been, not how a defence has got the better of it.</p> <p>\u201cYou get very few bad games in sevens \u2013 and certainly not two in a row. I am not sure that can be said for 15s when it comes to the northern hemisphere this year and it will be interesting to see how the two forms of the game coexist after the Olympics, which will provide incredible exposure and get people talking about skills, pace and attack.\u201d</p> <p>HSBC\u2019s global head of sponsorship and events, Giles Morgan, said: \u201cI can see the United States and China being sevens powerhouses in 20 years, tilting the balance of power away from New Zealand,\u201d . By then, I see more people and countries playing sevens than 15s but without there being the cannibal effect T20 has had on five-day cricket.</p> <p>\u201cSevens and 15s will live together and help the other grow but every sport has to operate differently in the social media age, as golf has been finding out. The Olympics will widen rugby\u2019s boundaries and what an opportunity for Fiji, a country that has never won a medal. Watch China grow now the game there has access to government funding. It is an incredibly exciting time for rugby.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/20/nathan-hughes-wasps-england-premiership-fiji\">Win or lose with Wasps, Twickenham and England beckon for Nathan Hughes</a> </p> </aside>",

On a disappointing day for Eddie Jones \u2013 who announces his England squad on Sunday \u2013 his midfield may be further disrupted by the loss of Owen Farrell, who came off in the same game clutching his ribs. The Saracens fly-half is touch-and-go for next weekend\u2019s final.</p> <p>But Tuilagi is the main concern for England. It is understood the centre, who has been plagued by groin and hamstring injuries for two years, has suffered a grade-two hamstring tear, which he has suffered before, an injury that tends to carry a six-week layoff.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/15/leicester-tigers-richard-cockerill-rugby-interview\" title=\"\">Richard Cockerill, his director of rugby</a>, was unable to confirm the extent of the injury, but said: \u201cManu\u2019s pulled his hamstring. I don\u2019t know how badly. We\u2019ll assess it over the next 48 hours. He came off pretty quickly, so it doesn\u2019t look brilliant, but we\u2019ll see.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/15/european-champions-saracens-mark-mccall-racing-92-premiership-double\" title=\"\">Mark McCall</a> was similarly uncertain about Farrell\u2019s injury, picked up when he was hit by two tackles in the same passage of play. \u201cI don\u2019t know the extent of it yet. He\u2019s got a bang on the rib, and you know ribs can go one way or the other. Hopefully, it\u2019s the right way.\u201d</p> <p>Cockerill refused to blame Tuilagi\u2019s early exit for the result, but once again expressed his dislike for the artificial surface at Allianz Park.\u201cIf you get more purchase on the pitch, you put more force through your body and that causes more problems,\u201d Cockerill said.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not a fan of the artificial pitches at all. For me they could take them all out and make every Premiership side have a DESSO field (grass mixed with natural fibres) or a proper grass one that\u2019s mixed so that you have a good surface for the whole year.\u201d</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-22T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Eddie Jones has said ever since he became England\u2019s head coach that he needs to find players capable of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/16/eddie-jones-england-rugby-union-six-nations-squad\" title=\"\">challenging the current squad </a>and forcing their way into the team, but his selection for June\u2019s tour to Australia will largely be made up of the tried and tested after the last two months of the club season left him underwhelmed.</p> <p>One uncapped player who impressed Jones during last week\u2019s training camp in Brighton, which was not attended by players involved in the Premiership semi-finals, was the Harlequins prop Kyle Sinckler, whose club colleague and fellow front-rower, Joe Marler, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/18/joe-marler-pulls-out-england-match-wales-tour-australia\" title=\"\">will miss the trip</a> to take some time out from the\u00a0game.</p> <p>The 23-year-old Sinckler, who took up rugby in Battersea when he was eight after being considered too aggressive for the football field, has shadowed the Wales and Lions tighthead Adam Jones at Quins this season, starting seven matches and making 20 appearances as a replacement. He came off the bench in the recent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/13/harlequins-montpellier-european-challenge-cup-final\" title=\"\">European Challenge Cup final against Montpellier</a> in Lyon when his relish for the physical battle against the Top 14 side that contained a number of South Africans caught the England coach\u2019s attention.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/16/eddie-jones-england-rugby-union-six-nations-squad\">Eddie Jones expects attitude and instinct from the new England breed</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSinckler is the most interesting one for me,\u201d says Jones. \u201cThere are areas of his game he needs to improve but he has competitive edges. He gave Harlequins exactly what they needed when he came on against Montpellier having been bullied. He looked to get on the front foot and he was not prepared to be bullied.</p> <p>\u201cHe is from a pretty tough background so rugby means a lot to him and he plays the game for all the right reasons. He loves a sport that helped him get out of a difficult situation and he is a guy who could keep on developing really well. He is athletically gifted: a tighthead needs to be able to scrummage and they need a competitive edge, which Sinckler certainly has when he carries the ball.\u201d</p> <p>Sinckler scored four tries for Quins this season with two, against London Irish and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/07/harlequins-exeter-premiership-match-report\" title=\"\">Exeter</a>, from long range as he showed a turn of speed not often seen from a tighthead prop, never mind one who weighs more than 19st. He joined Harlequins when he was 18 and has played for England at every age-grade from the under-16s.</p> <p>\u201cYou could not ask more from Kyle as a ball-carrier and he hits some incredible lines,\u201d says the Harlequins captain, Danny Care.</p> <p>\u201cHe has worked hard this year with Adam Jones to get his scrummaging up to speed and he is good to have around the squad, a funny character who fits in with us well and I am sure he will do with England.</p> <p>\u201cHe has got that added little bit up top where he wants to hurt people and he has the size to do it. He has the pace of a back and the power of a front rower, an explosive athlete. He showed how sharp he was with his try against Exeter when after 40 metres no one was catching him. If he gets a chance, he will not let anyone down.\u201d</p> <p>While Harlequins lost their European final, defeated 26-19 despite a valiant effort, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/14/saracens-racing-92-european-rugby-champions-cup-final-match-report\" title=\"\">Saracens flew home with the Champions Cup after beating Racing 92</a> comprehensively to become the first English club to take possession of the trophy for nine years. However, although Jones lauded the achievement, and the performances of his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/19/england-win-six-nations-grand-slam-france-match-report\" title=\"\">England grand slam winners</a>, he believes rugby in the Six Nations is behind the southern hemisphere in terms of skill.</p> <p>\u201cPlayers get a lot of confidence from winning big games,\u201d he says. \u201cSaracens won all their games in Europe and that helps England. Some of the rugby I have seen over the last five or six weeks hasn\u2019t added to the selection conundrum. Sinckler is the only one who has come out of left field. I haven\u2019t seen anyone elevate their position massively from where they have been.</p> <p>\u201cIf you look at the European Cup final and Super Rugby, they are at different ends in the spectrum of rugby. Last week\u2019s final was like a physical game of chess; everything was organised and planned and there was little unstructured rugby. In fact, it was probably zero.</p> <p>\u201cSuper Rugby is 90% unstructured. The best sides are able to play both ways and that is what I am looking for. At the moment I have to guess a lot about what players are capable of and I am hoping Henry Slade [the Exeter utility back] comes through because he has got a bit of everything once he gets his running game back.\u201d</p>",

Certainly the play-offs make a mockery of the idea of football as a meritocracy, simply because they don\u2019t necessarily reward the best team, but really there is no more appropriate way of deciding who goes up from such a terrifying and chaotic division than with such a terrifying and chaotic match.</p> <p>Brighton are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/16/brighton-sheffield-wednesday-championship-play-off-second-leg\">the latest victims of this lack of fairness</a>, having finished six and 15 points <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/championship/table\">ahead of the Tigers and the Owls</a>, but they will be watching on TV as half of south and east Yorkshire decamps to Wembley on Saturday.</p> <p>These two have enjoyed, or endured, depending on your view, similar paths to the final. Both faced teams upon whom there was much more pressure in the semi-finals; both took commanding leads to the second leg only to suffer <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/17/johnny-russell-derby-county-hull-city-championship-play-off-wembley-match-report\">all sorts of skittish moments</a> in the return; both hung on and probably feel quite grateful to be through.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/16/brighton-sheffield-wednesday-championship-play-off-second-leg\">Sheffield Wednesday rock Brighton to reach Championship play-off final</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The big difference is that one team expected to be here, while for another this represents a vaguely unlikely bonus. For Wednesday, to be on the verge of the top flight after the start of the season they had is rather remarkable.</p> <p>Last summer their new owner Dejphon Chansiri, perhaps harshly, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/11/sheffield-wednesday-stuart-gray-leaves-post\">sacked Stuart Gray</a>, but as the end of June approached and most other teams in the division were well under way with their preparations for the season, they did not have a manager and had not signed any players. For a while it looked fairly certain that Mark Cooper would be their new head coach, with Carlos Carvalhal acting as director of football.</p> <p>In the end Carvalhal, who had not coached for three years and had averaged slightly more than a brisk club-a-year for the previous 14, took the top job, and now has them 90 minutes from the Premier League. Cooper, if you\u2019re wondering, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/17/swindon-manager-mark-cooper-part-company-departure\">was sacked by Swindon in October</a> (temporarily replaced by their chairman), left Notts County in May and joined Forest Green Rovers a few days later. What could\u2019ve been.</p> <p>Few really knew what to make of Carvalhal when he arrived, fewer still when it emerged the Portuguese had written a book called <em>Soccer: Developing A Know-How</em> which threw around ideas such as \u201ctactical periodisation\u201d and a \u201cconceptual matrix\u201d, while also referencing Ren\u00e9 Descartes. Not exactly the sort of thing you expect from a division that Neil Warnock recently <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/06/neil-warnock-rotherham-championship-manager\">described as being full of \u201cblood and guts\u201d</a>.</p> <p>Carvalhal\u2019s arrival came with a late summer barrage of recruits: 14 players were signed permanently and on loan before the end of the transfer window, the most important probably being Fernando Forestieri from Watford.</p> <p>Forestieri, who thought he had won the player of the year award last week, only for that to be revealed as a miscalculation of the votes, has nevertheless been perhaps the most influential player in the division, scoring 15 goals and chipping in with another eight assists. There is always a vague sense that the Italian is on the verge of a volcanic tantrum, but that just makes him all the more fun to watch.</p> <p>Wednesday are clearly underdogs, something that Carvalhal has been doing his best to play up. \u201cI grew up in my country seeing the games on a black and white TV and it used to be the final of the [FA] Cup in England. I never thought I would go to Wembley one day and now this is something that we have achieved. It is fantastic,\u201d he said last week, sounding a little more like a tourist than a manager about to take his team there. \u201cWe know we have made history, it\u2019s been a long time for Sheffield Wednesday and it\u2019s very important for the club. Now we can wake up the giant.\u201d</p> <p>For his opposite number\u2019s part, this game could decide his future as well as a place in the Premier League. Steve Bruce has looked more and more exasperated every time he has been asked whether his job is safe in recent weeks, something that will be decided after the game but potentially complicated by owner Assem Allam\u2019s attempts to sell the club.</p> <p>\u201cYou are asking the question constantly because it\u2019s been lingering around for six months,\u201d he said after Hull just held off Derby in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/17/johnny-russell-derby-county-hull-city-championship-play-off-wembley-match-report\">their semi-final second leg </a>last week. Whoever wins, it is unlikely to feel fair.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-22T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>For Laura Robson, just stepping on to a court at Roland Garros is something of a victory, but she wants a lot more than that. As the 22-year-old Londoner said before her first-round match here against the 28th seed, Andrea Petkovic: \u201cThere\u2019s no reason that I can\u2019t get back to where I was, if not better, if I put the work in and do the right things.\u201d</p> <p>Where Robson once was \u2013 No1 in Britain, top 30 in the world, an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/05/andy-murray-laura-robson-olympic-silver\" title=\"\">Olympic silver medallist alongside Andy Murray</a>, a 14-year-old <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/jul/06/wimbledon.tennis4\" title=\"\">junior Wimbledon champion</a> \u2013 all seems so long ago. Now she is No302 in the world, but has a protected ranking, calculated on previous achievements, that gets her into this French Open.</p> <p>All of which makes her sunny disposition the more remarkable. There are plenty of players who would have crumbled and perhaps walked away from the challenge Robson\u2019s stressed-out wrists visited upon her from the moment she had to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/06/laura-robson-hobart-australian-open-tennis\" title=\"\">retire during her first-round match against Yanina Wickmayer</a> in Hobart in January 2014.</p> <p>Since then, she has seen more doctor\u2019s surgeries than tennis courts, but she thinks the suffering is over. She last had pain in her wrists at the start of the year. Finally, she can wind up her powerful arms and put maximum force through those frightening groundstrokes. What Robson needs now are a few wins to bolster her self-belief.</p> <p>\u201cMy wrist is fine. I\u2019m hitting it as hard as I always did,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m trying to play a little bit more consistently, but there have not been any changes due to injuries. It took a long time. Even at the US Open last year I wasn\u2019t hitting through it like I did before. I just had to keep getting on the practice court every day and get that confidence back.</p> <p>\u201cIt has been a while. I don\u2019t feel that I\u2019m overly far away. I had opportunities against Vika [Azarenka in Madrid] and in every match I played, especially in Miami against [Kirsten] Flipkens, set points and everything.</p> <p>\u201cI think it\u2019s always been mental. You can be the fittest player in the world, but if you are not there mentally then it\u2019s extremely hard to do well. Getting that confidence has been a long, long process and it\u2019s still a work in progress.\u201d</p> <p>Was there an upside to being away from the Tour for awhile? She laughs and shakes her head, then says: \u201cI saw my friends and my family much more than I had in the past. And I got a cat. But, no, I would have preferred to have been on Tour the whole time. It was a sucky situation.</p> <p>\u201cYou have to adjust your expectations. Like my coach is very positive and everyone around me is very happy that I\u2019m just playing, whereas I\u2019m like: \u2018I\u2019m still losing guys.\u2019 So you have to just adjust in that way.</p> <p>\u201cI haven\u2019t had any doubts with my wrist since the start of the year and that was the last time I had pain. Since then, I haven\u2019t worried about it. I\u2019m still doing rehab four times a week but I\u2019m going to be doing that for the rest of my life.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s nice to be able to get back on court every day. That was always the issue. I was able to play once and then take five days off because I still felt pain. So it\u2019s nice being able to plan a schedule because you know nothing is going to happen. When I was still in a cast, that was not fun because it went above the elbow and I couldn\u2019t tie my hair up or anything. My brother had to do that for me for a while.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a really long process with a lot of doctors and way more cortisone than anyone should have. We aren\u2019t talking a huge amount. I\u2019m sure footballers are getting it more because they have to play every weekend. We weren\u2019t silly with it, the doctors, especially my doctor, is very cautious with it.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a struggle but it has made me a more positive person in the long run and I\u2019m just happy to be here. My mum and dad and my family kept me sane. They weren\u2019t ever concerned that I wouldn\u2019t be able to get back. Everybody around me was pretty positive about it. I had a good group of people helping me along.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ll play the smaller tournaments again once my protected ranking runs out. It\u2019s fine though. I\u2019ve played all of them before. You\u2019re more excited to be at a slam as opposed to a 50 in France or somewhere, but it has to be done. There\u2019s no way around it. There\u2019s no short cut to getting your ranking back up.\u201d</p>",

They conceded 28 unanswered points either side of the break, beginning with Willie Isa\u2019s two tries to make it 12-4 for the Warriors.</p> <p>Penalties and errors from Wigan afforded Leeds the opportunity to reduce the gap but they were ultimately rudderless with ball in hand \u2013 and the Warriors would make them pay just after the break. First, clever footwork from Tomkins allowed George Williams to charge through an all-too familiar gap in the Leeds defence, before Dom Manfredi plucked a towering Matty Smith kick from the air the following set.</p> <p>Leeds were 22-4 behind and never looked capable of clawing back such a margin, and they were killed off six minutes after Manfredi\u2019s try when Ben Flower charged over. Whether it was in the script or not following his cautious recovery from a long-term knee injury,Wigan could even afford to give Tomkins the final quarter off with the job more than complete. Mitch Achurch scored something of a consolation try for Leeds but, true to form, their leaky defence had the final say, as tries for Oliver Gildart and Dan Sarginson rounded off another miserable day at the office for the champions.</p> <h2>Tigers roar back to bite Warrington with Solomona double</h2> <p> Magic Weekend provides Super League players with arguably the grandest stage of the season to produce their scintillating best: and if you ever felt a team would take advantage of the opportunity at hand, then it would be <strong>Castleford</strong>. Trailing 14-0 midway through the first half against <strong>Warrington</strong>, the Tigers decided that was the appropriate time to wake up and produce some of the mesmerising rugby league they are quickly becoming renowned for.</p> <p>Amazingly, they kept the ball alive on the last tackle for almost a full minute before Luke Dorn eventually crossed, with Grant Millington\u2019s effort just before half-time equally impressive.</p> <p>That made it 14-12 at half-time, and the Tigers continued to produce more sensational play after the break as they quickly moved into an unassailable lead. Denny Solomona\u2019s 17th and 18th tries of the season \u2013 both spectacular \u2013 were either side of a fine effort from Mike McMeeken, before an incredible break from Junior Moors allowed Dorn to touch down for his second and Castleford\u2019s sixth in a 34-14 win.</p> <p>Earlier, <strong>Widnes</strong> were in control of the opening game against <strong>Salford</strong> and looked set to end their poor run, despite Daniel Vidot crossing first for the Red Devils. The Vikings were 12-4 ahead at the break but as the second half wore on, Widnes\u2019s frailties began to haunt them more and more. Two remarkable try-saving tackles from Stefan Marsh kept the Vikings ahead but when Justin Carney crossed midway through the second half, it became a question of whether Widnes could hold on. Late on, Vidot crossed all too easily for his second and an 18-12 Salford win suggests they may yet haul themselves out of trouble. Widnes have now lost eight in a row. <strong> </strong></p>",

When you get down and you decide on the final 23-man roster, there are very close, tight decisions to make. The moment when you decide, it\u2019s about definitely who you feel the strongest about.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/16/jozy-altidore-copa-america-hamstring-injury-usa-soccer\">Jozy Altidore to miss Copa Am\u00e9rica with hamstring injury</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Klinsmann looks to have found his first-choice goalkeeper too. Howard, who played his final game for Everton last week before heading back to MLS with the Colorado Rapids, took a one-year international break after the 2014 World Cup, allowing Brad Guzan to stake his claim as No1. on Saturday, Klinsmann said the Aston Villa goalkeeper will start as first-choice: \u201cWe go into the tournament with Brad Guzan being the No1,\u201d said Klinsmann. \u201cWe believe that Brad deserves it. He had a very tough year with Aston Villa [who were relegated from the Premier League] ... but it\u2019s also a different environment [with the US national team]. \u201d<br /></p> <p>\u201cThe manager makes the decisions, that\u2019s no different than any other time,\u201d Howard said this week. \u201cSo for me, I\u2019m not really that concerned with any decisions that are getting made. I don\u2019t make them, I can\u2019t concern myself with them.\u201d</p> <p>Klinsmann <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/01/copa-america-usa-40-man-roster\">had brought 40 players into the preliminary squad</a>, but was forced to cut the roster down to 23 before the the start of the tournament.</p> <p>Jozy Altidore was ruled out earlier this week with a hamstring injury. The 26-year-old has 34 goals in 93 international games but will not feature in the tournament, which celebrates 100 years of the Copa America. USA play against Colombia in the tournament opener on 3 June.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a huge bummer for all of us, but especially for Jozy, because he had so much drive and ambition going towards the Copa America,\u201d Klinsmann said in the week. \u201cObviously it\u2019s a big blow for us and him personally, but there\u2019s nothing we can do about it, unfortunately.\u201d</p> <p>USA kick off their campaign against Colombia at Levi\u2019s Stadium in Santa Clara.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-22T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>The Villa Poligono housing project, near the city of San F\u00e9lix, in Venezuela\u2019s south-eastern Bol\u00edvar state, is somewhere President Maduro might once have felt his popularity was secure.</p> <p>His smiling, moustached image features prominently on a vast poster at the entrance to the complex of bungalows. Poligono is part of the socialist government\u2019s <em>Gran Misi\u00f3n Vivienda</em>, the great housing mission designed to provide rent-free homes to those most in need, under the slogan \u201cdecent homes for the people\u201d.</p> <p>But for the past few weeks few of its residents have been at home. Instead they can be found on the road outside, mounting a noisy protest. \u201cWe\u2019ve had enough\u2019, says Anna Karena, 44. \u201cThis has to end.\u201d</p> <p>She has multiple grievances. Shockingly, none of the breezeblock homes in the entire complex has ever had running water. When the residents were given their keys in 2014, they were told that the plumbing would soon be connected. It never was. More recently, electricity blackouts, lasting four hours at a time, have become routine, as a combination of drought and inefficiency has left the nation without enough generating capacity.</p> <p>But what seems to have persuaded her and her neighbours to protest openly is the extreme scarcity of basics, such as rice, soap and medicines. Unable to afford the exorbitant prices of the rampant black market, Karena has to queue for hours, sometimes from before dawn, just to buy enough to eat.</p> <p>Hers are the same allegations of government incompetence and corruption that are <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/18/venezuela-police-fire-teargas-protesters-crisis\" title=\"\">echoing across this nation</a>. A crash in the global price of oil, by far Venezuela\u2019s most significant export, has unmasked both its dysfunctional economy and a calamitous lack of foresight on the part of its leaders. It is grappling with the world\u2019s deepest recession, the world\u2019s highest inflation (estimated at around 500%), and the world\u2019s second highest murder rate. It has no sovereign wealth fund and is facing the serious risk of default by November.</p> <p>\u201cThey have been telling us for years it\u2019s about to get better,\u201d says Karena, pointing to a field that the residents use as a public latrine. \u201cYou want to know what happened to the money that they should have set aside for electricity and water?\u201d says her neighbour, Yanileth. \u201cThey stole it.\u201d</p> <p>A handful of those in the small group on the road describe themselves as opposition supporters. Some claim that they are still Chavistas, loyal to Nicol\u00e1s Maduro\u2019s predecessor, the late Hugo Ch\u00e1vez. But all say, without hesitation, that they want to see Maduro leave office. And they have a firm, but possibly misplaced, belief that they have the power to make that happen.</p> <p>Venezuela\u2019s opposition, which won control of the national assembly following <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/07/venezuela-elections-socialists-dealt-a-blow-as-opposition-wins-landslide\" title=\"\">landslide elections in December 2015</a>, has begun the process of holding a recall referendum, hoping to cut short the president\u2019s mandate, which is otherwise due to end in early 2019.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d73f4c850998f098f226bd2fb2feb6dfe582be8e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d73f4c850998f098f226bd2fb2feb6dfe582be8e/0_296_4895_2936/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Caracas protest\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police block a demonstrator during a march on the electoral commission headquarters in Caracas last week, demanding a referendum to recall the president</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Fernando Llano/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is a cumbersome process. First of all, 1% of the electorate, in each of Venezuela\u2019s 23 states, as well as the capital, Caracas, have to sign a petition saying they support a recall referendum. That is around 200,000 people. The opposition says it managed to gather 1.85m signatures in a matter of days.</p> <p>The signatures are now being \u201cverified\u201d by Venezuela\u2019s electoral council (CNE). It is a supposedly independent institution, but is in fact a branch of government. The opposition accuses the CNE of deliberately stalling the referendum process and doing everything it can to protect its paymaster. It has organised three nationwide marches on its offices to demand an end to the delays. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/18/venezuela-police-fire-teargas-protesters-crisis\" title=\"\">The latest, on 18 May</a>, led to at least a dozen injuries and 26 arrests after security forces fired multiple rounds of teargas. At one stage, in an apparently unprovoked attack, a group of opposition supporters viciously beat up a police officer.</p> <p>With the country seemingly in a deep downward spiral, President Maduro, who blames the widespread shortages on a combination of the price of oil, foreign powers and capitalism, has decided that the solution is to give himself more power. He has unilaterally declared that the country is in a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/14/venezuela-maduro-emergency-powers\" title=\"\">state of emergency</a>, ignoring the fact that, according the constitution he claims to uphold, such a decision needs the approval of the national assembly.</p> <p>The state of emergency gives him sweeping options to intervene in the private and public economy, including allowing the army to take over the distribution of food. Maduro has also threatened to close down the national assembly, which he claims is full of \u201cfascists\u201d. \u201cIt is a matter of time before it disappears,\u201d he says.</p> <p>He describes the referendum as \u201coptional\u201d only. \u201cWe have no obligations to hold any type of referendum in this country,\u201d he said, during a rare news conference with international journalists, the purported aim of which was to counter the bad press that he has been getting abroad.</p> <p>Such statements have led to expressions of concern from many of Venezuela\u2019s neighbours. Trinidad and Tobago, fearing a possible failed state on its doorstep, says that it is preparing for a \u201cworst case scenario\u201d.</p> <p>The secretary general of the Organisation of American States, Luis Almagro, has told Maduro that, if he blocks the recall referendum process, he will go down in history as just another of Latin America\u2019s \u201cpetty dictators\u201d. Jos\u00e9 Mujica, the leftwing former president of Uruguay, seen as one of the region\u2019s more philosophical leaders, went one stage further, describing Maduro as \u201cmad as a goat\u201d.</p> <p>Some who know the 53-year-old president well have expressed surprise at his public intransigence and bullying demeanour. After beginning his career as a bus driver, Maduro worked his way up the ranks of the socialist political ladder as a union leader in the metro system, and ultimately a foreign minister under Ch\u00e1vez. He may have done little beyond carrying out his boss\u2019s orders. But those who encountered him during that time say he did so with tact and charm. In 2012 he was handpicked by the dying Ch\u00e1vez as his successor to take the so-called Bolivarian revolution forward.</p> <p>The veteran Venezuelan politician, Henry Ramos Allup, the current president of the national assembly and a political opponent of Maduro, told the <em>Observer</em> that he remembers him as a young politician as \u201cneither exceptional nor unexceptional. Normal\u201d. He says Maduro\u2019s current unusual manner may be a consequence of the stress of attempting to imitate Ch\u00e1vez\u2019s autocratic style of leadership, while also having to share that power with others, including the defence minister, Vladimir Padrino L\u00f3pez, and the former head of the national assembly, Diosdado Cabello.</p> <p>This weekend Maduro has promised widespread military exercises, in response to an unspecified (his opponents say, imaginary) threat from abroad. Half a million army personnel are expected to take part in what Padrino L\u00f3pez says will be the biggest such exercise in the nation\u2019s history.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd8c088ee73aff6dfb8536a05ebfa10ca2ad7142\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd8c088ee73aff6dfb8536a05ebfa10ca2ad7142/0_74_2953_1772/1000.jpg\" alt=\"President Maduro\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">President Maduro is threatening to close down the national assembly, which is trying to remove him from office.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mirafloress Press/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The army has long been the arbiter of power in Venezuela, where there have been five coups, or coup attempts, since 1940. Henrique Capriles, the opposition leader, says the time has come for the army to consider its position in the face of what he says is President Maduro\u2019s disregard for the constitution. \u201cYou must decide whether you are with the constitution or Maduro,\u201d he says.</p> <p>It is unlikely that the army would consider deserting Maduro. Both Ch\u00e1vez, a former commando, and Maduro have been careful to ensure that the military is heavily embedded in the project of Chavismo, and its profits. Dozens of high-ranking officers occupy senior positions in government ministries.</p> <p>So is there any solution? International efforts are continuing to try to bring Venezuela\u2019s government and opposition together in mediation talks. <a href=\"https://stjoerayne.org/2016/05/02/pope-francis-writes-letter-to-venezuelan-president-maduro/\" title=\"\">Pope Francis has written a letter to President Maduro</a>, the contents of which have not been revealed. A visit by his envoy scheduled for this week was, however, cancelled without explanation. The former Spanish prime minister, Jos\u00e9 Luis Rodr\u00edguez Zapatero, the former president of Panama, Mart\u00edn Torrijos, and the former president of the Dominican Republic, Leonel Fern\u00e1ndez, met President Maduro, and then senior opposition leaders, late last week. Progress appears to have been limited. The opposition coalition has made it clear that a condition for its taking part in talks with the government would be a pledge from Maduro that a recall referendum will take place this year, and political prisoners are released. Both seem highly unlikely.</p> <p>Luis Vicente Le\u00f3n, a pollster in Caracas, takes a bleak view of the coming months. Maduro\u2019s government, he says, may have decided that the political cost of admitting that its previous policies were wrong will lead to its downfall. Almost its only option now, he says, is a more radical path.</p>",

Or perhaps, in truth, they know as little about what happened as we do.</p> <p>Because we live in such disturbed times, because we feel beset by almost daily acts of heinous terror that seemingly move ever closer to home, because the world, never easier to travel, appears an increasingly dangerous place, we fear the worst.</p> <p>In this case the worst <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/20/who-was-on-board-egyptair-flight-ms804\">is not that 66 people have died</a>, dreadful though that reality is. It is that they were, possibly, victims of a calculated act of mass murder. Unspoken is the thought that, next time, the victims could be ourselves and our families.</p> <p>Obviously this is not an objective response. It is a human one. And naturally so. It is our shared humanity that is under attack.</p> <p>It may not have been terrorism. The only really hard information to date about what happened in the last three minutes of EgyptAir flight MS804 from Paris to Cairo has been garnered from the automatic Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System. The plane\u2019s sensors <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/21/egyptair-flight-ms804-smoke-detected-in-minutes-before-crash\">reportedly detected smoke in a lavatory and the avionics bay</a>, window or windows suddenly open to the skies, and rapidly ramifying computer problems.</p> <p>Some experts warn the Acars data is incomplete. Others say it gives the first reliable indication of what occurred. It can be interpreted in different ways, as evidence of a catastrophic technical failure sparking an on-board fire, or of a bomb explosion.</p> <p>Other theoretical variations \u2013 a hijacking, a deadly cockpit struggle, a suicidal pilot, a missile strike or a different form of unusual technical fault \u2013 appear less credible at this point. Yet all that would change if a fanatic were suddenly to pop up in a Raqqa video, celebrating another blow against the kuffar.</p> <p>Whatever conclusions the investigators ultimately reach \u2013 and it may take months to get final answers \u2013 the broadly held perception that this was yet another terrifying and violent event in an international landscape inadequately protected from ruthless extremists has probably already taken irreversible root.</p> <p>It raises pressing questions for the French and Egyptian governments. Regardless of whether the plane was sabotaged, this episode has highlighted the serious concerns about security at Charles de Gaulle airport outside Paris and, in particular, the potential for the radicalisation of the Muslim workforce.</p> <p>Patrick Calvar, head of France\u2019s equivalent of MI5, warned recently that the country remained a top target for Isis, which he said was seeking \u201cnew ways\u201d of hitting home. For President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, who vowed to \u201ceradicate terrorism\u201d after last November\u2019s Paris attacks, personal as well as political credibility is now at stake.</p> <p>Egypt\u2019s authoritarian, military-backed government, whose harsh and divisive policies since seizing power in a 2013 coup have done much to undermine moderate Muslim opinion, also has questions to answer.</p> <p>It took nearly four weeks before President Abdel Fatah al-Sisi admitted that the Russian passenger jet that crashed last October on the Sinai peninsula had been blown up. There must be no cover-ups and face-saving this time.</p> <p>Fear and uncertainty is bound to continue as long as the battle against Isis, al-Qaida and like-minded affiliates in Libya and elsewhere remains inconclusive. Optimistic American assessments must be taken with a large pinch of salt.</p> <p>When the dust clears after this latest incident, we should also remember that Europeans or westerners are not the main target. In this ongoing civil war within Islam, it is Muslims who are by far the most numerous victims. But fear makes victims of us all.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-22T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>It had been four years since Farrag Diab said goodbye to his family and set off for work in Saudi Arabia, and he was longing for the wedding that would bring him back home this month. But his son had found work closer to home as a security guard on the national carrier, EgyptAir, and had been assigned to fly MS804 from Paris late on Wednesday evening.</p> <p>Diab rushed home last week in terror rather than celebration, to wait for news of a missing plane, and then begin the long mourning for his son. Without a body, Mohamed Diab\u2019s mother refuses to accept his death.</p> <p>\u201cFarrag broke down at the airport,\u201d said Wael Diab, a 28-year-old cousin of Mohamed. \u201cThey are in shock. His father is still wailing all the time, and his mother still sits by his bed, waiting for him to come home.\u201d</p> <p>The family had been scattered by the economic crisis that followed Egypt\u2019s slide into turmoil. Mohamed\u2019s father and brother went to Saudi Arabia for work, but they didn\u2019t earn enough to return home for visits and only his father was able to come back for a memorial service in Cairo.</p> <p>Nearly half of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/20/who-was-on-board-egyptair-flight-ms804\">the 66 people who were killed in the MS804 crash</a> were Egyptians, many of them young men and women forced to look overseas for work, families splintered by reluctant migration. Their journeys tell similar stories of an economy weakened by decades of corruption and mismanagement, and under fresh recent pressure from violence and political turmoil since the revolution that ended president Hosni Mubarak\u2019s 30-year reign in 2011.</p> <p>Tourism, still a mainstay for millions, has been the worst hit, and most Egyptians fear their country\u2019s latest tragedy will only deepen the crisis, even as investigators try to work out if it was sabotage or a tragic failure of electronics and engineering. \u201cThe plane crash only makes things worse,\u201d said Ibrahim el-Ghitany, senior researcher at the Regional Centre for Strategic Studies in Cairo. \u201cIt adds a lot of suspicion on the security situation in Egypt, which on its own will affect the tourism industry.\u201d</p> <p>Mohamed Diab\u2019s profession \u2013 security \u2013 is one of the few still flourishing in an increasingly unstable state. When he got the job some four years ago it was celebrated by a family glad to have him still in Cairo as other work, particularly in tourism, was drying up. Visitor numbers to Egypt have plunged by nearly half over the last year, deepening half a decade of decline. They may not return to their 2010 peak near 15 million for many years, experts say.</p> <p>\u201cThere have been so few tourists since the revolution,\u201d said Mohammad, a former salesman at Bluewater shopping centre in Kent who returned home to be closer to his family, but now barely scrapes by touting for business as a tour guide outside the pyramids.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6fab7175c097e3568c8618c35c9b8f6218f77a00\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6fab7175c097e3568c8618c35c9b8f6218f77a00/421_224_1163_698/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Debris that search teams found from EgyptAir Airbus Flight MS804.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Debris that search teams found from EgyptAir Airbus Flight MS804.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HO/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A cocktail of fears is keeping visitors away after a series of deadly incidents, from plane accidents and riots to the military\u2019s mistaken slaughter of several Mexican tourists, and the gruesome murder of a young Italian student after he was detained by Egyptian police.</p> <p>The tragedies all represent threats to the economic stability of the country, experts said. Those fears were almost immediately reflected in the Cairo stock market, which lost $300m of its value in a dramatic plunge on Thursday, the last trading day of the week in Egypt.</p> <p>Militants waging war on the Egyptian state have warned that they aim to sow economic devastation as well as fear with their attacks, most recently in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/31/russian-plane-crashes-in-sinai-egyptian-pm-says\">the bombing of a Russian charter plane last October</a>, with a small device smuggled on to the Metrojet flight inside a soda can.</p> <p>\u201cThe Islamic State in Sinai, and the group that preceded it, have been running self-declared economic warfare against Egypt since 2013,\u201d said Zack Gold, an expert in militancy in Egypt and non-resident fellow at the Atlantic Council\u2019s Rafik Hariri Centre for the Middle East.</p> <p>The government\u2019s handling of past crises has done little to reassure Egyptians, or those who might consider visiting the country, that officials are stepping up efforts to protect them.</p> <p>It took four months for the government to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/17/egypt-plane-crash-bomb-jet-russia-security-service\">publicly acknowledge that the Russian Metrojet flight was brought down by a bomb</a>, and though it has been faster to consider a terrorist role in last Thursday\u2019s crash, many of the mourning relatives say Cairo is focusing on the details of the investigation at their expense.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone in our family went to the airport. Not a single official told us what was going on. We could not get an explanation, we did not know what happened to him,\u201d said Ehab el-Hawwary, cousin of Nasser Hamdy Hammad, a 45-year-old father of five, who died in the MS804 crash. \u201cWe demand nothing but to find out the truth of what happened, what caused the plane to crash.\u201d</p> <p>His is an anger echoed by other relatives, tormented by accounts of the terrifying last moments of the plane, and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/20/egypt-mourns-grief-is-camped-over-this-village\">without even bodies to anchor their grief</a>.<br /></p> <p>There is still no explanation for the disaster. Flight data shows parts of the doomed aircraft were filling with smoke minutes before it vanished from radar screens, and a few battered pieces of the plane and luggage have been found at sea, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/20/egyptair-flight-ms804-what-theories-must-investigators-rule-out\">they offer little clue as to what caused the crash</a>.</p> <p>It may be weeks or even months, if at all, before investigators find the black box data recorders that can help clarify what happened. Part of the search area has a seabed with challenging geology, and few have forgotten the two-year search needed to find the same parts of an Air France flight that crashed into the Atlantic in 2009.</p> <p>Security experts say the lack of any claim of responsibility from a terrorist group would be a striking departure from usual working methods. \u201cIf it is terrorism, it is very strange that no one has claimed it yet,\u201d said Gold, who pointed out that the Metrojet attack was claimed within hours by Islamic State, although few believed the group at first.</p> <p>Even if it was a terrorist attack, the first security questions would be asked in Charles de Gaulle airport on the outskirts of the French capital, where the EgyptAir flight took off.</p> <p>The grim details that are known have already renewed the damaging perception of dangers in a country once known more for sunshine, ancient treasures and spectacular dive sites, said Gold. \u201cIf tourists think flights to Egypt are being targeted they might choose to fly to different destinations,\u201d he added.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1e3f9ea588c89bc3b5e4dec75981bd9995716464\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1e3f9ea588c89bc3b5e4dec75981bd9995716464/0_161_3500_2101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"People mourn at a makeshift memorial for victims of Russian airliner\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">People mourn at a makeshift memorial for victims of a Russian airliner which crashed in Egypt in October.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stringer/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is a particularly bitter blow for those who have ridden out several tough years in the tourist industry, because it comes at a time when there seemed to be cause for a sliver of cautious optimism, with Russia talking about restarting flights after a string of security upgrades in the airport at Sharm el-Sheikh, from where Metrojet Flight 9268 took off.</p> <p>\u201cEgypt is already under the spotlight, so when we have this, people start to wonder is it safe to go there,\u201d said Gold. \u201cTourism is always related to aviation; when you travel you use aeroplanes.\u201d</p> <p>The Metrojet tragedy prompted Britain and Russia to halt flights to the Sinai peninsula over security concerns. Because both countries are at the heart of the tourism trade centred on Sharm el-Sheikh, the decision virtually wiped out the industry overnight. \u201cIt cannot get worse than this. Already as an industry we lost 80% of our income. Definitely we are suffering,\u201d said Ramy Yousry, owner of a dive centre in the resort, adding that only one in five hotel rooms were full now.</p> <p>With unemployment rates in Egypt already high, particularly among the young, each disaster sows the seeds of future tragedy. They force families apart as those who can travel head off in search of work, and those who cannot are left without jobs or purpose, and so perhaps are vulnerable to radicalisation.</p> <p>In a sleepy village by the Nile delta, one mother mourning her son and granddaughter who were <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/21/egyptair-flight-ms804-smoke-detected-in-minutes-before-crash\">killed in Thursday\u2019s plane crash</a> was also weeping for her daughter-in-law, who the family only recently found out is pregnant with another child that they fear might never know Egypt. Haitham Dedad had left for France to support his parents and met and married a Moroccan woman there, who speaks a different dialect of Arabic, and has no ties to his home village. Their surviving daughter and unborn child will be French citizens.</p> <p>\u201cWe can\u2019t expect them to live in Egypt,\u201d said Hassan Dedad, a cousin of the dead passenger. \u201cWe just wish they would allow his parents to visit their grandchildren in Paris.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong> <br /></strong></p> <p>The stock of British politicians can rarely have been lower on Green Lanes, the historical heart of Britain\u2019s Turkish community. \u201cIt\u2019s quite racist to be honest,\u201d said Ebru Ozcan, referring to the Vote Leave campaign\u2019s strategy of attempting to portray her compatriots as inherently disposed to criminality and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/live/2016/may/20/eu-referendum-economy-increasingly-important-in-decision-poll-suggests-politics-live\">desperate to flock</a> to Britain. \u201cThe way they talk has gone too far,\u201d added the 32-year-old, who runs the popular Ozcan jewellers on the bustling artery in Haringey, north London.</p> <p>\u201cIf you can lie, then you become a politician. Why are they making us out to be such a threat?\u201d said Huseyin Babir, 25, who works at Safir jewellers, and whose family moved from central Turkey to Palmers Green, north London, when he was aged one.</p> <p>Justice secretary Michael <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/20/eu-immigrant-influx-michael-gove-nhs-unsustainable\">Gove\u2019s claim</a> that 5 million migrants, many of them Turkish, could come to Britain if the public votes to stay in the European Union was treated with either disbelief or contempt. \u201cThat will never happen, we have family who live in Turkey and we always have to visit them, instead of them coming here, because they like it there and also the cost is prohibitive,\u201d said Dilek Oksuz, 24, who works at Turkish travel agent Right Holidays.</p> <p>The manager at the nearby Gold Bar jewellers was aghast at the suggestion that large swaths of the Turkish population would come to the UK. \u201cThe Turkish don\u2019t even want to come here. Turkey itself is a better country, a safer country \u2013 the police have things much more under control there.\u201d</p> <p>He said that the claim that crime was higher in Turkey than the UK was preposterous and that, given the opporunity, he would move there immediately. \u201cYou are more likely to get mugged here than Turkey, it\u2019s as simple as that. If I didn\u2019t have responsibilities, then I would head out there straightaway.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"02b230449f750df147b3f85fa7ce060bae0b325a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/02b230449f750df147b3f85fa7ce060bae0b325a/0_0_3602_1801/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Vote Leave\u2019s campaign poster, saying Turkey (population 76 million) is joining the EU.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Vote Leave\u2019s campaign poster.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The attempt by the Vote Leave strategists to associate the Turkish people with criminality was scoffed at, with many believing that Brexit campaigners were deliberately trying to conflate media images of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/14/turkey-ankara-attack-one-bombers-was-pkk-member-officials-say\">battles between</a> Turkish military and the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party, or PKK, and the threat of Islamic State (Isis) attacks to portray its people as dangerous.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not even Turkish people doing crime, it is terrorists entering the country,\u201d said Babir. Others said that they felt much safer in Turkey than in London. \u201cTurkey is very safe; of course, you see the news and the fighting but that is confined. Turkish people like to go back and visit because it is so safe,\u201d said Sevda Kadir, 29, who works selling olives at the Dostlar supermarket but also admitted that her hometown village, near the eastern city of Bing\u00f6l, was sometimes too dangerous to visit because of fighting between the PKK and the military.</p> <p>\u201cI do wish they [British politicians] would be more careful how they talk. The fact is that we are very hard-working, but they talk like we don\u2019t work. The Turkish people here work very hard to build up their businesses,\u201d added Kadir.</p> <p>It was a common refrain along Green Lanes on a typically busy Saturday morning. \u201cWe pay among the highest taxes, higher than anyone I think,\u201d said Babir, who said business rates for his shop were between \u00a37,000 and \u00a310,000 a year. At Ozcan jewellery, claims that Turkish people were prone to criminality prompted anger. \u201cWe work very hard, full time, and pay high taxes and rates, and that should be recognised.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/21/vote-leave-prejudice-turkey-eu-security-threat\">Vote Leave embroiled in race row over Turkey security threat claims</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Away from Green Lanes, others warned that the Vote Leave\u2019s anti-Turkish tactics would alienate a country that needed more meaningful engagement with Europe when dealing with issues such as the refugee crisis. \u201cThe fear is that a Muslim-majority country of 76 million will come to Europe and Britain should save itself from that \u2018contamination\u2019. This rhetoric and a Brexit would isolate Turkey even more,\u201d said Ezgi Basaran, a leading Turkish journalist and an academic visitor at St Antony\u2019s College, Oxford University. \u201cWe are all in the same boat when dealing with the quagmire in the Middle East that has already spilled into Turkey.\u201d</p> <p>Basaran added: \u201cWhat the latest refugee crisis shows is very clear: if people find themselves under authoritarian regimes and destitute, no border barrier is good enough to keep them where they are. No wall is tall enough; no crossing is wide enough to keep them away. The fear of \u201876 million Turks at the gate\u2019 would come true if the EU and the rest of the world do not engage with Turkey and the region in a meaningful way.\u201d</p>",

The move comes as conservative and liberal legislators in states across the nation battle over where they believe their constituents <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/18/transgender-bathroom-bill-texas-north-carolina-obama\">have a right to pee</a>. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/18/transgender-bathroom-bill-texas-north-carolina-obama\">Texas poised to be the next bathroom battleground in transgender fight</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The measure was announced ahead of the Ivy League school\u2019s 315th commencement, and included <a href=\"http://lgbtq.yale.edu/restrooms\">an interactive map</a> of where to find 332 gender neutral bathrooms across the campus in New Haven, Connecticut.</p> <p>\u201cYale aims to be a leader on this front,\u201d Tamar Gendler, dean of Yale\u2019s faculty of arts and sciences, told the Associated Press. \u201cPart of what is important about the all-gender bathroom project, and about putting it at the top of our commencement site, is this is about public signaling.\u201d</p> <p>The university has also shifted to using students\u2019 preferred pronouns, covering gender reassignment costs under the student health plan and allowing students to change names on identification cards, according to the AP. </p> <p>As of 2015, around 150 colleges and universities across the country had incorporated gender-neutral bathrooms into school policy, according to a \u201c<a href=\"http://comptroller.nyc.gov/newsroom/comptroller-stringer-proposes-legislation-to-expand-protections-for-transgender-and-gender-non-conforming-communities/\">Restrooms for All</a>\u201d policy paper from New York City comptroller Scott Stringer.</p> <p>In New York, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/29/gender-bathrooms-cooper-union-college-new-york\">Cooper Union</a> was lauded after student activists removed gender designations from bathroom signs. The university chose never to reinstall them. </p> <p>Such changes come as a pitched fight over bathroom rights rages from New York to California, echoing efforts to halt same-sex marriage that ended a year ago in June when US supreme court justices <a href=\"http://www.scotusblog.com/2015/06/in-historic-decision-court-strikes-down-state-bans-on-same-sex-marriage-in-plain-english/\">legalized such unions nationwide</a>.</p> <p>According to the <a href=\"http://www.transequality.org/action-center\">National Center for Transgender Equality</a>, conservative legislators in 21 states have proposed \u201canti-trans state bills\u201d, many of which limit access to bathrooms based on sex. Most have gone nowhere.</p> <p>North Carolina and Mississippi are notable exceptions. North Carolina\u2019s Republican governor, Pat McCrory, signed a first-in-the-nation bill that forces public schools to segregate bathrooms by gender. </p> <p>The law\u2019s swift passage was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/news-blog/2016/apr/25/anti-lgbt-law-sparks-protests-in-north-carolina-with-dozens-arrested\">met with outrage</a>, leading companies to pull out of the state or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/19/north-carolina-anti-lgbt-law-bathroom-bill-hb2-economic-losses\">cancel plans to expand</a> there, and leading musicians to cancel concerts. </p> <p>As the US justice department launched a lawsuit against the state, the state initiated a suit of its own, accusing the federal government of \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/09/lgbt-bathroom-bill-north-carolina-justice-department\">overreach</a>\u201d.</p> <p>In Mississippi, legislators passed a \u201c<a href=\"http://billstatus.ls.state.ms.us/documents/2016/pdf/HB/1500-1599/HB1523PS.pdf\">protecting freedom of conscience</a> from government discrimination act\u201d, which opponents argue <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/31/mississippi-religious-freedom-bill-lgbt-discrimination-same-sex-marriage\">legalizes discrimination</a> by businesses toward the LGBT community. The Mississippi act also defines marriage as between a man and woman. </p> <p>Even in liberal states such as New York, legislators have introduced measures requiring people to use bathrooms based on their \u201cbiological sex\u201d at birth. On 12 May, a Republican legislator from Suffolk County, Long Island, <a href=\"http://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?default_fld=%0D%0A&amp;leg_video=&amp;bn=A10127&amp;term=2015&amp;Summary=Y&amp;Actions=Y&amp;Text=Y\">Dean Murray,</a> introduced such legislation. It is not likely to make it into law.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/21/texas-republican-party-gay-grammar-wording\">Texas Republican party inadvertently suggests most Texans are gay</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Gender-neutral bathroom policies were in effect as early as 2006, when <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://ohr.dc.gov/page/safe-bathrooms-dc\">Washington DC</a> required public restrooms that are so-called single-occupancy, or one large room with a lock, to be gender neutral. Since then, cities such as Austin, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/LGBT-Gender-Neutral-Restrooms-206932591.html\">Philadelphia</a> and New York have enacted similar legislation. </p> <p>This week, New York City required landlords and business owners to refer to people by their <a href=\"http://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2016/05/19/nyc-gender-neutral-pronouns.html\">preferred pronoun</a>, including \u201cze\u201d. </p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.kansascity.com/entertainment/arts-culture/article73858067.html\">Kansas City artist\u2019s</a> bathroom signs, meanwhile, have gone viral, showing a classic stick figure in half-skirt, half-pants, above the words \u201cWe don\u2019t care\u201d.</p> <p>Schools in the small Ohio city of Troy marked the first full year of gender-neutral bathrooms on Friday, a decision that, according to <a href=\"http://wdtn.com/2016/05/20/troy-city-schools-model-for-gender-neutral-bathrooms/\">local news station WDTN</a>, initially brought condemnation from parents and people who didn\u2019t even live in Ohio. Now, the district fields calls from other schools in the Buckeye state looking to do the same.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone has rights and everyone needs to feel safe and protected, and that\u2019s what we do as a public school,\u201d Eric Herman, Troy schools superintendent, <a href=\"http://wdtn.com/2016/05/20/troy-city-schools-model-for-gender-neutral-bathrooms/\">told the TV station</a>.</p>",

      "body": "<h2>OLYMPIAN COMEBACK ...</h2> <p>A welcome return for a truly great runner when Tirunesh Dibaba makes her comeback in the 10km of the Great Manchester Run (on Sunday, 11am, BBC2). The Ethiopian, who is a three-time Olympic champion and the current world and Olympic 10,000m champion \u2013 having won back-to-back <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/04/london-2012-tirunesh-dibaba\" title=\"\">10,000m titles at London 2012</a> \u2013 took the 2015 season off to give birth to her son in March of that year. The race is part of her buildup to defend her title for a third time in Rio de Janeiro, a feat no other athlete has achieved. Dibaba is undefeated in her 11 races over 10,000m. Competition comes in the form of two-times marathon world champion Edna Kiplagat and Britain\u2019s Gemma Steel who was runner-up in last year\u2019s Great North Run.</p> <h2>EUROPEAN GYMNASTICS ...</h2> <p>Britain\u2019s men will look to put in a strong performance in their preparations for the Olympics as they head to the European Championships (Saturday, 1.30pm, BBC1). The team won the title for the first time in 2012, the same year they took bronze at the Olympics, and went on to take silver at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/oct/29/great-britain-men-silver-gymnastics-world-championships\" title=\"\">the world championships in 2015</a>. But they go to Bern without pommel horse world champion, Max Whitlock, who has had to withdraw from the team because of a viral illness. He is replaced by Courtney Tulloch. Reigning champions Russia present the most serious competition and this should be a fine way for Team GB to judge form before Rio.</p> <h2>1966 AND ALL THAT ...</h2> <p>Fifty years on and it remains the high point of England\u2019s football achievements, but just how was it done? David Jason sets about explaining in<em> Alfie\u2019s Boys</em> (on Sunday, 8pm, BBC2). Looking back at the 60s, he examines how Sir Alf Ramsey put together his side and how they bonded. The documentary includes previously unseen footage and an outstanding list of contributors, including Sir Bobby Charlton, Jack Charlton, Jimmy Greaves, George Cohen, Tina Moore, Harry Redknapp, Terry Venables, Sir Geoff Hurst and Gordon Banks. With no guarantees it can ever be done again, it is surely no guilty pleasure to revel in their finest moments.</p> <h2>SQUASH FINALS ...</h2> <p>Britain\u2019s Laura Massaro has reached the squash season\u2019s climax at the PSA Dubai World Series finals (begins Tuesday, live Saturday, 4pm, BT Sport 2,). It is the biggest tournament of the year with the top eight men and women going head to head for the title. The 32-year-old has had a fine campaign this year, winning two world series titles, and is in with a good shout of another. In the men\u2019s event, Britain\u2019s former world No1 Nick Matthew returns from injury.</p> <h2>DIAMOND DAYS ...</h2> <p>More athletics as Rio looms, with a double dose of the Diamond League. The third round, in Rabat, Morocco, is on Sunday (5pm, Eurosport), and the main event is Olympic champion <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/aug/24/shelly-ann-fraser-pryce-wins-world-100m-gold\" title=\"\">Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce</a> competing in the 100m \u2013 where she will be looking to shine before the Games. African record-holder Blessing Okagbare races against her. On Saturday (9pm, Eurosport 2), the fourth meeting takes place in Eugene, USA, where British focus will be on long-jumper Shara Proctor. She became the first Briton to jump seven metres at the world championships, where she won silver, and will be up against her main rival, the US\u2019s Tianna Bartoletta, who beat her to the gold.</p>",

      "body": "<p>If this was his last match as Manchester United manager, Louis van Gaal at least went out on a note of triumph. He arrived for his post-match press conference with the FA Cup, planting the trophy on the table in front of him, and when the questions were done he lifted it on two separate occasions as he made his way to the door. \u201cThank you for the congratulations,\u201d he repeated twice, glowering at the people he described, with no great affection, as his \u201cfriends in the media\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/21/jose-mourinho-to-be-appointed-manchester-united-manager-next-week\">Jos\u00e9 Mourinho set to be appointed Manchester United manager next week</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By that stage the news had already been leaked that Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, Van Gaal\u2019s old friend and colleague, should be installed in the coming days and, amid all the celebrations on the pitch a short while earlier, it was certainly noticeable that United\u2019s supporters reacted differently when the Dutchman was shown on the giant screens. There were even some isolated boos when it was his turn to lift the trophy and the cheer was nothing like as loud as that moment when Sir Alex Ferguson appeared, pointed at himself and clenched a fist, with that familiar rubicund smile.</p> <p>United\u2019s supporters must pine for those happy old days but at least the club have won their first major trophy since Ferguson announced his retirement three years ago. It has taken longer than the club might have anticipated but finally, after all the disappointments of the Van Gaal era, the accusations of blandness and the permanent suspicion that a once-mighty club have been dramatically under-achieving, they have remembered what it is like to win a trophy and the joys it can bring.</p> <p>They also had to do it in the manner of the old United \u2013 or, at least, with some of the old capacity for worrying their supporters \u2013 given that Jason Puncheon had given Crystal Palace a 78th-minute lead and Chris Smalling was sent off for his second bookable offence after Juan Mata\u2019s equaliser had taken the game into extra time.</p> <p>The winner came in the 111th minute courtesy of Jesse Lingard\u2019s equivalent of Lee Martin\u2019s famous goal when these sides met at the old Wembley 26 years earlier and Alan Pardew might come to regret his touchline dance when Puncheon volleyed past David de Gea and Palace\u2019s manager showed the moves of a tipsy uncle at a wedding. Pardew looked like he had been spent the morning practising in the mirror but Palace were ahead for only two minutes and United showed great competitive courage after Smalling\u2019s dismissal late in the first period of extra-time.</p> <p>Lingard might never have struck a shot with more power and precision and, on the balance of play, it was difficult to argue it was undeserved. United had struck the post twice in the second half and Marcus Rashford\u2019s speed, directness and high confidence made him a frequent danger until he was forced off with a second-half injury that might threaten his involvement in England\u2019s pre-Euro 2016 plans. Wayne Rooney was prominently involved in his new midfield position and Marouane Fellaini, often the player United\u2019s supporters like the least, justified his selection after three games out with suspension.</p> <p>More than anything, United showed great competitive courage after the jolt of going behind and, though the occasion will probably be remembered for Lingard\u2019s winner, perhaps the most impressive part was the way they absolutely refused to accept defeat. Rooney, showing all his leadership qualities, eluded three challenges on the run that led to Mata\u2019s equaliser. His cross was expertly turned across the six-yard area and Mata provided the volleyed finish after Fellaini had chested the ball down.</p> <p>Pardew reflected afterwards about the moment in the first half when Rooney chased Wilfried Zaha into the penalty area, missing the ball with his sliding challenge but was given the benefit of the doubt by the referee, Mark Clattenburg. Puncheon\u2019s goal left Palace on the brink of the greatest result in their 110-year history and the glory could still have gone their way if another substitute, Dwight Gayle, had managed to beat De Gea with their best chance of extra-time, with the score at 1-1.</p> <p>What a noise the Palace fans created, rarely letting the volume drop and urging on their team during those difficult moments when Fellaini lashed one shot against a post, Anthony Martial struck the frame of the goal with a header and Pardew\u2019s men struggled to cause too many problems at the other end.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/21/louis-van-gaal-manchester-united-sack\">Louis van Gaal was doomed at Manchester United by refusal to adapt | Amy Lawrence</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It was unusual for United\u2019s supporters to be out-sung so comprehensively but, then again, it was an unusual occasion in many ways. It was difficult to think of another FA Cup final when the winning manager has been condemned so quickly and, if that will be remembered as an embarrassment for United, there was an awkward sub-plot for the Football Association as well, bearing in mind the ridiculous razzmatazz that preceded the game. With the teams waiting to come out, the build-up involved shooting flames, a bemusing cameo from Tinie Tempah and enough nonsense to delay the start by five minutes, all capped off by a singer who was supposed to be taking us through the national anthem missing her cue. Karen Harding later described herself as \u201cmortified\u201d.</p> <p>Thankfully, a game of football did eventually break out and, though it was certainly not a classic, that probably was not a tremendous surprise for anyone who has watched United closely in the Van Gaal era.</p> <p>On this occasion, though, he could legitimately argue that his tactics and substitutions had worked. United have now equalled Arsenal\u2019s record of 12 FA Cup wins and Lingard will never forget the moment when Antonio Valencia\u2019s cross was turned back into his path on the edge of the penalty area. Lingard\u2019s volley was a peach, still rising as it hit the net. \u201cIt was a beautiful goal,\u201d Van Gaal said, and some way for a manager to potentially go out, a trophy in his hands.</p>",

But when the <em>Observer</em> posed as a customer, staff at the website wrote back within a few hours offering a \u201cbulk discount\u201d. The company also boasted that it could bypass the Captcha security system used by sites such as Ticketmaster.</p> <p>Captcha is a way of testing whether someone trying to buy a ticket is a human or a bot, for example by showing the user a gallery of pictures and asking them to place a tick next to all of those that depict, say, trees. But an employee of ticketbots.net said its bots were able to defeat this security protocol by enlisting real people to tick the right boxes. \u201cOur softwares already bypasses these picture Captchas using 3rd party CAPTCHA bypassing companies, who types the Captchas for you,\u201d ticketbots.net wrote in an email.</p> <p>The website also offers a vast array of other tools designed to boost the amount of tickets that touts are able to scoop up.</p> <p>One product description boasts: \u201cIn short, the bot grabs hundreds of tickets for multiple event simultaneously and let you choose cream tickets from them to buy with just a single click.\u201d</p> <p>Ticketbots.net even demonstrates how to use one of its bots in a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fa3Is7D0gSU\">YouTube video that shows how to get multiple tickets</a> for comedian Kevin Hart at Wembley Arena.</p> <p>And the website offers \u201cPDF copiers\u201d, which can be used to copy the unique barcode on a ticket to produce counterfeit copies.</p> <p>According to ticketing expert Reg Walker, fraudsters can even copy the barcode from pictures that fans post on social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter. \u201cDo not post pictures of your tickets on social media,\u201d said Walker. \u201cSomeone will make a copy and when you go to the gig, you won\u2019t be able to get in if they got there first.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/15/shady-world-of-the-ticket-touts\">How the ticket touts get away with bleeding fans dry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>More than \u00a35m was lost to ticket fraud in 2015, up 55% on the previous year, according to figures released this weekend by the Local Government Association.</p> <p>Other products on offer on ticketbots.net include \u201cspinners\u201d, which automatically flip purchased tickets on to secondary websites, where they can be sold at a large mark-up. Buyers can also pay for \u201cdrop checkers\u201d, which automatically monitor ticketing sites for new events and pick up tickets automatically based on the users\u2019 preferences.</p> <p>Walker said that while the use of bots was not that common among UK touts, his ticket security firm, The Iridium Consultancy, had seen an increase in attacks from overseas.</p> <p>Michael Waterson, an economics professor from the University of Warwick, is due to publish his recommendations on measures to improve the ticketing industry at the end of this week.</p>",

The scale of the move varied across the range of pollsters, but the big thing in all polling analysis is to look for the general direction of travel, paying particular attention to the fieldwork dates. The <a href=\"http://whatukthinks.org/eu/opinion-polls/poll-of-polls/\">\u201cpoll of polls\u201d</a> maintained by Professor John Curtice of Strathclyde University now has a 10% average lead for Remain after the undecided have been stripped out of the numbers for each survey.</p> <p>This has been helped by four new phone polls completed since last weekend, all of them with comfortable margins for Remain. The biggest, and the one that has had the most impact, was the margin of 18 points recorded in the <em>London Evening Standard</em>\u2019s Ipsos MORI poll. The <em>Daily</em> <em>Telegraph</em> ORB poll was not far behind on 15 points, the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/16/phone-poll-finds-10-point-lead-for-remain-but-web-survey-puts-leave-ahead-brexit\">Guardian/ICM poll was at 8 points </a>and ComRes for the <em>Mail</em> had 11 points \u2013 the latter being the only one where the gap was narrowing.</p> <p>One of the factors driving the change is that a number of pollsters are finding that more Conservative voters appear to be edging to support David Cameron\u2019s position rather than Boris Johnson\u2019s. Until last week, not many surveys had more Tory voters supporting Remain than Leave.</p> <p>A big question over all referendum polling is that the online polls have been showing a very different picture from those conducted by phone. This was highlighted in the Guardian/ICM poll when a separate test asking the same questions in the same manner online was completed at the same time. Instead of an 8-point Remain lead, the online survey had Leave leading by 4 points.</p> <p>Why this should be so is hard to say. It is argued on behalf of online polling that people feel able to give their true feelings when a live interviewer is not involved. Those supporting phone polls say that internet samples can be distorted because participants are more politically engaged.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/21/tory-eu-referendum-voters-switching-remain-opinium-observer-poll\">Tory EU referendum voters are switching to \u200b\u200bremain, says poll</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The online/phone debate within the polling industry spilled out into a public Twitter spat after Peter Kellner, former president and one of the founders of the internet polling pioneers YouGov, went on record backing phone referendum polls. This drew a sharp response from Kellner\u2019s former colleague and now chief executive of YouGov, Stephan Shakespeare. YouGov also published details of its own split-mode test in support of its contention that phone poll samples include too many graduates \u2013 a segment that is markedly more pro-Remain.</p> <p>However, the gap between the two modes may be narrowing. The latest <em>Observer</em> online survey by Opinium has a Remain lead of 4 points, up from 1 point in late April. It is also the same margin as in last week\u2019s YouGov poll for the <em>Times</em>. Both these online pollsters, it might be noted, got the winning gap for Sadiq Khan in the London mayoral election exactly right.</p> <p>Referendums have a long history of shifting to the status quo the closer it gets to polling day. That happened in the 2011 alternative vote referendum; in the last vote on Britain\u2019s relationship with Europe, in 1975; and in the Scottish independence referendum in September 2014.</p> <p>The propensity of British voters not to support change has been seen, as well, in the 52 referendums in England on whether local authorities should switch to having an elected mayor. Only 16 have resulted in yes outcomes.</p> <p><em>Mike Smithson is a polling analyst and editor of </em><a href=\"http://www.politicalbetting.com/\"><em>PoliticalBetting.com</em></a></p>",

There is no definition of extremism in the bill, however.\u201cThe fact that the government is struggling to define the \u2018extremism\u2019 it wants to ban should be a clear indication that this legislation has no place in a liberal democracy,\u201d adds the statement.</p> <p>The diversity of the coalition assembled indicates the disquiet prompted by the new bill; it includes the Jewish Council for Racial Equality, the British Institute of Human Rights and figures such as the journalist Peter Oborne and <em>Guardian</em> columnist Owen Jones.</p> <p>Dr Shuja Shafi of the Muslim Council of Britain, which incorporates 500 mosques, schools and charities, said: \u201cThe fact that such a diverse range of groups have come together should tell us there are widespread concerns about the proposals in the government\u2019s counter-extremism bill. The terrorists would like nothing better than provoking ill thought-through policies that undermine all our freedoms.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, a new survey reveals that one in three British adults say they agree that Islam promotes violence in the UK. A study conducted by ComRes on behalf of Ahmadiyya Muslim Community UK also found that 56% of Britons disagreed with the view that Islam is compatible with British values.</p> <p>Ibrahim Ikhlaf from the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/apr/23/asad-shah-stabbed-ahmadiyya-muslim-glasgow\">Ahmadiyya Muslim</a> Community UK, said: \u201cThe focus in the media on extremism, and linking any type of violence or crime by Muslims to Islam, has skewed public perception so that they believe Islam condones or encourages violence and extremism. Nothing could be further from the truth.\u201d</p> <p>Tom Mludzinski, director of political polling for ComRes, said the findings revealed the extent of the conflicting perceptions among the British public towards Islam. \u201cWith Britons similarly as likely to agree that Islam promotes acts of violence in the UK as they are to agree that Islam promotes peace in the UK, it is clear that perceptions of Islam are mixed among the general public.\u201d</p>",

They are more likely to gain a first-class degree than UK classmates, less likely to be unemployed, and more likely to be in a graduate job, earn a high salary and go on to postgraduate study.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/testing/2016/06/brexit-companion/embed/embed.html?sheet=intermediate&amp;id=university_students\" data-alt=\"Brexit explained: university students\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/testing/2016/06/brexit-companion/embed/embed.html?sheet=intermediate&id=university_students\">Brexit explained: university students</a> </figure>  <p>As a result, the authors of the report claim, they represent a valuable resource to the UK which would be threatened if the country voted to leave the EU.</p> <p>EU-domiciled students comprise one in 20 undergraduates in the UK, and a further one in 10 postgraduates. Each year in the UK more than 10,000 graduates and postgraduates study science, technology, engineering and maths \u2013 the so-called Stem subjects deemed crucial for British industry.</p> <p>The research, by Dr Renee Luthra and Greta Morando, examined data from the <a href=\"https://www.hesa.ac.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1899\">Destination of Leavers from Higher Education</a>, a survey that follows the paths of more than 2 million leavers from British universities for six months after graduation. They found that EU undergraduates were nearly 50% more likely to obtain a first-class degree.</p> <p>The study found that EU students did better than their British peers graduating from the same universities, with the same marks, in the same year and in the same subjects. They were more than twice as likely to continue to postgraduate courses in the UK than their British friends, and those from the core EU15 countries who went into the workplace were earning on average 9% more than their British peers six months after graduation. They were more likely to get a first-class degree in Stem subjects than British students.</p> <p>\u201cThe EU students at UK universities are clearly the best and the brightest in their class \u2013 on the whole their achievements outstrip their British classmates and they represent a significantly well-qualified group of graduate workers entering the UK workforce,\u201d Luthra said. \u201cThis is especially true of undergraduates, as those EU students who study and remain in the UK to work are very high-performing. These undergraduates will be having a very positive impact on UK industry.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/18/eu-students-how-will-brexit-affect-you-studying-in-the-uk\">EU students: how would Brexit affect you studying in the UK?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The academics claim their analysis highlights how a vote to leave the EU is likely to have an impact on not only higher-education enrolments in the UK, but also the supply of high-performing undergraduates and postgraduates to the British labour market.</p> <p>\u201cAlthough EU students make up only 5% of the undergraduate population studying in UK universities, they are twice as likely to continue on to post-graduate study as their British friends and make up a substantial part of our postgraduate population \u2013 nearly one in eight of all research students are from the EU,\u201d Luthra said. \u201cOf those in postgraduate research degrees, two-thirds are studying Stem subjects of vital importance to the UK economy. The uncertainty surrounding a vote to leave the EU would almost certainly reduce the flow of these high-performing students, particularly in the short-term transition period.\u201d</p> <p>A study o<a href=\"https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/brexit-would-put-international-students-survey-shows\">f 1,763 would-be students who had contacted or applied to UK universities</a>, published last week by international student recruiters Hobsons, found that almost half said Brexit would make the UK a less attractive place to study.</p> <p>Vote Leave\u2019s chief executive, Matthew Elliott, said Brexit would not diminish the attractiveness of the UK\u2019s universities. \u201cThe UK is home to three of the world\u2019s top 10 universities. Countries in the rest of the EU don\u2019t come close. As such, after we vote Leave we would still attract the brightest students from not only the EU, but right across the world.\u201d</p>",

And that\u2019s sport, some days are good, some are bad. It\u2019s amazing. The same opposition and same place and such contrasting emotions.\u201d</p> <p>In a Test dominated by bowlers, it would be England\u2019s wicketkeeper, Jonny Bairstow, who claimed man of the match after his 140 as well as nine catches across the two Sri Lankan implosions.</p> <p>Cook said: \u201cJonny was playing on a different wicket to the other 21 guys, it was an extraordinary innings. I remember the first time I saw him play for Yorkshire at Scarborough [in 2010] and thought he\u2019d play for England. There hasn\u2019t been a better batsman in the country over the past two years.\u201d</p> <p>Sri Lanka, following on, were 77 for two when rain brought an early lunch on the third day, only to fold to 119 all out by 5.15pm after England received a pep talk from their head coach, Trevor Bayliss, a man of few words.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/21/jimmy-anderson-headingley-england-sri-lanka\">Jimmy Anderson snaps his fingers to finally master Headingley | Mike Selvey</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Cook said: \u201cI think he just wanted a bit more limelight and show he was doing some coaching. But no, he said to make sure we are on it from ball one. Sometimes after a break you can drift into a session. We were OK in the morning session but it reminded us to be switched on.\u201d</p> <p>The Sri Lanka captain, Angelo Mathews, said: \u201cIt was a quite an embarrassing defeat. Everything went wrong for us apart from winning the toss. Anderson and Stuart Broad bowled beautifully and we couldn\u2019t handle it. It was swinging and seaming.</p> <p>\u201cWe have a few days to regroup, all we have got to do is change our mindset and believe we can do it. It was a humiliating defeat but if we stick to our plans we can turn it around.\u201d</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-22T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Up the hill he came, the Football Stand to his back, ghosting to the crease as if on well-oiled castors. Jimmy Anderson caresses the ball in his fingertips, creating a bond with it almost, as if it is a part of him. The seam is upright and a change in the pressure from his middle finger and first finger, and a slight shift in the thumb that supports the ball, can dictate whether the ball will deviate to the left or the right.</p> <p>By way of further variation, he might hold the seam in such a way that it will oscillate gently on its way down the pitch, effectively widening the surface area of the stitching so that, on pitching, it might stand more chance of gripping: the famous wobble-ball. In the first innings of this Test match it was just such a delivery that disposed of the Sri Lanka captain, Angelo Mathews, jagging back at him and almost blasting his front pad from his left leg.</p> <p>Sometimes, when the pitch is unforgiving for the bowler and he needs some assistance from an outside agency he will forgo his stock-in-trade orthodox swing, and the French-polisher\u2019s ruby shine, and instead hold the ball across the seam so that the surface will rough it up, the better to help instigate the precious reverse swing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/21/england-sri-lanka-first-test\">Jimmy Anderson leads charge again as England rout Sri Lanka inside three days</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is no time for reverse though. Headingley is blanketed with cloud, the air is moist, dank almost, but not as chilly as it has been. Anderson, although sheltered a little by the Football Stand, has, coming over his left shoulder, the sort of biffing breeze that sets flapping the trouser legs of the waiting predators in the slips and has the flags of St George and Sri Lanka standing out starchily from their poles. Anderson reaches the crease and gathers himself into his action. If his head dips after delivery as his right arm comes down and across his body, in the manner of a regency aristocrat greeting a lady with a sweep of his hat, then the action itself is beautifully aligned and orthodox. His long fingers and elastic wrist provide the energy that, with the last point of release from the tip of his middle finger, imparts the backspin that, gyroscopically almost, ensures that the seam stays upright on its passage down the pitch.</p> <p>At the other end, Kusal Mendis waits. He is 21 years old, in his fourth Test match, and has the considerable task of replacing the little matter of the 12,400 Test runs provided by Kumar Sangakkara. These would be challenging conditions even for that master batsman. In the first innings Mendis faced two balls, the second of which, from Stuart Broad, he edged to Jonny Bairstow. Now he has Anderson to contend with. In the first innings, Anderson had bowled from the same Football Stand end and taken five of the cheapest wickets he has managed in Tests.</p> <p>As far as Headingley is concerned it was a novel experience. Up until then, he had sent down 1,978 deliveries in his first-class career on the ground and, as far as he can recollect, not a single one involved anything but running down the hill from the Kirkstall Lane end. If true, this would be remarkable for a man whose success, on a ground famed for its help to bowlers of his type, was limited to 28 wickets at 39 runs apiece, and a best of four for 97, yet who not once had considered that a change of ends might pay a better dividend. As a result, Anderson has never warmed to the place: reach the gates, he says, and he just wants to turn around and go home. Ten wickets for 45 in this match might change that view.</p> <p>Mendis, diminutive, is ready. He is to play a gutsy innings, his first Test half-century, with some wristy bottom-hand whips and helped on his way by the uncharacteristic benevolence of the England fielders who reprieved him three \u2013 maybe even four \u2013 times.</p> <p>Anderson is already on a roll. He finished off the Sri Lanka first innings with a spell of four wickets for one run and already in the second he has the further wickets of both openers. Mendis is in a good position, alert and balanced, as Anderson releases the ball. He sees it early: do that and play it late is the benchmark of good players.</p> <p>This delivery is coming at him at 85mph, down the line of his middle stump. In a split second, the sharp eyes of youth see the seam, upright and tilted towards Alastair Cook at first slip. If his mind could react in time to that, he would have known it was the away swinger. But he doesn\u2019t. The seam cuts through the air and, as the batsman commits and starts to push forward, the ball suddenly veers off course, impossibly late, before pitching, rising sharply and searing past the groping bat. Mendis hears the ball smack into Bairstow\u2019s gloves. No contact, no run, no wicket. There will be many such before he chops Anderson on to his stumps.</p>",

There was something opportunistic about this success, which came at the expense of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/30/frankie-dettori-2000-guineas-galileo-gold-newmarket-aidan-obrien\" title=\"\">Galileo Gold</a> \u2013 unable to repeat his victory in the English equivalent on a much softer surface and after a modicum of trouble in running.</p> <p>Still, Awtaad won by a convincing margin of two and a half lengths, having charged up the middle of the track with some authority under Chris Hayes, who was landing a Group One for the first time since the Irish Leger of 2013. Some 20 lengths further back, Air Force Blue was as disappointing as he had been in Newmarket three weeks before, beating only one rival.</p> <p>\u201cAwtaad\u2019s always been a good horse from the time we got him,\u201d said Prendergast, who displayed a nice line in understatement in his post-race interviews. Asked where this would rank among the achievements of his 53-year career, he replied: \u201cI\u2019d say it wouldn\u2019t be too bad.\u201d When someone noted that he last won this race 40 years ago, the trainer responded cheerfully: \u201cIt\u2019s a long time. A lot of fellas weren\u2019t born!\u201d</p> <p>But the killer line, in relation to Awtaad, was no understatement: \u201cHe\u2019s as good a horse as I\u2019ve had, anyway, and I\u2019ve had Ardross,\u201d Prendergast said. Ardross, who joined Henry Cecil for his most productive seasons, twice won the Gold Cup at Ascot and was beaten a head in the Arc 34 years ago.</p> <p>Awtaad would not have Ardross-like stamina but may yet be asked to stretch himself out to a mile and a half in next month\u2019s Derby, for which he is already entered. Prendergast said all such decisions would be made by the owner, Sheikh Hamdan \u2013 but, on the face of it, Awtaad is a stronger candidate for mile races such as the St James\u2019s Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot.</p> <p>That would mean a rematch with Galileo Gold whose trainer, Hugo Palmer, said in as many words that he would fancy his horse to turn around this form on a better surface at Ascot. \u201cThis is a proper-ground horse,\u201d he said. \u201cJessie Harrington said to me beforehand: \u2018The ground is heavy. Will your horse go on it?\u2019 I said: \u2018We\u2019ll find out.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cWe found out. Frankie [Dettori] said he hated every yard of it. Every yard. The winner had first run but, on quicker ground, he would have picked him up.\u201d</p> <p>This was an unusually poor Irish Guineas for Aidan O\u2019Brien, who trained four of the eight runners and failed to get one in the first three. Air Force Blue would not have liked this ground but there must also be a suspicion that he has not trained on since his fine juvenile season. The way he pulled through the early stages here suggests he may now be returned to sprint distances.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/15/derby-aidan-obrien-the-gurkha-ryan-moore-deauville-2000-guineas-michael-stoute-ulysses-horse-racing\">Derby beckons after Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s The Gurkha puts rivals to the sword</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Perhaps surprisingly, that would have consequences for betting on the Derby. O\u2019Brien said here that if Air Force Blue ceased to be a miler, he would run The Gurkha in top-class mile races in his place, starting at Royal Ascot. That would take The Gurkha out of the Epsom race, for which he has been 9-2 favourite. His trainer has many other Derby options, led by US Army Ranger.</p> <p>Ireland\u2019s jump-racing champions were on winning form in France, where Willie Mullins trained a big-race double with Footpad and Un De Sceaux, both partnered by Ruby Walsh. Un De Sceaux bolted up by eight lengths in Auteuil\u2019s Prix La Barka, running over hurdles for the first time in two years.</p> <p>Second to Sprinter Sacre on his last two starts, at Cheltenham and Sandown this spring, Un De Sceaux hacked along happily in the front on this occasion and pulled effortlessly clear in the straight, with British-trained runners such as Ptit Zig, Aubusson and Al Ferof fading out of the places behind him.</p> <p>Representing his father, Patrick Mullins said the extra half-mile had helped Un De Sceaux, though he questioned whether the horse would be asked to go another half-mile in the French Champion Hurdle this summer. \u201cI\u2019d say softer ground and a step up in trip suited him. Two miles on soft ground, he\u2019s just not as quick as Sprinter Sacre. Now that\u2019s he settling better, we can probably step him up in trip and it opens more options for next year.\u201d</p> <p>The feature race in England ended in controversy when the well-backed and popular Mecca\u2019s Angel was beaten a neck in Haydock\u2019s Temple Stakes by Profitable, who leaned on her throughout the closing stages, carrying her from mid-track to the far rail.</p> <p>In mitigation, the winning distance was a neck and Profitable\u2019s jockey, Adam Kirby, made clear efforts to straighten him up, switching his whip hand in the closing stages.</p> <p>\u201cShe was nearly forced through the rail,\u201d complained Michael Dods, the trainer of Mecca\u2019s Angel. \u201cPaul [Mulrennan] had to snatch up a bit. If she\u2019d been beaten a head rather than a neck, we might have got it.\u201d</p> <p>The stewards ruled that the outcome had not been affected but gave Kirby a two-day ban for careless riding. The two horses may meet again in the King\u2019s Stand at Royal Ascot, though Mecca\u2019s Angel would need some cut in the ground in order to take her chance.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Here at the Cannes film festival, the organisers like to get the day under way with some animal antics aboard the main stage. With the delegates still finding their seats for the 8.30am screening, a sniffer dog named Strafus inhales the scent of the curtain that conceals the big screen. On the assumption that if the creature likes what it smells it will go about its job quietly and create an unholy ruckus if it doesn\u2019t, you might say that at Cannes, even the dogs are film critics.</p> <p>Anyway, I\u2019m taking the absence of barking as proof that this, the 69th festival, has been an especially good vintage. Outside the Palais the weather has been balmy. Inside, at times, it has felt positively fevered as visitors barely have the chance to proclaim one film a masterpiece before, hey presto, they\u2019re shuttled straight into the next. This, some are excitably saying, has been the best lineup in years; maybe (whisper, don\u2019t jinx it) the best in living memory. Everybody has been drinking the same addictive Kool-Aid. They\u2019re wandering the Palais with wide, dopey grins. Indirectly, I suspect, we have <em>Toni Erdmann</em> to thank.</p> <p>When <em>Toni Erdmann</em> played on the opening weekend it sent the place into raptures. Written and directed by Maren Ade, the film is that reputed oxymoron, a German comedy, except that this time the joke is on us because <em>Toni Erdmann</em>\u2019s a hoot. Sandra H\u00fcller is Ines, a brittle, Bucharest-based management consultant whose sterile existence is sent into a spin by her puckish, burly dad (Peter Simonischek), who rocks up in a wig and Ken Dodd-ish false teeth, variously claiming to be the German ambassador or <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/profile/ion-tiriac/\" title=\"\">Ion Tiriac</a>\u2019s tennis partner. True, Ade\u2019s high-concept conceit is not dissimilar from a Hollywood TV caper (zany father teaches kid to laugh again). But <em>Toni Erdmann</em> possesses a disreputable charm that is constantly surprising and finally deeply moving. It established a giddy, buoyant air that Cannes has been riding ever since.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d6a507cd06affc473305429a84be9447f619f745\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d6a507cd06affc473305429a84be9447f619f745/0_55_3971_2383/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Adam Driver, who plays a bus-driving poet in Jim Jarmusch\u2019s Paterson.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Adam Driver, who plays a bus-driving poet in Jim Jarmusch\u2019s Paterson.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Loic Venance/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That said, forced to choose between two dad-daughter classics in this year\u2019s competition, I\u2019m still leaning towards Cristian Mungiu\u2019s <em>Graduation</em>. The Romanian film-maker won the 2007 Palme d\u2019Or with his superb <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2008/jan/13/periodandhistorical\" title=\"\"><em>4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days</em></a> and yet this urgent morality tale may just be its equal. It\u2019s about a flawed, decent doctor (Adrian Titieni) who pulls all manner of strings to ensure his anguished teenage daughter (Maria Dragus) secures a scholarship to London. Along the way, Mungiu gently pulls back the drapes to reveal a body politic that is rotten to the core; a place where pedestrians turn a nervous blind eye to a sexual assault and where any rule can be broken so long as it provides a way out. \u201cWhen you\u2019re in Kensington Gardens with all the squirrels chasing you, this world will feel so far away,\u201d the doctor promises at one point. He makes dirty old London sound like Shangri-la.</p> <p>While Mungiu probably won\u2019t win the top prize this year, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/andrea-arnold\" title=\"\">Andrea Arnold</a> just might. The British director\u2019s latest work, <em>American Honey</em>, is a gorgeously wanton and poetic affair; a film that runs wild with a band of youthful itinerants as they freewheel towards the sunset, selling magazines door to door. Some have lamented its woozy longueurs, its lack of narrative drive or clear-cut resolution, although this seems to me to be missing the point. Not every movie that wanders is lost \u2013 and <em>American Honey</em> knows exactly what it\u2019s doing.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s Only the End of the World has so many close-ups that the actors resemble drooping orchids inside a hothouse</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cI fucking loved it,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/kristen-stewart\" title=\"\">Kristen Stewart</a> tells me when we meet under the flapping canvas of a windblown beach bar. \u201cI don\u2019t care that it\u2019s transient. Transience is what it\u2019s about.\u201d</p> <p>Most celebrities bounce in and out of Cannes like Peter Pan on a wire. Stewart, by contrast, has been marooned here the whole time. She came for <em>Caf\u00e9 Society</em>, which opened the event, and has been forced to stick around for the unveiling of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/olivier-assayas\" title=\"\">Olivier Assayas</a>\u2019s <em>Personal Shopper</em>, a ghost story of sorts in which she gives a sterling performance as the gaunt, flailing heroine, desperate to make contact with her dead twin brother. <em>Personal Shopper</em>, sad to say, found itself roundly booed at its evening press show, although I rather liked its off-beam, skittish nature, its marriage of stock genre thrills with lugubrious human drama.</p> <p>Besides, Cannes needs such audience flash points, if only to prevent the event becoming too cosily consensual. It hungers for films such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/jul/13/nicolas-winding-refn-god-forgives\" title=\"\">Nicolas Winding Refn</a>\u2019s brilliant <em>The Neon Demon</em>, an outrageous sugar-frosted nightmare of LA, which had some viewers swooning and others howling at the screen. Perhaps it even needs <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/xavier-dolan\" title=\"\">Xavier Dolan</a>\u2019s <em>It\u2019s Only the End of the World</em>, a screeching family melodrama that comes framed in so many oppressive close-ups that the actors (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/marion-cotillard\" title=\"\">Marion Cotillard</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/oct/11/lea-seydoux-interview-james-bond-spectre-blue-is-the-warmest-colour\" title=\"\">L\u00e9a Seydoux</a>) start to resemble drooping, rotting orchids inside a hothouse. After about 20 minutes of this I wanted to kick out a window to let some air in, but even Dolan\u2019s folly boasts a band of ardent defenders. The dog didn\u2019t bark, so I\u2019m guessing the dog liked it too.</p> <p>As the lights go down for an evening screening, a disembodied voice in the cinema will shout out \u201cRaoul!\u201d \u2013 and this cry is answered in turn by a ripple of laughter and applause. This happens each night, almost without fail, and apparently dates back to some notorious bygone incident when a delegate showed up late and started blundering through the darkened aisles, screaming for his friend. In the intervening years (decades?) the cry has been enshrined as a part of Cannes tradition, a jubilant whoop to launch the nightly festivities. Unless, of course, it\u2019s the same idiot delegate, forever blundering in late and screaming for Raoul. In which case it\u2019s really annoying. Something ought to be done.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1584efd0e669429b309ec66eb93022a0d1e45e35\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1584efd0e669429b309ec66eb93022a0d1e45e35/0_337_7360_4417/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elle Fanning, left, and Bella Heathcote on the set of Nicolas Winding Refn\u2019s The Neon Demon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elle Fanning, left, and Bella Heathcote on the set of Nicolas Winding Refn\u2019s The Neon Demon.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I\u2019d dearly love to cite <em>Paterson</em> as another of those polarising Cannes productions \u2013 but that would be a stretch, given that I\u2019m one of the rare few who wasn\u2019t completely bowled over. <em>Paterson</em> (alongside <em>Toni Erdmann</em>) remains the best received film from this year\u2019s competition, adored for its goofy asides and quiet epiphanies. And, yes, undeniably there is much to enjoy in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/22/jim-jarmusch-only-lovers-left-alive\" title=\"\">Jim Jarmusch</a>\u2019s ode to a bus-driving poet (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/29/adam-driver-lots-things-said-about-face-interview\" title=\"\">Adam Driver</a>), who writes perfectly clean copy inside his secret notebook; it\u2019s just that the whole thing felt a little bogus to me. <em>Paterson</em> amounts to a piece of shrink-wrapped existentialism. It\u2019s too neat and tidy; comfortable and complacent. Jarmusch\u2019s recipe for artistic fulfilment? A modest outlook, a regular daily routine and a beautiful, doting wife who is presented as simple to the point of outright imbecility.</p> <p>Line them up and roll them out. Hundreds of pictures screen during the 10 days of Cannes. They come rushing past our ears in an ongoing stampede. It\u2019s an impossible task to keep track of each and every one; it\u2019s hard enough remembering some of those we\u2019ve already seen. I had high hopes for the Dardenne brothers\u2019 <em>The Unknown Girl</em> but it\u2019s a minor work from the two-time Cannes winners, a kind of holistic murder mystery starring Ad\u00e8le Haenel as a sleuthing small-town GP. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/pedroalmodovar\" title=\"\">Pedro Almod\u00f3var</a> was regarded as an early Palme d\u2019Or favourite for his <em>Julieta</em>, adapted from a dazzling series of Alice Munro stories, although I came away with the sense that the finished film (stirring though it is) doesn\u2019t gel. Where Munro\u2019s material relies on elegant understatement, Almod\u00f3var favours bold gestures, bright colours, everything writ large. He seizes hold of a tragedy and manhandles it into melodrama.</p> <p>And then, look, here\u2019s Jim Jarmusch back again. He\u2019s playing in the midnight screening slot with <em>Gimme Danger</em>, a documentary about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/iggy-pop\" title=\"\">Iggy Pop</a> and the Stooges, who provided a brutish alternative to flower power. The film itself is intoxicating; a splash of hard liquor inside a filthy shot glass. I relished it a lot more than I did <em>Paterson</em>.</p> <p>Worst in Cannes show? That would have to be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/seanpenn\" title=\"\">Sean Penn</a>\u2019s preening Liberia-set aid drama <em>The Last Face</em>, which turned its imperilled African characters into tacky set dressing and had the audience guffawing right from the start. Still, it could be argued that the very best lineup depends on the odd imperfection; an unseemly blot to make us appreciate the beauty elsewhere. If so, even Penn merits a berth at this year\u2019s Cannes film festival.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d1ae0c37290f20824fa36956b260cc816e2da4ed\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d1ae0c37290f20824fa36956b260cc816e2da4ed/45_21_2814_4114/684.jpg\" alt=\"Kristen Stewart at the Personal Shopper premiere.\" width=\"684\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kristen Stewart at the Personal Shopper premiere.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Fisher/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Outside the Palais the street is lined with thrill seekers, photographers and black festival cars. A newspaper vendor cries \u201cLiberacion\u201d beside the red carpet. I\u2019ve grown fond of him\u2013 a rumpled, whippy man with an astonishing foghorn delivery, bellowing seemingly from dawn until dusk.</p> <p>Liberation sounds good; it turns more enticing by the day. By this stage of the festival, many of the guests appear ready to drop. Over the past week and a half they have gorged themselves on too many good films, broiled themselves witless in too many queues and talked themselves hoarse in too many post-screening discussions. And now, at last, they are being set free. The Cannes market has been swaddled in bubble wrap, its waste bins emptied. The vast spate of screenings has slowed to a trickle.</p> <p>On the walk back from the Palais, I notice a phalanx of delegates already heading out, liberated by the shuttle-bus that runs across to Nice airport. Their cases are doubtless packed with sweaty, wine-stained clothes and clogged, tattered notepads. But their heads ring with tales of rule-breaking fathers, haunted personal shoppers, rowdy American youth. The escapees sit behind the smeared glass as the bus takes them off, each cradling cherished souvenirs from their 10 days by the sea. Cannes, like Hemingway\u2019s Paris, is a movable feast. They carry it with them back into the world.</p>",

The county claim there have been no complaints to the club from its members, however, either this weekend or at the start of the year, and the deal remains in place.</p> <p>\u201cI was disappointed to read the article,\u201d Guy Lavender, the Somerset chief executive, told the Observer. \u201cBut as I\u2019ve said before, we found him to be fantastic the last time he was here, in terms of activities both on and off the pitch. It\u2019s a shame, because it detracts from his cricketing ability. The fact is, what he has said is inappropriate. But we haven\u2019t had an opportunity to discuss [it] with him. I\u2019m sure we will. But I don\u2019t see it as grounds not to have him playing for us this summer.\u201d</p> <p>Asked if player conduct was taken seriously at the club, Lavender replied: \u201cVery much so, it\u2019s a key part of what we do. Players are ambassadors of the club. We have a track record of mavericks \u2013 Ian Botham and Viv Richards are examples \u2013 but we take conduct seriously. I\u2019m sure we will have a sensible conversation with Chris when he arrives in the country.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>In a final-day match-up that many aficionados believe could be played out often in years to come, Austria\u2019s Dominic Thiem survived a dogged early challenge from fellow rising star Alexander Zverev to retain his Nice Open title.</p> <p>The 15th-ranked Thiem, top seed at the ATP 250 event, won 6-4, 3-6, 6-0 in one hour and 39 minutes to claim a place alongside former French Open champions Bjorn Borg and Ilie Nastase as a double winner on the French Riviera. Whether the 22-year-old can go on to emulate the feats of those illustrious forebears at Roland Garros is a moot point, but claiming the fifth title of his fledgling career \u2013 and fourth on clay \u2013 should ensure he heads north to Paris, where he is the 13th seed, with no shortage of confidence. Few will relish the prospect of facing him, not even the nine-time champion Rafael Nadal, whom he could play in the fourth round.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/21/andy-murray-amelie-mauresmo-on-court-behaviour-split\">Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo: Andy Murray\u2019s on-court behaviour played part in split</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Zverev, the 19-year-old German for whom this was a first final on the ATP Tour, could have a big say in whether that encounter comes to fruition, just as he initially had a shaping influence here. The two men will resume hostilities at Roland Garros should they both progress to round three and, despite suffering a final-set whitewash, Zverev showed enough early on to suggest that a successful tilt at revenge is well within his capabilities.</p> <p>The gods have not always smiled on the 48th-ranked teenager at key moments this year. In March, Zverev played virtually flawless tennis to reach match point against Nadal in Indian Wells, only to fluff a simple forehand volley with the Spaniard at his mercy. This time his momentum was arrested through no fault of his own, a nosebleed forcing him to take a medical timeout after he had broken to take a 4-2 lead in the opening set. When play resumed, Zverev surrendered the advantage with a double fault, throwing Thiem a lifeline that the Austrian gleefully accepted with a run of six straight games that left him a set and a break to the good.</p> <p>Yet, as he showed in saving two match points against Gilles Simon in the quarter-finals, Zverev is not one to capitulate in testing circumstances. Capitalising on a shoulder injury that forced Thiem to call for the trainer, the teenager broke back immediately and won six of the next seven games to force a third set. There, though, he was comprehensively outplayed, failing to win a point on his opponent\u2019s first serve and claiming just three behind his own delivery.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Stanislas Wawrinka, the reigning French Open champion, completed his preparations for Roland Garros with a straight sets victory over Marin Cilic, the former US Open champion, in the Geneva Open final. The top-seeded Wawrinka came through a tight second set to win 6-3, 7-6 (13-11) and claim the first title of his career on home soil. </p>",

National Rifle Association members cheered him on Friday after their leaders endorsed his candidacy. \u201cI will not let you down,\u201d Trump told them.</p> <p>His likely Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, has promised the opposite: she will take on America\u2019s gun lobby from her \u201cvery first day\u201d in office. One of her advisers <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-05-20/hillary-clinton-believes-pivotal-gun-rights-ruling-was-wrong-adviser-says\">announced</a> on Friday that she believed a landmark 2008 supreme court decision protecting gun rights had been \u201cwrongly decided\u201d. \u201cWe have just too many guns \u2013 on the streets, in our homes, in our neighborhoods,\u201d she said last month.</p> <p>Each candidate has made appeals to very specific demographics, implicitly linking the questions of gun rights and gun violence to race. In addressing the NRA\u2019s annual meeting Friday, Trump spoke to an older, largely white crowd, and the NRA\u2019s CEO, Wayne La Pierre, spoke to that crowd in exclusionary terms. </p> <p>\u201cIn this room, we still see the America that we have always loved,\u201d he said. \u201cWe in this room, we are America.\u201d</p> <p>In contrast, Clinton has extended a hand to African American voters, particularly black women. On Saturday, Clinton will speak at a Florida event honoring Trayvon Martin, a black teenager whose shooting death <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/19/blacklivesmatter-birth-civil-rights-movement\">presaged a new civil rights movement</a> under the banner Black Lives Matter. Clinton has been joined on the campaign trail by the Mothers of the Movement, a coalition of black women who lost children in incidents related to gun violence and law enforcement.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"d2efb5b0f5325d6b5fda6e65a8dba3c8b8f156e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2efb5b0f5325d6b5fda6e65a8dba3c8b8f156e1/1359_0_2432_3040/800.jpg\" alt=\"Trayvon Martin.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Trayvon Martin.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark St George/Rex Features</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The former secretary of state has decried the disproportionate toll of gun violence on minority communities and pledged to \u201cend the era of mass incarceration\u201d.</p> <p>Trump told NRA members that locking up criminals was the best way to keep Americans safe.</p> <p>\u201cHillary Clinton will release violent criminals from jail, more so than even Obama,\u201d he said, \u201cand put innocent Americans at risk.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m going to put criminals behind bars,\u201d Trump promised, in an attack that echoed tough-on-crime ads from the 1980s and contrasts with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/oct/01/mandatory-minimu-sentencing-reform-bill-us-senate-bipartisan\">a bipartisan effort to reduce incarceration</a>.</p> <p>He and LaPierre blamed Barack Obama for high crime in cities such as Chicago, saying the president and his former secretary of state would disarm all the Americans most in need of protection. </p> <p>\u201cHillary wants them to be defenseless, wants to take away any chance they have of survival,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou have men and you have women, sitting in an apartment, and outside is tremendous crime, tremendous crime of all kinds, and they need to be protected. And if you take that gun away from them, it\u2019s going to be a very unfair situation.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/21/hillary-clinton-bill-90s-nostalgia-reform-scandal\">Clintons find 90s nostalgia where others see legacy of mistakes and scandal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He also said Clinton should herself go without protection, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/734003305819570176\">tweeting</a> on Saturday: \u201cHillary wants to get rid of all guns yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed.

Trump has been endorsed by a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, and earlier this month, Trump\u2019s campaign blamed a \u201cdatabase error\u201d after a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/10/donald-trump-white-nationalist-delegate-database-error\">white nationalist was included</a> on its official list of delegates to the Republican National Convention. Trump <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/28/donald-trump-former-kkk-leader-david-duke\">wavered before finally condemning the endorsement</a> from the former Klansman. </p> <p>Clinton, in contrast, has repeatedly talked about the burden of systemic racism on Americans of color, and about the importance of white Americans recognizing their privilege. </p> <p>\u201cRace still plays a significant role in determining who gets ahead in America and who gets left behind,\u201d Clinton said earlier this year \u2013 marking a stark contrast from much criticized policies in the 1990s. As first lady, Clinton embraced tough-on-crime measures and once referred to juvenile gang members as \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/07/bill-clinton-protesters-hillary-rally-philadelphia-incarceration\">super-predators</a>\u201d who needed to be \u201cbrought to heel\u201d.</p> <p>At the Friday\u2019s Leadership Forum, LaPierre did not talk about race or racism. He highlighted a different tension: the contrast between the people \u201cwho keep American running every day\u201d and the \u201cpolitical and media elites\u201d who are \u201cshredding the very fabric of our country and transforming America into an America you won\u2019t even recognize\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re the police officers who patrol neighborhoods, and we\u2019re the firefighters, in this room, who run towards the fire, the servicemen and women who have answered the call,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are other rooms \u2013 rooms where the America we see is no longer visible and no longer wanted.\u201d</p> <p>On Saturday, Clinton will address a group concerned about the vigilantism, which LaPierre and Trump have promoted with language about \u201cgood guys with a gun\u201d. Martin, the teen whom she will honor in Florida, was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/12/george-zimmerman-trayvon-martin-gun-auction\">shot and killed in 2012 </a>by a self-appointed neighborhood guard who was later <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/14/zimmerman-acquitted-killing-trayvon-martin\">acquitted</a> of second-degree murder and manslaughter charges. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/13/ferguson-effect-real-researcher-richard-rosenfield-second-thoughts\">Is the 'Ferguson effect' real? Researcher has second thoughts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The issue of policing adds another question to the debate about guns and racism, and Trump supporters have raised it repeatedly. On Friday morning, a man in the line to hear Trump address the NRA challenged a reporter to name a murdered police officer, and asked why none of their names were as well known as Martin\u2019s. </p> <p>As protests against police violence and mistreatment of black Americans continue, some law enforcement officers have said they are being unfairly demonized, particularly considering their daily work responding to community violence and trying to keep African American residents safe. </p> <p>In an interview earlier this spring, the head of Chicago\u2019s police union criticized Clinton for running an anti-police campaign. \u201cPeople used to run on an anti-crime platform. Now it\u2019s anti-police. Instead of going after the gang-bangers, go after the guns, go after the dope, it\u2019s go after law enforcement,\u201d Dean C Angelo, Sr, said. \u201cIt\u2019s upside down.\u201d</p> <p>Trump appealed to this group as well, saying they deserved \u201ca standing ovation\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cThey are fantastic people,\u201d he said. \u201cAmazing.

Violence has also spiked in some cities over the past year: a new<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/01/us/murder-rates-rising-sharply-in-many-us-cities.html\"> justice department-funded study</a> found that much of the increase in 2015 homicides among large cities was concentrated in 10 cities, all of which had large African American populations. <br /></p> <p>Trump has tweeted out a graphic with fake crime statistics that say 81% of white homicide victims were \u201ckilled by blacks\u201d. FBI crime data shows that the majority of homicide victims, white or black, are killed by offenders of their own race, and conservative TV host Bill O\u2019Reilly asked Trump about the \u201c<a href=\"http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/bill-o-reilly-trump-incorrect-retweet\">totally wrong</a>\u201d statistics last year.</p> <p>\u201cI retweeted somebody that was supposedly an expert,\u201d Trump said. \u201cAm I gonna check every statistic?\u201d </p> <p>\u201cYou gotta. You\u2019re a presidential candidate,\u201d O\u2019Reilly replied. </p> <p>The 2016 election has also coincided with<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2015/oct/02/mass-shootings-america-gun-violence\"> a series of high-profile shootings</a>, three of which occurred over consecutive months last year: the massacre of nine African American churchgoers last June in Charleston, South Carolina; a shooting at a movie theater in Lafayette, Louisiana, in July; and the killing of two reporters in Roanoke, Virginia, in August while they were live on air. </p> <p>Following a mass shooting at a community college in Oregon last October, which left nine victims and the perpetrator dead, Clinton unveiled an expansive plan aimed at reducing gun violence. Among its key tenets were universal background checks, a ban on assault weapons, and a push to hold gun dealers and manufacturers accountable for gun violence, including by repealing a 2005 law that bars lawsuits against gun companies when a legally sold gun is later used in a crime. </p> <p>On the latter, Clinton has clashed with Democratic rival Bernie Sanders, who voted in favor of granting legal protections to gunmakers in 2005. Clinton, then representing New York in the US Senate, voted against the bill.</p> <p>Trump, who has now adopted a hard line on the gun issue, once supported an assault weapons ban, and following the 2012 elementary school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, tweeted that Barack Obama \u201cspoke for me and every American in his remarks\u201d on the tragedy. More recently, Trump has repeatedly argued that the carnage of terrorist attacks and mass shootings could be reduced, or even prevented entirely, if more people carried guns. </p>",

      "headline": "Exeter Chiefs grind out win over Wasps to reach first Premiership final",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-22T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Exeter continued this sporting year\u2019s underdog theme by reaching the Premiership final for the first time, almost six years to the day after winning promotion from the Championship. Had bookmakers in 2010 been offering odds on the Chiefs winning the title this month, they would probably have been longer than 5,000-1.</p> <p>Not that Exeter went into their fourth match of the season against Wasps as underdogs. The Chiefs had won the six previous Premiership matches between the sides here and they had lost in front of their own supporters once in 19 months. Their improvement over the years, starting as they plotted their way out of the Championship a decade ago, has been incremental, layer on layer, so that playing in the Premiership final, as well as winning it, is more design than dream.</p> <p>So a club making its first play-off appearance always knew where it was going against opponents who had won the Premiership four times.<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/01/exeter-wasps-premiership-match-report\" title=\"\"> There were points when Wasps</a>, who did not resemble the team that had collapsed here at the start of the month, looked to have the outcome in their grasp, not least towards the end of the first-half when they led by a point despite having opted to play into the strong wind, but their grip was not strong enough.</p> <p>It has been a notable season for Wasps who, in one sense, have come almost as far as Exeter after planting one foot in the Championship four years ago, close to bankruptcy. They have gone from bust to booming, the Premiership\u2019s great entertainers, but their two semi-final defeats in the past month, to the clubs who will contest the Premiership final next Saturday, showed the need for more balance in their game.</p> <p>This match was effectively settled by two Exeter tries either side of half-time. The first came after Wasps had lost the ball near the Chiefs\u2019 22: Henry Slade used the wind to kick the ball 60 metres and Charles Piutau picked it up just short of his own line. One of the players of the season dithered, worried about conceding an attacking lineout, and was caught in possession by Slade and Jack Nowell.</p> <p>Piutau dropped the ball and the Exeter No8 Don Armand swerved out of Matt Mullan\u2019s challenge to cross only for the referee, Greg Garner, to check on a suspected knock-on by Nowell. The Chiefs had a scrum rather than a try and when it was collapsed by Mullan, they kicked to touch and drove a maul. Down that went and that penalty was kicked to touch too.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/21/saracens-leicester-premiership-play-off\">Saracens outclass Leicester to reach Premiership final and put double in sight</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When the same happened again, Garner warned the Wasps\u2019 captain, James Haskell, about the consequences of another collapsed maul. His words were lost in the roar of the crowd as Exeter duly set the next lineout take on course for the visitors\u2019 line and down it went. Carlo Festuccia, who had earlier scored his side\u2019s first try from a driving maul, was deemed to have been the most guilty of a number of suspects and shown a yellow card after a penalty try was awarded, although all he looked to have collapsed was himself.</p> <p>Exeter led 20-14 at the break, a modest return for the significant wind advantage they had enjoyed and when Jimmy Gopperth knocked a penalty five minutes after the restart it looked as if the Chiefs would need to dig in. Then the No8 <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/20/nathan-hughes-wasps-england-premiership-fiji\" title=\"\">Nathan Hughes</a>, running in the Chiefs\u2019 22, threw a blind overhead pass that was spilled.</p> <p>Exeter turned defence to attack and within two minutes the imposing flanker Dave Ewers broke the tackles of Hughes and Bradley Davies to give his side a 10-point lead and a cushion Wasps were unable to deflate. They gnawed away with Gopperth kicking two more penalties, but on a day when the weather was more November than May, grey, dank and damp, they struggled to get their outside backs into the game. When a series of attacks broke down with four minutes to go Exeter seized the moment and won the game with a penalty try awarded 30 seconds after their five-metre scrum was sabotaged.</p> <p>Exeter held their nerve, which they will need to do, and more, against Saracens. They are a team that shapes its own destiny and there was never a sense of panic during the moments when the semi-final was tilting away from them. It did not look as if the vocal home crowd would have too much to worry about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/14/exeter-chiefs-gareth-steenson-premiership-rugby-union-semi-final-play-offs-wasps-twickenham\" title=\"\">when Gareth Steenson\u2019s two penalties</a> rewarded the Exeter\u2019s early dominance, but when Festuccia scored after Wasps\u2019 first attack, the contest became real.</p> <p>The lively Nowell was tackled into touch by Charles Piutau after a scrum move, but after Wasps kicked to touch, Exeter brought Nowell in to midfield from, the lineout and he off-loaded to Ian Whitten who was tackled by Mullan but not held on the ground and got up to score.</p> <p>The lead changed again 11 minutes later when Wasps produced a move that summed up their season: George Smith, Hughes and Frank Halai combined in a quick passing move before Haskell took the ball up. After another burst by Hughes, Dan Robson saw Steenson lurking around the ruck and wrong-footed the outside-half.</p> <p>It was the Chiefs, though, who had the right balance and they should, being far less ideologically driven, push <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/30/bath-saracens-premiership-match-report\" title=\"\">Saracens more than Bath did in last year\u2019s</a> final.</p>",

      "headline": "Hibernian and David Gray stun Rangers to make Scottish Cup history",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-22T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>First, the positive. Hibernian\u2019s status as the butt of so many jokes has now been removed. In a moment where time appeared to freeze, Liam Henderson\u2019s corner was met by the head of David Gray in ending a 114-year wait for Scottish Cup glory. Poetically, the winner arrived in stoppage time. Glory, Glory to the Hibees as the old song dictates.</p> <p>This Hibs vintage of 2016 has thereby been afforded legendary status by stepping where so many before them, including wonderful teams, could not. Logan, Gray, Hanlon, Fontaine, Fyvie, McGeouch, Stevenson, McGinn, McGregor, Stokes, Cummings, Henderson, Keatings and Gunnarsson will roll from the tongues of Hibs fans forever more. They have captured the Holy Grail when led by Alan Stubbs. After so many decades of hurt, bordering on torture at times, only the seriously churlish would deny Hibs their basking in epic glory. Good on them.</p> <p>Nonetheless, Hibs\u2019 triumph came at an immediate cost to reputation. The scenes that arrived at full-time, and will provide enduring images of the 131st Scottish Cup final, were despicable. Laughing them off as excessive jubilation would be a scandal in itself. Plenty have already tried. This was easily the worst Scottish football scene since the infamous Hampden riot of 1980.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/22/hibernian-condemn-crowd-trouble-cup-win-rangers\">Hibernian condemn crowd trouble which marred Cup win over Rangers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For thousands of Hibs supporters to invade the Hampden playing surface with a desire to celebrate, haul down goalposts and claim turf \u2013 as plenty did \u2013 is dubious but perhaps understandable. The problem was perfectly obvious; an element took it upon themselves to immediately head to the Rangers end of the ground and goad the opposition. Physical confrontation with the defeated players was also apparent before police horses arrived to belatedly restore at least an element of calm. Why any individual would choose to mark such a wonderful moment in their club\u2019s history with such antics is utterly baffling.</p> <p>Some of the Rangers following had responded by entering the field themselves, in itself worthy of condemnation despite provocation. The fighting that ensued could conceivably have been worse but was horrible enough to offer a shameful image of Scottish football to an audience who had earlier been treated to an excellent match. The Rangers players could not so much as receive their medals in public, while Hibs were denied a lap of honour. Only those in Cloud Cuckoo Land can believe there is any chance of the push to sell alcohol at Scottish grounds succeeding in the near future.</p> <p>Supporters aside, the failure of authorities to appropriately control what was transpiring before their very eyes was a scandal. In part, they understated what this meant to Hibs. Perhaps the Scottish FA will charge itself with an inability to properly preside over a cup final. Rod Petrie, the Hibs chairman and a vice-president of that governing body, bizarrely met the media and praised the \u201cprofessional manner\u201d with which events were dealt with. Petrie repeatedly pointed to \u201cover exuberance\u201d as an explanation.</p> <p>\u201cYou guys should be writing about five great goals and our success after years of toil and effort. That\u2019s the story,\u201d asserted Petrie, delving into the territory of flat earth. This reflected exceptionally poorly on both Petrie, his club and his SFA position. \u201cBehaviour that is unacceptable should be punished,\u201d Petrie eventually added, after castigating one journalist for \u201cexaggerating\u201d.</p> <p>It was Gray, unwittingly of course, who lit the touchpaper. Hibs had led through Anthony Stokes inside three minutes, the opening blow of a terrific first half. Kenny Miller restored parity with a fine header after James Tavernier crossed from the right.</p> <p>Stokes, his strike partner Jason Cummings and John McGinn all had opportunities to endorse what was lengthy Hibs superiority in the early stages with more goals. Instead, Rangers gradually gained a foothold in the second half and edged in front through Andy Halliday\u2019s long-range, powerful drive.</p> <p>For so long, Hibs\u2019 bottle had been questioned. They were now expected to wilt. Instead? Henderson\u2019s first, key outswinging corner was met at the near post by the outstanding Stokes. Even better was to follow.</p> <p>Hibs had commonly been castigated for their failure to gain promotion to the Scottish top flight for a second time in succession. Being realistic, this cup win will probably matter more than the league botch to those who sampled disappointment for so long. The victory means Hibs will even take their place in the qualifying phase for next season\u2019s Europa League.</p> <p>Mark Warburton, the Rangers manager, did not attend any post-match press conference. Police Scotland\u2019s assessment of \u201cdisorder and violence\u201d was more valid, in any case. Sadly, the achievement of stunning victory from the jaws of defeat for Hibs and a painful defeat for Rangers had already been overlooked in so many quarters. We have not heard the last of 21 May 2016 at Hampden. Nor should we have.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Ben Stokes will discover the full extent of the damage suffered to his left knee on Sunday, with doubts over his fitness meaning England will name an expanded squad for the second Test in Durham.</p> <p>The 24-year-old underwent lengthy treatment during the second day at Headingley and while he went on to bowl four more overs that evening, he left the field early on the morning of day three after a brief spell at slip at did not return.</p> <p>\u201cFor Ben to be off the field is not a good sign and it doesn\u2019t look good for Durham,\u201d said the captain, Alastair Cook, who confirmed Stokes would undergo a scan on Sunday and admitted the balance of the side for Friday\u2019s second Test will now be a problem.</p> <p>The Nottinghamshire seamer Jake Ball was the 12th man named in the original squad; however, the chance of Stokes being absent at the Riverside Ground may bring Warwickshire\u2019s Chris Woakes back into the thoughts of the selectors.</p> <p>Woakes played the last of his six Tests in the dead-rubber defeat to South Africa at Centurion in January, and while he struggled to impress there, the 27-year-old has started the county season strongly, with 14 wickets in four matches and a century in the win over Nottinghamshire.</p> <p>Losing Stokes for the Test would not only represent a blow for England, but for the hosts too, being Durham\u2019s sole player in the team and a possible draw card for late ticket sales for what is the only international fixture in the north-east this summer.</p> <p>The club\u2019s overall ticket sales sit around the 26,000 mark across the five days \u2013 the ground holds 17,000 for international fixtures \u2013 and are not helped by the close proximity to Leeds, which is hosting the first Test because Lord\u2019s \u2013 the venue for the opening Test for the past 15 years \u2013 is redeveloping the Warner Stand.</p> <p>Durham expect to make a loss on the \u00a3923,000 staging fee paid to the England and Wales Cricket Board, as part of a package in which they will host a further three one-day internationals and one Twenty20 over the following three seasons, and are now in talks to spread the repayments over a longer period in an uncertain financial situation.</p> <p>Their reported debt of \u00a35m are dwarfed by those at Yorkshire or Warwickshire, but it is currently unsustainable. A knock-on effect could yet be felt in the playing staff, with the England fast bowler Mark Wood, their one-day captain, Mark Stoneman, and batsman Scott Borthwick among those who will be out of contract at the end of the season.</p> <p>Wood, who is understood to be making a strong recovery after ankle surgery and is targeting Durham\u2019s four-day friendly against Sri Lanka A at the end of June for a possible return, finds his situation complicated by virtue of being a centrally contracted England player.</p> <p>The year-long deal means Wood is off the county\u2019s wage bill at present, but any offer from the club may hinge on whether the 25-year-old is likely to be retained by England when the 2017 contracts are announced in September.</p> <p>Stoneman, an opening batsman, has already been offered a renewal, but is known to be attracting interest from other clubs, while Borthwick, the leading scorer over the past three county seasons, will also be highly coveted.</p>",

To that end, as some of us like to call this Star Trek XII, here are the 13 most striking images from the newly released trailer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2e9a7388172ceffd8658f5568a88927eefa879a4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2e9a7388172ceffd8658f5568a88927eefa879a4/0_0_1440_596/1000.jpg\" alt=\"1\" width=\"1000\" height=\"414\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>\u201cA man will tell his bartender things he\u2019ll never tell his doctor.\u201d The first Bones once said that to the Captain of the Enterprise. No, it wasn\u2019t Dr Leonard McCoy to Captain Kirk, it was Dr Philip Boyce to Captain Christopher Pike (Star Trek is complicated). But clearly the sentiment crosses numerous timelines.</p> <p>Chris Pine\u2019s James T Kirk has the blues for some reason, and his pal Bones (Karl Urban) has poured him a little brown liquor (Saurian brandy?) to get him chatting. If the rest of the trailer is any indication this is one of the few scenes that isn\u2019t played at lightspeed.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dc1f9890b988fba6ce06e0b5abcc02f26f75e706\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dc1f9890b988fba6ce06e0b5abcc02f26f75e706/0_0_842_351/500.jpg\" alt=\"STB\" width=\"500\" height=\"208\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>For 50 years the makers of Star Trek have found nifty ways of showing something that literally can not be viewed: faster-than-light travel. We\u2019re either in the ship, looking out at some sort of tunnel, or we\u2019re watching the ship zoom off, leaving behind a warp trail. In Star Trek Beyond, director Justin Lin gives us something new. What we see here is a side-view of the warp bubble that (if I understand it correctly) carves out spacetime to create what is known as subspace. Traveling through subspace is what enables the Enterprise to traverse vast distances in short periods of time. For serious Trek dorks this image is a long time coming, though I\u2019m sure someone is on a message board right now saying this isn\u2019t what it actually would look like.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"91405dd59696659325561b3d012e4524567649b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/91405dd59696659325561b3d012e4524567649b1/0_8_1440_590/1000.jpg\" alt=\"STB\" width=\"1000\" height=\"410\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>1979\u2019s Star Trek: The Motion Picture is a divisive film but most fans agree the lengthy sequence of the Enterprise in spacedock is a glorious sight. Star Trek Beyond gives us a playful tweak, making the view of the shipyard more interesting than the ship. Look for the little rectangle of red \u2013 that\u2019s the back of the Enterprise caught up in this enormous tube on a space station.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a5331099a47d60b0b0061c228c912ee9174a04c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a5331099a47d60b0b0061c228c912ee9174a04c0/0_4_1439_593/1000.jpg\" alt=\"STB\" width=\"1000\" height=\"412\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Here they are: the troika. Captain James T. Kirk flanked by his id and superego, Bones and Spock. This image apes Communist propaganda, which is funny considering the original Star Trek reflected interventionist Kennedy-style American Cold War policy (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGO-SldLrNA\">let\u2019s not forget the time Captain Kirk read the Constitution!</a>)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ef6853d1a768b80646d62f525e9c143b5a2daabc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ef6853d1a768b80646d62f525e9c143b5a2daabc/0_3_1438_594/1000.jpg\" alt=\"STB\" width=\"1000\" height=\"413\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I respect Justin Lin for finding new ways to shoot the Enterprise. It took me a few minutes to figure out if the ship was coming or going in this shot. It\u2019s from the front, just a very odd angle. Moreover, the departure from spacedock feels very tactile, almost jarring in a way. Any doubts that the Fast &amp; Furious director wouldn\u2019t make his mark are quickly being erased.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d633217a94e0c6ebf5cd4e38f38acb90cb124dc1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d633217a94e0c6ebf5cd4e38f38acb90cb124dc1/0_9_1436_596/1000.jpg\" alt=\"STB\" width=\"1000\" height=\"415\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The \u201cswarm ships\u201d from the last trailer are back, but now they are coming in for the deflector dish. We still don\u2019t know if these are mini sentient spacecrafts, nor do we know what they want, but it becomes clear they mean business. Like space piranhas, they tear into the Enterprise, forcing an evacuation.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a16bd46c541190d6fd261ebf437e63c64cd2e762\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a16bd46c541190d6fd261ebf437e63c64cd2e762/0_6_1440_594/1000.jpg\" alt=\"STB\" width=\"1000\" height=\"413\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>But not before our gang puts up a fight! Here\u2019s Uhura kicking ass against some of the baddies that board the ship (it\u2019s still unclear if these nasty guys come out of the swarm ships, or if the swarm ships clear a path for a larger transport vessel). Either way, it must be said that the villains that Uhura is fighting in this image kinda-sorta resemble the <a href=\"http://memory-alpha.wikia.com/wiki/Breen\">Breen</a>, those enigmatic aliens who wore temperature-controlled suits with glowing green helmets. I\u2019m sure they aren\u2019t, as these reboot films have had very few callbacks to lesser-known creatures from the show, but a fan can hope.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f958014d02237aadfe0d68d98688ab731a4b7945\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f958014d02237aadfe0d68d98688ab731a4b7945/0_7_1432_595/1000.jpg\" alt=\"8\" width=\"1000\" height=\"416\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>What you are seeing here is terrifying, but likely something of a misdirect. After Captain Kirk orders an abandon ship, we see Chekov (hey, love that guy!) and Sulu (love that guy, too!) get into escape pods. A number of pods fire out into the inky void, and then the camera lingers on one as a swarm ships swoops down and gobbles it up. It\u2019s more of a Mothra move than anything from typical Star Trek. I\u2019m quite sure it wasn\u2019t anyone we know in that pod, but I\u2019m certainly ready to bet he was wearing a red shirt.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"172a3d02b9ffc272a48b348724d75ebf1f66a734\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/172a3d02b9ffc272a48b348724d75ebf1f66a734/0_9_1425_595/1000.jpg\" alt=\"9\" width=\"1000\" height=\"418\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Our crew gets scattered and along the way join forces with this woman named Jaylah. What\u2019s her story? Not sure yet, other than she\u2019s ready to fight! Despite some similarities in look, she is probably <em>not</em> from Nibiru, the primitive planet seen at the beginning of Star Trek Into Darkness. Underneath the makeup, Jaylah is played by Algerian-French dancer and actor Sofia Boutella, who you may remember as the henchwoman with swords for legs in Kingsman: The Secret Service.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fa58c19b11da0bb1eb2db8d9a7c9181a7740cc10\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa58c19b11da0bb1eb2db8d9a7c9181a7740cc10/0_7_1432_591/1000.jpg\" alt=\"10\" width=\"1000\" height=\"413\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>More space action! But look closely. That doesn\u2019t look like the Enterprise. Way too flat, more like Captain Archer\u2019s NX-01. Some poking around tells me that it is probably the USS Franklin, <a href=\"http://www.trektoday.com/content/2016/02/new-star-trek-beyond-starship/\">as some design sketches for this ship have surfaced online</a>. But any more than that is a mystery.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0fcb6a065e576524b7b8e752b4f763f4e9396892\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fcb6a065e576524b7b8e752b4f763f4e9396892/0_0_1439_595/1000.jpg\" alt=\"11\" width=\"1000\" height=\"413\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Oh yeah, Idris Elba, one of the best actors working today, is in this movie. He\u2019s the one on the right! Yes, underneath a ton of reptilian makeup. So little is known about his character in this film, other than he is mean. Just look at him being a jerk to Uhura! Boo! His name is Krall and, based on soundbytes, he represents where \u201cthe frontier pushes back.\u201d</p> <p>This isn\u2019t that far removed from the concept of the Gorn, the laughably rubber lizard-man Kirk fought in the Original Series episode Arena. The Gorn were all ticked off at the Federation for having outposts too far into their sphere of influence. But if you watch the behind-the-scenes footage of J.J. Abrams\u2019 2009 Star Trek you\u2019ll see there was a Gorn created for one of the early prison scenes that was cut. So Krall probably isn\u2019t a Gorn (plus, Gorn don\u2019t speak English, they hiss \u2013 even with the Universal Translator operative).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0e0239192f111dacef8c708d002be13b3ebcdb97\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0e0239192f111dacef8c708d002be13b3ebcdb97/0_0_1440_597/1000.jpg\" alt=\"12\" width=\"1000\" height=\"415\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Spock and Bones are down on the planet firing phasers, but there are two noticeable things. One, Spock is wearing overalls? I guess in the context of roughing it while marooned, it is logical. Second, he is clutching his abdomen. Usually in a movie any pronounced overture of being wounded usually means a character is going to croak. I don\u2019t know if I have it in me to watch another Spock die in a film, even though they have a tendency to come back to life later. Here\u2019s hoping he just had some bad <a href=\"http://www.geekychef.com/2010/01/plomeek-soup.html\">Plomeek soup</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"502735047bb384219840d3ac0d828a512bf29db4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/502735047bb384219840d3ac0d828a512bf29db4/0_0_1439_594/1000.jpg\" alt=\"13\" width=\"1000\" height=\"413\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>That mysterious ship has returned and this time it is headed to a space station inside some sort of sphere, possibly with an atmosphere. Star Trek has never shown us such a cool looking station before. Between this, images of Jaylah, Krall and those swarm ships, I can safely say that this is already the one of the most visually creative Star Trek films yet. Now we just need to figure out a way to warp to July 22 ...</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-22T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Barcelona and Sevilla arrived in Madrid as the city prepared its departure for Milan, the last of the Spanish capital\u2019s European Cup final ticket allocation finally sold. At Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s Vicente Calder\u00f3n stadium they were getting ready for the Copa del Rey final between the recently crowned league champions and the even more recently crowned Europa League champions; at Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s Cerro del Espino training ground, they were getting ready for the Champions League final against Real. Saturday morning aerobics with Oscar \u201c<em>El Profe</em>\u201d Ortega, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/dec/18/diego-simeone-atletico-madrid-chelsea\" title=\"\">Diego Simeone</a>\u2019s relentless fitness coach, followed by a full rehearsal on pitch one.</p> <p>In red: Oblak; Juanfran, God\u00edn, Gim\u00e9nez, Filipe Lu\u00eds; Sa\u00fal, Augusto, Gabi, Koke; Torres, Griezmann. Against them, nine Atl\u00e9tico first-teamers plus two kids from the youth team, in white bibs and a 4-3-3 formation, with Yannick Carrasco as Cristiano Ronaldo, Luciano Vietto playing Karim Benzema and Angel Correa in Gareth Bale\u2019s role. Final score? 0-0. Not even a dodgy penalty, blown by Simeone in his role as referee, could produce a winner: Antoine Griezmann shot wide.</p> <p>Another clean sheet, then, at the end of a season in which Atl\u00e9tico have kept 34 of them. \u201cThat will be important in Milan because then you only need to score one,\u201d the goalkeeper Jan Oblak said. \u201cWe\u2019re very happy with the record, but the final is another game.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe game of our lives,\u201d Fernando Torres calls it, and Torres is a World Cup winner whose strike in the Euro 2008 final clinched Spain\u2019s first triumph in 44 years. \u201cYou never know how many finals you\u2019ll get; you have to play each as if it was your last,\u201d Koke added.</p> <p>It may yet be their last, but it is not their first, of course. Two years on, Madrid\u2019s biggest clubs \u2013 the only two left in Spain\u2019s first division after relegation for Getafe and Rayo Vallecano \u2013 meet again in the European Cup final in Milan next Saturday.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/24/champions-league-final-real-madrid-atletico-madrid-live\" title=\"\">In Lisbon, Atl\u00e9tico were seconds from victory</a> only for Sergio Ramos\u2019s header to change everything with the scoreboard showing 1-0 and 92.48. Diego God\u00edn had scored Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s opener that night, agonisingly close to being eternal, but asked if this was about revenge, he insisted: \u201cNo. We don\u2019t see this as revenge; we see it as a new opportunity.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat happened, happened,\u201d Koke said. It is inevitable that Lisbon is on their minds, but there appears to be a collective effort to look beyond that now. Publicly, at least. No revenge, no fatalism. Privately, it is a different matter: this has been their obsession since then. But, asked how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2014/may/24/real-madrid-atletico-madrid-champions-league-gallery-pictures\" title=\"\">the scar of Lisbon</a> was, whether it had healed, Simeone replied simply: \u201cVery good.\u201d Koke added: \u201cTwo years have passed; some things have changed, some stay the same. It\u2019s different now.\u201d</p> <p>There have been changes, and not just the stage upon which this will be set, Simeone describing San Siro as \u201cpure football\u201d. Some have even suggested that Atl\u00e9tico are favourites, too, but you will not catch them saying that. \u201cIt\u2019s just one game and the fact that we beat Bayern and Barcelona doesn\u2019t mean that we are going to win this,\u201d Griezmann said. \u201cFifty-fifty,\u201d Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s players repeated, one after the other. Simeone, too.</p> <p>Simeone is still there, of course, the man who transformed this club for ever, but Madrid\u2019s manager has changed: from Carlo Ancelotti to Rafa Ben\u00edtez to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/04/zinedine-zidane-real-madrid-coach-rafael-benitez\" title=\"\">Zinedine Zidane.</a> Players have changed too. Three of Real Madrid\u2019s starters have gone: F\u00e1bio Coentr\u00e3o, \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda and Sami Khedira, who replaced the then-suspended and now departed Xabi Alonso.</p> <p>The turnover at Atl\u00e9tico has been even more significant: Thibaut Courtois, Jo\u00e3o Miranda, Ra\u00fal Garc\u00eda, Diego Costa and David Villa, all starters that night, have gone. Filipe Lu\u00eds left too, although he is back again. Out on pitch one, he bombed up and down the left through the white box marking the pressure points on the turf. The replacements have been good ones. Oblak, who watched that final on television, has been outstanding and Simeone described Griezmann as one of the best three players in the world. \u201cThat\u2019s nice, isn\u2019t it?\u201d the Frenchman grinned.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/13/atletico-madrid-barcelona-champions-league-match-report\">Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s Antoine Griezmann sends Barcelona crashing out</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The buildup has been different too: longer and quieter. So far, at least. \u201cLast time we came from a having won the league at the Camp Nou,\u201d Simeone said. There was a league title, a bus parade, celebrations, and injured players back then; this time they have a fortnight to\u00a0prepare.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019ve had more time. It\u2019s not an excuse but we had played a \u2018final\u2019 against Barcelona and physically and mentally that\u2019s tiring,\u201d Koke said. God\u00edn agreed. \u201cWe\u2019re better physically,\u201d he said.</p> <p>They both are. That night, Pepe missed out through injury while Benzema and Ronaldo were struggling. For Atl\u00e9tico, there was no Arda Turan and Costa was withdrawn early, broken again, while others were running on empty; the Camp Nou had cost them.</p> <p>There has been a slight shift in styles, too, God\u00edn talking about Atl\u00e9tico as a team seeking \u201cnew variations\u201d, while Simeone spoke about a side that is constantly \u201creinventing itself\u201d, about \u201crenewal\u201d. \u201cDefend well\u201d might have been the first thing that Koke highlighted as vital at San Siro but the idea that this is all they do is facile and flawed. The idea that Real always attack is, too \u2013 and it was striking that Simeone and his players expect their opponents to wait for them.</p> <p>\u201cI anticipate them playing like they did against Manchester City,\u201d Simeone said. \u201cCasemiro gives them defensive strength and in the Champions League they have played on the break in almost every game. They have used that to get space; tactically, I think they\u2019ve been very good.\u201d The midfielder Augusto Fern\u00e1ndez described Madrid as \u201cvery strong, direct\u201d, noting: \u201cThe more space they have the better it is for them.\u201d Atl\u00e9tico will try to deny them that.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s the way they\u2019ve played in this Champions League,\u201d God\u00edn said. \u201cAnd we must not allow space for the Madrid forwards. In close games like this, a game that I expect to be tactical, hard, set plays could be the difference between winning or losing. But then lots of things can happen that you don\u2019t expect. Football isn\u2019t always logical.\u201d</p> <p>If it wasn\u2019t, perhaps they would not be here, but the revolution rolls on. And here Atl\u00e9tico are again, for the second time in three seasons, only the third time ever. So far, little over a minute has cost them two European titles, late equalisers ending their challenges after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/may/23/great-european-cup-team-bayern-munich\" title=\"\">120 minutes in Brussels 1974</a> and 92 minutes in Lisbon 2014.</p> <p>In Milan, they must avoid that same fate. Repeating that does not bear thinking about, so they are trying not to.</p> <p>\u201cWe\u2019re thinking about the moment we\u2019re in now; we all dream of playing in another final,\u201d God\u00edn said. \u201cWe\u2019re excited and we\u2019re going into this final with the confidence and humility we always have, knowing that this is a lovely chance to write a great page in Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s history.\u201d</p>",

It was 9.30pm on 7 December, and the Oakland, California, mother saw a man she did not recognize furiously pounding on her front door.</p> <p>\u201cOpen the fucking door,\u201d he screamed, according to Cortez\u2019s account. \u201cLet me in!\u201d</p> <p>When her husband Nemesio cracked open the door to ask him to leave, the man, who smelled strongly of alcohol, allegedly kicked him in the stomach and grabbed Olga, who was wearing a bathrobe and fell to the ground \u2013 exposing her body. Another man came running out of their backyard and appeared to point a gun at the wife. </p> <p>Their daughters, ages 11 and 13, stood in the doorway crying.</p> <p>The traumatizing incident, outlined in a claim to the city, got worse when the Oakland police department (OPD) showed up. The officer wanted the couple to \u201csanitize their story\u201d, asking them if the man \u201cwas simply knocking\u201d on the door and had inadvertently pushed Olga \u201cwhile falling down\u201d.</p> <p>The bizarre line of questioning only made sense when OPD lieutenant Roland Holmgren later revealed to Olga the identities of the two suspects: They were Oakland cops who, according to the lieutenant, were just \u201cbeing silly\u201d and \u201cmistakenly went to her house\u201d looking for a party, the claim alleges.</p> <p>The ensuing scandal is just one among numerous misconduct cases plaguing the police department in Oakland, the city across the bay from San Francisco that has long been at the center of contentious debates about crime, gentrification and race relations. </p> <p>Although presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump recently called the city one of the \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/22/magazine/donald-trump-primary-win.html\">most dangerous</a>\u201d places in the world, some say the real danger in Oakland is its police. </p> <p>This week, four officers were caught up in a national controversy centered on accusations that a cop may have <a href=\"http://www.eastbayexpress.com/SevenDays/archives/2016/05/12/oakland-police-underage-sex-scandal-involves-cop-who-possibly-killed-his-wife\">murdered his wife</a> in a case that has exposed allegations of <a href=\"http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Oakland-police-place-fourth-officer-on-leave-in-7515868.php\">sexual misconduct</a> by numerous officers, possibly involving <a href=\"http://www.bigstory.ap.org/article/8f272337f9a8455abebdf2b37ca93d63/california-police-sexual-misconduct-probe-sparked-suicide\">sex with a minor</a>.</p> <p>\u201cI was not surprised,\u201d Melissa Nold, the Cortez family\u2019s attorney, said of the latest scandal. \u201cWe\u2019ve been saying forever that there are systemic problems.\u201d</p> <p>The December assault was, however, particularly disturbing to Nold. That\u2019s because OPD sergeant Joseph Turner, who allegedly trespassed in the family\u2019s backyard, appeared to be out partying with cops that night \u2013 just two weeks after he had killed a man in a shooting many believed was cruel and unjustified.</p> <h2><strong>A notorious history</strong></h2> <p>Black residents began <a href=\"http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/stories-of-the-great-migration-to-oakland/Content?oid=3868223\">migrating</a> in large numbers from the south to Oakland in the 1940s, but the police department did not adapt to reflect the city\u2019s diversity, and racial tensions escalated.</p> <p>In the 1960s, Oakland became the birthplace of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/03/black-panthers-vanguard-revolution-film\">Black Panther movement</a> after growing police harassment and brutality, and in 1968, anger at OPD boiled over when cops <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2011/oct/26/oakland-police-department-black-community\">killed a 17-year-old</a> member. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7067633b6f26dca7d587527fd406efc0c7acb865\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7067633b6f26dca7d587527fd406efc0c7acb865/0_157_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Protesters gather last year near illuminated letters spelling dream outside a house which they identified as the residence of Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Protesters gather last year near illuminated letters spelling dream outside a house which they identified as the residence of Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Although the unrest mirrored strife in urban communities across the US, OPD established itself as one of the most notorious law enforcement agencies in the country with a 1990s corruption scandal involving a group of cops known as the \u201cRiders\u201d. The officers allegedly <a href=\"http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/opd-still-appears-to-be-targeting-blacks/Content?oid=4185368\">planted drug evidence</a> on black residents, <a href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/OAKLAND-Riders-lied-brutalized-man-2629441.php\">falsified records</a> and brutalized suspects, leading to a 2000 federal lawsuit and court oversight of OPD that remains in effect today.</p> <p>\u201cThe Oakland police department is corrupt in its roots,\u201d said Cat Brooks, co-founder of the Anti Police-Terror Project, a local community group. </p> <p>Despite a <a href=\"http://www.oaklandcityattorney.org/notable/riders.html\">settlement agreement</a>, a federal judge said he was forced to <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/2012/dec/14/local/la-me-oakland-police-20121214\">take direct control</a> of reform efforts in 2012. Since then, there have been improvements and OPD leadership has, in recent years, begun to seek <a href=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/crime-courts/ci_28085713/oakland-police-becoming-example-departments-seeking-reform\">proactive solutions</a>, said Jim Chanin, a civil rights attorney who helped initiate the Riders lawsuit. \u201cThere are people in the department who are dedicated to achieving real lasting cultural change,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Still, OPD disproportionately <a href=\"http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Black-Oakland-residents-stopped-searched-with-6662485.php\">stops and searches black residents</a>, and a court-appointed investigator continues to issue <a href=\"http://www.eastbayexpress.com/SevenDays/archives/2015/04/16/court-appointed-investigator-slams-oaklands-broken-police-disciplinary-process\">scathing reports</a> on the department\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.eastbayexpress.com/oakland/why-oakland-cant-fire-bad-cops/Content?oid=4074076\">disciplinary procedures</a>.</p> <p>Some of the agency\u2019s longtime critics say they\u2019re starting to develop more faith in OPD\u2019s top cops, but they say a steady stream of controversies in recent months point to a fundamental cultural problem within the department \u2013 one that allows police to get away with unjust shootings, bad behavior and possibly even murder.</p> <h2><strong>\u2018Like killing animals in the street\u2019</strong></h2> <p>On 15 November, Ada Perkins-Henderson, 66, stepped outside her home in East Oakland and prayed for the person lying dead in the street one block away.

That family needs you,\u2019\u201d she recalled.</p> <p>Later, she got a call: Her youngest son Richard was dead.</p> <p>\u201cI didn\u2019t know I was praying for my son.\u201d</p> <p>According to <a href=\"http://www.mercurynews.com/crime-courts/ci_29144985/oakland-police-release-name-suspect-killed-by-officers\">Oakland police</a>, Richard Perkins, 39, approached cops with a toy pistol, prompting four officers, including Turner, to simultaneously fire at him.

      "body": "<p>From the phones in our pockets to the cars on our roads, almost everything with an electrical circuit needs a battery. But while the rest of the technology industry has made great leaps over the past couple of decades, batteries have not.</p> <p>The shortcomings of batteries are now one of the biggest bottlenecks in transport, energy, infrastructure and more. Our power demands are ever-increasing, but our ability to carry or store power is limited. Smartphones barely last a day, electric vehicles have much shorter ranges than petrol or diesel cars, and storing energy from sources such as solar panels is difficult.</p> <p>A breakthrough in energy storage is sorely needed, and many companies, including some of the oil giants, are working on it. There\u2019s a potentially lucrative market for those that succeed, but the limitations imposed by the chemistry of batteries have proved difficult to overcome.</p> <p>The biggest problem is energy density \u2013 how much energy can be stored in a given size and weight. Lithium-ion batteries, first introduced in 1991 and used in phones, cars and other rechargeable devices, store between 150 and 250 watt-hours per kilogram (Wh/kg). To put that in perspective, a fridge uses around 1,600 Wh a day, and petrol stores about of 13,000 Wh/kg \u2013 or more than 50 times the energy of even the best lithium-ion batteries.</p> <p>There are battery chemistries that used other metals, or elements such as sulphur or silicon, but researchers have struggled to increase energy density and meet strict safety requirements.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b38ab3bd9bf75a02e7123728fee4ba8c0b4aebe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b38ab3bd9bf75a02e7123728fee4ba8c0b4aebe/0_205_6144_3686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Tesla home battery being installed at a house in Cardiff.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Tesla home battery being installed at a house in Cardiff.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Phillips for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThe more energy you put into a box, the more dangerous it will be,\u201d says Billy Wu of the Dyson School of Design Engineering at Imperial College London. \u201cSafety is key and thermal management is crucial. If a battery heats up beyond 80C, the components start to decompose. That\u2019s when it can explode.\u201d</p> <p>That\u2019s not the kind of explosion manufacturers are after. The battery market is forecast to be worth $120bn in 2019 according to industry research firm Freedonia Group, and vacuum cleaner firm Dyson recently joined electric carmaker Tesla, Korea\u2019s Samsung, Panasonic of Japan and IBM in investing heavily in battery research.</p> <p>Tesla\u2019s electric cars have a claimed range of 200-300 miles per charge, and the company recently entered the home battery market. Working with Panasonic, it is investing $5bn in what has been dubbed the \u201cgigafactory\u201d. Making batteries on a large scale will be crucial for pushing electric cars into the mass market. Currently the battery makes up about 20% of the price of a Tesla Model S, which costs from \u00a358,300.</p> <p>Many consider a range of 500 miles crucial \u2013 the distance an average petrol or diesel car can travel on a single tank. Since 2009, IBM\u2019s Battery 500 Project has been working on lithium-air batteries, which have the potential to reach similar energy densities to petrol. But so far a commercial product has remained out of reach.</p> <p>\u201cA lot of people talk about metal air systems, which are on the horizon, but are 20 years away from any commercialisation,\u201d says Wu.</p> <p>Dyson\u2019s recent \u00a31bn investment in battery technology has shone a light on one promising area of research. Last October, the British company acquired University of Michigan spin-off Sakti3, which is developing solid-state batteries with twice the energy density of lithium-ion versions. They use a solid polymer instead of the electrolyte paste, and potentially offer faster charging times as well.</p> <p>Beyond consumer applications, much research has focused on energy supply. \u201cThe problem with renewable energy sources such as solar and wind is that they\u2019re intermittent, and can sometimes produce too much power, which has to be dumped to avoid overloading the grid,\u201d says Wu.</p> <p>Storing that energy in batteries would help even out supply. But right now that kind of storage, be it in large-scale battery banks or at home, is limited in the same way as in consumer electronics. All commercial battery firms can do is try to get the most out of current lithium-ion cells.A big leap in battery technology is coming \u2013 but not quite yet.</p>",

Total of France, for instance, announced two weeks ago that it planned to spend nearly \u20ac1bn on buying 100-year-old battery manufacturer Saft.

Total announced last year that it was spending \u20ac200m on transforming an unprofitable oil refinery into a biofuel plant, and separately that it would start to invest $500m a year in renewables.</p> <p>Total made its first real drive into renewable energy five years ago, with its <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2011/apr/29/total-solar-power-renewables\" title=\"\">$1.4bn acquisition of SunPower</a>, one of the largest solar panel makers in the US.

There is tremendous growth in that sector and we want to be part of that.</p> <p>\u201cIt makes sense to utilise our project-management skills from oil and gas to offshore wind which is why we are operating Sheringham Shoals and Dudgeon Sands off the UK. We are also looking at more carbon capture schemes and at solar [worldwide].\u201d</p> <p>Even Exxon Mobil, often dismissed by climate change activists as the most conservative oil company of them all, has recently unveiled plans to investigate CCS more fully in a new partnership with a fuel cell company.</p> <p>But some of the sums being invested are quite small: the Shell New Energies, for example, has a capital expenditure budget of just under 0.5% of its total. And oil companies do have form for shouting loudly about moving into renewables only to beat a hasty retreat.</p> <p>BP in particular was pilloried for promising to go \u201cbeyond petroleum\u201d \u2013 then running down its alternative energy division. Shell used to have a very big solar business, but this was scaled down several years ago.</p> <p>Environmentalists are increasing the pressure on oil companies by accusing them of trying to slow the march to low-carbon energy, if not of being the climate-change deniers some were of old.</p> <p>There are even claims that Big Oil has been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/22/fossil-fuel-firms-accused-renewable-lobby-takeover-push-gas\" title=\"\">deliberately infiltrating renewable energy lobby groups so that it can push its agenda</a> of keeping gas, in particular, as a \u201ctransition fuel\u201d of the future \u2013 something the companies deny.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"0a978f03cd989cd0b0542e917a649759ae165936\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0a978f03cd989cd0b0542e917a649759ae165936/0_133_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Exxon gas station\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Exxon is dismissed as conservative, but has recently become involved with CCS.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But academics such as Paul Stevens, an energy expert at thinktank Chatham House, have warned that large oil companies <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/05/oil-firms-environment-energy-climate-change\" title=\"\">must transform their business or face a \u201cshort, brutal\u201d end within 10 years</a>.</p> <p>Jeremy Leggett, a former petroleum geologist who went on to found photovoltaics group SolarCentury, thinks the oil companies are taking precautions as the world moves towards low-carbon energy. \u201cThe oil and gas majors are in a fascinating place,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re starting to use clean-energy investments to hedge their bets that markets for oil and gas will exist decades from now.</p> <p>\u201cThese investments are of varying degrees of seriousness. I would put Total at the top of the league table at the moment. But, unlike many of the big utilities, none of the majors has yet grasped the nettle and told stakeholders that the game is up. That oil and gas will be over by year X, and strategy is now being based on back-mapping from that year.\u201d</p> <p>The Brussels-based SolarPower Europe lobby group also believes that of all the oil majors, Total of France is on a steady path to become the \u201cgreen giant\u201d of the future.</p> <p>James Watson, chief executive of SolarPower Europe, says: \u201cWe take Total\u2019s moves seriously. From our perspective, it has been a long-time player in solar, it was a founding member of SolarPower Europe back in 1985. It acquired SunPower back in 2011 and recently announced that it wants to be one of the top three solar players by early next decade.</p> <p>\u201cI suspect that it has also been pushing for the French government to drive solar \u2013 and we saw recently the announcement by the French government that they will triple the amount of deployed solar in France by 2022. This could make France the leading annual installer in Europe up to that point.</p> <p>\u201cShell has a stake in the Japanese solar company Solar Frontier, but has yet to do anything in Europe. We know its boss sees solar as the backbone of energy in the future, but at an undefined time. Having no date does not suggest a strong commitment.\u201d</p> <p>Oil analysts themselves say it makes sense for oil companies to invest in renewables at a time when the value of green firms is also depressed by the low oil price. One leading City figure saw lots of reason for this: \u201cAssets are relatively cheap; it\u2019s a good time to diversify; and you can keep some of the low-carbon critics at bay. Also, the oil companies have a herd mentality: once one of them does it, you can expect the rest to follow. You could say green is in fashion.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/co-operative-group\" title=\"\">Co-operative Group</a> is going back to the future, and its chosen destination is 1968, when Mrs Robinson was in the charts and the average house price in Britain was \u00a34,000.</p> <p>Fast forward to this week and the group will begin a major facelift of its vast business, tearing down the lime-green frontages of its food shops and replacing them with a new blue logo.</p> <p>The cloverleaf-like design will look familiar to loyal members of the Co-op, because it was first launched back in 1968 and abandoned a decade ago when the group decided a more corporate look was needed.</p> <p>The facelift is part of a \u00a31.3bn investment to breathe fresh life into the 172-year-old group. It will include refurbishing the food shops and funeral homes and paying for new systems in its insurance business, as well as improving products and services.</p> <p>The relaunch is about more than shop windows and a new logo on a pint of milk: at its annual meeting in Manchester on Saturday, the mutual revealed plans to hand tens of millions of pounds back to its 8.4 million members and their communities through a new rewards scheme. As chairman Allan Leighton puts it, the Co-op is seeking \u201ca better way of doing business\u201d.</p> <p>The rebrand comes after the group, which traces its roots back to the Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers in 1844, recovers from its near-meltdown in 2013 and 2014, when a crisis at the Co-op\u2019s bank took the organisation to the verge of collapse.</p> <p>There was a \u00a31.5bn black hole in the banking business; the division\u2019s former chairman, Methodist minister Paul Flowers, was engulfed in a very public sex and drugs scandal; and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/11/co-operative-group-chief-executive-euan-sutherland-resign\" title=\"\">the group\u2019s chief executive resigned after the size of his pay package \u2013 \u00a36.6m \u2013 was revealed by the <em>Observer</em></a>.</p> <p>A radical shake-up of the board followed, new bosses were brought in \u2013 with Leighton as chairman and Richard Pennycook as chief executive \u2013 parts of the business were sold off, and the group reduced its stake in the bank to 20%.</p> <p>Since then Pennycook and Leighton have been quietly been putting the business back together and feel it is now ready to step out of the shadows following its very public humiliation. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a bit of a bounce-back,\u201d says Rod Bulmer, the head of the Co-op\u2019s consumer services business, including funeral care.</p> <p>The mention of Flowers\u2019s name is still uncomfortable: \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about Paul Flowers,\u201d says Bulmer. \u201cWe see that as part of the crisis point in the past, and we think we are through that by some\u00a0distance.\u201d</p> <p>As well as unveiling the new look to members on Saturday, the Co-op Group revealed new member benefits, designed to retain the loyalty of its existing members and attract new ones.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"27bdd3b01ade8c439b98fab658d63407ce687b6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/27bdd3b01ade8c439b98fab658d63407ce687b6b/0_452_7087_4253/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The new logo as it will appear on stores from this week\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The new logo as it will appear on stores from this week.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It wants another million members within the next five years, hoping that a return to the traditional values of the co-operative movement, where community comes before profits, will appeal to a new generation.</p> <p>Steve Murrells, chief executive of the food business, says: \u201cHindsight and reflection would say that, for a period of years, the society lost its way. When we moved to a more corporate logo it was probably the right thing back then, but it has become abundantly clear that we do need to go back to our roots.\u201d</p> <p>Under the new plans, members will receive a 5% reward every time they buy a Co-op own-brand product or service \u2013 whether that be a tin of beans or a funeral. The amount will be credited to members\u2019 accounts, and can then be cashed in as a discount against future goods and services.</p> <p>A further 1% will be credited to the members\u2019 account to be donated to a local cause of their choosing, such as a new park or local charity. The group says it has already identified 1,500 communities where the rewards could be invested.</p> <p>The benefits will be available from autumn this year, and by 2018 it is estimated that the scheme will see \u00a3100m a year being handed back to members of the society and the community.</p> <p>\u201cWe are putting money back into the hands of members and communities. We don\u2019t believe we are considered a profit centre,\u201d Murrells says. \u201cEverything will be put back into the community or given directly to members when we have effectively paid down the costs of running the business. The more customers who shop with us, the more good we can do.\u201d</p> <p>The group is hoping that, within five years, half of its sales across the various businesses will be generated by members \u2013 currently, in the food business, it\u2019s a quarter.</p> <p>The new membership rewards will be offered in addition to traditional dividend payments, which were suspended during the dark times in 2014 and will not be resumed until 2017 at the earliest.</p> <p>The financial crisis shone a light on some of the worst practices of big business and led to public outrage over boardroom excesses \u2013 an issue that is still being played out at annual meetings around the country as shareholders revolt against executive pay deals.</p> <p>Murrells says the national mood, particularly among younger people, presents an opportunity for the Co-op. \u201cBack as far as 2012, it was clear to us that the younger generation was very sceptical of big business and very aligned to the model of co-operatives,\u201d he says. \u201cThe signals were there and we knew as a business we had the chance to reach out to younger people.</p> <p>\u201cSo the [new] logo will resonate with members that have stuck by the Co-op and with new, younger members. We have been working towards this day.\u201d</p> <p>As if to lead by example, chief executive Pennycook has asked for a pay cut after receiving a total of \u00a33.59m last year including an annual bonus of \u00a31.12m.</p> <p>His basic salary will be cut from \u00a31.25m to \u00a3750,000 from July, although reductions in potential bonuses do not begin until 2017.</p> <p>The changes announced on Saturday reflect the group\u2019s determination to lay the shambles of 2013 and 2014 to rest and carve a successful future. They are pinning their hopes on a \u201cback to being the Co-op\u201d approach that goes back to 1968 and before.</p> <p>\u201cThe opportunity is huge if we can get that engagement right,\u201d says Bulmer.</p>",

What worked in the 1990s is no guarantee of box office success this time.</p> <p>Though his exact role in any future administration remains unclear and a cabinet post has been ruled out, the emergence of William Jefferson Clinton as a central cast member in his wife\u2019s 2016 campaign is already prompting a major reinterpretation of past performances.</p> <p>From trade liberalisation and welfare reform, to gay rights and the war on drugs, the once-vaunted legislative successes of the first Clinton decade are being re-litigated in a very different America.</p> <p>Trump has also begun to re-examine old scandals. He has tried to use Bill\u2019s womanising as an antidote to his own alleged misogyny, and has threatened to dredge up everything from <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/16/monica-lewinsky-shame-sticks-like-tar-jon-ronson\">his affair with Monica Lewinsky</a> to the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/1998/nov/18/clinton.usa\">Whitewater property deals</a> in an effort to smear his opponent in attack adverts.</p> <p>\u201cNobody in this country was was worse than Bill Clinton with women.

And I would like to see it happen again,\u201d boasted Bill Clinton during <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/13/donald-trump-bill-clinton-appalachia-democrats-voters\">a speech to supporters in Kentucky</a> where he first revealed his offer to help his wife revitalise impoverished regions like Appalachia and the Rust Belt.</p> <p>But while this attention to what the former Clinton adviser James Carville once dubbed \u201cthe economy, stupid\u201d makes just as much electoral sense now as then, there is far less consensus today that Clintonomics holds the necessary answers.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>At least two phenomena can trace some roots in that insecurity: Trump\u2019s capture of the Republican party and the remarkably persistent challenge of Bernie Sanders to Clinton\u2019s Democratic nomination. Both rest on their shared critique of Clinton-era free trade deals, and both opponents target the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) and the permanent normalisation of trade relations with China in October 2000, which they say began a hollowing of US manufacturing that accelerated under George W Bush and Barack Obama.</p> <p>Sanders in particular has <a href=\"http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/02/bernie-s/sanders-welfare-reform-more-doubled-extreme-povert/\">singled out Clinton\u2019s reform</a> of welfare entitlements for exacerbating US poverty rates and removing a vital safety net once the economy turned sour.</p> <p>The collapse in middle class incomes since the banking crash of 2008 can also arguably be traced back to Clinton\u2019s decision to remove many of the restraints on Wall Street.</p> <p>Recently<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/19/wall-street-deregulation-clinton-advisers-obama\"> revealed documents</a> show two separate attempts by bank-friendly advisers, in 1995 and 1997, to hurry Clinton into a repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, which prevented investment banks, insurers and retail banks from merging. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8bc92d24c6fb6baf061674723478809950637d3b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8bc92d24c6fb6baf061674723478809950637d3b/0_293_1366_1707/800.jpg\" alt=\"Clinton on the Arsenio Hall show in 1992.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Clinton on the Arsenio Hall show in 1992.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reed Saxon/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A Financial Services Modernization Act was passed by Congress in 1999, giving retroactive clearance to the 1998 merger of Citigroup and Travelers Group. The law also unleashed a wave of Wall Street consolidation that was later blamed for forcing taxpayers to spend billions bailing out the enlarged banks after the subprime mortgage crisis.</p> <p>Even Bill Clinton\u2019s own labour secretary, Robert Reich, has become a major critic of the administration\u2019s legacy \u2013 and emerged as a powerful cheerleader for Sanders instead.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jan/27/want-to-reverse-sky-high-inequality-bernie-sanders-is-the-pragmatic-choice\">Want to reverse sky-high inequality? Bernie Sanders is the pragmatic choice | Robert Reich</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As Sanders supporters come under pressure to rally around Clinton, Reich acknowledged this week that she would be preferable to Trump, but with words of faint praise.</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t demonize or denigrate Hillary Clinton,\u201d <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RBReich/posts/1220494881296439\">he wrote</a>. \u201cShe\u2019ll be an excellent president for the system we now have, even though Bernie would be the best president for the system we need.\u201d</p> <p>On the campaign trail, Bill Clinton has also become a magnet for critics of the criminal justice system, who claim his 1994 crime bill, passed during the so-called \u201cwar on drugs\u201d, was responsible for incarcerating a lost generation of African American men.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know how you would characterise the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped up on crack, sent them out onto the street to murder other African American children,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/07/bill-clinton-protesters-hillary-rally-philadelphia-incarceration\">he angrily told Black Lives Matter</a> protesters <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/08/bill-clinton-black-lives-matter-protest-crime-bill-almost-apology\">last month</a>. \u201cYou are defending the people who kill the lives you say matter.\u201d </p> <p>Though the language sounded as dated as the policy, Clinton supporters argue some can be excused by the changing times and attitudes. Both Clintons, for example, have also been criticised by gay rights campaigners for supporting the Defense of Marriage Act in 1996, when public support for same sex marriage was far less common or vocal.</p> <p>Ultimately, however, such issues reveal the limits of relying on 90s nostalgia to help propel the Clintons back into the White House. As it has with grunge music, electronic pagers and Tamagotchis, the world has moved on a long way.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Asghar Farhadi, who became the first Iranian to win an Oscar, with 2011\u2019s A Separation, has spoken out about his country\u2019s treatment of those who could criticise the government through their art. </p> <p>Speaking in Cannes after the first screenings of A Salesman, in which a teacher and actor tries to track down the man who has assaulted his wife, Farhadi said: \u201cIntellectuals have been so insulted and mistreated in my country. It embarrasses me no end. I\u2019m very proud of [Abbas] Kiarostami and our poets and writers,\u201d he continued, emphasising their resilience in the face of potential censorship and maltreatment. \u201cThey\u2019re not bogged down in any way, that\u2019s erroneous propaganda.\u201d</p> <p>The film shows the gradual escalating of the anger felt by Emad (Shahab Hosseini) after his wife, Rana (Taraneh Alidoosti), is attacked while showering by a man who may have been a client of the prostitute who previously rented their flat. Farhadi said he was interested in exploring what people felt to be proportionate vengeance. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/21/the-salesman-review-asghar-farhadi-cannes\">The Salesman review: Asghar Farhadi offers layers of Willy Loman</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m not talking about uncontrolled violence, but pre-meditated. Sometimes you are convinced that a violent act you are going to do is justified,\u201d he said. \u201cLike terrorists; they feel they have good reason to be violent. Sometimes you can believe you are entitled to be violent and build up a whole body of reasons which lead up to the act. A responsible and kind man can turn into a potentially violent being.\u201d</p> <p>Farhadi said such an investigation was prompted by his anxiety about living in such an unstable world. \u201cA lot of violent things are occurring for ideological reasons. It\u2019s becoming really disquieting as it grows so much. It is very difficult to withstand this violence, to eliminate it. Even if in the film we don\u2019t directly refer to what\u2019s happening, it is an illustration of contemporary society.\u201d</p> <p>In the movie, which is a contender for this year\u2019s Palme d\u2019Or, Emad and Rana are starring as Willy Loman and his wife in a semi-amateur production of Arthur Miller\u2019s Death of a Salesman. The director said he had been struck by the parallels between Manhattan after the second world war and Tehran today. At one point Emad expresses the desire that the city could be razed to the ground so the developers could start again; Farhadi said that this has in fact already happened. </p> <p>\u201cMiller saw this change in the city; he loses all his benchmarks. You see the very modern life beginning to impact on individuals. But a lot of groups fail to adapt to fast changes so quickly.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat\u2019s happening to Iran is very similar. This frantic, totally mad race forward. It\u2019s spreading so quickly, this thirst for modernity \u2013 often irrational \u2013 and it doesn\u2019t seem to match a lot of the very traditional values in our society. If you raze a city it may lead to disaster because such renovation and renewal cannot be achieved if you just sweep away traditions so deeply rooted.\u201d</p> <p>The troupe of actors of which the couple in The Salesman are a part are highly-educated and open-minded people. \u201cYet modern people in given circumstances react in highly traditional ways, fairly backward ways,\u201d said Farhadi. </p> <p>The director said he felt that the couple were representativeness of an admirable \u201cprudishness\u201d which was central to Iranian society. As well as the fallout from the central attack, there are scenes in single sex classrooms, and one in which a young boy is reluctant to be helped in the bathroom by a woman who isn\u2019t his mother. </p> <p>\u201cOur body is something very private,\u201d said Farhadi. \u201cOur private lives, too. There is total dichotomy between men and women. In a different culture the husband might have reacted differently and wouldn\u2019t have been so shaken by what happened. There is also the problem of reputation and collective judgement; the way other people - such as the neighbours - view you. This makes him become violent and leads to him perpetrate a heinous act.\u201d</p> <p>Yet his star, Alidoosti, disagreed, saying she felt the film was \u201cvery universal and went beyond just Iran and Iranian prudishness and this business of reputation and honour.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cI find it hard to believe that a western man wouldn\u2019t react in the same way. The dignity of a woman hasn\u2019t been respected, and that\u2019s a very sensitive issue wherever you are in the world. All women find it difficult to describe rape or sexual assault.\u201d</p> <p>The director said he had filmed in Iran after shooting his previous drama, The Past, in France, after feeling the need to return home. His success with A Separation had helped facilitate film-making in the country, he said, and upped the levels of enthusiasm amongst his crew. </p> <p>\u201cIf you have worked in Iran for decades you get used to running up against obstacles and they become a source of energy and motivation,\u201d he said. \u201cDespite the existing difficulties, I have great pleasure and satisfaction making films there. But I\u2019m sure if an American came to Iran to make a film, they would find it impossible, insurmountable.\u201d</p>",

He remains in hospital in an induced coma.</p> <p>Later that day, police were called to Oldham Road where two men, both aged in their thirties, had collapsed. They received medical attention at the scene before leaving of their own accord.</p> <p>Two other men on Saturday were reported to have been suffering adverse effects as a result of taking legal highs; one of them, aged 34, currently in hospital in a serious condition. </p> <p>DS Louise Ashurst of GMP\u2019s Rochdale borough said the incidents highlight a worrying trend that more people are taking legal highs. \u201cThey might not be illegal but they are very dangerous and can cause you serious harm, and we currently have two men in hospital in a very serious condition,\u201d she said. \u201cWe believe that some of the substances that are being taken are called Annihilation or Cherry Bombs, which might make them sound appealing, but the potential consequences make taking them not worth it. We would urge everybody to think about the effect that these legal highs can have on your health and not take them.\u201d</p> <p>According to GMP, consuming the substances can lead to profuse sweating, racing heartbeat, extreme muscle tension, delirious ranting and high body temperature.</p> <p>The warning comes five days before the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/05/blanket-ban-on-legal-highs-england-wales-begin-26-may\">Psychoactive Substances Act 2016</a> comes into force. The legislation will provide a blanket ban on the production, supply and importation of new psychoactive substances. </p> <p>The introduction of the act was originally due to come into force on 6 April, but was delayed following claims its definition of psychoactivity was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/30/legal-highs-ban-uk-delayed-concerns-law-enforceable-psychoactive-definition\">not practically enforceable</a> by the police and prosecutors.</p> <p>The legislation is designed to outlaw the trade in legal highs \u2013 synthetic chemicals that imitate the effects of traditional illicit drugs such as cannabis and ecstasy \u2013 but does not make their possession outside a prison a criminal offence.</p> <p>The introduction of similar legislation in Ireland triggered a wave of closures of shops and online outlets, although few prosecutions have followed due to difficulties proving in Irish law whether a substance is psychoactive.</p>",

Its director, Sharon Ament, says her job is to make it \u201cthe best museum in the world\u201d and looks forward to being able to put many more of its 6m objects on display. But that might not happen for five years and there\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.museumoflondon.org.uk/museum-london?gclid=CIy82t_76MwCFekp0wodXTEDFw\">plenty for visitors to enjoy</a> in the meantime.</p> <p>The museum also produces videos. One of these documents the explosion of a first world war munitions factory in Silvertown nearly a century ago, in January 1917. The accident killed 73 people and remains, in the words of curator Georgina Young, \u201cthe largest single explosion that London has ever seen\u201d.

Swelling went down, so no worries.\u201d</p> <p>Curry was wearing a shooting sleeve on the elbow, describing its purpose as \u201cjust compression to make sure I can get shots up and not have any swelling.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s sore, just because of the impact, but the spot it\u2019s at doesn\u2019t affect the range of motion, so I can shoot and dribble and do all I need to do,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s uncomfortable, but it\u2019s not necessarily painful.\u201d</p> <p>Many critics noted the lack of help Curry received when he barreled into the home crowd. When asked about the sequence, Curry said, \u201cI saw it once. Not a lot of help. That\u2019s all I\u2019ll say.\u201d He then joked: \u201cI wanted to do a crowd-surfing kind of deal. They weren\u2019t ready.\u201d</p> <p>One fan was seen taking a picture of Curry when he was on the ground. Curry said: \u201cI need that picture. That\u2019d be something to remember. I\u2019m kind of disappointed he took that moment to document it, if you will.\u201d</p> <p>Curry said: \u201cIt was kind of dangerous, but I don\u2019t know how you can play hard, do what you do in those situations, 50-50 balls or whatever with any doubt in your mind.\u201d</p> <p>The Warriors play the Thunder in Game 3 on Sunday, and Curry said he hopes to heal up in that time. He has missed six playoff games so far, thanks to knee and ankle injuries sustained against the Rockets.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m doing all right, nothing to really worry about,\u201d Curry said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have three days in between to get your body right.\u201d</p> <p>Curry said of his inury: \u201cThat\u2019s severe, the way it looked during the game. These are, from what I hear, very common injuries. You land on something, hard surface, or get bumped \u2013 elbow, hip, knee \u2013 they tend to kind of swell up. They don\u2019t cause any problems mechanically or what not. I can still use my arm, do what I need to do. It just looks ugly and is a little uncomfortable. That\u2019s it.\u201d</p>",

So the 2016 prize rejection season has at last begun: the following guide may be helpful to other potential refusers who need to know the options available.</p> <h2><strong>Refusing competition</strong></h2> <p>A stance Andras shares with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/mar/30/john-le-carre-booker-honour\">John le Carr\u00e9</a>, who asked (unsuccessfully) to be removed from the 2011 Man Booker international prize shortlist because \u201cI do not compete for literary prizes\u201d. A variant is exiting a specific competition made messy by mud-slinging, as with Derek Walcott\u2019s withdrawal from the 2009 Oxford poetry professorship race after personal smears, Vintil Horia\u2019s refusal of the 1960 main Goncourt prize (he had been accused of past membership of Romania\u2019s far-right Iron Guard), and last year\u2019s hoo-ha at the Hugo awards for SF and fantasy, when two novel prize nominees pulled out.</p> <p><strong>Pro:</strong> honourably self-sacrificial, especially for a debut author such as Andras who presumably could do with the \u20ac3,800 cheque.</p> <p><strong>Con:</strong> can appear holier-than-thou \u2013 many others dislike the \u201cposh bingo\u201d of prizes yet enter nonetheless \u2013 and look like \u201cgrandstanding\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Political rejection</strong></h2> <p>As illustriously exemplified by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/nov/21/pressandpublishing.books\">Hari Kunzru</a> (who in 2003 turned down the \u00a35,000 John Llewellyn Rhys prize saying its backer the Mail on Sunday was \u201cxenophobic\u201d and \u201canti-migrant\u201d), <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/oct/26/spanish-novelist-turns-down-prize\">Javier Mar\u00edas</a> (who rejected a \u20ac20,000 Spanish government prize in 2012 on the grounds that he didn\u2019t want revenue or recognition from \u201cstate institutions\u201d) and <a href=\"http://\">Alice Oswald</a> (who withdrew from the TS Eliot prize in 2011 because she felt \u201cuncomfortable\u201d about its investment-firm sponsor Aurum). Last year <a href=\"http://\">David Grossman</a> cancelled his candidacy for the Israel prize, accusing PM Benjamin Netanyahu of meddling with the judging.</p> <p><strong>Pro:</strong> makes a stronger, more straightforward statement than your work, which in all the above cases tends to be complex, wordy and enigmatic.</p> <p><strong>Con:</strong> someone repellent might get it instead \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.ursulakleguin.com/Blog2013.html\">Ursula Le Guin</a> withdrew from a Nebula award to protest the organising body\u2019s treatment of Poland\u2019s Stanislaw Lem, only to find her replacement was Isaac Asimov, \u201cthe old chieftain of the Cold Warriors\u201d.</p> <h2><strong>Pre-emptive rejection</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a7dc40fef00c8af7e8a1b2fcac0839bd829020f3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a7dc40fef00c8af7e8a1b2fcac0839bd829020f3/0_0_3536_2351/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nadine Gordimer\" width=\"1000\" height=\"665\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">No argy-bargy \u2026 Nadine Gordimer.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gallo Images/Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some female novelists \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/20/as-byatt-intellectual-women-strange\">AS Byatt</a>, Nadine Gordimer, Anita Brookner \u2013 declined to be submitted for the Orange/Baileys prize. Others have been less consistent: Patrick White and Peter Handke collected awards after seeming to be committed to a no-prizes policy.</p> <p><strong>Pro:</strong> means you stay aloof from all the argy-bargy, rather than having to awkwardly extract and explain yourself mid- or post-judging.</p> <p><strong>Con:</strong> enemies will say you\u2019re on the wane or giving yourself airs, and would have stood no chance of being a serious contender.</p> <h2><strong>Refusing tardily</strong></h2> <p>The most famous \u201cNon!\u201d of all, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jan/05/sartre-nobel-prize-literature-letter-swedish-academy\">Jean-Paul Sartre</a>\u2019s refusal of the Nobel prize for literature was in a would-be forestalling letter to the Swedish Academy (voicing disgust about being \u201ctransformed into an institution\u201d) that arrived \u2013 cannily, anti-Sartreans might allege \u2013 after they\u2019d made their decision. He remains (as nobel.org attests) the official 1964 winner.</p> <p><strong>Pro: </strong>you keep your cake and eat it too, winning but preserving your integrity.</p> <p><strong>Con:</strong> you forfeit the prize money \u2013 Sartre apparently made an undignified and unsuccessful later inquiry about receiving the cash after all.</p> <h2><strong>Acceptance that\u2019s also a rejection</strong></h2> <p>You can mock the prize and those behind it, as <a href=\"http://www.irwincorey.org/routines.html\">Thomas Pynchon</a> did when he sent the nonsense-spouting comedian \u201cProfessor\u201d Irwin Corey to accept his 1974 National book award; or excoriate the sponsors, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/john-berger\">John Berger</a> (who gave half his purse to the Black Panthers) did in his <a href=\"http://gostbustere.tumblr.com/post/17158444595/speech-by-john-berger-on-accepting-the-booker\">Booker prize victory speech in 1972</a>. A subtler snub was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/jmcoetzee\">JM Coetzee</a>\u2019s non-appearance to collect either of his Booker prizes, whereas for his 2003 Nobel prize (which has no public longlists or shortlists, and so is not a full-blown inter-author competition) he flew to Stockholm.</p> <p><strong>Pro:</strong> at its best is itself \u2013 as performance theatre \u2013 a literary creation, and more talked about than your books (who remembers Berger\u2019s <em>G</em>?).</p> <p><strong>Con: </strong>less pure than outright political rejection or a no prizes policy \u2013 you\u2019re co-opted by the system, even if you treat that ironically or angrily.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-22T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Tuesday afternoon at Wembley Stadium. The stands are empty and the place is quiet. A group of schoolchildren on a tour of the ground emerge and stomp through the press seats, briefly stopping to peer around and take a few pictures, but even they are not making much noise. Now and then, music pumps out as technicians put the sound system through its paces before the FA Cup final. Otherwise, though, people are behaving like tourists who have wandered into a precious old church: respectful, hushed, flushed while apologising to the member of security who chastises anyone for ignoring the \u201ckeep off the grass\u201d sign.</p> <p>This is the calm before the storm and Peter Beadle is in a contemplative mood as he stands by the side of the pitch and drinks it all in. \u201cYou look around and see where our fans are going to be and they will almost be filling up one quarter of the ground,\u201d Hereford Football Club\u2019s manager says and, even though Beadle claims to prefer the old twin towers to the arch, he has a nice line about one of his players being unable to wipe the grin off his face when the team bus arrived at Wembley.</p> <p>Hereford are here and they do not quite believe it. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/dec/19/hereford-united-wound-up-high-court\">Reborn and revitalised</a> after their proud history as Hereford United came to an angry, tearful end <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/dec/19/hereford-united-wound-up-high-court\">when they were put into liquidation at the end of 2014</a>, they will be cheered on by 20,000 supporters when they face Morpeth Town, who finished fourth in the First Division of the Northern Football League, in Sunday\u2019s FA Vase final.</p> <p>They have risen from the ashes of financial oblivion with a new name and a new identity. After all the turmoil, a fresh start beckoned last summer. The Hereford United Supporters Club set about starting a new club and, with the backing of four local benefactors, they registered to play in the Midlands Football League, in the ninth tier of the English game, and their first season as a phoenix club has been a remarkable tale of success and redemption.</p> <p>Beadle was asked to return, having been let go after a brief caretaker manager spell in the 2013-14 season, and although he had to put a squad together from scratch, using nine pre-season friendlies to assess new players, Hereford have won the league with 108 points, earning promotion to the Southern League Division One South and West. With the Herefordshire County Cup and Midland Football League Cup already in the bag, the quadruple is on.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"032ef5ffda90387f610155312f34a97ea6689e14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/032ef5ffda90387f610155312f34a97ea6689e14/0_46_4090_2454/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hereford FC Manager Peter Beadle, Captain Joel Edwards, right, and Pablo Haysham pose with of the FA Vase at Wembley Stadium.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hereford FC Manager Peter Beadle, Captain Joel Edwards, right, and Pablo Haysham pose with of the FA Vase at Wembley Stadium.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tony Marshall/The FA via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Neither Hereford club has ever played at Wembley. It means a lot and fans are coming from far and wide to see their team. One supporter has travelled from Hong Kong and the father of Hereford\u2019s captain, Joel Edwards, has flown over from Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit surreal with all the buildup but now we\u2019re here reality is kicking in,\u201d Edwards says.</p> <p>\u201cThey have to overcome that,\u201d Beadle says but he knows it will not be easy. Forget Wembley, reality was money problems, hated owners, fan boycotts and unpaid bills and wages not so long ago. It reached an inevitable conclusion when Andrew Lonsdale, who had become the most public director, failed to produce a \u00a31m proof of funding required to stave off liquidation, his complaints that he had been held up in traffic on his way to court falling on deaf ears.</p> <p>\u201cIf you don\u2019t get paid, what do you do?\u201d Edwards, Hereford born and bred, says. \u201cThere were people with responsibilities. For them not to get paid, it was shocking. With families it\u2019s hard. The PFA stepped in a bit and Steve Niblett, the photographer here, helped auction stuff for a bit of charity. It was dribs and drabs, whatever we could get. My family and friends are all fans and they hated it.\u201d</p> <p>Attendances at Edgar Street had fallen into the low hundreds and the ground was in a state of disrepair. Some players slept on camp beds at the stadium. Yet Hereford have had the seventh highest attendance in non-league football this season and the feel-good factor is back. Under-16s have had to pay only \u00a31 for their Wembley tickets and Edgar Street looks good again.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the things we have noticed this year is how many young people have supported us,\u201d Beadle says. \u201cThe club have made a big effort to bring new supporters in, we have had players going out to schools so the young supporters have now made that bond with the players and I am sure a lot of them have said to their parents \u2018I really want to go\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>There is a determination never to let disaster strike again. A crucial sense of community has been restored. Beadle is a part-time manager and a full-time parent, looking after his two children while his wife goes to work, and the players have day jobs. Edwards used to be a full-time professional; now the squad features roofers, teachers and even a barista. \u201cThe lad who works in the coffee shop says there is a lot more income in the shop now he is at Hereford,\u201d Edwards, 24, says.</p> <p>Hereford have not lost every link with history. Ronnie Radford, whose 30-yard rocket toppled Newcastle United in the FA Cup in 1972, will be in the crowd, while Hereford\u2019s supporters will be treated to the sight of their mascot, a prize bull called Hawkesbury Ronaldo, being paraded around the pitch 30 minutes before kick-off.</p> <p>\u201cIf he paid a pound for every pound he weighed it would be expensive because he is a big boy,\u201d Beadle says. \u201cHe is a true beast. Obviously the old cattle market used to be outside the ground. It should be and will be a huge celebration. And the big cherry on the cake will be if we pick up the trophy at the end.\u201d</p>",

Leicester know more about winning that gong than anyone, but they were destroyed by a ravenous club on a mission. Worse still \u2013 at least for England \u2013 they lost Manu Tuilagi to a hamstring injury in the 20th minute. The limp and the look on the face did not bode well for Eddie Jones, as he assesses options for the England tour to Australia.</p> <p>Perhaps even more concerning for Jones \u2013 and certainly for Saracens \u2013 was an injury to Owen Farrell in the second half, as the game meandered to its conclusion as a revival by Leicester after the break hinted for a moment at an impossible comeback. Farrell took two blows to his ribs in the space of a few seconds and was in evident pain as he left the field on the hour. If he is lost for the final, Saracens will curse the need for a second half, even if they reasserted themselves in the final quarter.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/18/saracens-sweep-honours-premiership-awards-alex-goode-maro-itoje\">Saracens sweep honours at Premiership end-of-season awards night</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Because in the first half, they had done all they needed to. They were brutal in defence and deadly on the relatively rare occasions they attacked. For a semi-final it was a painfully one-sided opening period. Which is not to say Leicester were quite awful, although they did become increasingly desperate as that first 40 unwound.</p> <p>Indeed, the Tigers ripped into Saracens from the off. It seemed then as if Saracens were suffering a hangover from Lyon after all. In the first minute, Peter Betham tore away down the left, then Ben Youngs broke round the fringes of the next ruck to send Tuilagi to the posts. How they celebrated. But JP Doyle referred that ruck to the TMO and Dom Barrow was caught handling the ball on the floor. No try.</p> <p>The scare woke Saracens up. Some brilliant off-loading down the left paved the way for more through the middle, Schalk Brits feeding George Kruis feeding Will Fraser, who galloped to the line. That was in only the fourth minute, but still Leicester kept running at their hosts, despite the brutal defence. Their approach this season has been notable for an added emphasis on ambition. Running out of their own 22 was ambitious indeed against this lot. Everything had to be spot on, and it was not.</p> <p>Owen Williams put in a little chip that might have sat up for Telusa Veainu, if it had bounced one way, but instead it did so for Chris Wyles. After a bit of footwork, the winger was away for the game\u2019s second try. It was in the chase that Tuilagi\u2019s hamstring went.</p> <p>The prospects were bleak for Leicester, and all the more so five minutes later. Saracens worked a beautiful \u2013 and all too rare \u2013 try from a scrum, finished in deadly fashion by Chris Ashton: 21-0; 25 minutes.</p> <p>Farrell extended the lead with a penalty before the most insulting of the afternoon\u2019s tries befell the Tigers. Youngs threw a horrible pass to Betham, which Wyles intercepted on his own 22, whence he ran in on the stroke of half-time.</p> <p>At 31-0, there was almost no point returning for the second half and the Saracens of the first half were, indeed, absent after half-time. Leicester struck in the first minute of the second period, just as they had in the first, and this time the try stood. Williams countered brilliantly from deep in his half and put Veainu away. Five minutes later, Williams landed a penalty; five minutes again and a tapped penalty by Youngs coaxed Fraser into a yellow-card offence. Leicester drove the resultant lineout over and suddenly the margin was a mere 14 points. They couldn\u2019t, could they?</p> <p>Leicester and the impossible have become synonymous this season, but, alas, this was the wrong sport. Saracens pulled themselves together enough to halt the revival there and then. The final half-hour drifted towards the inevitable. Farrell picked up his injury on the hour, and Charlie Hodgson came on for the last home appearance of his career, nailed two penalties and converted a late try for Ashton, brilliantly finished again.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m actually a bit confused,\u201d said Mark McCall. \u201cI thought last weekend our performance was incredible and it wasn\u2019t really reflected in the scoreboard. This week the scoreboard was probably too kind to us.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/18/saracens-sweep-honours-premiership-awards-alex-goode-maro-itoje\" title=\"\">Those</a> are the kind of standards Saracens have set for themselves. It might not have been perfect for 80 minutes, but few clubs in Europe are <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/16/saracens-european-champions-manchester-united-class-of-92\" title=\"\">capable of dismantling</a> Leicester as they did in that first half.</p> <p>So they progress to their latest final. This is to be their fifth appearance at the Twickenham showcase in the last seven seasons. With or without Farrell, it will take a remarkable performance from Exeter to deny them on this form.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-22T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Eight coaches in a little under four years at Watford under the reign of the Pozzo family may not bode well for Walter Mazzarri\u2019s long-term employment hopes but it has not stopped the 54-year-old from signing a three-year contract at Vicarage Road having been impressed by the Italian owners\u2019 vision for the club.</p> <p>Mazzarri, a former Internazionale and Napoli manager, will be expected to guide Watford into the top half of the Premier League, but, unlike his predecessors, has been given a lengthier deal with the task of turning Watford into a permanent fixture among the elite.</p> <p>Fenerbahce and Galatasaray had also expressed an interest in Mazzarri, according to his agent, Andrea D\u2019Amico, but the Pozzo family had been courting him for some time. They initially wanted Mazzarri to take over at Udinese but the timing had never been right for both parties. \u201cHe chose the quality of the project and his faith in the Pozzo family ahead of other offers,\u201d D\u2019Amico said, hinting that there may also have been an opportunity to replace Antonio Conte as Italy manager. \u201cHe will certainly do very well.\u201d</p> <p>One-year agreements or two-year deals with break clauses have been used by Gino Pozzo at Watford until now and for all of Mazzarri\u2019s faith in the ruthless owners and the comparatively long contract, the chances of a long-lasting partnership still appear slim. As the club\u2019s chief executive, Scott Duxbury, said on his appointment: \u201cThe progress and development of the club always remains the highest priority.\u201d</p> <p>While Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores was lauded from outside for guiding Watford to 13th, the Spaniard did himself no favours by starting the season impressively. They were seventh at the turn of the year before a dip in form meant they lost 12 of their final 20 games, having been defeated in five of the opening 18. Although Watford reached the FA Cup semi-finals, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/24/crystal-palace-watford-fa-cup-match-report\" title=\"\">to be beaten by Crystal Palace</a>, the arrest in form along with suggestions of a lack of discipline at the training ground <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/14/quique-sanchez-flores-watford-departure-explained\" title=\"\">forced the Pozzos to act</a>.</p> <p>Concerned by the downturn and the knock-on effect that might carry on to next season, the owners had decided some time before the campaign\u2019s conclusion to part with Flores. Mazzarri immediately became their first-choice target, but a lingering sense remains that if the season had been reversed and Flores started slowly but survived on the basis of a strong finish, he may have been allowed to continue.</p> <p>\u201cWalter has been the target of a number of approaches for his services, so we\u2019re delighted to secure him as head coach here at Watford,\u201d said Duxbury. \u201cWe\u2019re thoroughly looking forward to working with such a highly regarded coach.\u201d</p> <p>Mazzarri, who, like his Chelsea-bound compatriot Conte, has been taking English lessons, will start on 1 July, linking up with two former players in Valon Behrami and Miguel Britos. Behrami rarely featured under Flores and, frustrated by a lack of football, had angled for a move away in January. His relationship with Mazzarri at Napoli was strong and upon confirmation immediately tweeted that \u201cit was nice to wake up to good news\u201d.</p> <p>Watford\u2019s uncommon yet successful and sophisticated transfer policy will continue to be run by Gino Pozzo and the sporting director, Luke Dowling. While Mazzarri will have some input with regards recruitment, his primary task will be to bind the new acquisitions and the existing squad members together.</p> <p>A staunch user of 3-5-2, Mazzarri began his managerial career at Acireale in Serie C before joining Pistoiese and Livorno. Having spent one season at each, he moved to Reggina in 2004, lasting three years before switching to Sampdoria. His most successful spell has come at Napoli, winning the Coppa Italia in 2012 before leading the club to second in Serie A a season later and Champions League qualification for the first time. That team was most notable for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/feb/11/walter-mazzarri-napoli-lazio\" title=\"\">their pace and counterattacking</a>.</p> <p>After almost four seasons in Naples he was lured by the glamour of Inter but could only guide them to fifth in his first season. Despite signing a one-year extension, he was relieved of his duties a little over three months into his second season with the club in ninth, 12 points off the lead, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/14/internazionale-sack-walter-mazzarri\" title=\"\">replaced by Roberto Mancini</a>. Out of work for the past 18 months, the Watford job is Mazzarri\u2019s first outside Italy.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>The decision to retire from racing last year was tough. </strong>It was hard to accept I wasn\u2019t going to achieve my goal of getting on to the starting grid for a Formula 1 race. But I believe in gut feelings, and mine told me this journey was coming to an end.</p> <p><strong>Bernie Ecclestone supported me every step</strong> of the way during my career as a test and development driver. I got hounded when I supported him [after <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/14/female-f1-driver-bernie-ecclestone\">he recently said female F1 drivers</a> would not be taken seriously]. But I can only speak from experience.</p> <p><strong>I had an idyllic childhood </strong>on the west coast of Scotland. I hated reading \u2013 I was not a \u201cgood kid\u201d \u2013 but I was determined when I put my mind to something.</p> <p><strong>I loved the speed of go-karting,</strong> but didn\u2019t have a lot of natural talent. The first time I went out on the track I found it scary; other karts were flying past and bumping into me. I came into the pits and said I didn\u2019t like it and my dad said: \u201cOK, you\u2019ve got two options: you call it a day and put the kart back, or you go out and try to improve.\u201d I took the second option.</p> <p><strong>I have never put my helmet on </strong>and wondered what could go wrong. There\u2019s respect, but never fear. There are lots of things in life that have danger. I\u2019d never get on a horse \u2013 an animal is frightening \u2013 but that\u2019s a sport that society sees as something girls can do, while karting is not.</p> <p><strong>I never really thought about being a woman in a man\u2019s world.</strong> Then at the World Championships in 2000 I finished 15th. I was called on to the podium just for being a woman, and I realised things were going to be different. There have been pluses and minuses \u2013 I\u2019ve had it tougher than the guys in some ways, but I\u2019ve also had a lot more media attention.</p> <p><strong>My husband, Toto Wolff</strong> [executive director of the Mercedes F1 team] is Austrian; I\u2019m Scottish. His first language is German; mine is English. I love the culture clash. It can take the heat out of a conversation when you have to pause and say: \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t understand what you\u2019re saying.\u201d</p> <p><strong>I live in Switzerland,</strong> where they are very strict on speeding, so that can drive me mad. I don\u2019t mind being driven by my husband, but it can be tricky with other people. Because I\u2019m a racing driver, people often think they need to show how good they are and end up out of their comfort zone.</p> <p><strong>I never thought of myself as a role model,</strong> but I\u2019ve had so many messages from girls, women, mothers saying I was an inspiration. That led me to start my new initiative, <a href=\"https://daretobedifferent.org/\">Dare to be Different</a> [a foundation which aims to develop talent in male-dominated professions].</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/12/maria-de-villota-died-injuries-crash-claim-family\"><strong>Mar\u00eda de Villota</strong></a><strong>\u2019s death was a huge shock</strong> [the test driver died in 2013]. It was a stupid accident that should never have happened, and she was such a nice lady and a good friend. The one thing you can say is that she died doing something she loved, but it was tragic.</p> <p><strong>I think the way I look and the way I feel are very connected. </strong>As a woman you always wish that you had this or had that. But I\u2019m healthy and I wake up feeling good, so I\u2019m thankful.</p> <p><em>Susie Wolff is a presenter on Channel 4\u2019s Formula 1 coverage this season.

      "body": "<p>When Fisal Abo Karaa stepped off the train in Malm\u00f6\u2019s central station this time last year, exhausted after a long journey by train and boat, he looked like any other victim of Syria\u2019s terrible civil war.</p> <p>It wasn\u2019t until April, when Malm\u00f6\u2019s main shopping street was filled with the sound of Syrian bagpipes, drums and dancing that he made his presence felt. The opening of Jasmin Alsham, his new restaurant, was the most visible sign yet of an unexpected injection of Syrian money hitting Sweden\u2019s third city.</p> <p>Abo Karaa and his partners have invested a rumoured five million Swedish kronor (\u00a3400,000) converting what was once a Pizza Hut into a replica Damascene house. It is one of five Syrian restaurants to have opened in less than a year. \u201cThere are people saying that the Syrians have come and want to buy up everything,\u201d says Ibrahim, a hairdresser and member of the Nahawand shisha smoking club, a meeting place for the city\u2019s established Arab businessmen.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s many, many Syrian people who want to move money to Sweden,\u201d says Maher Alkhatib, from Damascus, who opened a restaurant last year. \u201cI know people in the Emirates, they are asking me, \u2018Find a good project so we can invest money\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>Abo Karaa\u2019s family owned four factories in Homs exporting paper tissues all over the Arab world. \u201cWe have lost in Syria millions of dollars, and many assets,\u201d his nephew Mohammed says.</p> <p>At the Nahawand shisha club, sharp-suited businessmen sit with friends, wives and their families under ersatz oil paintings of Ottoman-era potentates, sipping freshly squeezed juices and listening to a cabaret singer, who switches between emotive, plaintive song and raucous humour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"30ff26a5b4e5bcb622501557c66856447d51b77b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/30ff26a5b4e5bcb622501557c66856447d51b77b/0_256_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A brother and sister share a shisha pipe at Nahawand Shisha\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A brother and sister share a shisha pipe at Nahawand Shisha.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Malin Palm for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Among its members are some of the biggest success stories from three decades of Arab immigration into the city. Some 43% of Malm\u00f6\u2019s 317,000-strong population now have a foreign background, with the 40,000 Iraqi-born citizens and their descendants forming the largest single group. Together they have transformed a city which in the early 1980s was in such a deep slump after the collapse of its shipbuilding industry that one in seven inhabitants packed their bags and left, bringing the population as low as 230,000. \u201cMalm\u00f6 in the 1990s was a totally depressing place: everybody was miserable,\u201d remembers Christer Havung, whose caf\u00e9, Br\u00f6d och V\u00e4nner, sits next to Ibrahim\u2019s salon.</p> <p>The new arrivals have created an alternative city centre around M\u00f6llev\u00e5ng Square, with a busy vegetable market and shops selling Iranian, Iraqi and Lebanese goods. \u201cMalm\u00f6 has changed completely,\u201d says Jassim Almudafar, an Iraqi who has worked for the last 14 years for Almi, a state-run bank that gives loans to immigrants starting businesses. \u201cWhen I came to Sweden, there was no one who sold falafel, there was only sausage and hamburger. Now you have hardly anyone selling sausages, but maybe 50 or 60 falafel restaurants.\u201d</p> <p>The statistics are grim, however. The unemployment rate for foreign-born men between 16 and 64 in Malm\u00f6 is 30%, compared with 8% nationally. For foreign-born citizens between 18 and 24 it is 41%. The average annual income in 2014 for citizens born in Iraq was 53,000 kronor (\u00a34,000), according to Statistics Sweden, compared with 285,000 kronor (\u00a323,000) for those born in Sweden.</p> <p>Almudafar is sceptical. Many of those he has backed over the past 14 years have gone from nothing to owning major businesses, he points out. Greg Dingizian, a property developer who is one of Malm\u00f6\u2019s richest men, came to Sweden as a child from Baghdad. Officially unemployed people have jobs in the black economy, while many businesses under-report earnings to avoid Sweden\u2019s punitive taxes.</p> <p>\u201cImmigrants create growth \u2013 think how many start businesses,\u201d Almudafar stresses. He is particularly bullish on the latest wave of immigrants from Syria. \u201cThey\u2019re a little different,\u201d he says. \u201cThey have ambition. After just a few months in Sweden they already want to set something up.\u201d</p> <p>He has funded more than 50 new Syrian businesses and is in talks to fund hundreds more. There is a woman who wants to set up a factory making Syrian cheeses. There are bakeries, sweet-makers, dentists, IT consultants, building firms, a market gardener who plans to grow Syrian vegetables under glass, even a shop selling ouds, a sort of Arab lute.</p> <p>In October, Mohaymen Selim, a 22-year-old Iraqi, launched Hello Shisha, whose delivery vans ferry water pipes packed with fragrant tobacco anywhere in the city. The business, powered by a busy Facebook page and a website blasting out electro house, is booming.</p> <p>One of Almudafar\u2019s clients, Sabah Akkou, who opened Damaskus, a small backstreet restaurant near M\u00f6llev\u00e5ng, with her daughter Salma in April, says that Malm\u00f6\u2019s restaurant boom is something she has seen before. \u201cIt was the same thing in Egypt, as soon as the Syrians came there, restaurants and bakeries started opening up everywhere,\u201d she laughs. Akkou was a marketing manager for one of the biggest textile companies in Aleppo at the time the war broke out, but left almost everything behind when she fled to Egypt. She got the money to open the restaurant from her son, a research scientist at Mainz University in Germany.</p> <p>\u201cYou will notice that Syrian people are very different from other nationalities, because we like to work,\u201d she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t like to take anything from the government.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0dda9a41d348124c3881d563dfc30f45473cbe76\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0dda9a41d348124c3881d563dfc30f45473cbe76/0_340_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A live performance at Nahawand Shisha\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A live performance at Nahawand Shisha.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Malin Palm for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>",

In the film, directed by Paul Verhoeven, Huppert plays a woman who is brutally raped but deals with the fallout in a perverse and often darkly comical way.</p> <p>\u201cThe story shouldn\u2019t be taken as a realistic story,\u201d she said at a press conference. \u201cIt\u2019s not a statement about a woman being raped and accepting her rapist, that\u2019s not what it\u2019s about. It should be taken as more of a fantasy. The fantasy is within yourself but it\u2019s not necessarily something that you want to happen. It\u2019s something that you couldn\u2019t confess. It\u2019s in your inner thoughts and of course, Paul Verhoeven projects that on screen but it doesn\u2019t mean that it happens to all women in the world. It happens to that woman in particular. It\u2019s not trying to make a general statement and I think when you watch the film, that\u2019s the way you take it.\u201d</p> <p>The film, which the Guardian\u2019s Xan Brooks described as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/21/elle-review-paul-verhoevens-brazen-revenge-comedy-is-a-dangerous-delight\">\u201cendlessly disturbing\u201d</a>, is based on the acclaimed novel Oh... by Philippe Djian, and its author defended the central character\u2019s frequently bizarre behaviour.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"102826612f7e3442c3ce9e4d7af66f1c58912e70\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/102826612f7e3442c3ce9e4d7af66f1c58912e70/0_38_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Isabelle Huppert and Paul Verhoeven (R) pose during the photocall for Elle.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Isabelle Huppert and Paul Verhoeven (R) pose during the photocall for Elle.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Julien Warnand/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p> \u201cShe\u2019s just someone who tries to not obey codes,\u201d Djian said. \u201cShe tries to be free. It\u2019s her own personal freedom. It\u2019s frightening because people don\u2019t like women to feel free. She wants to react how she likes without following societal codes.\u201d </p> <p>Verhoeven, who has made films in both the US - such as Basic Instinct and Showgirls - and Europe (Black Book and Turkish Delight), was originally going to make the film in the US but said that \u201cno American actress would take on such an amoral movie\u201d.</p> <p>Dijan added: \u201cAll these wonderful American actresses turned it down for reasons that are so foreign\u201d.</p> <p>Despite also being known for iconic sci-fi movies such as Total Recall and Robocop, Verhoeven is keen to stay grounded from now on.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m not so positive about the further development of all this science fiction stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a feeling that everything has been said and done and we should go back to normality. All these big superheroes and whatever, I don\u2019t know what kind of wet dream this is of the US but I feel that we have lost contact with normal people. The story of us is more interesting than that of a superhero.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Andy Murray is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/09/andy-murray-amelie-mauresmo-splits-coach\">looking for his 11th coach</a>, but how have his previous coaches raised his game? Few people are a better judge than Nick Bollettieri, a former paratrooper and self-taught tennis coach, who helped discover Andre Agassi, Monica Seles and Maria Sharapova and then turned them into world beaters. Among the most respected coaches on the Tour, the American first spotted Murray when he was 13 and has followed his career ever since. \u201cAndy\u2019s had 10 coaches,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I was introduced at the International Tennis Hall of Fame as the best coach, I said \u2018no, I\u2019m not the best coach, I may be one of them\u2019, but I hold the undisputed title of having eight wives. Andy holds the title of the most coaches.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/21/andy-murray-amelie-mauresmo-on-court-behaviour-split\">Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo: Andy Murray\u2019s on-court behaviour played part in split</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>The early years Judy Murray, Leon Smith and Pato \u00c1lvarez </strong></p> <p>Murray credits his mother, Judy, with developing the fundamentals of his game and some of his variety. Judy brought in Smith from 1998 and then later sent her son to Spain in 2002 where he met \u00c1lvarez. \u201cI believe in the beginning it was very important for Andy to keep the ball in play because I think [it suited] his temperament,\u201d Bollettieri says. \u201cIf he had tried to be a big hitter in the beginning, he probably would have quit tennis. That Spanish way of keeping the ball in play and grinding it out was good to a certain extent but it\u2019s very difficult to become a champion like that today. But Judy, she\u2019s a winner.\u201d</p> <p><strong>June 2005 - April 2006 Mark Petchey </strong></p> <p>The former British Davis Cup player acted as something of a mentor. Under Petchey, Murray won his first ATP Tour title in San Jose and moved into the top 50. Unfortunately Petchey wasn\u2019t in San Jose as he was on holiday and Murray moved on in the summer of 2006. \u201cHe missed that San Jose win \u2013 if I was working with Andy, I\u2019d say, if you fire me, you have to pay me alimony,\u201d says Bollettieri.</p> <p><strong>July 2006 - November 2007 Brad Gilbert </strong></p> <p>Former world No4 Gilbert coached Agassi to world No1 and his hefty pay demands were met by the LTA for the majority of his time with Murray. \u201cBrad was certainly very different,\u201d says Bollettieri. \u201cThe thing about Brad is that even though his strokes were ugly, as he admits, he knew how to win by getting into people\u2019s minds. That\u2019s what made Gilbert a good player and a good coach.\u201d</p> <p><strong>2007 - 2011 Miles Maclagan and \u00c0lex Corretja </strong></p> <p>Murray hired another former British Davis Cup player in the mild-mannered but astute Maclagan, with whom he reached his career-high ranking of No2 and made <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2008/sep/07/usopentennis.andymurray\">his first grand slam final</a> at the 2008 US Open. Maclagan was part of the first \u201cTeam Murray\u201d, which included a physio and two fitness trainers and later the former world No2 Corretja. \u201cI don\u2019t believe you can reach the top of the banana tree in anything in life without a team,\u201d Bollettieri says. \u201cThe team must devote their life to the mission and everybody\u2019s got to do their part. It has worked for Andy.\u201d</p> <p><strong>January 2012 - March 2014 Ivan Lendl </strong></p> <p>At the end of 2011, Murray announced that former world No1 Lendl would be his new coach. The first of the so-called \u201csuper coaches\u201d, his arrival <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/aug/05/andy-murray-olympic-gold-great-britain\">brought Olympic gold in London</a>, quickly followed by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/sep/11/andy-murray-us-open-novak-djokovic1\">a first grand slam title</a> at the US Open in 2012 and then the holy grail of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/07/andy-murray-wimbledon-2013-novak-djokovic\">a Wimbledon title in 2013</a>. \u201cI believe that Lendl brought discipline,\u201d says Bollettieri. \u201cHe was basically telling Andy: \u2018bullshit, go out and do it now, I don\u2019t want to hear it\u2019. There\u2019s only one way that Lendl plays, to win. If a person is in front of the net, he\u2019s going to knock their head off, that\u2019s it, period. That\u2019s Lendl, no monkey business \u2013 I don\u2019t care if the crowd like me or don\u2019t like me, I don\u2019t give a shit, it\u2019s all about winning.\u201d</p> <p><strong>June 2014 - May 2016 Am\u00e9lie Mauresmo </strong></p> <p>Murray continued to set new trends with the appointment of former women\u2019s world No1 Mauresmo in the summer of 2014. Mauresmo helped Murray recover his form after back surgery (accompanied occasionally by Sweden\u2019s Jonas Bjorkman), winning seven titles, reaching two grand slam finals and regaining the world No2 ranking. \u201cI think Mauresmo brought calmness,\u201d Bollettieri says. \u201cAm<strong>\u00e9</strong>lie filled a great gap and she brought maybe a little more tenderness.\u201d</p> <p><strong>March 2016 - Jamie Delgado </strong></p> <p>Murray hired Delgado, another former Davis Cup player for Britain, to accompany him for 40 weeks a year, a constant as Mauresmo juggled with motherhood. After splitting with Mauresmo, Murray promptly <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/15/andy-murray-novak-djokovic-rome-claycourt\">won the title in Rome</a> with some of his best ever form, helped by a vastly-improved second serve. \u201cThat might be a combination of both Delgado and Mauresmo,\u201d Bollettieri says. \u201cThe second serve sat up and he was always on the defence. Right now, he\u2019s getting a lot more wrist-snap. He had to go for it. If he didn\u2019t, there\u2019s no way Andy would be doing what he\u2019s doing now.\u201d</p> <p><strong>And finally \u2026 Bollettieri\u2019s advice for Murray\u2019s next coach</strong></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m telling you if they come out and screw around with his technique and movement, it\u2019s going to hurt him. He has worked his backside off physically, he\u2019s gotten better mentally and strokes-wise, not too much [should] be done to that, in my opinion. Murray fights. Once in a while he\u2019ll look up and give you the fist, but that\u2019s him, man.\u201d</p>",

The producers and directors have been named in two defamation suits by the film\u2019s subject, David D\u2019Amato, who alleged they had damaged his character by portraying him as a \u201cdeviant\u201d. Both have been dismissed.</p> <p>New Zealand TV reporter David Farrier and fellow director Dylan Reeve\u2019s <a href=\"http://tickledmovie.com/\">documentary</a> alleges that Jane O\u2019Brien Media - which specialises in making videos wherein which young men tickle each other - is owned by D\u2019Amato, heir to the fortune amassed by famed New York insurance lawyer George D\u2019Amato. He denies \u201cassociation or ownership interest in Jane O\u2019Brien Media\u201d in one filing, a point the film-makers contended.</p> <p>When Farrier, co-director of Tickled and the primary defendant in both cases, began his investigation into Jane O\u2019Brien Media someone from the company declined an interview request on the grounds of Farrier\u2019s sexuality. \u201cAssociation with a homosexual journalist [presumably Farrier, who is gay] is not something we will embrace,\u201d emailed a representative from the all-male tickling league.</p> <p>Legal threats have dogged the movie prior to and throughout its production \u2013 links to Farrier\u2019s three-part expos\u00e9e on Jane O\u2019Brien Media have been removed from news sites. Farrier said he couldn\u2019t talk about legal aspects of the film in an email to the Guardian on Friday.

At the time his apartment was raided by the FBI in 2000, the then 38-year-old D\u2019Amato was a guidance counselor at West Hempstead high school on Long Island.</p> <p>More recently, people from Jane O\u2019Brien Media have attended festival screenings of the documentary, which was acquired by HBO Films for a June release. \u201cSundance security told me that [a Jane O\u2019Brien staffer] was there, but I didn\u2019t want to tell the audience,\u201d Farrier <a href=\"http://www.indiewire.com/article/tickled-doucmentary-david-farrier-true-false-lawsuit-20160308\">told IndieWire</a>. \u201cFrom what I understand, [during the screening] he made a lot of loud \u2018hurmph\u2019 noises and took extensive notes on a legal pad.\u201d</p> <p>At a festival attended by the Guardian, a man apparently attempting to take clandestine footage of the screening <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/08/tickled-documentary-review-david-farrier-cyberbullying\">using a camera in a coffee cup</a> was forcibly ejected from the proceedings.</p>",

      "body": "<h2>CHRISTINE AND THE QUEENS</h2> <p>Christine and The Queens is, in one sense, the stage name for H\u00e9lo\u00efse Letissier, a French pop singer who has been kicking around in her homeland for a couple of years but burst on to the global music scene with her stunning minimal pop LP Chaleur Humaine, a record filled with questioning, queer identities and Anglo-French inquisition. But live, it also becomes the catch-all term for an incredible show that combines a troupe of dancers, video and theatre, creating a spectacle you normally only see from headlining artists. This year she will have to make do halfway up the second stage at Latitude, her only confirmed UK festival so far.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Tilted by Christine and the Queens\">  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9RBzsjga73s\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>KEY TRACK:</strong> <strong>Tilted </strong></p> <p><strong>CATCH HER AT:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.latitudefestival.com/\"><strong>Latitude</strong></a></p> <h2>YOUNG THUG</h2> <p>Who knows how the most exciting rapper in the US will handle a big festival stage like Wireless. His live shows tend to be shambolic: the cross-dressing, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtRt6XxwR34\">lean-drinking</a>, self-professed stoner can often be seen wearing three different outfits and barely remembering his own lyrics. But when the energy is right, there is nothing else like it, huge weirdo Atlanta rap tracks boomed with the gusto of a man who has no limits. Could be something incredibly special, or a disaster.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Stoner by Young Thug.\">  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/j1cR-AW3Zf0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>KEY TRACK:</strong> <strong>Stoner</strong></p> <p><strong>CATCH HIM AT: </strong><a href=\"http://wirelessfestival.co.uk/\"><strong>Wireless</strong></a></p> <h2>JACK \u00dc</h2> <p>This is what happens when two of the biggest DJs team up for a laugh. Dubstep pioneer Skrillex and superstar producer Diplo, the mastermind behind Major Lazer and some of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s biggest hits, started Jack \u00dc a couple of years ago as a way for them to DJ together every six months or so. But what started as a party trick soon turned serious, and they have since released an album together, which features turns from AlunaGeorge, 2 Chainz, Missy Elliott and Justin Bieber on the huge hit Where Are \u00dc Now?. Now they\u2019re headlining the second stage at Reading and Leeds, so we can safely assume this is no longer a side project. They\u2019ve not played a big festival show like this before, so who knows what to expect, but Bieber will be in the country the week before to headline V Festival. Biebz be warned, if the Reading fans covered Panic! At The Disco in bottles of piss, imagine what they could do to you.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Where Are \u00dc Now? by Jack \u00dc\">  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/nntGTK2Fhb0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>KEY TRACK: Where Are \u00dc Now?</strong></p> <p><strong>CATCH THEM AT:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.readingfestival.com/\"><strong>Reading</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href=\"http://www.leedsfestival.com/\"><strong>Leeds</strong></a></p> <h2>AJ TRACEY</h2> <p>For more than a decade the grime genre was dominated by acts from east London who came of age in the early 00s. But in the last few years, young teenage MCs like Stormzy and Novelist have re-energised the scene, and opened its doors to the next generation. AJ Tracey is a west London fresh face who turned heads when he spat on the same beat as grime legend Kano and gave him a run for his money. For Tracey, music is a family affair, his dad was a Trinidadian rapper and his Welsh mother used to play jungle on pirate radio. He plays Rinse FM\u2019s youthful Born and Bred festival in June.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Spirit Bomb by AC Tracey video\">  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/VBND5nKfj5Q\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>KEY TRACK:</strong> <strong>Spirit Bomb</strong></p> <p><strong>CATCH HIM AT:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.bornandbredfestival.com/\"><strong>Born and Bred </strong></a></p> <h2>SKINNY GIRL DIET</h2> <p>Adored by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/01/the-slits-viv-albertine-punk-violence-domesticity\">Viv Albertine</a> and Kathleen Hanna, Skinny Girl Diet are three teenage girls from London who make riot grrrl punk that smacks of grunge rebellion and four-track tape recorders. The band\u2019s DIY attitude means they\u2019ve been allowed to develop away from press attention and let their sound evolve: their latest EP, Reclaim Your Life, sounds like Courtney Love being dragged through a particular angsty episode of My So-Called Life. Frankly, it\u2019s about time Latitude booked a band this bad-ass: those Father John Misty fans need to be shaken up a bit.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Burnout (live) by Skinny Girl Diet video\">  <iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-rq6ukfmCkA\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>KEY TRACK: Burnout </strong></p> <p><strong>CATCH THEM AT:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.latitudefestival.com/\"><strong>Latitude</strong></a></p> <h2>REJJIE SNOW</h2> <p>Rejjie grew up in Dublin, but it was a school trip to Atlanta, Georgia, that gave him a taste for hip-hop. He doesn\u2019t fit into any of the current British grime or hip-hop scenes, his flows are laid-back and reflective, he\u2019s got more in common with the likes of introspective west-coast rapper Earl Sweatshirt and sometime collaborator King Krule, a south London singer-songwriter. Despite a lack of radio play, Snow regularly sells out huge venues just by tweeting a link to his hardcore fanbase, so expect to be surrounded by a lot of people who know all the words to his \u201cNetflix and chill\u201d-inspired lyrics.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"Late again by Rejjie Snow video\">  <iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/fTOa3v50BKE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p><strong>KEY TRACK: Late Again</strong></p> <p><strong>CATCH HIM AT: </strong><a href=\"http://fielddayfestivals.com/line-up/\"><strong>Field Day</strong></a></p>",

Photographs of a life vest, parts of the plane\u2019s chairs and other wreckage were posted on Facebook.</p> <p>In France, investigators confirmed the data about smoke warnings that was first reported by the website <a href=\"http://avherald.com/h?article=4987fb09&amp;opt=0\">Aviation Herald</a>, while the French foreign minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said no theory on the cause of the crash has been ruled out.</p> <p>\u201cAt this time ... all theories are being examined and none is favoured,\u201d he said after meeting with relatives of victims.</p> <p>The warnings came at about 2.26am local time on Thursday, just before air traffic controllers lost contact with the plane, which plunged into the Mediterranean killing all 66 on board during a scheduled flight from Paris to Cairo.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfa0f07c3567a41769ac8bc31beba3f67a02426a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfa0f07c3567a41769ac8bc31beba3f67a02426a/0_75_2000_1201/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A life vest from EgyptAir flight MS804, shown in a picture posted on the Facebook page of the Egyptian armed forces spokesman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A life vest from EgyptAir flight MS804, shown in a picture posted on the Facebook page of the Egyptian armed forces spokesman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/davidlearmount\">David Learmount</a>, a consulting editor at Flight Global, said the data presented the beginning of a sequence of events that could be \u201cthe answer to what happened\u201d, but he could not confirm whether the fire was triggered by an act of terrorism or an electrical fault. </p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a report of smoke in the forward lavatory [and] a minute later there\u2019s smoke in the avionics bay, which is very worrying; and then two minutes later the flight control computers, one after the other, start to fail,\u201d Learmount told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme.</p> <p>\u201cNow the question we are left with is did this start with an ordinary electrical fault, a short circuit which started a fire, or was the fire started deliberately with a small explosion or an incendiary device?</p> <p>\u201cIt could still be terrorism but it looks as if the aircraft went out of control because the controls were literally burning up.</p> <p> But we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s terrorism that started this or an electrical fault.\u201d<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/debris-confirmed/giv-12515yhRDxbG9LwgM/\" data-alt=\"EgyptAir locator map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/debris-confirmed/giv-12515yhRDxbG9LwgM/\">EgyptAir locator map</a> </figure>  <p>Shaker Kelada, the former head of Egypt\u2019s plane crash investigations unit, cautioned against reading too much into the data<strong>. \u201c</strong>Alone, it means nothing. It\u2019s the last four seconds at the end of the transmission. If it\u2019s an indication of anything it could be a followup to an explosion. It could also happen if someone smokes in the cockpit or the bathroom. But there was no warning in the cockpit.</p> <p>\u201cThis could be the first indication of a bomb. Or it can be unrelated. Since we don\u2019t have any further information we cannot tell anything.\u201d</p> <p>Greece\u2019s lead air accident investigator Athanasios Binis said on Saturday that the search had been narrowed to a 900-square mile area, approximately 290km north of Alexandria. \u201cThat is where we are focusing and the sea there is between 7,500-10,000ft deep. Our priority, now, is to find the black boxes and as much wreckage as possible.\u201d </p> <p>Investigators were still unclear whether the plane\u2019s sudden drop in altitude was controlled or not, he added. \u201cWe still don\u2019t know how it dropped from 37,000ft to 15,000ft or whether the pilot had tried to control it. It seems that they had a series of technical malfunctions before they lost control but what caused that we have yet to discover.\u201d</p> <p><br /></p> <p>The passengers included 30 Egyptians, 15 French citizens, two Iraqis, two Canadians, and citizens from Algeria, Belgium, Britain, Chad, Portugal, Saudi Arabia and Sudan. They included a boy and two babies. Seven crew members and three security personnel were also on board.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/may/19/egyptair-flight-ms804-paris-cairo-missing-video-explainer\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4jc5c\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2508636\"            data-video-name=\"Missing EgyptAir flight: what we know so far \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"guardian.co.uk\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-573d71e8e4b094bc5b17a61c\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/21/160519EgyptAirExplainersSatUpdate2_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/21/160519EgyptAirExplainersSatUpdate2_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/21/160519EgyptAirExplainersSatUpdate2.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/21/160519EgyptAirExplainersSatUpdate2_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/21/160519EgyptAirExplainersSatUpdate2_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/may/19/egyptair-flight-ms804-paris-cairo-missing-video-explainer\">Missing EgyptAir flight: what we know so far</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Ayrault, who was joined by Egypt\u2019s ambassador to France at the meeting with passengers\u2019 relatives on Saturday, said: \u201cI strongly emphasised the desire of the French authorities to tell the entire truth about what happened.

The everyday struggles of the forgotten \u201chidden army\u201d of female volunteers during the second world war, all carefully detailed in quadruplicate monthly reports, have been stored away in dusty boxes for more than 60 years.</p> <p>Now the Royal Voluntary Services (RVS) \u2013 formerly the Women\u2019s Voluntary Services (WVS) \u2013 is launching a fundraising campaign to digitise the archive and offer public access to some 30,000 pages of documents, written by female volunteers who gained the nickname \u201cthe army that Hitler forgot\u201d.</p> <p>The RVS ambassador, actress Patricia Routledge, called it a \u201cthrilling project\u201d. She said: \u201cThis stuff has been in boxes for years and yet they [the reports] are some of the most important historical documents we have in modern British history.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a time, during the second world war, which altered the status of women in society for all time, and it was precisely because of the sort of activities that are detailed in this archive.\u201d</p> <p>She said the women had volunteered at a tremendously difficult time for them and their families. \u201cThe skills that were shown were quite extraordinary.\u201d Routledge, who remembers sleeping in a cellar bunker during the war as a young girl in Merseyside, where some of the worst bombing took place, is fronting the Hidden Histories of A Million Wartime Women project, <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1419318354/hidden-histories-of-a-million-wartime-women\">a crowdfunding campaign</a> to raise the \u00a325,000 the charity requires to painstakingly photograph and post each report online. \u201cThe women of the WVS made great sacrifices for this country, but the breadth of their contribution has been hidden from view until now,\u201d she said. \u201cWe hope that, in making their stories available to everybody, the value of their contribution will gain the recognition it deserves.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eed404ff8d73f688865008f325fca43990244d7d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eed404ff8d73f688865008f325fca43990244d7d/129_32_3020_1813/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Toddlers evacuated by donkey cart, Lyme Regis, in 1945.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Evacuee toddlers in a WVS donkey cart, Lyme Regis, Dorset, in 1945.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Royal Voluntary Service</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The million women \u2013 one in 10 British women were members \u2013 who joined the WVS between 1938 and 1945 were of all ages.

All these different women with different backgrounds writing their bit.</p> <p>\u201cThere was one woman in the Isle of Wight who always put a little poem at the end, the poetry was a little bit dubious, but the sentiment good.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cPeople forget about the salvage operations on the home front. It was the WVS running them. In Birmingham the WVS ladies were running 89 dumps. For six years we have been sorting, protecting and preserving tens of thousands of pieces of fragile paper to get to a point where we can start to capture and share these remarkable stories with everyone.\u201d</p> <p>If the charity hits the target for the project, work will begin in the autumn.</p> <p><em>To find out more and donate, visit </em><a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1419318354/hidden-histories-of-a-million-wartime-women\"><em>Kickstarter</em></a>.</p> <p><strong>Bath, April 1942</strong></p> <p>When the first \u201call clear\u201d sounded as we heard that three unofficial halls had opened to take the people off the streets WVS volunteers went in immediately and took care of the homeless \u2026 Unfortunately the raiders returned in about an hour\u2019s time and the work during the next raid was no easy task.</p> <p>At the request of the controller, the Ford vans were used for carrying food to demolition and rescue squads and householders.</p> <p>At our office we improvised a canteen, feeding some 300 a day\u2026 For 11 days we worked as a canteen, all workers gladly offered their services. We served approximately 3,500 meals.</p> <p><strong>Portsmouth, November 1943</strong></p> <p>Our dog hair expert attended a demonstration of the spinning and knitting of dogs\u2019 combings held at Harrods on 18 November by the Hailsham WVS at the request of the Board of Trade. Wonderful results are obtained from these combings and the whole process was shown, from the raw state to the final garment. The wool is warm and hard-wearing \u2013 Portsmouth\u2019s contributions were highly praised.</p> <p>We hope to have some garments on show soon \u2026</p> <p><strong>Andover, April 1943</strong></p> <p>During Aid to China week, as a frivolous interlude we raffled a banana \u2026 Unfortunately the banana showed signs of a short life and the raffle was closed quickly, having realised 15 shillings.</p> <p><strong>Sheffield, December 1940.</strong></p> <p>One of our elderly canteen volunteers \u2013 who had the previous week been in the office to see if she could do night work \u2013 was in the town hall WVS office the morning after Sunday night\u2019s raid fitting herself out with necessary clothes. We asked if we could do anything for her and she replied that if we could send two wires to her soldier sons she would be grateful. Our secretary took the addresses and the messages down. The wires both said \u201cBombed out but still smiling, Mother\u201d</p> <p>She had no home, no clothes, no money but her desire to avoid worrying her sons as shown in her message was, we considered, almost heroic.</p> <p><strong>Isle of Wight, October 1942</strong></p> <p>Collection of chestnuts has been excellent, and rose hips are still coming in. Our junk room is also receiving all kinds of metal in addition to the usual salvage which comes in daily. The entrance to the junk room was facilitated, thanks to Hitler, as one large window disappeared through blast, and the amount of salvage that \u201cwalked in by itself\u201d was quite remarkable.</p> <p><strong>Newbury, Berkshire, August 1943</strong></p> <p>A very charming if somewhat unusual letter was received at the Newbury Rural District WVS from a soldier who had lost his wife. He wrote saying he had heard what excellent work the WVS did, and how kind and helpful they were, so he ventured to write and ask if the WVS could introduce him to someone who would eventually become his wife and a mother to his two children. He was terribly lonely and felt he could not exist without female company. The letter is having careful attention.</p>",

      "body": "<p>My apologies for the length of time since I last gave you an update. I hope that normal service is now restored.</p> <p>Last time (in March) I asked whether the recent increased appearance of anagrams in the Quick puzzles was generally welcome or not. There were a few responses in the comments online, including an enthusiastic thumbs up on behalf of <strong>sardanista</strong>\u2019s 8-year-old granddaughter. It seems she enjoys anagrams greatly and, indeed, does most of the other Quick clues as well, provided doing so does not require specialised adult experience. </p> <p>However, I also received 44 emails in response. This was clearly not a \u2018Marmite issue\u2019 (you either love or hate the very British savoury spread made from yeast and vegetable extracts, which is too salty and makes the gums and roof of the mouth sting painfully). </p> <p>There were 15 emails in the \u2018Vote No\u2019 camp, but of these only seven were actual card-carrying, diehard members of the Hate Party. The others said that they were OK, but only if they were much more strictly rationed. By contrast, of the 29 voters supporting the Love Party ticket, 18 could only be described as besotted anagram fans, unable to get enough of the stuff, while the others said that they liked them but perhaps there were too many bunched together. </p> <p>I shall be sitting down with my advisers shortly to discuss how the data should be interpreted and what policy decisions conclusions should be drawn.</p> <p>_____</p> <p>As some of you will already know, Gordon Holt (Otterden) died at the end of April. He started setting puzzles for us in 2013, when he was crossword editor of the New Statesman, to which he continued to contribute. He had a prolonged period of illness and recuperation in 2014 but was then back and in good form. He chose his nom de plume because a holt is the den of an otter. An obit by his friend and collaborator Maskarade was published online on 3 May [see <a href=\"https://viewer.gutools.co.uk/crosswords.2016/may/03/gordon-holt-obituary\">www.theguardian.com/crosswords.2016/may/03/gordon-holt-obituary</a>]. This obit was then also published in the paper itself on 16 May.</p> <p>_____</p> <p>There seem to be new names appearing in first-past-the-post prizes in the Genius stakes. I know (though at the time in question I am normally asleep) that there have been continuing problems with the launch of the Genius puzzle in recent months. It is the last Guardian crossword puzzle that still has to be entered \u2018manually\u2019 in to the production computer system and, since the Guardian is not willing to pay for someone to sit up overnight just to check the uploading of one puzzle, it takes some time on the first Monday of each month to discover what, if anything, has gone wrong and for the morning shift to find out why it happened and to put it right.</p> <p> As a result, the March offering by Vlad (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2016/mar/07/genius-crossword-no-153\">No 153</a>) attracted only six correct entries on the first day: M1F at 05:05 and ID@gmail leading the field at 05:05 and 08:44 respectively. There were 212 entries by the deadline and the prize winner was Alan Roberts in New Zealand.</p> <p>Last month\u2019s puzzle (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords/2016/apr/04/genius-crossword-no-154\">No 154</a> by Monk) had 30 entries on the first day with \u2018mic\u2019 in Australia first in at 02:06 and the new bookies\u2019 favourite M1F at 02:23. Peter Scrace, also in Australia, won the April prize, as well as being the third correct entry received at 04:2.</p> <p>If you have any technical problems with our crossword service, please email <a href=\"mailto:userhelp@theguardian.com\">userhelp@theguardian.com</a>.

      "body": "<p>A surge has been recorded in violent crimes against London taxi drivers, prompting a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/may/17/uber-smartphone-app-cab-taxi\">fresh spat between Uber and black cabs</a> over who is to blame.</p> <p>New figures from Scotland Yard reveal that violent offences against taxi drivers have risen by more than two-thirds, from 856 in 2014 to 1,403 last year. Black-cab drivers have blamed Uber for the increase, alleging that \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/24/uber-drivers-boris-johnson-knowledge-black-cabs\">poor English</a>\u201d and the inadequate street knowledge of drivers working for the taxi-hailing app company have generated so much frustration among passengers that it has led to violence.</p> <p>Uber has dismissed the criticism, explaining that many private-hire drivers had switched to working with Uber because of the app\u2019s safety features, with every trip tracked by GPS and electronically recorded .</p> <p>The Metropolitan police figures show that since 2012 \u2013 when Uber arrived in London \u2013 the total number of violent crimes has doubled from 709 in 2012. Most of these cases were of common assault, followed by cases of assault with injury, and then harassment.</p> <p>When sexual offences and robbery are added, the total number of offences against taxi drivers almost doubles, from 884 in 2012 to 1,586 in 2015.</p> <p>The Licensed Taxi Drivers Association (LTDA) has attributed the rise in attacks against drivers to the increase in Uber vehicles on London\u2019s streets. Uber has seen massive growth in London, with around 25,000 drivers <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/27/how-uber-conquered-london\">currently signed up</a> to the app, compared with 10,000 at the start of 2015.</p> <p>An LTDA spokesperson said: \u201cThey [Uber drivers] are untrained. Many have poor English skills and no idea of the topography of the area they are working in. This, obviously, leads to disputes with passengers. The low standard of their driving also causes many conflicts with other road users and a combination of all this, plus low dispute resolution skills, contributes to the figures.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/09/london-black-cab-drivers-reject-uber-olive-branch\">London black-cab drivers reject Uber olive branch</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tom Elvidge, general manager of Uber in London, said: \u201cOne of the main reasons thousands of private-hire drivers have switched to working with Uber is because of the safety features on our app. For example, all Uber users are registered with us, every trip is tracked by GPS and electronically recorded, and there\u2019s no exchange of cash.

      "body": "<p>Turn off the lights and let the horror begin. Paul Verhoeven\u2019s new film, Elle, is an outrageous black comedy, volatile and deadly; a film that opens up with a sexual assault and then cleans off the blood ahead of a posh restaurant dinner. \u201cI suppose I was raped,\u201d Michelle (Isabelle Huppert) casually remarks to her friends, just as the waiter swoops in with a magnum of champagne. A guest at the table flicks a nervous glance at the bottle. He says, \u201cMaybe wait a few minutes before popping that.\u201d</p> <p>Likewise one perhaps needs to pause before trumpeting Elle as one of the best pictures in this year\u2019s Cannes competition, if only because its implications are so problematic they require more time to be processed. But there\u2019s no denying that, in the moment at least, the film is utterly gripping and endlessly disturbing. In carving a hazardous path through hackneyed genre territory, Elle never flags, barely stumbles. Verhoeven, I fear, is pointing his film straight to Hell. He brazenly dares us to stick with him for the ride.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/21/isabelle-huppert-elle-rape-cannes\">Isabelle Huppert: Elle is not about a woman 'accepting her rapist'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Playing the role of Michele Leblanc, a moneyed Paris games executive, Huppert gives a performance of imperious fury, holding the audience at bay, almost goading us to disown her. Audaciously, Elle presents her not so much as a victim but as the casualty of a world she is very much a part of; maybe (still more troublingly) an accessory to. Inside her sleek office, Michele strolls disinterestedly past a scantily-clad model striking a brutalised pose. Her top-selling game allows its user to take the role of a hulking orc rapist, penetrating a damsel from behind with a snaking tentacle.</p> <p>If that weren\u2019t enough, Michele is revealed to be the daughter of Charles Leblanc, a notorious 1970s serial killer, now safely behind bars. There is even a suggestion that she was somehow involved in his crimes. According to Michele, her father was \u201ca monster\u201d; in the view of her mother (Judith Magre) he was \u201cno more than a man\u201d. The film\u2019s implicit suggestion is that human beings can be both.</p> <p>Perish the thought that Verhoeven\u2019s a safe pair of hands. The director prides himself on discombobulating his audience; maybe even discombobulating himself. In his time, the Dutch provocateur has conspired to seduce the Hollywood mainstream with Basic Instinct, flummox it with Starship Troopers and give it a ghastly cold shower with 1995\u2019s Showgirls. Elle, however, may just be his most maniacal work to date, a film that runs boldly up and down the tonal bandwidth, zig-zagging from pitch-black horror to devilish satire to light domestic comedy and then back again.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2016/may/20/cannes-2016-peter-bradshaw-festival-verdict-award-predictions\">Cannes 2016: Peter Bradshaw's festival verdict and award predictions</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For lengthy periods, in fact, Verhoeven\u2019s film appears to forget the rape altogether. Michele clears the broken crockery from the floor, sinks into a bath and then proceeds with her life. She has a demanding job to attend to; family problems to address. She is enraged by her milksop son and his bullying pregnant girlfriend. She worries about her vampish mum, who has decided she wants to marry her gigolo. She\u2019s having an ill-advised affair with her colleague\u2019s foursquare husband. But all the while the memory of the assault sits quietly in the room, like unstable nitroglycerin beside the cheese-board. Time and again, we catch its full horror in the corner of our eye. Michele, for her part, is drawn back to it too.</p> <p>What an electrifying film to close this year\u2019s Cannes competition. If the delegates imagined they would be sent off with something gentle and affirming, they had another think coming. They sat down in the dark and received a slap in the face, a blatant provocation, a set of jump leads hooked on to their chests. Elle is uproarious, galvanic and guaranteed to spark debate. All at once it as though this year\u2019s Cannes, a whisker away from the finish line, has just roared back into blazing, angry life.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The sign outside says \u201cHappy Hours\u201d. It has a picture of a woman\u2019s cleavage and advertises *Hookah* *Belly Dancing* *Live Music*. It doesn\u2019t advertise death, which is what I\u2019m here for. </p> <p>It\u2019s a rainy Wednesday evening and I\u2019m at a Moroccan restaurant in Times Square to attend the New York franchise of the <a href=\"http://deathcafe.com\">Death Caf\u00e9</a>. </p> <p>The Death Caf\u00e9 is a global movement in which strangers gather over tea and cake \u2013 or, in this case, tea and couscous \u2013 to discuss death. It\u2019s not a support group; the point is simply to encourage more frank conversation.</p> <p>Started by Jon Underwood in 2011, the first Death Caf\u00e9 was based out of his East London house. Since then, more than 1,000 cafes have popped up in 90 countries. Anyone can host a Death Caf\u00e9 and they\u2019ve been held in a variety of venues, from cemeteries to yurts to, well, Moroccan belly-dancing restaurants.</p> <p>Nancy Gershman and Audrey Pellicano started the <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Death-Cafe-New-York-City/\">monthly New York event</a> in 2013. Audrey is a registered nurse and Nancy is a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.artforyoursake.com\">memory artist</a>\u201d. She works with terminally ill patients and their families to create \u201cdreamscapes\u201d, photoshopped montages of memories that people don\u2019t have pictures of. Sometimes she also creates pictures of memories people wish they had been able to create (she recently created an image of a couple on the cruise they\u2019d always meant to take). </p> <p>There are four people sitting around a table when I arrive: Nancy and three octogenarians. Nancy points me to a neighboring empty table. The Death Caf\u00e9 is an intimate affair; you sit at tables of four rather than chatting to the whole group. Soon, two more people soon arrive: a young guy, K, in his early 20s, and M, in her 50s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f90a648c224b8dfe795d914aed1978f1b599b57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f90a648c224b8dfe795d914aed1978f1b599b57/0_0_3000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An art piece by Nancy Gershman.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"800\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An art piece by Nancy Gershman.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nancy Gershman</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It\u2019s K\u2019s second Death Caf\u00e9; he\u2019d heard about it in a class at college. Although young, he\u2019s experienced a series of deaths in quick succession. The latest had just been an acquaintance, nevertheless it had affected him more than he\u2019d been expecting. </p> <p>\u201cHave you ever had that?\u201d he asked, leaning forward. \u201cFeeling sadder than you really should about someone you don\u2019t really know?\u201d The guy had been 27, a talented musician who died of a heroin overdose. K hadn\u2019t been able to go to the funeral in Brooklyn but found closure in other rituals, like listening to the man\u2019s music, or sharing memories on his Facebook wall. \u201cWhat do you think about that?\u201d I ask. \u201cDigital afterlives? The way we live on now in social media?\u201d I\u2019m 33, old enough for social media mourning to feel weird. But K, a decade younger, just shrugged. \u201cIt\u2019s normal.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Americans think there\u2019s a pill for everything. They try and avoid death. They think they can buy their way out.</p> <footer> <cite>D, a palliative care worker</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Conversation at the Death Caf\u00e9 isn\u2019t moderated or structured. You simply sit and talk. Or sit and don\u2019t talk. There was, after K stopped speaking, an uncomfortable silence. Attempting to fill it, I turned to M: \u201cSo, um, do you come here often?\u201d It\u2019s M\u2019s second time as well. Her mother recently died, she felt like she was getting older, like she was \u201cnext in line\u201d, and so had started thinking about death more.</p> <p> Another slightly morose silence ensued.</p> <p>And then D breezed in. In her mid 30s, she was wearing a bright blue skirt and exuding an upbeat, somewhat frenetic, energy. Which seems at odd with her job: she\u2019s a fellow in palliative care at a Manhattan hospital. She explains to terminally ill patients and their families that nothing more can be done and prepares them for death.</p> <p>D is Bulgarian but has worked in the US for the last 10 years. America\u2019s different from Europe, she tells the table. Americans think there\u2019s a pill for everything. They try and avoid death. They think they can buy their way out. American kids aren\u2019t educated about death. Look at the fairytales \u2013 they\u2019re all sanitized. You know what happens in the Little Mermaid really? She dies. A painful death. The prince finds another woman. He doesn\u2019t care. That\u2019s real life. </p> <p>In the last three years, D estimates, she\u2019s seen 80 or so people die. \u201cYou start to know when it\u2019s about to happen,\u201d she said, spooning couscous onto her plate. \u201cTheir toes start curling, their skins starts changing, their hands go a little purple.\u201d She pauses to eat. \u201cThey start breathing quickly and irregularly.\u201d There is one nursing home she\u2019s heard of where a cat called Oscar knows exactly when someone\u2019s died. He goes and sits next to them as soon as they\u2019ve shuffled off their mortal coil. \u201cI guess he likes the smell.\u201d</p> <p>Death brings out both the best and the worst in people, and D has seen it all. There are old people with rent-stabilized apartments whose kids insist on keeping them alive, skewered with tubes, so they can hang on to those apartments. And then there are the scammers who befriend lonely old people so that they can gain their trust and rob them. \u201cThey especially like people with dogs,\u201d D says. \u201cBecause when the person goes to hospital they say \u2013 here are my keys, feed my dog \u2013 and then they go and steal everything.\u201d </p> <p>Some of D\u2019s work includes home visits and these take her from penthouses on Park Avenue to bedsits in the Bronx. \u201cThere was one guy,\u201d she recalls, \u201cenormous apartment, lots of staff, his dog had cancer earlier. He spent $39,000 treating it. The poodle lived but now the man is dying and he\u2019s worried about who will take care of his dog when he\u2019s gone. He set up a trust fund for it. He made one of his staff its guardian. He didn\u2019t have anyone else. \u201d </p> <p>When you\u2019re too ill to speak for yourself or make your own healthcare decisions, an appointed proxy makes these decisions for you (normally a close friend or family member). There\u2019s a term for people who don\u2019t have anyone to willing to take that role: the \u201cunbefriended\u201d.</p> <p>Death is the great equalizer, and one thing D has noticed is that no matter how rich or poor her patients, a lot of them are alone. Many Manhattanites, she says, don\u2019t speak to their kids or the kids refuse to be the healthcare proxy.\u201d Sometimes people ask for their doorman or the guy at the local bodega to be their proxy; these people always refuse, they don\u2019t want that responsibility.</p> <p>D has started talking about antibiotic-resistant infections and flesh-eating illnesses when the waitress comes by with dessert menus. We order cake. Life starts to encroach on death: people check their phones, make their excuses, put on their coats, exit. </p> <p>I\u2019m not sure how I\u2019d thought the night would end, but it comes suddenly and with a sort of anti-climax. I\u2019m the last to leave and, before I go, I head to the bathroom to check my mascara.</p>",

Sometimes they are quite obvious \u2013 a bloat that says, \u201cplease don\u2019t eat oatmeal\u201d or a clench that says \u201cthat\u2019s not a good idea\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Then I felt like drinking a Diet Coke. I drink a fair amount it, at least one 20-ounce (600ml) bottle a day, if not two. But then a thought infiltrated into my brain from its snaky neighbor to the south.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/17/cheese-america-surplus-donation\">America is drowning in surplus cheese.

I\u2019ve contemplated quitting Diet Coke before, but I\u2019ve come up with all manner of excuses every time. <em>It\u2019s my only vice</em>, I whine. <em>It\u2019s too hard. I can\u2019t deal with that right now</em>. </p> <p>But I thought about all the reasons why I would like to quit Diet Coke. I don\u2019t want empty cans and bottles around me that I have to deal with \u2013 it makes me feel like a wino. It must be killing my teeth. Some say Diet Coke causes all kinds of brain problems and joint issues and maybe even cancer.</p> <p>Then I asked myself, \u201cwhat are the benefits of this regimen of consuming regular amounts of expensive, tainted water?\u201d Little breaks \u2013 it becomes associated with a sense of relief. A banal identity marker. \u201cYou\u2019re a Diet Coker? Me too!\u201d Companionship \u2013 that little joy you feel because Diet Coke is always there for you. </p> <p>Why doesn\u2019t eating baby carrots or having a plain glass of water trigger the same sensations? I also drink a lot of tea, and that doesn\u2019t do it either.</p> <p>I think it\u2019s because Diet Coke has a dark side. Despite the beverage\u2019s marketed image of \u201cfun\u201d and sexy, Diet Coke really isn\u2019t. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Others will admit sadly that they, too, have tried to leave, but Diet Coke won\u2019t let them.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It doesn\u2019t actually taste good. It can make you burp. Is it cute to be drinking sodas all day long? Not really. It\u2019s that little crackle of \u201cI like sabotaging myself with bad decisions\u201d that keeps \u2019em coming back. \u201cMaybe this time it will taste good. Maybe it actually will be refreshing.\u201d</p> <p>Diet Coke promises a lot, but delivers little. A diet drink is supposed to be a guilt-free sweet treat. No calories \u2013 all joy! But Diet Coke can make its drinkers feel guilty, knowing that maybe something isn\u2019t quite right in their body as it slides down into their depths. It is in that curious category of \u201cnon-food items\u201d \u2013 at best, tooth-rotting and fattening; at worst? Who knows? Coke took something decent (water), mucked it up, called it \u201cthe real thing\u201d and exported it all over the globe. I have a friend who calls Coke the \u201cblack water of imperialism\u201d.</p> <p>Why are we all so thirsty, anyway? People used to have two cups of coffee and a scotch as their daily hydration. They were fine. I sometimes think that we\u2019ve turned into big babies (myself included) who need our ba-ba\u2019s, as we lug around bottles of water and diet sodas. </p> <p>Nonetheless, something had to replace my beloved Diet Cokes. I couldn\u2019t just ditch my ba-ba cold turkey. So I cranked up my seltzer machine and laid in some Key limes. I am not lying when I say that this watery treat is about a million times better than Diet Coke.</p> <p>I\u2019m going to save a lot of money, anyway. Diet Coke retails for about 2.5 cents per ounce. My tap water costs about 2 cents per gallon.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/02/healthy-eating-tips-labels-processed-food-bpa-gmo-free-cans\">No amount of 'free from' labelling will make processed food good for you | Marion Nestle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>How terrific do I feel since quitting?

I don\u2019t have the insane sugar cravings I thought were part of my personality \u2013 just the regular ones. I am walking taller since I have taken back a piece of something I didn\u2019t realize I had lost: my self-respect.</p> <p>Sure, a lot of Diet Cokers will roll their eyes at suggestions that it\u2019s an unhealthy beverage. Some will make uncomfortable jokes. Others will admit sadly that they, too, have tried to leave, but Diet Coke won\u2019t let them.</p> <p>But they aren\u2019t really talking about Diet Coke.

      "body": "<p>A few days on and, having had time to reflect, Liverpool supporters may now be thinking that their midweek trip to Switzerland was not so heartbreaking after all. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/18/liverpool-sevilla-europa-league-final-match-report\">Losing to Sevilla</a> was painful but getting to a European final is an achievement in itself, especially when it is a club\u2019s first in nine years and the players and manager involved <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/09/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-manager-normal-one\">have been working together</a> for just seven months.</p> <p>That, ultimately, should be the positive which the thousands who travelled to Basel from Merseyside (and elsewhere) cling on to as they enter the post-season period \u2013 that what they witnessed on Wednesday night was the start rather than the end of a process. The team that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/18/sevilla-liverpool-europa-league-final-basel-party\">lost the Europa League final</a> was put together by one manager and led into battle by another, disconnect contributed to defeat, and what can begin now is long-term rebuilding.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/19/jurgen-klopp-dortmund-liverpool-europa-league-final\">J\u00fcrgen Klopp \u2013 serial loser? No, he can do a Dortmund at Liverpool</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That would have been the case even if Liverpool had held on to or increased the lead given to them by Daniel Sturridge\u2019s 35th-minute strike at St Jakob Park, but the manner in which they collapsed in the second half \u2013 conceding three goals in 24 minutes and looking vulnerable to letting in more \u2013 only confirmed the sense that, for all his warm words and even warmer hugs, J\u00fcrgen Klopp is about to take an axe to the squad he inherited from Brendan Rodgers in October.</p> <p>The German intimated as much when he spoke after defeat to Sevilla of his players losing \u201cfaith in our style of play\u201d. Damning words from a man with a demanding doctrine and further proof that Liverpool\u2019s biggest collective failure is in their heads rather than their feet.</p> <p>It was in evidence throughout the recently completed campaign and highlighted up by the fact that Liverpool lost 19 points from winning positions in the Premier League, the third highest behind Tottenham Hotspur (20) and Chelsea (21). Norwich, West Bromwich Albion, Sunderland and Newcastle United were among the teams who pegged Liverpool back, with Southampton doing it twice, the second time recovering from 2-0 down to beat Klopp\u2019s men 3-2 on <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/20/southampton-comeback-beat-liverpool-3-2\">a wild Sunday afternoon at St Mary\u2019s</a>.</p> <p>In that regard, Liverpool\u2019s capitulation against Sevilla was not that shocking, the key difference being that this time what they lost was not points but a first trophy in four years and, with it, qualification for the Champions League. Little wonder there were tears at the final whistle from those in red, in the stands and on the pitch.</p> <p>There is a view, held by fans and observers alike, that Liverpool\u2019s mental brittleness is a consequence of the youthful nature of the squad, that there are too many boys learning their trade, which inevitably leads to collective breakdowns. There is some truth in that \u2013 Liverpool do have a generally young group of players, a result of the transfer policy put in place by Fenway Sports Group (FSG) following <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/oct/06/liverpool-sold-new-england-sports-ventures\">their October 2010 takeover</a> of the club. FSG put the emphasis on signing the best raw talent available, as opposed to chasing established players who come with expensive transfer fees and wage demands.</p> <p>But to focus on that heavily would detract from the fact that among the 40-plus players acquired at a cost of more than \u00a3400m in the past six years, a fair few have been over the age of 25. Indeed in the team that started against Sevilla, there were only four players under 25 years old, with the entire XI full internationals at one time or another. It is not experience that Liverpool lack, but leaders.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/19/liverpool-jurgen-klopp-organisation-pressing-sevilla-europa-league-final\">Liverpool\u2019s collapse shows J\u00fcrgen Klopp needs greater control amid the chaos | Jonathan Wilson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sporting leadership is a hard to define quality but you know when you see it and the simple fact is Liverpool do not have enough players with the necessary qualities to make sure the team is capable of seeing out a lead on a consistent basis, or when they lose that lead, not suffering a brain freeze that causes tactical and technical disorder, as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/18/liverpool-sevilla-talking-points-europa-league-final\">was the case against Sevilla</a>.</p> <p>Leadership can come in the form of an older player who has been there and done that, and so it was noteworthy that Liverpool\u2019s best player at St Jakob Park was Kolo Tour\u00e9, a 35-year-old winner of Premier League titles with two different clubs. The Ivorian\u2019s contract expires next month and on the back of his most recent display, allied to Mamadou Sakho\u2019s potentially <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/23/liverpool-sideline-mamadou-sakho-failed-drugs-test\">lengthy unavailability</a> at centre-back, it would make sense for the club to keep him on for another season at least.</p> <p>But if Tour\u00e9 does stay on he is unlikely to feature regularly for Liverpool next season and what is required are players who can fortify the resilience, as well as adherence to Klopp\u2019s intensive style, of the first team on a consistent basis: cool-headed commanders in the heat of battle.</p> <p>So the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/28/liverpool-confident-signing-mario-gotze-jurgen-klopp-connection\">pursuit of Bayern Munich\u2019s Mario G\u00f6tze</a> makes sense. The 23-year-old may not be an obvious leader but having won two Bundesliga titles under Klopp at Borussia Dortmund he not only knows what it takes to claim major honours but also how to do it with the current manager. Scoring a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jul/13/germany-argentina-world-cup-final-2014-match-report\">winning goal in a World Cup final</a> is also a decent claim to fame.</p> <p>More players will come in \u2013 Liverpool have already signed Serbian midfielder Marko Grujic and Cameroonian defender Jo\u00ebl Matip and are reportedly close to purchasing the Mainz goalkeeper Loris Karius \u2013and many will depart, partly because of flaws in their ability but also because they simply do not have the mentality to succeed at a club of grand status and grand ambitions. Basel was a blow, but for Klopp and the Kop it can also be the beginning of a stronger, more successful future.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s been a busy week for the US labor secretary, Tom Perez. </p> <p>On Tuesday night, the White House announced that the Obama administration had finalized a new rule that could potentially expand overtime benefits to 4.2 million more Americans. On Wednesday morning, Perez boarded Air Force Two and with Vice-President Joe Biden and flew to Columbus, Ohio, where they made the official public announcement inside <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://jenis.com/\">Jeni\u2019s Splendid Ice Creams</a>.</p> <p>The new rule has been described by some as second only to the Affordable Care Act in its ability to affect the wellbeing of working- and middle-class Americans. Perez, who has been at the head of the US Department of Labor for nearly three years, has made the overtime rule a priority even as he has toured the country speaking to workers and advocating for other worker-friendly policies such as higher minimum wages at the local, state and federal level. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/17/obama-overtime-pay-new-rule\">Millions could get a raise under Obama administration's new overtime rules</a> </p> </aside>  <p>With two-thirds of a year left until the new president is sworn in, Perez still has an intimidating list of unfinished business \u2013 paid leave, auto-enrolling US workers into 401K or other pension programs and a higher minimum wage among others\u2013 that he\u2019d like to accomplish. As the election nears, he may have even more on his plate: Perez is said to be a potential vice-presidential pick.</p> <p>He is clearly unafraid of a challenge. Big business has come out swinging against his changes to paid leave. Perez is unfazed. \u201cWe are the only industrialized nation on the planet that does not have some form of paid leave. We are the only industrialized nation where paid leave is a partisan issue,\u201d Perez said. </p> <p>\u201cI got in trouble recently because I said: \u2018The United States and Papua New Guinea are the only nations on the planet that do not have some form of paid leave.\u2019 Someone approached me after and said: \u2018Hey, I am from Papua New Guinea and we have been taking an initiative. Stop dissing New Guinea.\u2019 So I want to note my own error and apologize for dissing New Guinea. We are alone as a nation.\u201d</p> <h2>A good listener</h2> <p>\u201cTom Perez has guts,\u201d said Michael Subin, executive director of the Montgomery County\u2019s criminal justice coordinating commission. \u201cWhen he sees injustice, he is not afraid to take on those committing the injustice.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Subin and Perez worked together in the early 2000s when Perez served as a member and then a president of the Montgomery County council. Together they proposed the Perez-Subin bill that sought to limit predatory lending. According to Subin, Perez knows how to get things done.</p> <p>\u201cLot of legislators don\u2019t understand what they have to do and how the system works best. He was able to get things done because he was able to work with people,\u201d he said. \u201cHe understood what they were looking for, what their issues might have been regarding specific pieces of legislation. And he listened.\u201d</p> <p>Mary Kay Henry, president of the SEIU \u2013 one of the largest labor unions in the US \u2013 enjoys working with Perez because \u201che gets us\u201d.<br /></p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to explain struggles that people have. He is often telling me stories of people he has just met \u2013 about how they are stitching together two or three jobs to make ends meet and that we have to stop it. What are we going to do together to get things right? He has really been a privilege to work with.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dcc78fc612b5b8de0e513a9163a0e5a1059a7951\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dcc78fc612b5b8de0e513a9163a0e5a1059a7951/0_144_1050_533/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Perez in Tucson\" width=\"1000\" height=\"508\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Perez visiting a homeless man in Tucson, Arizona.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Burcham/US Department of Labor</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One morning early in May, Perez made his way to Brooklyn\u2019s Sunset Park neighborhood to visit UnCommonGoods, an online and catalogue retailer.

UnCommonGoods is what Perez would describe as a \u201cconscious capitalism\u201d company focused on developing its workers by paying them well, listening to their feedback and incorporating that into how the company is managed. </p> <p>\u201cI came here for the job, but I stayed for the culture,\u201d said Joel Villa, an operations supervisor who started at the company in 2013. \u201c I can grow and learn here.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7d5bd34465ddae336de303beb51bb0d94ed42cfc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7d5bd34465ddae336de303beb51bb0d94ed42cfc/181_605_3255_1952/1000.jpg\" alt=\"4 May U.S. Secretary of Labor Thomas Perez tours UnCommonGoods and has a roundtable discussion on Conscious Capitalism with it\u2019s workers. ***Official Department of Labor Photograph*** Photographs taken by the federal government are generally part of the public domain and may be used, copied and distributed without permission.

Spotting one of the workers with a staff-designed handheld scanner, he said: \u201cCan I see your gun for a minute?\u201d As the employee handed it over, Perez looked it over and posed for photos. \u201cIt\u2019s so elegant,\u201d he said handing it back. \u201cShow me what you\u2019re doing here?\u201d</p> <p>Later that day, Perez would go on to visit the kitchen of The Modern \u2013 one of Danny Meyer\u2019s restaurants with a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/15/danny-meyer-us-restaurant-group-no-tipping-policy\">no-tipping policy</a>. He is as comfortable in a kitchen as he is in a warehouse, in a hard hat on a construction site or bending pipes in a garage. Making house calls, as he refers to his visits with employees and employers, is a key part of his job as a labor secretary and enables him to \u201cunderstand the angst\u201d of those Americans who still feel left behind in the economic recovery.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"a58cc7caf8a0fa68c6d8bdc113caec32aad69dbf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a58cc7caf8a0fa68c6d8bdc113caec32aad69dbf/0_725_5760_2860/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Perez at the Modern\" width=\"1000\" height=\"497\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Perez tours The Modern restaurant and has a roundtable discussion on \u2018conscious capitalism\u2019 with its workers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shawn T Moore/US Department of Labor</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cPeople in this country are resilient. I\u2019ve met so many folks who got kicked to the side of the road in the Great Recession and they\u2019ve rebounded.

That\u2019s not right. We can do better as a nation.\u201d</p> <p>Just days after his visit to Brooklyn, the Department of Labor released its April jobs report noting that the US economy added <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/06/april-jobs-report-us-economy-unemployment-rate\">just 160,000 jobs</a>, about 40,000 fewer than expected.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s another solid report,\u201d Perez told the Guardian that afternoon, pointing out that the number of long-term unemployed has been dropping amid optimism about the US job market. \u201cThe percentage of long-term unemployed is the lowest in seven years.\u201d </p> <p>With the unemployment rate reaching 5% \u2013 <a href=\"http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000\">down from 10% in October 2009</a> \u2013 there are fewer workers on the market and employers are going to have to hire workers who \u201cmight have a 12-month hole on their r\u00e9sum\u00e9\u201d. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve met these folks. They have incredible talent,\u201d said Perez. \u201cTheir only mistake \u2013 if you want to call it a mistake \u2013 is that they were at a wrong place at a wrong time during the Great Recession.\u201d </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/20/us-unemployment-jobs-doctor-thomas-perez\">The jobs doctor is in: US Labor secretary makes unemployment 'house calls'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On a cold, wet February morning, Perez met half a dozen New Jerseyans who were over 55 years old and had been out of work for an average of 1.8 years. The panel took place at Rutgers University, which had recently launched a \u201cNew Start Career Network\u201d focusing on older, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/20/us-unemployment-jobs-doctor-thomas-perez\">long-term unemployed workers</a>.</p> <p>\u201cFor them, it was hugely significant, the simple fact that the highest-ranking official in the country who deals with these issues took the time to talk to them about their experiences with long-term unemployment,\u201d Maria Heidkamp, director of the network, told the Guardian. \u201cIt was very meaningful to them.\u201d</p> <p>In the nearly four months since they met Perez, one of the attendees got a one-year contract. Three others were able to find short-term work on a two- to three-month contract. \u201cWe are hoping that in couple of those cases it turns into something longer term,\u201d said Heidkamp. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"db05cb840875335508a04709e1721d083055d9b3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/db05cb840875335508a04709e1721d083055d9b3/0_218_4000_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"National Apprenticeship Week Amplification EventSec of Labor Tom Perez, bends a pipe as apprenticemen Nicholas Payne, 28, and Matthew Weitzel, 30 look on during National Apprenticeship Week Amplified Event at IBEW Local 26 Joint Apprenticeship Training facility in Lanham, MD Nov 3, 2015. ***Official Department of Labor Photograph*** Photographs taken by the federal government are generally part of the public domain and may be used, copied and distributed without permission.

After becoming the first Latino elected to the Montgomery County council and later serving as its president, Perez ran for attorney general of Maryland in 2006. However, his campaign <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/10/13/frontrunner-for-attorney-general-was-thrown-off-ballot-for-a-g-of-maryland.html\">came to a stop</a> after one of his rivals sued him alleging that he had not practiced law for 10 years and therefore did not meet the requirements to serve. That same year, Martin O\u2019Malley was elected as the state\u2019s governor and later appointed Perez to serve as the state\u2019s labor secretary. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>In October of 2009, Perez joined the US Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division as assistant general attorney. While there he had investigated the death of Trayvon Martin, who was killed by George Zimmerman in February 2012, abuse at police departments in cities such as Miami and Seattle and civil rights violations by anti-immigration sheriff Joe Arpaio. In the summer of 2013, he was tagged by Barack Obama to run the US Department of Labor. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47b7c6f51408bfbe6040dbbc39de0ac71ba5b35c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47b7c6f51408bfbe6040dbbc39de0ac71ba5b35c/0_0_5760_2749/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tom Perez delivers Remarks to the Greater Baltimore Committee (GBC).\" width=\"1000\" height=\"477\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom Perez delivers Remarks to the Greater Baltimore Committee (GBC).</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Shawn T Moore/US Department of Labor</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To many of his supporters it comes as no surprise that since then, Perez\u2019s name has been floated for a number of other posts. When Eric Holder stepped down as US attorney general, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/10/tom-perez-attorney-general-obama\">Mother Jones ran a piece</a> headlined: \u201cWhy picking Tom Perez for attorney general would be a smart move for Obama\u201d. Earlier this year when the supreme court justice Antonin Scalia died, Perez\u2019s name came up in the pool of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://fusion.net/video/272348/labor-secretary-tom-perez-reacts-to-possible-supreme-court-nomination/\">potential replacements</a>. </p> <p>The past few months have also seen speculation that Perez might end up as Hillary Clinton\u2019s running mate. Perez \u2013 who has at times joined Clinton on the campaign trail \u2013 insists he is focused on his day job.</p> <p>\u201cEvery engagement that I have had with him, he knows the number of days left in the president\u2019s term,\u201d said Henry. \u201cThe thing I admire in him is that even though speculation is happening, he remains laser-focused on trying to implement the fair pay and safe workplaces executive orders that we worked for six years to come to light. He is completely indefatigable on making sure that anything on his plate gets his full attention before he ends the term.\u201d</p> <p>On Friday, while speaking to a room of journalists, Perez once again dodged a question about his possible vice-presidency. The comments came after he said mass deportation proposals floated by some Republicans \u201cwon\u2019t happen\u201d and added that he was confident the US government was going to pass comprehensive immigration reform in the next year.</p> <p>\u201cYou can\u2019t keep demonizing the largest growing population in America and think that that\u2019s a good strategy for growth,\u201d he said, pointing to the naturalization movement in immigrant communities. \u201cImmigration reformation is long overdue.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cSpoken like a vice-presidential nominee,\u201d quipped Bernie Kohn of Bloomberg News. </p> <p>\u201cI have not been approached,\u201d said Perez, dodging the question. \u201cI like my day job. Actually, I love my day job, what I am doing every day. I have 245 days until the weekend. I have a little sign on my desk, not because I want to count the days but because I want to make all the days count.\u201d</p>",

During prohibition, Montreal (a convenient train ride from New York) was known as the place where the drink flows and anything goes, and it has been living up to that reputation ever since. It has more than 100 festivals through the summer \u2013 many of them free \u2013 and chic new hotels such as the <a href=\"http://www.althotels.com/en/montreal/\">ALT Hotel</a> (doubles from \u00a3100 room only) and downtown <a href=\"http://www.marriott.co.uk/hotels/travel/yulmd-renaissance-montreal-downtown-hotel/\">Renaissance</a> (doubles from \u00a3155 room only).

Old Montreal, the city\u2019s historic district, is where most tourists end up. It has good <a href=\"http://museesmontreal.org/en\">museums</a>, the cobblestoned, 17th-century Rue St-Paul and the impressive 200-year-old Notre Dame basilica (see <a href=\"http://fitzandfollwell.co/\">fitzandfollwell.co</a> for guided tours of Old Montreal from \u00a341pp). Across the harbour, the Biodome (\u00a310.50 adult, \u00a35.40 child) houses an excellent recreation of the four major ecosystems of the Americas: from the rainforest of the south to the polar tips of the north.</p> <p>The Latin Quarter has good restaurants and fun bars, such as the 1920s-style speakeasy <a href=\"http://www.encachette.ca/final/\">En Cachette</a>. Venues such as <a href=\"http://lasalarosa.com/\">La Sala Rossa</a> and the <a href=\"http://theatrefairmount.ca/\">Fairmount Theatre</a> host live music every night of the week. And for outdoor fun, there are 217 miles of cycle paths, hundreds of parks (including Mount Royal, with views across the city), the nine-mile Lachine Canal for kayaking and canoeing, and one of the world\u2019s best standing river waves \u2013 surfers can ride this continuous wave on the St Lawrence river all day, without moving an inch.</p> <p>All of which is great, but it\u2019s not where the real action is. The new spirit of Montreal lies on the periphery, in former industrial districts such as Mile End, Saint-Henri and Little Burgundy, where vibrant artist communities are shooting up like flowers from the pavement. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d339a9e0f39f4bcd2ffa3efb1d11430b0cedbbcc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d339a9e0f39f4bcd2ffa3efb1d11430b0cedbbcc/0_171_2551_1530/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Alternative tours by Spade & Palacio\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Alternative tours by Spade &amp; Palacio</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To explore them, I took a different kind of tour. Rather than traditional sights and histories, Danny Pavlopoulos, co-founder of Spade &amp; Palacio, offers a look around his home turf, the Plateau district, just north of downtown (<a href=\"http://spadeandpalacio.com/\">spadeandpalacio.com</a>, from \u00a347pp including food and drink tastings). We had pastries in his local <a href=\"http://www.ledepanneurcafe.com/\">Caf\u00e9 Le D\u00e9panneur</a> (206 Rue Bernard Ouest), which is also Montreal band Arcade Fire\u2019s coffee-stop of choice. We swung by his favourite brewpub, the Dieu du Ciel for a glass of P\u00e9ch\u00e9 Mortel (deadly sin), a thick coffee-infused stout (my favourite, though, was the very hoppy Babylone IPA at Montreal\u2019s first microbrewery, <a href=\"http://lechevalblanc.ca/\">Le Cheval Blanc</a>) and tried the unofficial favourite food of Quebec province, <em>poutine</em>. This is cheesy chips and gravy, but somehow infinitely more delicious: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Patati-Patata/152005481506456\">Patati Patata</a> (4177 Boulevard Saint-Laurent) is the locals\u2019 favourite.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d309d1cb96fda7503492edb3d0485bf71228f3b1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d309d1cb96fda7503492edb3d0485bf71228f3b1/0_378_7144_4286/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Classic poutine, with chips, gravy and cheese curd.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Classic <em>poutine</em>, with chips, gravy and cheese curd.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Danny also showed me where to buy the best threads (<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ClarkStreetMercantile/\">Clark St Mercantile</a>, which is big on independent brands, including its own clothing line); the best place for sundowners (<a href=\"http://www.alexandraplatzbar.com/\">Alexandraplatz Bar</a>, a pop-up drinking den in a former warehouse in the Mile-Ex district); and the best summer parties (<a href=\"http://piknicelectronik.com/en/\">Piknic Electronik</a>, for outdoor DJ sets on Ile Sainte-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne every summer Sunday, tickets from about \u00a37). People hugged him on the streets, and I met his friends. </p> <p>Later, I headed south to Little Burgundy. Along with neighbouring Griffintown, this former working class district is like the city\u2019s Mile End district was 10 years ago: arty but still edgy. It\u2019s swiftly becoming the foodie capital of Montreal, too. Famous spots like <a href=\"http://joebeef.ca/\">Joe Beef and Liverpool House</a>, sister restaurants on Rue Notre Dame Ouest, have become synonymous with this city\u2019s no-nonsense, high-quality food \u2013 the lobster spaghetti (\u00a326) and oysters from its seafood bar come highly recommended. But there are also new treats, such as experimental <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/restofantome/\">Le Fantome</a> (1832 Rue William), known for peanut butter and jam sandwiches with foie gras, and hip cafe-cum-bakery <a href=\"http://www.labeteapain.com/\">La B\u00eate \u00e0 Pain</a>, which has just opened a branch on Rue Young a little way north in Griffintown.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09a833538c897fd416f53c62406e95b878a07e57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09a833538c897fd416f53c62406e95b878a07e57/0_0_1198_630/1000.jpg\" alt=\"La B\u00eate \u00e0 Pain\" width=\"1000\" height=\"526\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">La B\u00eate \u00e0 Pain</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There are excellent cultural spaces too. Warehouse-style galleries such as <a href=\"http://www.arsenalmontreal.com/en/\">Arsenal </a>and <a href=\"http://www.galeriedivision.com/\">Division Gallery</a>, both on Rue William, are smaller than the main museums downtown but more challenging \u2013 until 3 July, for example, an interactive, virtual- and augmented-reality exhibition called Automata examines the impact of artificial intelligence on art and culture.</p> <p>Montreal is an in-between land. It is a city of two tongues, two minds and two ways of life. French is the official language, but half the city speaks English. It\u2019s like the confluence of two rivers: some of the waters blend together, but others may never mix. That creates a clash.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f376e971fed3aa1ea8794c09346560c43e00acac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f376e971fed3aa1ea8794c09346560c43e00acac/0_0_3743_2573/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A stylised mural near the riverfront in Montreal\" width=\"1000\" height=\"687\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A stylised mural near the riverfront in Montreal</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: George Rose/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cLiving in Montreal is like dating someone with borderline personality disorder,\u201d says Russ Cooper, a local guitarist. The French influence is everywhere: bars look more like brasseries, chip shops offer hand-cut <em>frites</em> and the patisseries rival Paris \u2013 including one that\u2019s so good it\u2019s called the G-spot (<a href=\"http://boutiquepointg.com/\">Point G</a>) known for its macaroons. But there are also things that France would never condone: fine dining restaurants with tattooed waiters, microbrewed beer that trumps <em>appellation control\u00e9e</em> wine, gastronomy that is experimental and fresh. </p> <p>And that\u2019s what makes Montreal special. Differences generate new ideas. Montreal now has the world\u2019s second-highest proportion of people employed in creative industries (after London). The National Film Board of Canada has become a world leader in virtual reality and interactive films, picking up six Webby Awards for innovation this year. Montreal is also the third-largest centre in the world for video game production and fourth-largest for visual effects.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4aa30a298ba5385d57f0540bf80b24f1bfc7ce57\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4aa30a298ba5385d57f0540bf80b24f1bfc7ce57/0_179_5370_3222/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cobbled Rue Saint-Paul in downtown Montreal\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Cobbled Rue Saint-Paul in downtown Montreal.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Arts centres such as downtown\u2019s PHI offer constant streams of pioneering creative content, from boundary-pushing theatre and music to digital art installations, ground-breaking cinema and more. And the more creative the city becomes, the more creative people come here. There is a palpable sense of ingenuity and imagination on the streets.</p> <p>And there\u2019s plenty to do, too. This summer sees the <a href=\"http://16.muralfestival.com/\">Mural Festival</a> of street art (9-19 June), a <a href=\"https://montrealcompletementcirque.com/en/\">Circus Arts Festival</a> (7-17 July), the <a href=\"http://montreal-fireworks.com/schedule.html\">Montreal International Fireworks Competition</a> (2-30 July), as well as events for comic books, kites, folk music, rock\u2019n\u2019roll and reggae. Montreal now has the biggest comedy festival in the world \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.hahaha.com/\">Just for Laughs</a> (13-31 July), this year hosting Jimmy Carr and Russell Howard from the UK, often in small, intimate venues \u2013 not to mention <a href=\"http://www.montrealjazzfest.com/default-en.aspx\">the world\u2019s largest jazz festival</a> (June 29-July 9).</p> <p>More than one local I met said their only complaint was that they felt guilty for having a night in.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d66d460cc7f695ba16d633edee982cde59318ac9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d66d460cc7f695ba16d633edee982cde59318ac9/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Printemps Numerique\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Printemps Numerique</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Martine Doyon</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Electronic arts are thriving, too. I visited during Montreal\u2019s <a href=\"http://printempsnumerique.info/en/\">Digital Spring</a>, a city wide celebration of <em>arts numeriques</em> (until 21 June) and in one night explored a gallery of first world war photographs displayed in virtual reality beside endless rows of gravestones, and ended up on my back in a 360-degree acid-trip-inspired planetarium show at a cool technological arts bar and event space called <a href=\"http://ix.sat.qc.ca/\">S.A.T</a>. Things like that tend to happen here.</p> <p>Early summer is the best time to come. In winter, temperatures drop to skin-burning degrees and people hibernate like bears. (Although there are exceptions: \u201cDancing in a one piece fluorescent ski suit in -35C is pretty special,\u201d one local told me.) Summer is the release. Bars and restaurants take over the streets, music rings from every corner, flowers bloom and colour floods the city. It\u2019s like the final bell of the summer term, when all the kids run out to play.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7c5cb238ed2b35e23c8ccc34b05342b2450c2437\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7c5cb238ed2b35e23c8ccc34b05342b2450c2437/0_0_1200_800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Le Mal N\u00e9cessaire, Chinatown, Montreal\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Le Mal N\u00e9cessaire, a pineapple-themed bar in Chinatown</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And play I did. My last night started in a pineapple-themed bar in Chinatown, <a href=\"http://www.lemalnecessaire.com/\">Le Mal N\u00e9cessaire</a>, then I moved on to watch award-winning Canadian comic Heidi Foss and sidestepped to Little Italy and a new, retro pinball machine joint called <a href=\"http://www.northstarpinball.com/english/#pinball\">North Star</a>. I should have ended the evening listening to Seb Black perform at Emery Street Studios, but somehow, four giant bowling-pin-sized beers later, ended up with my head nearly in a plate of poutine at <a href=\"http://www.midnightpoutine.ca/food/2007/03/patati_patata_petite_patate_tant_pis_pour_toi/\">Patati Patata</a>. And that was just an \u201cordinary\u201d Friday night out. </p> <p>Montreal\u2019s not the new Brooklyn or the new Seattle. It\u2019s not France, Great Britain or America. It\u2019s not even really Canada. It\u2019s its own thing, an island city. On Place d\u2019Armes, in Old Montreal, a pair of sculptures depict a French woman holding a poodle and a British man holding a pug. The humans are turning away from each other, but the poodle and the pug just want to play. Perhaps, more than anything, they encapsulate the spirit of this city.</p> <p>Because whatever clashes and harmonies this city creates, what matters most is that right now, the winter is over, the sun is out, there\u2019s music playing \u2013 and Montreal is up for a good time.<br /><em>\u2022 The trip was provided by Tourism Montreal (<a href=\"http://www.tourisme-montreal.org/\">tourisme-montreal.org</a>), Tourisme Qu\u00e9bec (<a href=\"https://www.quebecoriginal.com/en-ca\">quebecoriginal.com</a>) and Explore Canada (<a href=\"https://www.canada.travel/uk/?utm_source=explore-canada.co.uk&amp;utm_medium=vanity_url&amp;utm_campaign=uk_hub_2015&amp;utm_content=homepage\">explore-canada.co.uk</a>)</em></p> <p><strong>This article was amended on 24 May: it said, incorrectly, that Piknik Electronique was at Mont-Royal, and was free.</strong></p>",

      "headline": "Bombay dreams: how painter Bhupen Khakhar captured the city spirit",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-21T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Bhupen Khakhar was born in Khetwadi in Bombay in 1934. His father was an engineer, and he died when Khakhar was still a child. Whenever I read Khakhar\u2019s biographical details \u2013 he died in 2003 \u2013 I stop short at \u201cKhetwadi\u201d, where a Gujarati tailor my mother courted for his skill at making perfect blouses lived and worked in a room by a bridge. Khetwadi didn\u2019t fit in with my idea of Bombay. Although it was notionally in South Bombay (the term didn\u2019t exist when I was growing up, and now denotes the richest urban setting in India), it was distinct from it, as were the bazaar localities beyond Nana Chowk and Grant Road. Khetwadi was a small town in a big city, one of the many provincial settlements in a Bombay that made claims to be a great cosmopolitan metropolis. I ask my mother, who is now 90, the tailor\u2019s name, and she says, without hesitation, \u201cMadhavlal\u201d. His face comes back to me: gaunt, bespectacled, his stubble kohl-dark, a pencil lodged behind one ear. When he came to deliver blouses in Malabar Hill, he had the air of arriving from a different state. He hardly smiled, though this didn\u2019t necessarily mean he was unhappy.</p> <p>Khakhar, too, was Gujarati. I recall that Khetwadi had a large Gujarati contingent. Unlike Madhavlal, he was born into a middle-class family. Had Madhavlal been better educated, he might have turned to one of the two vocations, or professions, that figured in Khakhar\u2019s life: accountancy (Khakhar qualified as a chartered accountant in 1956) and art (he took an MA in art criticism from MS University, Baroda, in 1964, and was introduced to the art world there by his friend, the painter Ghulam Mohammed Sheikh). After all, the master tailor requires both the artist\u2019s instinct and a head for measurement and precision (thus, the pencil behind the ear). On the other hand, it seems that Khakhar wanted, on some level, to be Madhavlal. It\u2019s a droll middle-class fantasy \u2013 to want to be taken out of yourself in order to become whatever it is you\u2019re escaping. Khakhar left accountancy for art and Khetwadi for Baroda more or less simultaneously. In the extraordinary paintings that followed, he would endlessly revisit the small-scale and the provincial, and gaze adoringly, from various perspectives, at the Madhavlal-like figure.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"107cc5eefe3e313c89a3eadf0a80b33fb11114db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/107cc5eefe3e313c89a3eadf0a80b33fb11114db/0_0_3052_3048/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Khakhar\u2019s Man Leaving (Going Abroad) (1970)\" width=\"1000\" height=\"999\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Khakhar\u2019s Man Leaving (Going Abroad) (1970)</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These bare facts of Khakhar\u2019s childhood and youth don\u2019t take into account details revealed to him by a holy man in Patna: \u201cFor being unfaithful to his wife, a previous incarnation of Bhupen Khakhar was murdered by his feudal lord. It was his daughter with whom the act of infidelity had been committed. As a punishment for his sin, he was born a butterfly. In that form he (or she) flew into a saint\u2019s puja lamp. The unintentional sacrifice led to rebirth as Bhupen Khakhar at 7am on 10 March 1934, a Brahmakshatriya destined to become a chartered accountant and painter.\u201d This information appeared in one of Khakar\u2019s early exhibition catalogues \u2013 a catalogue that the poet Nissim Ezekiel, in \u201cThe Eccentric Genius\u201d (probably the best essay written on this artist), said in 1970 was \u201ca collector\u2019s item, the most original and humorous of its kind in the history of modern Indian art. That Bhupen created it is altogether characteristic of the man. So are his invitation cards, posters, publicity releases and other paraphernalia of artistic self-advancement. He designs them as self-mocking, satirical replicas of bazaar culture ... The butterfly has come a long way.\u201d</p> <p>Khakhar was an artist in a then century old avant-garde Indian tradition of playfulness \u2013 so the reference to 4th\u2011century Chinese philosopher Zhuang Zhou\u2019s celebrated butterly dream is unlikely to be accidental: \u201cOnce upon a time, Zhuang Zhou dreamed he was a butterfly ... flitting about happily enjoying himself. He did not know that he was Zhou. Suddenly he awoke, and was palpably Zhou. He did not know whether he was Zhou, who had dreamed of being a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming that he was Zhou.\u201d Khakhar\u2019s parable and the Chinese one are meant to remind us both of the randomness that sees a Gujarati accountant become an artist and of the essentially metamorphic nature of Khakhar\u2019s sexual life \u2013 for he was gay. After visiting England in the 1970s, and coming into contact with both a more open social space for homosexuality and the paintings of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/hockney\">David Hockney</a>, he began to explore, and achieve, striking visual metaphors for \u201ccoming out\u201d (what better term is there for the emergence of a butterfly?). This is not to ignore that Khakhar also found England \u201cgrumpy\u201d, and blamed it for exporting to India a Victorian morality that, in his eyes, replaced a more hospitable environment for his sexuality. The 1981 painting after which a new Tate Modern exhibition is named, <em>You Can\u2019t Please All</em>, takes its title from a fable by Aesop, and has a figure leaning from a balcony, naked, as if fresh out of the chrysalis.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"3188c9507f4d981643f37e8a32f07dc2ec5d3029\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3188c9507f4d981643f37e8a32f07dc2ec5d3029/94_74_4389_3992/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Death in the Family (1978) by Bhupen Khakhar\" width=\"1000\" height=\"910\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Death in the Family (1978) by Bhupen Khakhar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The two butterfly dreams shouldn\u2019t give us the impression that Khakhar believed in flitting about unfettered. The world \u2013 milieu, neighbourhood, lane, room, house, body, whatever we live and clothe ourselves in \u2013 is everything to him. This is what made him deeply attractive to certain writers: the poets Ezekiel and Adil Jussawalla; the novelist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/salmanrushdie\">Salman Rushdie</a>. It\u2019s what drew me to the work. Khakhar\u2019s figures are never really naked, even when he depicts them nude in numerous luminous and funny homosexual encounters. The body, like the room or the shirt, is another thing we dwell in; it too, for Khakhar, clothes the soul and the entrails. Its recurrence in the pictures is a reminder of Khakhar\u2019s abiding love of what is called <em>rupa </em>in Sanskrit: the form and appearance of things. On the other hand, clothes and things made of cloth are everywhere as metaphors for the body: being stitched, of course, but also folded and left in the balcony, as in <em>Still Life With Shirts</em>; and the various quilts that only partially veil Khakhar\u2019s lovers. Ezekiel, in that early essay, enumerates the locations in which Khakhar\u2019s \u201csoul\u201d, like the butterfly, wanders \u2013 no garden, but versions of Khetwadi: \u201cin paan shops and Irani restaurants, in tailor and watch repair shops, in the offices of branch managers and assistant accountants\u201d.</p> <p>Khakhar\u2019s paintings shun the metropolis proper; they portray excursions, liaisons, conversations, buildings, and ways of life in towns and neighbourhoods that are neither impoverished nor particularly desirable as places to move to or visit, unless it\u2019s for a homecoming, or to look up relatives, or to track down Madhavlal. A host of visual models are discernible \u2013 the popular posters representing pilgrimage sites (except the constellation of sacred destinations are replaced here by verandas, terraces and alleys); calendar images, and the opportunistic ways in which they incorporate and reject perspective; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gauguin\">Gauguin</a>; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2005/nov/01/1\">Henri Rousseau</a>; the Manet of <em>The Bathers on the Seine</em>. To these I\u2019d add the images painted in the caves of Ajanta more than a millennium ago, deliberately unfinished episodes depicting the Buddha\u2019s life in its various stages and reincarnations. When my wife and I first saw these, she noted spontaneously how India\u2019s culture, on the evidence of the resplendent fading likenesses from the second century BC, was always urban \u2013 before us, on the dim walls, were balconies, windows, terraces overlooking other terraces, women absorbed in their toilette inside rooms. She and I belonged to a generation that had grown up with an untested idea bequeathed to us by another Gujarati, Gandhi: that the \u201ctrue\u201d India always was, and would be, in the villages. The frescoes in Ajanta tell us something else. Khakhar\u2019s art, with its vernacular, bourgeois joie de vivre, is a liberating and comic rejection of Gandhi\u2019s asceticism and his cantankerous fetishisation of the \u201cnatural\u201d on behalf of the wayward life of civic spaces and an idiosyncratic fetishisation of the \u201cunnatural\u201d and manufactured. Nature doesn\u2019t interest Khakhar; culture does. Early on, he noted the importance of plastic flowers in a quasi-surrealist but resolutely Indian manifesto, and gave expression to this article of faith in the wonderful and self-explanatory <em>Man With Bouquet of Plastic Flowers</em>. Yes, seas, rivers and landscapes occur in the paintings, but often with the flattened eccentricity of posters; while the pictures in the rooms he paints might depict seas, landscapes and rivers. This constitutes a specifically Indian middle-class reciprocity with the world.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c6c341613becb632b120d04cfc0c6a23c6543a07\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6c341613becb632b120d04cfc0c6a23c6543a07/0_0_2953_2955/999.jpg\" alt=\"Janata Watch Repairing (1972) by Bhupen Khakhar\" width=\"999\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Janata Watch Repairing (1972) by Bhupen Khakhar</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Khakhar\u2019s besotted and provocative eye for kitsch needs to be placed within the tastes of the 20th-century Gujarati Hindu community, whose achievements were largely, sometimes heroically, mercantile: think of the Patels who, after being expelled from Uganda in the 1970s, transformed Britain. There is a preference, in this context, for nylon, the now near-extinct Terylene, chiffon, plastic figurines and sumptuously realistic representations of the gods. This often involves a superstitious confluence of plastic, kitsch and divinity. The sacred is made available through posters. Khakhar, in borrowing from plastic and the reality-inducing colours painted on it, at once mocks, mimics and internalises the devotion they excite. His reworking of kitsch is, as a result, subtly overlaid with that misplaced sacredness. His imagination comes alive at a moment when the bazaar dimension of bourgeois culture is both a part of Indian modernity and is an embarrassment to it; it still isn\u2019t an element in a cultural progression leading to the Bharatiya Janata Party. It\u2019s replete with mischief and innocence.</p> <p>I\u2019m reminded, looking again at the work, of the exceptional viability of the human figure in modern Indian art. Granted, the tradition produced abstract painters, and its ancient non-representational lineage contributed powerfully to western art\u2019s turn from conventional realism and perspective at the end of the 19th century. For all that, the figure in the Indian art of the last hundred years must count among the richest and most unexpected inheritances of secular modernity, and Khakhar possibly its greatest and most generous, most seductive, pioneer. This inheritance arises from being both shaped by and severing ties with the European Renaissance, with its photographic realism and insistence on putting the human being at the centre. All the great Indian practitioners of the figure \u2013 Tagore, Amrita Sher\u2011gil, FN Souza, Jamini Roy, Paritosh Sen, KG Subramanyan \u2013 rejected what the prodigiously gifted, short-lived, sharp-tongued Hungarian-Indian Sher-gil called \u201cacademic naturalism\u201d, which she characterised as a style that believes \u201cthe sole function of painting and sculpture is to reproduce a given object faithfully, that is, with as much cretinous minuteness and servility as is humanly possible\u201d. Khakhar\u2019s tailors and watch-repairers have expressionless faces not because of an inner ennui, but because they have been released from the \u201cservility\u201d of realism: they are essentially humorous. The figures\u2019 neighbourliness (all the humans and objects are conjoined by ties of friendship, family, sex and appetite) makes them strikingly different from Hockney\u2019s on the one hand, and Francis Bacon\u2019s and Lucian Freud\u2019s on the other. In Khakhar\u2019s world we discover in abundance the freedom of space and play that Sher-gil so desired from Indian art and life.</p> <ul> <li><em>Bhupen Khakhar: You Can\u2019t Please All</em> is at Tate Modern, London SE1, from 1 June. tate.org.uk.<br /></li> </ul>",

She wants to kill the old version of herself and recreate herself in an alter ego called Dolly Wilde, who is bold, loud and not afraid to say what she thinks.</p> <p>We follow Johanna through the story as she struggles with trying to be a new person while being raised in a family where they barely have enough money for food. Dolly wants to be a music journalist and to do this she feels as though she must eradicate the old person she used to be. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"37506dc6dc73e10346a82b22ca4aa70215cf5bfd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/37506dc6dc73e10346a82b22ca4aa70215cf5bfd/0_0_254_400/254.jpg\" alt=\"How to Build a Girl by Caitlin Moran\" width=\"254\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Because of the unfortunate situation Johanna is in at home, she uses Dolly to try and escape the gnawing truth of the current place that her and her family is in. Gradually, Johanna gives herself over to her life as Dolly and allows this character to subsume her own. She wants to build a new life and this starts with building herself. She wants to be successful in the society that she perceives. However, this is definitely not an easy task. </p> <p>This is not a story about Johanna Moriggan who comes from a council estate and then gets drunk and goes out a lot, it\u2019s about a girl who completely recreates herself to try and escape reality and then has to stop and start again when she realises that she wants to keep some aspects of her past self.</p> <p>This book is a great story about how a girl from a rough background tries to navigate herself into adulthood. I loved reading about how Johanna, who didn\u2019t exactly have it all together, still managed to make something of herself and succeed on her own terms despite all the hardships she suffered. </p> <p>The only problem I had with this book was the way that, towards the end, Johanna Moriggan seemed more focused on losing herself and worrying about the needs of others rather than finding herself. Although I got slightly frustrated with this I realise now that Caitlin Moran does this purposely to show how you need to recreate yourself many times in your life to discover who you really are. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I adore Caitlin Moran and her honest and hilarious writing style and I fell in love with Johanna\u2019s quirky character.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-21T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>When it was first published in Istanbul in 1943, it made no impression whatsoever. Decades later, when <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/378095/\"><em>Madonna in a Fur Coat</em></a> became the sort of book that passed from friend to friend, the literary establishment continued to ignore it. Even those who greatly admired the other works of Sabahattin Ali viewed this one as a puzzling aberration. It was just a love story, they said \u2013 the sort that schoolgirls fawned over. And yet, for the past three years, it has topped the bestseller lists in Turkey, outselling <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/orhanpamuk\">Orhan Pamuk</a>. It is read, loved and wept over by men and women of all ages, but most of all by young adults. And no one seems able to explain quite why.</p> <p>The story begins in 1930s Ankara, the Turkish Republic\u2019s newly appointed capital. The narrator has fallen on hard times, and it is only with the help of a crass and belittling former classmate that he is able to find work as a clerk at a firm trading in lumber. Here he meets the sickly, affectless Raif Bey, who is, we\u2019re told, \u201cthe sort of man who causes us to ask ourselves: \u201cWhat do they live for? What do they find in life? What logic compels them to keep breathing?\u201d When at last they make friends, it becomes clear that Raif\u2019s reason for living cannot be his family. The relatives assembled under his roof treat him with the utmost contempt. And yet he welcomes their derision. Even on his deathbed, he seems to accept it as his due. But there is also a notebook, hidden in his desk drawer at work, which he asks his friend to destroy.</p> <p>When his friend reads it instead, he meets a younger Raif, sent to Berlin by his father to study the manufacture of soap. Only a few years have passed since Turkey and Germany fought together on the losing side in the first world war, so he is warmly received by the pension\u2019s other residents. But he is not much interested in the glad-eyed widows and the ruined colonialists, or for that matter, in soap. He devotes his days to reading, and his evenings to strolling the streets. One evening, he wanders into an exhibition of contemporary art to be mesmerised by a portrait of a Madonna in a fur coat. He goes back the next evening, and the next, until finally the artist introduces herself. For the work that Raif has been admiring is a self-portrait. And though Maria Puder is the sort of free-thinking new woman he could never have imagined possible, the two form an intensely platonic friendship, in which Maria becomes more male than female, and Raif more female than male. It suits them both, but the world, as it closes in on them, has other plans.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"38f91554407d2f4d62ded2f7ac345c881a55c760\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/38f91554407d2f4d62ded2f7ac345c881a55c760/0_0_500_725/345.jpg\" alt=\"Sabahattin Ali in Berlin\" width=\"345\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sabahattin Ali in Berlin</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As it did for Sabahattin Ali. Born in 1907 in what is now Bulgaria but was then part of the crumbling Ottoman empire, he, too, went to Berlin as a young man, and his 18 months there turned him into a freethinking man. Returning to Turkey with trunks of books, he was sent to teach German in the provincial city of Aydin, and it was here that he did his first short stint in prison, accused of poisoning his students\u2019 minds with dangerous ideas. After his release, he moved on to a job in the city of Konya, to be imprisoned again, after having been found guilty of reciting a poem critical of Ataturk. Told that he would never again find work as a teacher unless he was able to prove that he had changed his thinking, he published a poem in praise of Ataturk, entitled \u201cMy Love\u201d.</p> <p>By now he had established himself as a poet and writer of short stories. Like so many other writers whom he came to count as friends, he was a patriot of the socialist variety. The works for which he was most admired in his time were imbued by his dreams for the common man, and rooted in his knowledge of the injustices they suffered.</p> <p>Though he carried on working for state institutions, his dissident writings ultimately led to his being removed from his post in 1945. He moved from Ankara to Istanbul, to be drawn into the struggle against the fascists then dominating Turkey\u2019s single party state. The reward was a relentless hate campaign, which branded him and his fellow writers as traitors and Soviet sympathisers, but did not stop him establishing, with his friend Aziz Nesin, the now legendary weekly magazine devoted to political satire, Marco Pasha. It had, by its eighth issue, gained a circulation of 34,000. But it was not to last. After his co-editor was carted off to prison, Ali and others kept it going under a series of new names \u2013 The Undeniable Pasha, The Late Pasha, The Boorish Pasha, Ali Baba and his Forty Thieves. These were seen (and perhaps intended) to refer to the leader of the single party state, \u0130smet Pasha. With time, the newspaper ceased advertising itself as a weekly, promising instead to appear whenever it wasn\u2019t impounded or whenever its editors weren\u2019t locked up.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In his last letter to his wife, he boasted that soon he would be writing from Italy, France or England</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 1948, after yet another stint in prison, Ali was forced to shut down for good. Unable to find work as a teacher or writer, he decided, as had others in his circle, that there was no future for him in Turkey. Having applied, unsuccessfully, for a passport, it became clear that his only option was to find another way across the border. This may have been why he found, through friends, a job as a truck driver.</p> <p>In his last letter to his wife, he boasted that the next time she heard from him, he would be writing from Italy, France or England. There followed a long silence, which ended with a public confession by a smuggler named Ali Ertekin, who claimed to have accompanied Ali to the Bulgarian border and then battered him to death with a shovel in a fit of patriotic anger, after discovering his true identity. It was a detailed account: he even mentioned that Ali was reading at the time. However, it is commonly believed that Ali died while being interrogated by the National Security Service, and that Ertekin, with whom the service had links, was chosen to take the blame. That Ertekin served only a few weeks of a four-year sentence gives weight to this theory.</p> <p>Ertekin claimed to have committed the murder in the first days of April 1948. Ali\u2019s body \u2013 if indeed it was his body \u2013 was discovered months later by a local man, after which his bones were carted away to parts unknown for tests. The contents of the bag he had with him survive in a photograph that appeared in a national newspaper in January 1949, and again in the last pages of the memoir that his daughter, Filiz Ali, published in 1995. They include a leather jacket, a wristwatch, a pair of glasses, a shaving kit, a bottle of cologne, a notebook, a pencil case, a Balzac novel, another volume by Onegin, a notebook, a stack of well-leafed newspapers, and scattered photographs which are hard to see, except for one \u2013 of his wife Aliye \u2013 that has been artfully propped against his briefcase. His daughter is still waiting for these items to be returned.</p> <p>Her father\u2019s books, meanwhile, travelled on without impediment. During the cold war, they were translated into a number of languages in the Soviet bloc, and they are still much read in Bulgaria. There is even a statue of Ali in Ardino, the town of his birth.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Ali was publicly taunted for failing to act like a 'real man'. He never responded to it. Instead, he wrote</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In Turkey, meanwhile, Ali\u2019s death continues to overshadow his life, in much the same way as his life overshadows his work \u2013 and with good reason. It is impossible to read of his ordeals without finding contemporary echoes. The fate of Marko Pasha, his satirical weekly, calls to mind the almost 2,000 prosecutions by President Erdo\u011fan\u2019s of those who have dared to mock him. Ali\u2019s murder, allegedly at the hands of an offended patriot, was echoed by the 2007 murder of the Turkish-Armenian journalist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/19/turkish-police-chiefs-trial-journalist-hrant-dink\">Hrant Dink</a>. It also calls to mind the foiled shooting of the main opposition newspaper\u2019s editor, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/06/turkish-journalist-can-dundar-escapes-attempted-shooting-outside-court\">Can D\u00fcndar</a>, as he walked with his wife into court to receive a five-year sentence for publishing an article about the ruling party\u2019s involvement in the secret arming of jihadi groups in Syria. This was only a few weeks ago. And it was just the latest episode in a series of increasingly savage attacks on independent publishing and journalism. The suppression of critical voices is now as harsh, if not harsher, than it was during the fascist-dominated single party state that crushed Ali and so many others. When Ali\u2019s readers cry for him, they are also crying for themselves.</p> <p>And here we come to what the novelist and critic <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/kaya-genc\">Kaya Gen\u00e7</a> sees as the key to the mystery of Ali\u2019s suddenly renewed fame. His least acclaimed novel has become Turkey\u2019s most celebrated love story today because it refuses the traditional gender roles that Turkey\u2019s president seems hell-bent on enforcing, not just in the religious heartlands but also in the cities and towns that have been secularising, and liberalising, for almost a century. Anyone who departs from his retrograde norms, he decries as traitors or terrorists in the making. During last year\u2019s election campaign, he went so far as to accuse Turkey\u2019s LGBT community as being in league with Armenians, Kurds, and the hostile foreign powers that funded them. Hardly a day passes without his saying what a woman should be, and what a man \u2013 a real man \u2013 should do to keep her in her place.</p> <p>During his lifetime, and even after his death, Ali was publicly taunted for failing to act like a \u201creal man\u201d. There was endless innuendo about his time in Berlin. He never responded to it. Instead, he wrote <em>Madonna in a Fur </em><em>Coat</em>, conjuring up a time and a place in which it was possible to be true to one\u2019s nature, with air to breathe, and to live and love without pretence, if only for a brief period. It is not hard to see how a novel carrying those dreams but set far away, in a long lost Berlin, might promise a refuge, and some hope, to young readers in Turkey. They are only too aware that the space for free expression, and even free thought, is diminishing every day. But with this book in their hands, they can see that a story that is true to itself, and honest about love, can travel through walls. It has taken more than 70 years, says Gen\u00e7, but at last Ali is having his revenge \u2013 not just in Turkish, but in English, too.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-21T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Before I picked up <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/moby\">Moby</a>\u2019s new memoir, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/406016/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Porcelain</a>, I thought of him as a small, bald, cheeky chappy who made tuneful dance music. I knew he had a few unconventional beliefs (wasn\u2019t he vegan? Hardcore Christian? Maybe teetotal?), but filed him as essentially harmless. After reading Porcelain, well\u2026 Let\u2019s just say his book is packed with incident. Lots of dodgy sex, oceans of alcohol, antics a-gogo. Plus: cockroaches, raves, death, celebrities (from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/madonna\">Madonna</a> to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/robertdowneyjr\">Robert Downey Jr</a>, but not in starry situations) and good old Top Of The Pops. It\u2019s a romp of a book. Such outrageous fun, in fact, that Moby tells me he\u2019s noticed that people have regarded him differently after reading it.</p> <p>\u201cThey have a look,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s odd being on the receiving end of that look. It\u2019s a look of knowing, but it\u2019s also a look of concern. Like, \u2018Is everything OK?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>The fact is, his book makes me like Moby more. For a start, he writes brilliantly, with none of the self-indulgence of most pop memoirs: \u201cI wanted each chapter to be like an anecdote you\u2019d tell in a bar, to have a punchline,\u201d he says. And also, there\u2019s something touching about who he was back then. At one point, he writes this, about some club kids \u2013 \u201cThey were all doing obscene amounts of drugs and having sex with strangers, but they still seemed innocent\u201d \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly how he comes across. \u201cIt\u2019s quasi-Dickensian,\u201d he says. \u201cNaive boy from the country moves to the big city and things go wrong.\u201d</p> <p>We are drinking herbal tea and eating (very tasty) vegetables in Moby\u2019s newly opened vegan restaurant in blue-skied Los Angeles. It\u2019s a nice place and I am relaxed, but endearingly, Moby isn\u2019t. He picks up a fallen cushion and plumps it before putting it back on the bench; he asks me if I\u2019m too cold and alters the air con; he goes through the menu with me.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He was dance music\u2019s Adele: everyone liked his stuff. Then he blew it with a thrash punk LP</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Moby has lived on the west coast for six years, but had no problem transporting himself back to his past for the book. Sometimes he would be writing about being blind drunk in New York, \u201ccovered in filth and squalor\u201d, and look up from his laptop and be shocked to see his swimming pool, bathed in sunshine. \u201cThe writing felt true and the reality felt like fiction. It was like time travel.\u201d</p> <p>Let\u2019s zoom back in time with him, then. Porcelain concerns itself with Moby\u2019s life between 1989 and 1999, from when he moved to New York to just before the release of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/MobyStuff\">Play</a>, his fifth album, and the one that changed everything. Play was packed full of sample-heavy, catchy dance tunes, which buried themselves into everyday life. Even if you haven\u2019t actively listened to the album, you\u2019ll know the songs: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVwDlkJoITU\">Honey</a>, with its driving piano riff and Bessie Jones sample \u201cget my honey come back, sometimes\u201d; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3YMxM1_S48\">Natural Blues</a>, featuring another blues sample (\u201coh lordy, trouble so hard\u201d), this time from Vera Hall. (Moby sourced these samples, and others, from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Lomax\">Alan Lomax</a>\u2019s folk music field recordings.) <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/#q=Why+Does+My+Heart+moby+official\">Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad?</a> has featured on the GSCE syllabus for music since 2008. Anyway, the big thing about Play was that every single one of its tracks was subsequently <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/jun/15/moby-licenses-play\">licensed for advertising or films</a>. This was a huge deal at the time, and a huge deal for Moby. It moved him from the electronica shadows into the big league, changed him from a musician who scrabbled for a few thousand dollars to a fully fledged, in-the-spotlight, pop star overlord. For a while, Moby was dance music\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/adele\">Adele</a>: everyone liked his stuff.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9eb39fa7c6a6de2cffeb2baaaf5b3545fcea5241\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9eb39fa7c6a6de2cffeb2baaaf5b3545fcea5241/12_0_1469_1028/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Moby DJing in New York in 1989\" width=\"1000\" height=\"700\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">DJing in New York in 1989.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Moby\u2019s personal collection</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>None of this is hinted at in his memoir, however, because none of it was foreshadowed in real life. In real life, before Play, Moby was bumping around New York, getting DJ gigs in now legendary clubs like Mars and Nasa, as well as awful swingers\u2019 nights (he says he would play anywhere). His career, as careers do, took time. In 1992, he had success with one track, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_Qwo8sT9U0\">Go</a> (particularly in the UK, where we have always been more open to his music than the US) and made a few well-received albums.</p> <p>Then, in 1995, just at the moment dance music really crossed over, he blew whatever small chance he had by bringing out a thrash punk LP.</p> <p>He is funny about this and his musical work is all present and correct in Porcelain, but it takes second place to the more fascinating everyday happenings in his life. He\u2019s a dominatrix\u2019s sidekick (he calls himself Master Bobby and shouts at a businessman wearing fuchsia lingerie). He gets <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Lyme-disease/Pages/Introduction.aspx\">Lyme disease</a>, he dates indie girls and strippers; he lives in disused warehouses and crappy flats with weirded-out flatmates who want to set him on fire and buy the petrol to do so.</p> <p>What is strange is how he chose to compartmentalise his life. He bounced between out-there clubbers and the suburban devout, between hanging out in orgies and having a mostly unconsummated relationship with his Christian girlfriend (they would hand out vegan sandwiches to homeless people for thrills). He was monastic in his home habits, then would go out and socialise madly. He was a vegan, sober, nonsexual God-botherer partying in the blood-soaked Meatpacking District with the sex-and-druggers. In 1995, after being teetotal for eight years, he took up drinking again. There\u2019s a sort of relief in it. He had so many different personae to try to unite.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f33a1548de872f24dc5bf41f4d27f4176e3ac92\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f33a1548de872f24dc5bf41f4d27f4176e3ac92/46_127_1881_1176/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Moby on stage at Reading Festival, 1996\" width=\"1000\" height=\"625\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Reading Festival, 1996.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Scott Frassetto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Is he still like that?</p> <p>\u201cHmm. I still recognise that person, stumbling through life without much agency. There\u2019s enthusiasm and a good work ethic, but ultimately complete cluelessness, being baffled by everything. It\u2019s like being a snowball rolling down a mountain. The snowball might have started kind of pure, but by the end, it\u2019s filled with dead squirrels and sticks and rocks and wellies and garbage. You\u2019ve got this snowball at the end, but to what extent does it relate to or resemble that original snowball?\u201d</p> <p>Moby, as you see, does a good line in therapy talk (\u201cWell, we\u2019re in southern California, the land of veganism and therapy,\u201d he says), but he\u2019s also very funny. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/salmanrushdie\">Salman Rushdie</a> has given a glowing quote for the cover of Porcelain that references Moby\u2019s supposed ancestor <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/hermanmelville\">Herman Melville</a> (hence Moby, after Melville\u2019s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/moby-dick-23.html\">Moby-Dick</a>; his real name is Richard Melville Hall). He has started writing the next instalment, covering the 10 years post-Play. He says his publishers, so far, don\u2019t approve. They think his excesses make him too unsympathetic. Such as? \u201cOh, fame, money, degeneracy, debauchery, bottoming out,\u201d says Moby. What\u2019s not to like? \u201cI know! That\u2019s what I want to read in a book!\u201d</p> <p>Because it focuses on his life from 23 to 33 years old, Porcelain doesn\u2019t take on Moby\u2019s childhood. Still, tellingly, it opens with a scene concerning him and his mother. She is working in a laundromat, unhappy, furious, and he is sitting in the car, waiting for her to finish her shift. He is 10. He tells me he could have written a lot more about his young life \u2013 \u201cthere are maybe five memoirs in there\u201d \u2013 and he clearly had a tough time. His father died in a drink-driving accident when Moby was just two. His mother\u2019s family was wealthy (Moby\u2019s grandfather ran a successful Wall Street company), but she rejected her background and set off to make her own story. \u201cSometimes we would be living in a squat-ish house with three or four other drug-addicted hippies, with bands playing in the basement,\u201d he says. \u201cWhich sounds fun, but when you\u2019re in fourth grade trying to do homework and there are people smoking pot in the kitchen, or fighting\u2026\u201d Every so often, they would stay with his grandparents in wealthy Darien, Connecticut, which was nice, but made him feel poor and ashamed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We lived in a squat, with hippies and bands.

And so, the night before my mom\u2019s funeral, I set the alarm. But this completely reliable clock at some point was set forward 21 hours, which meant that if it were 3am it somehow got set forward to midnight. The only thing that could have happened is that, at some point during the night, I woke up in a fugue state and set the clock forward 21 hours, so I would miss her funeral\u2026 I must have set it forward 21 hours, because something in my subconscious said that was the only legitimate and expedient way to miss the funeral.\u201d</p> <p>I ask him how he feels about that now, and his eyes mist up a tiny bit. He is sad: not for himself, but for his family. \u201cShe was my mom, but more importantly in some ways she was my aunts\u2019 sister. And my grandmother\u2019s daughter. I feel guilty. But for myself, I don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>Not knowing how you feel about things is a protective instinct. Moby is a lovely companion, in real life and on the page, but he can seem detached from his emotions. When his mum told him she had cancer, she also told him that he has a half-brother. I ask him about this, assuming he would have got in touch. But no.</p> <p>\u201cIf it were a full brother, then that would be interesting, but it\u2019s a half-brother,\u201d he says. (\u201cIt\u201d!). \u201cIn terms of my genetic sequence, I have almost as much in common with you and most of the people in this restaurant as I would with a half-brother.\u201d And that\u2019s that.</p> <p>What Porcelain suggests is that Moby\u2019s greatest love back then wasn\u2019t his family, or a person, or even music, but a city. At heart, Porcelain is a love letter to old New York: that grubby, crumbling, dangerous place. Recently, Moby was describing it to some young friends, and they couldn\u2019t believe what he was describing; honouring the city of that time was a major motivation in his writing. \u201cNew York completely changed in those 10 years. In 1989, it was old New York\u2026 cheap, murder-y, dysfunctional, fires\u2026 and by the end of the 90s, it was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/jayz\">Jay Z</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bottle_service\">bottle service</a> and condos.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ab00c2921dbc49b864a86c8a17a11d440d50904e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab00c2921dbc49b864a86c8a17a11d440d50904e/0_0_451_568/397.jpg\" alt=\"Moby in his first promo shoot, 1988\" width=\"397\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">In his first promo shoot in 1988.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joseph Kugielsky</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It took Moby a long time to fall out of love with New York, but he did. He gave up drink and his love ended. \u201cI was walking up Orchard Street, and it was one of those shitty days, 36 degrees Fahrenheit, sleeting, grey snow, and I realised there is sometimes an elective quality to suffering.\u201d New York suited his drinking; he classifies himself as \u201can old-timey alcoholic, I mean, there\u2019s just no doubt, you know?\u201d He would try going out for a couple of drinks and find himself \u201cat 8am, with strangers in my house, bags of drugs, I\u2019d had about 15 drinks, having sex with a complete stranger. Which is great, but that was my best attempt to drink in moderation. Also, I thought I was going on these great adventures, and the truth is I was going from one bar to another on Ludlow Street.\u201d</p> <p>So he got sober and moved to LA. For a while, he lived in Marlon Brando\u2019s old house, the fabulous <a href=\"http://la.curbed.com/2014/11/19/10019778/moby-just-sold-the-incredible-wolfs-lair-castle-compound-for-a-6mm\">Wolf\u2019s Lair</a>, an actual castle, but it soon felt too big. Now he\u2019s in a three-bedroom place: his musical equipment is in one bedroom, his exercise stuff in another, and he sleeps in the third. Hardly Jay Z, but he seems happy.</p> <p>In the past few years, Moby has reassessed his life. He wants to carry on making music \u2013 he has an album coming out this year \u2013 but he doesn\u2019t want to tour. He\u2019s happy for people to pay for his music, but he doesn\u2019t mind giving it away and, to this end, has set up a <a href=\"http://mobygratis.com\">website</a> so that student filmmakers can use his albums as soundtracks for free. He\u2019s stopped caring what other people think of him (not much social media, just occasionally posting on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/moby/?hl=en\">Instagram</a>, mostly cute animals or nature scenes). And he\u2019s decided that animal rights are his life\u2019s work.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s my day job \u2013 animal rights,\u201d he says. \u201cMaking music and writing books and doing other things is what I love, and it\u2019s fun, but I don\u2019t see it as work. You know, a lot of activism is single-issue activism. Like say, someone campaigns about turning land into a park. There\u2019s the land, you turn it into a park, it benefits the community \u2013 that\u2019s good. But it\u2019s limited. But the thing with animal agriculture, everything is covered by it. There\u2019s the animal side of it: most people who are not sociopaths can agree that animal suffering is not a good thing. But then there\u2019s the climate change aspect, the rainforest deforestation, famine \u2013 the reason there\u2019s famine is because food that could be fed to humans is fed to animals instead \u2013 then heart disease, diabetes, cancer, erectile dysfunction\u2026 Animal activism is my life\u2019s purpose. If someone came to me and said if I could die, and my death would somehow serve the purpose of saving animals, I\u2019d do it in a heartbeat.\u201d</p> <p>Then of course, there\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.littlepinerestaurant.com/\">the restaurant</a>, which he finds a constant trial. \u201cEverything has to be perfect. I\u2019m an emotional perfectionist \u2013 I just want things to feel as good as they possibly can for the people who are experiencing them.\u201d</p> <p>He did have another vegan restaurant, in New York, called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teany\">TeaNY</a>, which he opened in 2002, with his then girlfriend. This was a disaster, as they split up soon after, and, though they\u2019re still on good terms, he doesn\u2019t seem to know if TeaNY is still going. Relationships don\u2019t appear to be Moby\u2019s forte: he hooks up with a couple of women in the book who seem great, but he can\u2019t make it last. Was he just a sex dog? \u201cI don\u2019t think I was driven by sex. The way I dated was motived by the desire to be validated in someone\u2019s eyes. And clearly the desire to have sex as well, but it was like seeking validation without attachment or obligation.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"104cff986a919e1c173d56b104e4ad8910aa36a3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/104cff986a919e1c173d56b104e4ad8910aa36a3/0_0_6732_8984/749.jpg\" alt=\"Moby appearing to hover above a stream, wearing a silver space suit\" width=\"749\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Moby calls himself a \u2018developmentally disabled space alien or robot\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Buck for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He also thinks his difficulties with his mum had an effect. \u201cIf you\u2019re constantly ashamed when you\u2019re growing up, when you become an adult you\u2019re constantly ashamed. And when you get close to people you assume they will only like you as long as they see you in your best light. There is the profound desire for closeness and the profound fear of the other person. You start getting close to someone, they do something that might not be perfect, and it triggers a terror response and you run away\u2026 By you, I mean me, of course.\u201d</p> <p>Anyway, he\u2019s been in a relationship for eight months now, his first in 10 years. It seems to be going OK, though he can\u2019t really tell. He calls himself a \u201cdevelopmentally disabled space alien or robot\u201d and he keeps having to ask his girlfriend things: \u201cLike, is it OK if I go to bed after you do?\u201d He\u2019s also pretty set on not having children. He says, \u201cif the person I\u2019m dating got pregnant, sure \u2013 I\u2019d happily be involved and help out as much as I possibly can, but it\u2019s not something I long to do\u201d, which is about as detached as you can get without running away. He\u2019s going to adopt a couple of dogs after he comes back from his book tour, he thinks. He seems able to feel great emotion for humanity and animals in general, but finds it harder one-on-one.</p> <p>We talk a little bit about his Christianity; towards the end of the book, he starts questioning it, and he says now that he still understands the desire for spirituality, just not institutionalised belief systems or \u201cideological rigidity\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think that God cares what jersey you wear,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not like Man United and Leeds\u2026 is that the right UK sports reference?\u201d</p> <p>Leeds aren\u2019t in the Premiership any more.</p> <p>\u201cOK, Arsenal? Man United and Arsenal: that tribal rivalry is really fun in sport, but I don\u2019t think it should be part of divinity.\u201d</p> <p>We are having a laugh now; I feel as though I\u2019m talking to a friend. Moby is quite the most low-key multimillionaire I have ever met. He is modest. He looks the way he always did: unflashy with his shirt over a T-shirt, creative casual, unrich. He hasn\u2019t even had his teeth done, which is almost prosecutable in LA. We talk a bit about money and he says he thinks materialism doesn\u2019t work, meaning it doesn\u2019t actually make anyone properly happy. He should know, of course.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ffa9fbbc436ad689007ae1da80ca91a88f6fa2df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffa9fbbc436ad689007ae1da80ca91a88f6fa2df/0_0_3000_1997/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Moby on stage at Le Z\u00e9nith in Paris in 2015\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">On stage at Le Z\u00e9nith in Paris in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Moby seems to be enjoying his life, now he\u2019s not spending a big part of it drunk. \u201cI love reading and travelling to interesting parts of the world, and having time to think and write and make music and do activism. Life is short, and we have a limited amount of time and energy, and it\u2019s just so much easier trying to be your honest self.\u201d</p> <p>I take the opportunity to ask him about a long-standing rumour. Supposedly, years ago, Moby and his friends would play a prank at parties. One of them would unzip his flies and hang his willy out of his trousers, then the others would challenge him to go up to someone famous and \u201cknob touch\u201d them. I ask him if this ever happened, or if it was made up.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s both,\u201d he says, and pauses. \u201cHmm, there\u2019s a funny side to this story. I might change it because I don\u2019t know if I want it to follow me around. I had some friends from college who would do that. They would get very drunk, pull their willy out and just brush it up against people. Because it was funny. So what I will say is that a friend of mine once did that to Donald Trump.\u201d I laugh. \u201cIt was a restaurant on Park Avenue around 20th Street, some fundraising event, when Trump was just a New York real-estate developer.\u201d</p> <p>You seem to remember it well. Did that person get extra kudos for Trump?</p> <p>\u201cYou can extrapolate as to who that person might be, and that\u2019s as much as I can say,\u201d says Moby, a man who can\u2019t resist a funny anecdote, who\u2019s happy to tell the truth, who has lived a full and full-on life \u2013 but who is old enough now to know that he doesn\u2019t want all the consequences that come wrapped in the adventures. Fair enough. As long as he keeps writing all those stories down, we\u2019re good.</p> <ul> <li>Porcelain by Moby is published by Faber &amp; Faber at \u00a314.99.

      "body": "<p>Two prominent American colleges have removed advertisements for South Korean government scholarships that bar people with HIV, following the intervention of human rights activists.</p> <p>Princeton University on Thursday took down a posting on its website that advertised the Korean Government Scholarship Program, which funds study at universities in South Korea, over concerns that it was discriminatory. The move came less than a fortnight after the Frederick S Pardee School of Global Studies at Boston University quietly removed references to the scholarship in similar circumstances. </p> <p>UCLA, Stanford University and the University of Portland continue to host details of the scholarship on their websites, while Ohio State University directs students to another scholarship, Teach and Learn in Korea, that also bans HIV-positive applicants. </p> <p>\u201cBased on a review conducted by the Office of International Programs and the Office of Institutional Equity and Diversity, a scholarship posting stating that HIV positive individuals are ineligible (without any reference to specific health-related reasons for such a restriction) contradicts our policies and commitment to non-discrimination,\u201d the college <a href=\"http://dailyprincetonian.com/opinion/2016/05/university-removes-posting-of-discriminatory-scholarship/\">said in a statement given to the Daily Princetonian</a> student newspaper ahead of its anticipated public release. </p> <p>Dr Adil Najam, the Pardee School dean, did not return a request for comment. Colleges still advertising the scholarships also failed to respond.</p> <p>Princeton and Boston University took the action after Joe Amon, a Princeton professor and the former director of Human Rights Watch, and Benjamin Wagner, a US human rights lawyer, respectively expressed their concerns to college authorities. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/12/boston-university-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-eric-ruske\">Boston University sexual harassment suit claims school protected professor</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cPrinceton\u2019s statement that they are removing the posting of the Korean Government Scholarship is the right decision,\u201d said Amon. \u201cBut suggesting that the problem is that the scholarship does not include specific health-related reasons misses the point. As the WHO, UNAIDS and the US Department of Health and Human Services all plainly state, there is no medical reason that justifies discrimination against people living with HIV from pursuing educational opportunities or traveling to another country.\u201d</p> <p>Wagner, who successfully led a case against South Korea\u2019s mandatory testing of foreign English teachers before a UN committee on racial discrimination last year, said colleges advertising the programs could be in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. That law bans discrimination in education based on disability, including HIV status. </p> <p>\u201cWhile the scholarships aren\u2019t offered by the US schools directly, there\u2019s likely enough of a nexus between Korean government \u2018no Aids\u2019 scholarships and the promotion of it by the US schools to justify a complaint of \u2018harassment\u2019 \u2013 at a minimum \u2013 to the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, Office for Civil Rights,\u201d Wagner said.</p> <p>Recipients of the Korean scholarships are subject to HIV testing in South Korea and those who test positive face ejection from the program.</p> <p>Wagner expressed concern that HIV-positive applicants unaware of their status could be subject to harassment and discrimination if outed in the country, where the virus is heavily stigmatized.</p> <p>\u201cThe nightmare scenario that I want to see avoided is what I saw happen to a student I represented in 2009 who was outed as HIV positive in an extremely hostile manner,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was threatened with expulsion from the university, told his status would be disclosed to faculty and pressured to leave the country.</p> <p>In South Korea, HIV/Aids is often associated with prostitution, homosexuality and drug use, all of which are widely seen as morally degenerate. The country tests certain foreigners for the virus, despite the UN Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination ruling the policy to be discriminatory last year. South Korea has defended its policy as necessary to protect public health. </p> <p>Apart from American colleges, the scholarships are also being advertised by universities in Vietnam, Thailand, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Spain, Greece and Poland, and on the official website of the government of Canada. </p>",

      "body": "<p>Meet Hugh Grant. No, not the famously charming Four Weddings and a Funeral actor, but the far more controversial self-described \u201cScottish optimist\u201d who is chairman and chief executive of US agrochemical company Monsanto, AKA \u201cthe most evil company in the world\u201d.</p> <p>It\u2019s a big weekend for Grant and Monsanto, a company that has been fighting against adverse publicity since <a href=\"http://www.monsanto.com/newsviews/pages/agent-orange-background-monsanto-involvement.aspx\">its production of deadly herbicide Agent Orange in the 1960s</a> and, more recently, its role at the forefront of genetically engineered crops. Now it is battling an unsolicited multibillion-dollar takeover from the German chemicals company Bayer that would create the dominant force in the world\u2019s food supply.</p> <p>It\u2019s a role reversal for Grant, who had overseen Monsanto \u2013 which also makes the controversial and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/22/european-commission-glyphosate-weedkiller-leaked-proposal\">probably carcinogenic Roundup weedkiller</a> \u2013 during a series of takeovers by the agrochemical giant. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/19/bayer-gm-foods-monsato-talks-deal\">Bayer in talks to buy GM food company Monsanto</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Last month, one such attempt hit a roadblock when Monsanto dropped its long pursuit of the Swiss seed and pesticide maker Syngenta, losing to ChemChina. Grant told investors that Monsanto was better off alone. But, analysts say, Grant had left the firm vulnerable to a takeover itself. </p> <p>Earning forecasts had been cut, and the company was entangled in legal disputes across the world, sending its shares down almost 20% before news of the Bayer approach. \u201cIt\u2019s a relentless string of bad news,\u201d Jonas Oxgaard, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein, told Bloomberg. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like they forgot to sacrifice a goat to the gods.\u201d</p> <p>The news will get worse this weekend, when hundreds of thousands of activists join a day of <a href=\"http://www.march-against-monsanto.com/\">coordinated marches</a> against Monsanto in more than 400 cities across the world. In New York, campaigners promoted the march with <a href=\"http://www.march-against-monsanto.com/march-against-monsanto-launches-time-square-billboard-to-coincide-with-global-protests/\">a billboard in Times Square</a> showing a topless model and the slogan \u201cKeep GMOs out of your genes\u201d. </p> <p>Grant, 57, is used to controversy. Born in Larkhall, near Glasgow, he has worked at Monsanto since he was 23, first in Scotland and in Asia before moving to the US and becoming president and CEO in 2003. </p> <p>He regularly faces protests from campaigners outside events, and even stars of the silver screen have been known to give him an earful. Just before Christmas, Oscar-nominated actor Mark Ruffalo accosted Grant in green room of CBS studios to tell him: \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.trueactivist.com/monsanto-cutting-12-of-employees-as-profits-continue-to-fall/\">You are poisoning people</a>. You are killing small farms. You are killing bees. What you are doing is dead wrong.\u201d</p> <p>Writing about the encounter, Ruffalo said he felt he had to approach Grant because he was \u201cbeside myself watching this guy who is responsible for so much misery and sickness throughout the world slime his way through his interview. I could not hold my tongue.\u201d </p> <p>Grant\u2019s reply: \u201cWhat I think we are doing is good.\u201d<br /></p> <p>When protests are expected, Grant likes to be prepared. On the mornings of the company\u2019s always-fiery annual meetings, Grant, who is paid more than $11m (\u00a37.6m), makes arrangements for protesting shareholders to meet scientists and himself before taking their questions publicly at the meeting. </p> <p>At this year\u2019s meeting, Zen Honeycutt, founder of Moms Across America, who described him on <a href=\"http://www.momsacrossamerica.com/full_account_of_monsanto_shareholder_meeting\">her website</a> as \u201cthe CEO of the Most Evil Company in the World\u201d, told Grant: \u201cI\u2019m imploring you to choose a new direction. Stop poisoning our children,\u201d in a reference to claimed links between Roundup and autism and cancer. </p> <p>Pointing out that he was a father of three, Grant, who holds molecular biology and agricultural degrees from Glasgow and Edinburgh universities, said various studies had shown there was \u201cno linkage\u201d between glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, and any human illnesses.</p> <p>However, the European Union this week <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-eu-glyphosate-idUSKCN0YA1M1\">delayed a vote</a> on whether to continue to allow Roundup sales beyond June due to concerns that it could be carcinogenic. </p> <p>Concerns were led by France and Germany, and those countries are likely to lead a fight against the Bayer-Monsanto tie-up, which some fear could lead to more GMO crops and potentially dangerous pesticides entering Europe. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2016/may/05/monsanto-dow-syngenta-rush-for-mega-mergers-puts-food-security-at-risk\">Monsanto, Dow, Syngenta: rush for mega-mergers puts food security at risk</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cGermans view Monsanto as the main example of American corporate evil,\u201d Heike Moldenhauer, a biotechnology expert at German environmental group BUND, told Bloomberg. \u201cIt may not be such a good idea to take over Monsanto, as that means incorporating its bad reputation, which would also make Bayer more vulnerable.\u201d</p> <p>Campaigners are also worried that the proposed takeover, which was made <a href=\"http://news.monsanto.com/press-release/corporate/monsanto-comments-recent-media-reports\">public by Monsanto</a> late into the night on Wednesday just hours after a senior executive had dismissed rumors of an approach as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-monsanto-coo-idUSKCN0Y92JK\">\u201cwild speculation\u201d</a>, will leave control of the world\u2019s food supply in too few hands. </p> <p>If Monsanto is bought (the price has not been made public, but it is said to be about $42bn) the combined Bayer-Monsanto will control 29% of the world\u2019s seed market and 24% of the pesticide market. </p> <p>\u201cA further concentration of corporate power in the agriculture/chemical sector would be bad news for farmers and consumers,\u201d said Franziska Achterberg, Greenpeace\u2019s EU food policy director. \u201cIt would accelerate the decrease in crop diversity while limiting consumer choice. Farmers would become even more dependent on just a handful of global players. They would find it harder to choose what they grow and how they grow it.\u201d </p> <p>Grant says the problem is that consumers have become too distant from the food they eat, with just 2% of the world\u2019s population involved in agriculture, and the food industry needs to do a better job of educating them about the challenges ahead. </p> <p>He <a href=\"http://www.fortuneconferences.com/brainstorm-e-2016/\">told the Fortune Brainstorm E conference</a> in California this week that to feed an ever-growing population, food production needed to double by 2050 while using roughly the same land area and trying to reduce water use. </p> <p>After playing defense, his aim now is to convince millennials of the need for more GM crops, which require less natural resources to grow. He\u2019s started by hiring more young people. \u201cWe have an enormous community of millennials, and they\u2019re there because they want to be there,\u201d he said. If you\u2019re interested in plant biology, the \u201cparty is at Monsanto\u201d.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>",

It\u2019s known for its emphasis on sports activities, from parkour and tree climbing to mountain boarding, kayaking and baby bouldering (whatever that is). Aside from the extensive list of performers, there is a host of locally sourced produce (much of it street-food style), a Sunday family picnic, and even a woodland spa. The nature programme is unparalleled, featuring foraging, nature walks, evening expeditions to look for nightjars, and pond dipping. <em>Pippingford Park, East Sussex</em> </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"72ef3982fa037669883b32c200a0f1c7caf5efb4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/72ef3982fa037669883b32c200a0f1c7caf5efb4/0_0_1400_841/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Elderflower Fields, East Sussex.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"601\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Elderflower Fields, East Sussex.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><a href=\"http://blissfields.co.uk\"><strong>Blissfields</strong></a><strong> 30 June-2 July</strong></h2> <p>Considered one of the highest-quality family boutique festivals (with a \u201cposh wash\u201d pass giving you access to flush toilets and hot showers), everyone raves about its Angel Gardens, the space for children and adults alike. This year it has a Snow White and the 700 Children theme, with magic mirror-making workshops, dwarf training school and glittery apples. There is also a potion shop hidden in the trees, pony riding, science shows and yoga. The lineup is class too, including Dizzee Rascal, Everything Everything and Norman Jay. <em>Vicarage Farm, near Winchester, Hampshire</em> </p> <h2><a href=\"http://deershedfestival.com\"><strong>Deer Shed</strong></a><strong> 22-24 July</strong></h2> <p>Run by a family for families, Deer Shed is for the discerning festival goer, offering the best in music, food, kids\u2019 entertainment and (its USP) science. With a movies theme this year, the lineup includes Richard Hawley, Beth Orton, Anna Calvi and Steve Mason. Expect top-notch theatre, Aardman model-making workshops, Matthew Bourne dance classes, and a massive science programme of events on tree identification, forensics, robogals (to encourage more girls into science and tech industries) and bridge building from lolly sticks. At Deer Shed there are no designated kids\u2019 areas because \u201cthey\u2019re not zoo animals\u201d.

Award-winning theatre, storytelling, costume making by the V&amp;A, campfires, forest night camps, a cricket match \u2026 and on it goes.

Expect pillow fights, a bake-off, sports day, bubble hours, midnight feasts, a brilliant children\u2019s literature programme and a brand new Tales of Animalia area run by the Fabularium. On the practical side, there\u2019s a baby-feeding boudoir, nappy-changing tent, bottle warmers and an area where baby bubble baths are drawn from 5pm-7pm every evening.

      "body": "<h2><strong>The planter</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"http://ninabaxter.co.uk\"><em>Nina Baxter</em></a><em>, garden designer, and head of an all-woman planting team for </em><a href=\"http://www.jothompson-garden-design.co.uk/about/\"><em>Jo Thompson</em></a><em>\u2019s show gardens</em></p> <p>The first show I did for [designer] <a href=\"http://www.andysturgeon.com\">Andy Sturgeon</a>, I did about seven plants in one day. The next day, I asked Andy what he thought. He said, \u201cWell, it could be a bit better. Maybe start again?\u201d I had to take out everything I\u2019d done. But after a while, your eye locks in and you start to see how it should be \u2013 it\u2019s that balance between making everything look natural and not showing vast amounts of soil. At the end, I go through and every now and then take out a plant. It\u2019s amazing how much better it looks.</p> <p>You\u2019ve got to think of every angle: the judges look under things, over things, behind things \u2013 and you\u2019ve got to have that planted up. <a href=\"http://www.yukotanabe.com\">Yuko Tanabe</a> on our team comes from Japan every year; she\u2019s tiny, so can get into awkward places to plant.</p> <p>By the end of the week, everyone is slightly manic, because you\u2019ve all been working 14-hour days. Whatever the weather, you know you have a deadline: you have to get that garden done.</p> <p>Thousands of plants have to be offloaded from trucks. The big trees and shrubs tend to be put in by the landscape team; the planting team deal with smaller shrubs, roses and perennials \u2013 about 6,000 plants.</p> <p>It is difficult to concentrate with lorries continually going past, and when people are stone-cutting, you get covered in dust. But the worst thing is when the plane trees on Main Avenue dump their pollen. It\u2019s horrible: you get it in the back of your throat and in your eyes \u2013 they call it Chelsea flu. Everyone hopes for a big strong wind overnight so it takes it off the trees all in one go.</p> <p>You\u2019ve got to constantly look after the plants, nurture them, deadhead them, put up shade tents \u2013 they\u2019ve got to look perfect.</p> <p>I\u2019m a garden designer as well, and I battle against people who want their gardens to be like Chelsea. I tell them, this is a picture of a garden at one particular time of year, and that the same garden in August would have very little going on. But you might spot some trends or a plant combination, and adapt those ideas.</p> <p>It\u2019s very important to have a good shed behind the show garden, because it becomes your home for the duration of the build. We had massive shed envy last year: <a href=\"http://www.scapedesign.com\">James Basson</a>, who did the <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/shows-events/rhs-chelsea-flower-show/exhibitors/archive/2015/gardens/a-perfumer%E2%80%99s-garden-in-grasse\">L\u2019Occitane garden</a>, had a coffee machine in his, so we were sneaking in to get cups of espresso.</p> <p>There\u2019s that moment when the planting team finishes and the sponsor\u2019s team comes in to manage the garden for show week. It\u2019s a difficult moment, because you feel real ownership of it, and you\u2019re so tired and emotional. It\u2019s like your baby.</p> <h2><strong>The veteran</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1746298d9a5d03d6ac97171814c9c1928c63236b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1746298d9a5d03d6ac97171814c9c1928c63236b/0_440_6144_3686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ricky Dorlay, master plantsman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ricky Dorlay, master plantsman: \u2018It\u2019s a stress at times, but it is a challenge I enjoy.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Ricky Dorlay, master plantsman, </em><a href=\"http://www.hillier.co.uk/\"><em>Hillier Nurseries</em></a><em>, Hampshire</em></p> <p>This is my 51st Chelsea for Hillier Nurseries. We take 3,500-4,000 plants to Chelsea, and my job is to get them to the show in prime condition. The company\u2019s going for its 71st gold medal, as I am for my 51st.</p> <p>It\u2019s a big team effort. There\u2019s a great friendship, a lot of laughs. I\u2019ve got to know the other teams, and there\u2019s a lot of camaraderie. People will joke, \u201cOh, no, not you again \u2013 haven\u2019t you retired yet?\u201d</p> <p>Our exhibit features a lot of structural plants \u2013 some of the cornus and Japanese maples have been going to Chelsea for 20 or 30 years. It can be quite a stress on plants, and it takes them a year or two to get over it, as it does us. One year, I had flowering cherries in prime condition, put them on the lorry, but there was an accident and we were held up for three hours. By the time we got to London, they were in full flower, so they all had to go home again.</p> <p>I\u2019m 76 this year. I can\u2019t deny that, inwardly, I\u2019ll know when the time comes to stop going. It\u2019s a stress at times, but it is a challenge I enjoy. It\u2019s all about getting another gold..</p> <h2><strong>The young plantsman</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d0934fa8d6fe4a28c205e1856dcdea19292554fb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d0934fa8d6fe4a28c205e1856dcdea19292554fb/0_1023_5986_3591/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jamie Butterworth, nurseryman\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jamie Butterworth, nurseryman: \u2018It\u2019s the World Cup of gardening.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://jamiebutterworth.com/\"><em>Jamie Butterworth</em></a><em>, show plant manager, </em><a href=\"http://hortusloci.co.uk\"><em>Hortus Loci nursery</em></a><em>, Hampshire, raising plants for five Main Avenue show gardens</em></p> <p>I start work at 6am and leave about 6 or 7pm; it\u2019s pretty full on, but I love it. Because I\u2019ve spent so long talking to the designers, I\u2019ll be picking the plants that most fit the garden they are creating. We\u2019ll be sending up around 20,000 plants for Main Avenue gardens, plus trade stands, and the smaller gardens.</p> <p>I\u2019ll go on press day \u2013 I\u2019ve managed to blag myself a ticket. I\u2019ve always said I would swap Christmas for press day, because I love it so much. I first worked at Chelsea when I was 16, and I\u2019ve been back every year since. I am 21 now.</p> <p>I\u2019m an RHS ambassador for secondary schools. I\u2019ll go into schools to show them that gardening isn\u2019t just weeding; it\u2019s working with multimillion-pound gardens and designers, travelling the world to find plants, even working with Nasa on growing plants in space.</p> <p>I love the pressure, the adrenaline. You work for as long as you can, as hard as you can, then you go to the pub afterwards. It\u2019s the World Cup of gardening.</p> <h2><strong>The judge</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6888a81d84a6afba891bdf30774a5541168150fa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6888a81d84a6afba891bdf30774a5541168150fa/0_585_4637_2781/1000.jpg\" alt=\"James Alexander-Sinclair, RHS judge\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">James Alexander-Sinclair, RHS judge: \u2018Occasionally, judging panels go a bit crazy.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://jamesalexandersinclair.com\"><em>James Alexander-Sinclair</em></a><em>, garden designer and RHS show garden judge</em></p> <p>I\u2019ve been judging at Chelsea since 2008, and I consider it an honour: it means people trust what you say. Over the last three or four years, we\u2019ve tried to make the judging process as transparent as possible. If a judge says, \u201cOh, I don\u2019t like that\u201d, they have to justify why.</p> <p>There are some shoo-in gold medals, but there are always gardens that surprise you: you walk on thinking one thing and another when you walk off \u2013 maybe you\u2019ve seen something, or something has been pointed out to you by the other judges, and your mind has been changed. Each garden will have 45 minutes spent on judging it. It\u2019s a democratic process: there\u2019s debate and chat. We try to keep it fun, but serious.</p> <p>Occasionally, judging panels go a bit crazy. We all swoop and say, \u201cThis is the most amazing garden.\u201d Then a moderator comes along and says, \u201cDid you realise there\u2019s a whole patch over here that\u2019s dead?\u201d The moderator is there to make sure the judging is consistent.</p> <p>I\u2019ve judged gardens that didn\u2019t get gold medals, but I\u2019ve adored them; they were lovely places to be, but maybe the brick wall wasn\u2019t straight or the trees hadn\u2019t quite come into leaf. What you are looking for is excellence, and excellence doesn\u2019t mean \u201cquite good\u201d.</p> <p>I know by Monday lunchtime who has won a gold medal and best in show. We\u2019re sworn to secrecy and won\u2019t tell anybody until Tuesday morning, so that\u2019s hard, but one copes. You wander around looking smug.</p> <h2><strong>The broadcaster</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4d33156a6519012865e69769f33e7b10f5413a96\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d33156a6519012865e69769f33e7b10f5413a96/0_364_5458_3275/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Abdullai Adejumo, BBC producer-director\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Abdullai Adejumo, BBC producer-director: \u2018I\u2019ve never been to Chelsea before.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rebecca Rees for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Abdullai </em><a href=\"https://www.thetalentmanager.co.uk/people/1034/abdullai-adejumo\"><em>Adejumo</em></a><em>, producer-director of </em><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007lyhs\"><em>BBC television\u2019s Chelsea coverage</em></a></p> <p>I\u2019ve never been to Chelsea before, but I know it\u2019s the greatest flower show there is. We\u2019ll be broadcasting about 13 hours of TV, starting 22 May; both live coverage and films we\u2019ve produced in advance. I\u2019ve worked on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007tcw7\">The One Show</a>, so the pace of it won\u2019t faze me \u2013 we are filming stuff on the ground that will go on TV that day; there\u2019s a lot of pressure to make it look good. You\u2019ve got to be able to deliver in record time.</p> <p>There will be about 150 BBC staff at Chelsea; I am one of 10 directors, each with a crew, a cameraman and a soundman. We\u2019ll be on our feet pretty much all day. I\u2019m keeping my fingers crossed for sun.</p> <p>I have a garden and a lawnmower, and I\u2019m hoping Chelsea will inspire me. I want to get the best out of it personally, but also professionally \u2013 the best footage, the best stories. I am looking forward to getting inside some of the gardens and learning what all the fuss is about.</p> <h2><strong>The visitor</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1499073342bb47b0395804f88de8a8c226a0102f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1499073342bb47b0395804f88de8a8c226a0102f/0_877_4912_2947/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rosemary Cox, regular Chelsea visitor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rosemary Cox, regular Chelsea visitor: \u2018We have an all-day ticket, so we\u2019re not rushing.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Sophia Evans for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Rosemary Cox has been going to Chelsea for more than 30 years</em></p> <p>I wouldn\u2019t miss it for the world. My parents used to go, too, so I heard all about it for many years. Eventually I got to go, with my late husband John, more than 30 years ago. There were carnations everywhere, plus lupins and sweetpeas; there was one stand of <a href=\"http://www.mcbeansorchids.co.uk/\">McBeans orchids</a> \u2013 they were really exotic.

Attorneys for Guzm\u00e1n said on Friday, however, that they would be filing \u201cmultiple legal challenges\u201d against his extradition.<br /></p> <p>Friday\u2019s ruling covered an extradition request from a Texas federal court related to charges of conspiracy to import and distribute cocaine and marijuana, money laundering, arms possession and murder, and another extradition request from a federal court in California.</p> <p>But federal prosecutors in New York\u2019s eastern district, where Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s network allegedly sent almost four tonnes of cocaine in 2002-03, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/11/nyregion/el-chapo-could-be-tried-in-brooklyn-court-official-says.html\">are</a> <a href=\"http://nypost.com/2016/05/10/el-chapo-to-be-extradited-to-new-york/\">reported</a> to have won the right to try him after competing with rival cases including Chicago, San Diego, and El Paso for the justice department\u2019s approval.<br /></p> <p>\u201cIt is a calculus that involves a lot of different issues, but what it boils down to at the end of day is: who\u2019s got the best charges and who\u2019s got the best evidence,\u201d said Theresa Van Vliet, a former chief of narcotics at the justice department. \u201cIt\u2019s as simple as that.\u201d</p> <p>A grand jury indictment filed in Brooklyn in September 2014, when the US attorney general, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/loretta-lynch\">Loretta Lynch</a>, was the district\u2019s top federal prosecutor, charged Guzm\u00e1n and an ally with 12 murders that were carried out in Mexico between 2000 and 2008, along with two attempted murders and multiple murder conspiracies against rival cartels.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"2f05f8db215171746d9ba5e06a9717a85de42215\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2f05f8db215171746d9ba5e06a9717a85de42215/0_47_4029_2418/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Loretta Lynch, the current US attorney general, filed a grand jury indictment against Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n in 2014 when she was the top federal prosecutor in Brooklyn.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Loretta Lynch, the current US attorney general, filed a grand jury indictment against Joaqu\u00edn Guzm\u00e1n in 2014 when she was the top federal prosecutor in Brooklyn.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Lane/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Among the murders was that of Roberto Velasco Bravo, Mexico\u2019s director of investigation for organized crime, who was assassinated in Mexico City in April 2008. Guzm\u00e1n was also accused of the murders in 2005 of six \u201cJohn Does\u201d, whose identities were disclosed to grand jurors but kept secret from the public.<br /></p> <p>But a new indictment, which was filed in Brooklyn last week and supersedes previous charges against Guzm\u00e1n, now features only one paragraph accusing him and his co-defendant \u2013 fellow drug lord Ismael Zambada Garc\u00eda \u2013 of a murder conspiracy against unspecified \u201cpersons who posed a threat to the Sinaloa cartel\u201d.<br /></p> <p>Asked whether this meant that Guzm\u00e1n was no longer accused of murder, Nellin McIntosh, a spokeswoman for the US attorney\u2019s office in Brooklyn, said: \u201cNo comment.\u201d McIntosh confirmed that no public announcement of the new indictment was made.<br /></p> <p>Several legal analysts pointed to the possibility that the removal of murder charges could make it easier to have Guzm\u00e1n extradited from Mexico, which does not allow the transfer of suspects who may face the death penalty.<br /></p> <p>The Mexican foreign ministry\u2019s statement on Friday said: \u201cThe US government provided sufficient assurances that the death penalty shall not apply if Mr Guzm\u00e1n Loera were extradited and tried in that country.\u201d<br /></p> <p>\u201cThe are many life sentences that can be found in the narcotics counts,\u201d said Kendall Coffey, a former US attorney in Miami, who handled major drugs cases. \u201cIt makes plenty of sense to adjust the indictment.\u201d<br /></p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/jan/11/el-chapo-arrest-mexican-marines-raid-ends-in-shootout-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4fyzp\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2436991\"            data-video-name=\"El Chapo arrest: Mexican marines' raid ends in shootout  \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            data-video-poster=\"https://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2016/1/11/1452552880192/KP_1318138_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-569432bce4b0962b6cc0e691\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/audio/video/2016/1/11/1452552880192/KP_1318138_crop_640x360.jpg\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/01/11/160111Chapo_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/01/11/160111Chapo_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/01/11/160111Chapo_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/01/11/160111Chapo_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/01/11/160111Chapo.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2016/jan/11/el-chapo-arrest-mexican-marines-raid-ends-in-shootout-video\">El Chapo arrest: Mexican marines\u2019 raid ends in shootout</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Although Friday\u2019s ruling by the Mexican government related to charges in California and Texas, former senior prosecutors said Guzm\u00e1n could yet end up in any of the jurisdictions where he is indicted, including Brooklyn. The US attorney in Miami, another district with a case against Guzm\u00e1n, has been added as a special counsel on the Brooklyn case, indicating that the two teams are combining efforts.</p> <p>Prosecutors previously argued that despite being committed in Mexico, the murders could be prosecuted in Brooklyn because they took place in the \u201cextraterritorial jurisdiction of the United States\u201d. This same phrase was also used repeatedly in the 2014 indictment to describe the locations of Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s alleged drug trafficking offenses.<br /></p> <p>The phrase has, however, been wiped from the new indictment against Guzm\u00e1n. Asked whether American authorities now intend only to prosecute Guzm\u00e1n for alleged offenses on US soil, McIntosh again said: \u201cNo comment.\u201d<br /></p> <p>The \u201cextraterritorial jurisdiction\u201d formulation has been used in the past to prosecute foreign nationals for offenses such as killing Americans \u2013 particularly US government officials \u2013 in other countries. Its deployment for cases of foreign murders involving foreign suspects and foreign victims is, however, highly unusual if not unprecedented.<br /></p> <p>Professor Anthony Colangelo of Southern Methodist University said prosecuting Guzm\u00e1n this way could be \u201cproblematic for a number of reasons\u201d starting with the principle that \u201cextraterritorial jurisdiction\u201d is presumed not to apply to a US law unless specified in the relevant statute.<br /></p> <p>\u201cAnd constitutionally, it\u2019s just not clear to me what would authorize Congress to enact a law that applies to a foreign defendant and a foreign victim in a foreign location,\u201d said Colangelo.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/04/el-chapo-entered-us-california-manhunt-prison-break-daughter-says\">El Chapo entered US twice while on the run after prison break, daughter claims</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The new indictment against Guzm\u00e1n signals that prosecutors will instead focus on proving that Guzm\u00e1n was responsible for offenses such as illegal drug sales and money laundering within the US. Newly added lines specify repeatedly that drugs were sent \u201cinto the United States\u201d by \u201cboat and submarine crews, pilots and truck drivers\u201d and that money was funneled \u201cfrom the United States back to Mexico\u201d.<br /></p> <p>The new indictment may also be thought to allow Mexican authorities to save face, as authorities in Brooklyn are no longer explicitly claiming to have authority over actions on their territory. Mexico was previously reluctant to extradite Guzm\u00e1n.<br /></p> <p>An allegation in the 2014 indictment that Guzm\u00e1n and Zambada\u2019s campaign of violence dissuaded Mexican police officers, troops and other public officials \u201cfrom enforcing Mexican drug laws and disrupting the Sinaloa cartel\u2019s activities\u201d has also notably been removed from the new indictment.<br /></p> <p>Van Vliet, the former chief of narcotics at the justice department, described it as \u201ccommon sense\u201d that the new form of charges would be preferred in Mexico.<br /></p> <p>The new charges could also prevent complications that might jeopardize a conviction, according to Colangelo. \u201cIf they botched it up by including allegations that led to statutory or constitutional problems and an acquittal, he couldn\u2019t be prosecuted again because of the principle of double jeopardy,\u201d said Colangelo. \u201cTalk about killing your career as a prosecutor.\u201d<br /></p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>Hello, Nile! Is it really 4am where you are now?<br /></strong>Yes! I\u2019m in a car on the way to the airport.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019ve said in the past that you don\u2019t sleep much. Do you think dreaming less has limited or boosted your creativity?<br /></strong>It has been this way since I was five years old. It seems mathematically impossible for me to feel good, but I do! I actually think I dream more \u2014 even if I\u2019ve only been asleep for five minutes, I\u2019ll always wake up thinking it\u2019s the next day. I go right into REM sleep.</p> <p><strong>You\u2019re bringing </strong><a href=\"http://foldfestival.com/london-2016/\"><strong>Fold, the festival you curate, to London this summer</strong></a><strong>. Have you invited London\u2019s new mayor?<br /></strong>That would be genius. Just before I left my house, they had <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/10/sadiq-khan-i-dont-want-ignorant-donald-trump-to-make-me-an-exception\">Sadiq\u2019s remarks about Donald Trump</a> on CNN. I would love him to come, that would be so super-cool. I\u2019ll try and track him down. He can have VIP tickets, on me!</p> <p><strong>It\u2019ll be the first music festival ever held at </strong><a href=\"http://www.fulhampalace.org/\"><strong>Fulham Palace</strong></a><strong>. Do you think they\u2019re worried people might dig up all the bishops buried there?<br /></strong>Well, I hope that doesn\u2019t happen! Fold\u2019s reputation is very safe, and people are just there to have a good time. I curate each one like a local festival, thinking about what will play well in that area. On the first night, I have Alison Moyet and the Thompson Twins, then we work our way up to funk night.</p> <p><strong>And Beck\u2019s playing on the second night!<br /></strong>Yeah! He performed with me at the last Fold in New York. I know Beck quite well \u2014 we met at an Elton John party where Chic were the entertainment. I pulled Beck aside on the red carpet, told him I wanted to work with him. We ended up in the studio. That\u2019s a perk of Fold \u2014 I set aside a week during rehearsals to work with as many artists as I can on new recordings.</p> <p><strong>Noel Gallagher recently said he was a big fan. Would you record with him?<br /></strong>If I worked with Noel, we\u2019d figure out something great. I love him! He\u2019s amazing. He must be incredibly shy, because he always threatens to come to our gigs and never shows up. Maybe I should invite him to Fold. Dude, you just gave me an idea! Let\u2019s get him on stage at Fold. I\u2019m going to try to get in touch with him when I get back home.</p> <p><strong>A new Chic album was due out last year. Is it finished yet?<br /></strong>Originally, the album was going to be based on unreleased Chic material, but I started to feel that, as an artist, I\u2019ve learned a lot in the 20 years since [Chic\u2019s bass guitarist] Bernard [Edwards] passed away, and it felt unfair to limit the album. But I\u2019m working on it. I was in California a couple of weeks ago working with Lady Gaga, and the next day I started writing a song with Miguel; it was so good I sang it to Justin Timberlake over the phone and he loved it.</p> <p><strong>Can you sing the song to me now?<br /></strong>I can\u2019t do that! The hook will be out there and someone will sample it. But it\u2019s really catchy. I can\u2019t tell you about the Lady Gaga music, either, but I can tell you one thing \u2014 it\u2019s funky.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"35ce7517af099efacf9e67635b9874de32783ae1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/35ce7517af099efacf9e67635b9874de32783ae1/3_280_2468_1481/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nile Rodgers perfoms at Hyde Park in 2015\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nile Rodgers perfoms at Hyde Park in 2015</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joseph Okpako/Redferns via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>As well as the London festival, you\u2019ve got a Fold happening in New York, featuring Bette Midler and the Village People. What does Bette have planned?<br /></strong>We haven\u2019t figured it out yet. It\u2019s the first time we\u2019re performing together, but we go back a long way \u2014 when Chic were signed to Atlantic and had our first hit, the president of Atlantic wanted us to work with Bette Midler or the Rolling Stones. Instead, we chose Sister Sledge and came up with songs like Lost in Music and He\u2019s the Greatest Dancer.</p> <p><strong>So, in a parallel universe, the Rolling Stones ended up recording We Are Family?<br /></strong>Well, therein lies the rub: the Stones had their way of doing things. I don\u2019t think they\u2019d have sat back on the couch and let me and Bernard write all their songs.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s your favourite Village People deep cut?<br /></strong>I like the record that broke them \u2014 <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7-10JylGZ8\">San Francisco</a>. Their first album is compositional genius; I heard it around the same time I heard Donna Summer\u2019s Love to Love You Baby, and those records inspired me to come up with the whole Chic concept. People see them as a novelty, but what is Kiss? What are Slipknot? It\u2019s funny that rock bands do the novelty thing and get away with it.</p> <p><strong>Did you view Gaga\u2019s Grammys Bowie tribute as a success?<br /></strong>Yes \u2013 and more. We had a massive job: Gaga really wanted to tell David\u2019s story in music, and I had to remind her we only had a five-minute segment. We figured out a way to make it work. A lot of people don\u2019t understand that we gave a lot of thought to it; it was just as much my input as hers.</p> <p><strong>Good luck with the festival, Nile!<br /></strong>Thanks! And if you can hook me up with the mayor, tell him it\u2019s an open invitation! He seems like a totally cool guy.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019ll get him to bring Noel along.<br /></strong>Awesome. That would be the ultimate hookup.</p> <p><em>Nile Rodgers plays Fold festival on 26 June</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>Learning to garden in the early noughties meant that I slightly overdosed on grasses. Yes, the right grass can effortlessly hold together a scheme, yes they dance in the wind, produce lovely seed heads in autumn and make a striking bleached presence in winter, yada, yada, yada. But there were too many other things I wanted to grow, so they fell down the list.</p> <p>It\u2019s not that I\u2019ve got to the bottom of my list, far from it. But I\u2019ve been hanging around with a garden designer and I guess it is rubbing off on me, because grasses can hold a garden together. Many are easy to sow, make great cut flowers, and for the price of a packet of seed allow you to\u00a0experiment.</p> <p>All the big seed companies offer ornamental mixes with six or so different grasses, chosen for their attractive seed heads: these are a perfect starting point. If you fall in love with a particular variety or species, buy individually next year or save your own seed. If using a mix, sow in a line or in seed trays, prick out the individual species and plant them into appropriate spots.</p> <p>Foxtail barley (<a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/8793/Hordeum-jubatum/Details\" title=\"\"><em>Hordeum jubatum</em></a><em>) </em>is a short-lived perennial. It will naturalise and self-seed if it likes you, and for that you need to grow it in a sunny open spot in well-drained soil. It has lovely silver pink barley-like seed heads that wave in the wind and look particularly good with vertical forms rising between them, such as veronicastrums. Foxtail barley grows to about 70cm tall; cut back old stems hard in early spring<em>.</em></p> <p>Greater quaking grass<em> (</em><a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/76294/Briza-maxima/Details\" title=\"\"><em>Briza maxima</em></a>) has fine hanging droplets of pale green flowers that look like pearls as the light catches them. They readily self-seed and take about 12 weeks from a\u00a0late-spring sowing. Again they do best in full sun and grow to about 50cm tall; they dry to a buff colour and it\u2019s worth leaving some over winter. If you love this, try common quaking grass (<a href=\"http://www.knollgardens.co.uk/product/briza-media/\" title=\"\"><em>Briza media</em></a>), the perennial evergreen species that looks wonderful with achilleas, Mexican fleabane (<a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/32487/i-Erigeron-karvinskianus-i/Details\" title=\"\"><em>Erigeron karvanskianus</em></a>) and other grasses such as <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/64376/Melica-altissima-Atropurpurea/Details?returnurl=%2Fplants%2Fsearch-results%3Fs%3Ddesc(plant_merged)%26form-mode%3Dfalse%26plant_plant_type%3Df%252fplant_plant_type%252fgrass-like%26context%3Db%25253D0%252526hf%25253D10%252526l%25253Den%252526s%25253Ddesc%25252528plant_merged%25252529%252526sl%25253Dplants%252526r%25253Df%2525252Fplant_plant_type%2525252Fgrass-like%26page%3D2%26aliaspath%3D%252fplants%252fsearch-results\" title=\"\">melica</a>.</p> <p>I have a soft spot for hare\u2019s tail grass (<a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/plants/details?plantid=1108\" title=\"\"><em>Lagurus ovatus</em></a>). The name is apt; the flower head is just that \u2013 a hare\u2019s tail from tufts of narrow, arching leaves and slender stems. The flower heads start off pale green and fade to cream. They look good among salvias and low-growing <a href=\"https://www.rhs.org.uk/Plants/46339/Verbena-hastata/Details\" title=\"\"><em>Verbena hastata</em></a>.</p> <p>Switch grass (<em>Panicum elegans,</em> often sold as <a href=\"https://www.shootgardening.co.uk/plant/panicum-elegans-frosted-explosion\" title=\"\">\u2018Frosted Explosion\u2019</a>) is a half-hardy annual, but it should be warm enough to sow outside now. It has long panicles of airy stems that puff into an explosion of delicate seed heads. It doesn\u2019t mind a little shade and grows well in pots. It grows to 80cm tall and looks lovely with salvias.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/30/how-to-grow-perfect-courgettes-squash\">How to grow perfect courgettes and squash | Alys Fowler</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Finally, cloud grass (<a href=\"http://www.plant-world-seeds.com/store/view_seed_item/2507\" title=\"\"><em>Agrostis nebulosa</em></a>) takes airy to a new level; wispy puffs of seed heads perfect for flower arranging and spectacular in the garden, too. It comes from Spain and Portugal so does best in hot, sunny spots.</p> <p>PS Chop, chop, it\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/chelseaflowershow\" title=\"\">Chelsea</a> time.

What can I do to make it happen?</strong></h2> <p>Same, darling, same. I\u2019ve been roaming backstage like a poor teenage boy seeking the ideal prom date. Festivals are happy places, and you don\u2019t really want to enjoy them on your own. No luck for me so far, so I guess I can share with you what doesn\u2019t work: making heart shapes with your hands and silent stares. Seems like heart-shaped hands are not as cute as I thought, but rather absolutely creepy; as for silent stares, they\u2019re not effective enough to make your crush look back at you, unless you\u2019re <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professor_X\">Professor X</a>.</p> <p>Knowing that, the main piece of advice I can give you is this: don\u2019t try too hard. As a famous French opera aria might say, <em>l\u2019amour est enfant de boh\u00e8me</em> (rough translation: you can\u2019t order love like a pizza). Just go and enjoy the music with some friends, and stay open and curious to everyone who crosses your path; great encounters sometimes happen like they\u2019re nothing at first.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6f3a16c6dcc5523a13890f3d2f1f96ded4f5387d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6f3a16c6dcc5523a13890f3d2f1f96ded4f5387d/0_499_1841_2301/800.jpg\" alt=\"A stuffed dog is pushed around the Glastonbury site.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A stuffed dog is pushed around the Glastonbury site.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Leon Neal/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Is it OK to take a dog to a festival? If so, can I take my pet parrot?</strong></h2> <p>Do not leave this parrot at home. It will be a fantastic plus for your festival outfit (huge and appropriate <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Sparrow\">Jack Sparrow</a> swag) and if it\u2019s gifted enough it can sing along to whomever is on stage. Just remember that your parrot will need constant watering, silent moments in between sets and pauses from the intensity of a packed crowd.</p> <h2><strong>Do you have any tips for saving money at a festival?</strong></h2> <p>The money is already lost on the ticket. Enjoy the burning sun, it\u2019s totally free! Sip hot beer from the crushed cups on the floor!</p> <h2><strong>I don\u2019t drink, I don\u2019t do drugs and I don\u2019t enjoy live music, but I\u2019ve decided to go to my first festival this year. How can I make sure I have fun?</strong></h2> <p>Be on stage! You definitely have what it takes to be a pop star. Form a band, go on tour \u2013 if you don\u2019t drink and don\u2019t do drugs, it will be much easier to endure weeks and weeks of travelling without it affecting your performances. If you don\u2019t enjoy live music, maybe it\u2019s because you secretly think you could do better? Try it out! I\u2019ve been doing it myself, and so far it has turned out to be really fun.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"09488fb3cab97d8cf4f263c844be01b915de7f41\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/09488fb3cab97d8cf4f263c844be01b915de7f41/0_162_5315_3189/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Yurts at Glastonbury.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Yurts at Glastonbury.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roger Cracknell/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2><strong>Is it pretentious to book a yurt?</strong></h2> <p>Weird one. The process is indeed pretentious, but look how funny the word \u201cyurt\u201d is. Such a great word to text or to make puns with \u2013 and now you have an (expensive) excuse. \u201cCome to my yurt.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s meet at the yurt.\u201d \u201cI will always love yurt.\u201d Etc.</p> <h2><strong>I have always lived as a man, but I want to experiment \u2013 secretly \u2013 with presenting as a woman at </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/latitudefestival\"><strong>Latitude</strong></a><strong>. What should I do if I see someone I know?</strong></h2> <p>First of all, let\u2019s all welcome this new and fabulous version of you. You\u2019ll see that it\u2019s really a fun thing to experiment. And since you wanted to become her, you get to decide: what\u2019s her name? What are her memories? You can be new to the world, and so a wide smile and an introduction works with everyone as long as you\u2019re in charge; you can remember everything and everyone as well, as if the old you morphed into a new body. Up to you. I\u2019m sure your inner girl will be strong and carefree enough to do whatever she feels like if she bumps into someone.</p> <h2><strong>I bought a </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/glastonbury\"><strong>Glastonbury</strong></a><strong> ticket, but it\u2019s the same weekend as my sister\u2019s wedding. I\u2019d much rather go to the festival \u2013 can I?</strong></h2> <p>This is where you get to choose, not between the festival or the wedding \u2013 obviously that choice is already made \u2013 but if and how you make it up her. Are you OK with being a hurtful music geek? Or will you write your sister a whole album out of guilt? Albums made out of guilt are often stellar \u2013 think <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/feb/08/urban.shopping\">post-divorce Marvin Gaye</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/15/adele-25-new-album-interview\">Adele</a> \u2013 so you could end up missing your sister\u2019s baby shower because you\u2019re playing at Glastonbury next year. But hey, this time you\u2019d have a solid excuse.</p> <h2><strong>My girlfriend and I have tickets to Secret Garden Party, but I\u2019m planning to break up with her. Would it be wrong to offer to buy her ticket?</strong></h2> <p>Give me your name and your picture so I can never fall in love with you.</p> <p><em>Christine and the Queens plays Latitude festival on 15 July</em></p>",

Don\u2019t ask me how that works, I just felt several times as if I were in Wyoming.</p> <p>The driver\u2019s seat is wide enough for two, though it\u2019s arguable how useful that is, and three stone-cold enemies could sit in the middle row without compromising their implacable distance. The third row is a bit more intimate, and luggage would have to get on extremely well. But you wouldn\u2019t want this car to be any larger, particularly if you park like an idiot at the best of times, which by the ancient laws of the universe of cars, people who need seven seats always do.</p> <p>It isn\u2019t a thrilling thing to drive: changing gears is a bit like shouting at cows. They acknowledge your existence, but at their own pace and without much promise. But the steering is solid, even if it isn\u2019t grippy, and the diesel engine has a dogged spirit, so that, once it\u2019s moving, it never complains. It\u2019s mainly impressive for the many places you\u2019d expect a trade-off where a trade hasn\u2019t been made.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/09/on-the-road-ssangyong-korando-car-review\">On the road: \u2018It sends off mixed messages\u2019 \u2013 Ssangyong Korando car review</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Most obviously, a car this size should have mediocre emissions ratings, but it doesn\u2019t: at its most eco, it comes in below 100g/km, and even in the Exclusive + that I had, it\u2019s only 105g/km. Obviously, alongside that comes astonishing fuel economy. It might not be the cheapest people carrier, but it\u2019s not bogglingly pricey, and I\u2019d expect certain pay-offs and cheap bits, even small things like unappealing satnav or second-rate-citizen aircon. All that stuff belonged to a dearer car.</p> <p>There were tinny touches and plasticky bits in areas that don\u2019t matter \u2013 oddment stowage \u2013 and if you want to turn your parking brake into a button, you have to make damned sure it works every time. The steering wheel was a bit busy. But overall it\u2019s a quality cabin, an acreage you can survey and feel fortunate, particularly since it is large enough to live in.</p> <p>Front passengers like it for the posture, which you can recline like one of those stressed-traveller seats in airports from the 90s (it\u2019s called the RELAX function, in Exclusive + models only). Those are their caps; it\u2019s not me, yelling, \u201cRelax!\u201d at you).

Worried they won\u2019t be talking about your generation too? Don\u2019t sweat it. Sigma, Jess Glynne and a DJ set from Pendulum round out a lineup with something for everyone.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://downloadfestival.co.uk\">Download</a> 10-12 June </h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2edc1e5d318acd628f175c105b0eb2f70dbec245\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2edc1e5d318acd628f175c105b0eb2f70dbec245/0_13_4000_2400/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Download Festival\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The main stage at Download Festival</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The \u201cmetal one\u201d does exactly what it says on the tin. Rammstein close day one, Black Sabbath day two, and Iron Maiden nail shut Sunday. Clearly, Leicestershire\u2019s Donington Park is the definitive place to rock the hell out this summer. Expect a ratio of beards to hairless chins normally only seen at a cereal cafe.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://parklife.uk.com\">Parklife</a> 11-12 June </h2> <p>Heaton Park, Manchester, hosts the seventh year of the UK\u2019s fastest-growing festival \u2013 with the Chemical Brothers, Major Lazer and one of two exclusive UK gigs from Ice Cube (the other is at Wild Life in Brighton). At a little over \u00a3100 for the weekend, it\u2019s hard to get more bang for your buck.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://glastonburyfestivals.co.uk\">Glastonbury</a> 22-26 June</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"46374f438bc8ec3ce8f8d9433e3931ea381e211a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46374f438bc8ec3ce8f8d9433e3931ea381e211a/5_0_628_377/500.jpg\" alt=\"The Who on the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Who on the Pyramid stage at Glastonbury.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How do you top the outrageous Kanye West? Glastonbury\u2019s answer this year is: you don\u2019t. You play it safe, with three of the most bankable behemoths in the business. Coldplay, Muse and Adele will likely give fans exactly what they\u2019re expecting, but there\u2019s plenty of excitement lower down the bill, from the effortless cool of Grimes and Skepta to the nostalgic, only-at-Glasto feelz of Cyndi Lauper and Art Garfunkel.</p> <h2><br /></h2> <h2><a href=\"http://bst-hydepark.com\">British Summer Time</a> 1-10 July</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"441675aa210a87ac3b6089b4db9654dcf11a4bd5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/441675aa210a87ac3b6089b4db9654dcf11a4bd5/0_0_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"British Summer Time\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">British Summer Time</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not your traditional festival, but rather a series of six ludicrously starred-up one-day events in Hyde Park; for Londoners, BST combines the buzz of a Pyramid stage headliner with the relief of a tube ride home.

(and Pharrell Williams) Day.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://wirelessfestival.co.uk\">Wireless</a> 8-10 July</h2> <p>When it comes to R&amp;B in Britain, nobody does it better. London\u2019s Wireless 2016 may not be the best ever \u2013 it lacks the star quality of last year\u2019s Minaj-Drake-Lamar holy trinity \u2013 but with Calvin Harris to close the first night, plus Chase &amp; Status, Miguel and Boy Better Know, it will still be easy to keep dancing for three days straight. <em> </em></p> <h2><a href=\"http://tinthepark.com\">T in the Park</a> 8-10 July</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"c2acbc575ccff4ea6ce90c01489d0adc97018339\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c2acbc575ccff4ea6ce90c01489d0adc97018339/0_84_5120_3072/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Biffy Clyro at T in the Park 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Biffy Clyro at T in the Park 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: PR</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Scotland\u2019s biggest festival boasts half the best names from all the rest \u2013 including Calvin Harris, Disclosure, the Stone Roses, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Mexican acoustic guitar sensation Rodrigo y Gabriela.

And then, of course, there\u2019s the usual joyful mix of theatre, comedy and every other art form under the sun.</p> <h2><a href=\"http://endoftheroadfestival.com\">End of the Road</a> 1-4 September</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"55e6c387f9de751e5e58cbb0045c65531b1274c2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/55e6c387f9de751e5e58cbb0045c65531b1274c2/0_80_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"End of the Road festival.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">End of the Road festival.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Novell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Now in its 10th year, this boutique festival held at Larmer Tree Gardens north of Bournemouth has built a reputation as the perfect end to a wild summer.

      "body": "<p>Galileo Gold (5.40) is the one to be with in Saturday\u2019s Irish 2,000 Guineas as the chestnut attempts to follow up his win in the English equivalent three weeks ago. While he faces significant opposition from seven Irish-trained rivals, he is the form standout and odds of 15-8 are rather better than might be expected about such an emphatic <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/30/frankie-dettori-2000-guineas-galileo-gold-newmarket-aidan-obrien\" title=\"\">winner of the Newmarket race</a>.</p> <p>While he lined up there as a 14-1 shot, Galileo Gold moved throughout like the best horse in the contest and settled the outcome with an impressive move inside the final two furlongs. He overcame being rather keen with no cover through the early stages and won by daylight, despite hanging from the middle of the course to the stands\u2019 rail in the closing stages.</p> <p>There is no doubting the excellence of his trainer, Hugo Palmer, who reports the horse \u201chasn\u2019t missed a beat since Newmarket\u201d. Asking for another step forward may be rather optimistic, even though Galileo Gold has improved with every race to this point, but even a repeat of his last run will challenge most of his rivals here.</p> <p>This race has sometimes been won by horses that were thoroughly disappointing at Newmarket, so it is worth respecting Air Force Blue, even though he was 12th of 13 when last seen. But the suspicion must remain that he no longer has the developmental advantage he held over his contemporaries last summer and autumn, and he may need faster ground than the good going he will get here to show his best. I certainly don\u2019t feel like taking a chance on him at just 3-1.</p> <p>Awtaad is interesting after a convincing success in a Listed contest here last time, especially since he is bred to appreciate the extra furlong. That could also be said of Blue De Vega, who chased him home that day.</p> <p>But the each-way value in the race might be the 25-1 about Sanus Per Aquam, who kept good company as a juvenile and won three times from six. He was six lengths behind Air Force Blue in the Dewhurst but did not handle Newmarket so well as the winner, despite having won a lesser race there in September.</p> <p>He is bred to be better with time and distance and comes from the Jim Bolger yard that is just beginning to get going after an unusually slow start to the year. Bolger has already won a couple of Irish Classics with the progeny of Teofilo, sire of Sanus Per Aquam.</p>",

I just thought. \u2018Oh good, maybe I\u2019ll get a job now\u2019.</p> <p><strong>It\u2019s scary to leave something you\u2019re comfortable doing.</strong> I had done almost 50 years at Vogue before I went freelance at the start of the year. That said, I think it\u2019s good to have a challenge, to step out of your comfort zone. <br /></p> <p><strong>It\u2019s difficult to do projects if you\u2019re working full-time. </strong>At the beginning, I was full-time and it wasn\u2019t OK. I discussed it with Anna [Wintour]; I said it would take a while and so she was comfortable with this going ahead. It was a natural progression to go freelance but when, eventually, it happened, I decided it would be a good time to go. If you work full-time you can\u2019t do this \u2013 it\u2019s a conflict of interest. <br /></p> <p><strong>I started working on the perfume a couple of years ago. </strong>The idea came from my friend, Gaby. She said if you ever feel like doing anything besides Vogue \u2026 We were always looking for ideas. It was her suggestion that we did something like a perfume.<br /></p> <p><strong>Editorial, designing a perfume, it\u2019s all the same. </strong>You are dealing with other people. And, in both jobs, it\u2019s the same: you have a certain amount of control and there are also things that are out of your control. You take smells and you edit them down, just as when you are doing a shoot or a campaign, you take clothes and you edit them away. It\u2019s called editing.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019m not smell-orientated</strong>. I guess there\u2019s no such thing as no smell, just as there\u2019s no such thing as silence, but I like gentle smells. I really hate overwhelming perfumes. They make me feel claustrophobic.</p> <p><strong>The best way to wear a perfume is to spray it in your hair.</strong> Spray the air? That way you go through more perfume. Try it.</p> <p><strong>I am still pretty involved in Vogue. </strong>I have been working on other shoots, which has been interesting \u2013 advertising campaigns, things like that. It\u2019s not the same, but it\u2019s new people \u2013 which gives you a new enthusiasm.</p> <p><strong>I\u2019m famously friends with all my former assistants.</strong> If you spend that time with someone, it\u2019s intense. It\u2019s like an old lover, you don\u2019t just discard them.</p> <p><strong>Am I known better for loving cats or working at Vogue?</strong> I have a great love of cats and I wanted to have some sort of connection with that. </p> <p><strong>We may do a lipstick in the future. </strong>We talked about doing other beauty products. Trying to focus on two things is very hard. Right now, I\u2019ll focus on the perfume.</p> <p><em>Grace by Grace Coddington is available now at Dover Street Market</em></p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-22T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Long <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2003/may/21/minutebyminute.sport\">before Martin O\u2019Neill</a> presided over a famous era at Celtic, one of his players asked for the ideal philosophy for managerial success. O\u2019Neill was never likely to keep the reply brief; and duly told Tony Cottee of the coach who met boardroom and terrace approval from a set of opening defeats by scores of 4-3, 3-2, and 5-4. \u201cThe following week, the chairman asks the manager: \u2018Is there any chance of us winning a game at some point?\u2019\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Neill\u2019s storytelling wasn\u2019t straightforward but the point was as salient then as now. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/05/brendan-rodgers-liverpool-sacking-disappointed\">Brendan Rodgers has rightly been hailed</a> as a coup for Celtic but talk of theories, projects and dreamy ideology belie the 43-year-old\u2019s core task. That is, to endorse Celtic\u2019s domestic superiority and return them to the position of Champions League competitors. Rodgers himself, unfairly castigated in the past in a manner those from abroad wouldn\u2019t have been for endorsing a certain style of play, is pragmatic enough to know the value of results.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/20/celtic-appoint-brendan-rodgers-manager\">Celtic appoint Brendan Rodgers as manager to take over from Ronny Deila</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Scotland is a football society of entrenched opinion. The polar views are suddenly thus: that Rodgers is an appointment worthy of wild celebration, or that his coaching credentials are owed entirely to one man, Luis Su\u00e1rez. The perception of Rodgers has been tainted by the lavish praise bestowed upon <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/19/jurgen-klopp-dortmund-liverpool-europa-league-final\">his successor on Merseyside, J\u00fcrgen Klopp</a>.</p> <p>The truth, as ever, lies in the middle. Yet there is considerably more of a positive element to Rodgers accepting Celtic\u2019s overtures than should be initially classed as negative. Celtic\u2019s fans regard Rodgers as a cause for great optimism; not, perhaps, because of proven talent but as endorsement that their club has captured one so recently significant. Dermot Desmond offered the post to one man and received the reply he wanted, which hasn\u2019t always been the case. Celtic had Rodgers in their sights for months.</p> <p>For a Scottish club to coax someone who was not only prominent enough to be handed the Liverpool job in the first place but achieved manager of the year status from the LMA only two years ago is noteworthy. Celtic don\u2019t represent the entirety of a game which has so many recurring problems but Rodgers has delivered a shot in the arm to the Scottish Premiership by regarding this scene worth a chance, on less than a third of the basic salary he was last paid.</p> <p>The elephant in this room applies to Celtic\u2019s board and fans. Neither group will admit the return of Rangers to the top flight from next season as significant here but the inference is a clear one. With Rangers consigned to the nether regions of the Scottish game, Ronny Deila succeeded Neil Lennon on a fraction of the salary Rodgers will receive.</p> <p>The suspicion then, as now, was that the financial hit Celtic suffered - through no fault of their own - from their old foe\u2019s demise would resonate in a period of treading water. But now, Rangers are back. And suddenly, Celtic have offered a terrific statement of intent. The two matters cannot be coincidental. Similarly, for all that Rangers\u2019 on-field strength next season is still to be clarified, Rodgers will appreciate the element of bite and competitiveness so lacking from the league since 2012. Rodgers\u2019 background means he inevitably understands the fabric of the club, which matters.</p> <p>There are distinct managerial challenges. In either camp of the Old Firm, second place is an irrelevance. Home draws against relatively decent domestic challengers trigger howls of derision. Plenty of managers have tried and wilted against this ferocious backdrop.</p> <p>For all that Liverpool is a huge entity, the pressure for glory as encountered by Rodgers there pales into insignificance when compared to his new role. That may owe everything to a perceived lack of credible opposition, but is real. The insistence on winning and with style shapes the approach, historically to the detriment of young players. Rodgers\u2019 background suggests he will look to square that circle.</p> <p>Rodgers inherits a talented squad but a bloated one. Progression from next season\u2019s Champions League qualifying phase with the personnel at his disposal is a tall order. Two factors are key, though: Rodgers will inevitably have finance to overhaul that group, and the swell of support behind his arrival means initial shortcomings will be overlooked.</p> <p>Rodgers will also be introduced to a youth system which outstrips everything else in Scotland \u2013 as well it should \u2013 but has excelled in the production of players for other clubs. He is well qualified to change the academy dynamic.</p> <p>First, attention will be towards the basics. Should he call O\u2019Neill for advice, fundamentals from a discussion of almost 20 years ago would be repeated. Celtic fans should cheer their new manager, and he must make the feeling mutual.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-21T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>For those of us playing the long game by refusing to drive, getting to Pilsley, near Bakewell in the Derbyshire Dales, is a bit of a haul \u2013 train to Chesterfield, then a bus into the wilds. But sitting on the top deck of the 170 not only makes me feel confident that we non-drivers will inherit the Earth (when petrol rationing begins, our route knowledge will see us hailed as gods), it\u2019s also the perfect spot to appreciate why people rave about the Peak District.</p> <p>As the bus heads west (\u00a32.80 rather than \u00a320 in a taxi), the landscape scrolls through blasted moorland tops, sudden dense woodland and, then, the acres of lustrously green farmland that cover Derbyshire\u2019s curvaceous dales. All topographic life is here. In the spring sunshine, it looks stunning.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f298279091189e2332d96a5144b8705d7eca160d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f298279091189e2332d96a5144b8705d7eca160d/0_80_3543_2127/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Devonshire Arms, Pilsey\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Sitting in the middle of all this, on the Chatsworth Estate, is the handsome hamlet of Pilsley. In summer, Chatsworth House and its Capability Brown gardens are a huge visitor attraction, but many day trippers divert to Pilsley itself, to visit the Chatsworth farm shop/cafe and the Devonshire Arms.</p> <p>An 18th-century inn, the Dev is now a swanky, if still cosy, gastropub: all exposed stone walls, open fires, chic grey plasterwork, interesting art and designer furnishings. It is owned by the Duke and Duchess of Devonshire, whose input is surprisingly hands-on. For instance, the antique furniture in the next door farmhouse\u2019s six bedrooms (opened 18 months ago), all comes from their pile at Chatsworth.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7eee87263a0366662fa477794ff152ff86274e13\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7eee87263a0366662fa477794ff152ff86274e13/0_314_2036_1222/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bedroom at Devonshire Arms, Pilsey\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>That opportunity to touch the hem of the aristocracy\u2019s garments (or wardrobes, in this case) will leave some people breathless. Me? I was more interested in the seven cheaper rooms above the pub. Mine, Handley Bottom, is smart and modern, but in a modest, mature way. It is dressed with cool-ish lamps and mirrors, but the mousey colour palette of pale greens and creamy browns is very small-c conservative. That said, from Wi-Fi to shower, everything works smoothly; the slick bathroom is huge; and with its feather pillows, heavy duvet and Clipper teas, it is comfortable enough for \u00a399 a night.</p> <p>The Devonshire\u2019s sister pub in nearby Beeley, also confusingly called <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/mar/27/jay-rayner-devonshire-arms-beeley-derbyshire\">the Devonshire Arms</a>, is a one-time Good Food Guide regular whose bar food I have previously enjoyed, so, I was hoping for similarly impressive grub here. In vain, it transpires.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41145a9dfd33ec31ad32c0626e30c8fa7d11b743\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41145a9dfd33ec31ad32c0626e30c8fa7d11b743/0_617_8272_4965/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Steak chips peppercorn sauce at the Devonshire Arms, Pilsey\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Steak chips peppercorn sauce at the Devonshire Arms</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I assumed that the old-school tone of the menu (chicken liver parfait, fish and chips, gammon, steak, onion rings), was witty misdirection; that these traditional pub dishes would arrive as pin-sharp 21st-century renditions. But no. My starter of garlic mushrooms and tiny prawns served with a drab salad and woolly slices of chargrilled bread (\u00a36.50), is a bad idea clumsily executed. But for a few wild fungi, it could be a pub starter from 20 years ago.</p> <p>My main, steak pie (\u00a312.95) \u2013 actually, casserole under a rather flabby, undercooked puff pastry lid \u2013 is, predominantly, big chunks of dry, fibrous meat in a heavy, over-seasoned sauce. Skin-on chips were adequate. The best thing on the plate was an unusually creamy, vibrant hillock of mushy peas.</p> <p>That the dessert (a so-so hazelnut brownie and raspberry sorbet) arrived dusted with icing sugar and topped with a physalis, encapsulates how stuck in the 1990s the Devonshire\u2019s food is. Of course, there is still an audience for huge platefuls of unfussy cooking. The next table were cooing over that pie, but for me this food lacked finesse. Unlike my excellent pint of Thornbridge\u2019s Kipling, one of four cask ales.</p> <p>Happily, breakfast was much better. Armed with local ingredients such as Owen Taylor\u2019s A1 sausages, it is pretty hard to cock up a full English. My advice? Sleep here but dine elsewhere \u2026 if you can. The last bus is at 7pm. Maybe I need to learn to drive after all.</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Accommodation was provided by the Devonshire Arms, Pilsley (01246 583258, </em><a href=\"http://devonshirepilsley.co.uk/\"><em>devonshirepilsley.co.uk</em></a><em>), which has doubles from \u00a399 B&amp;B</em></p> <h2><strong>Ask a local</strong><br /></h2> <p> <strong>Geoff Quinn, owner, </strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BuxtonBreweryCompany/\"><strong>Buxton Brewery Company</strong></a><strong> </strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"47ebff43731fcc1462bbb3c94f3aa13a1a25c941\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/47ebff43731fcc1462bbb3c94f3aa13a1a25c941/0_205_6144_3686/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Monsal trail\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Monsal Trail, Derbyshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u2022 <strong>Walking/cycling</strong> The recently reopened <a href=\"http://www.sustrans.org.uk/ncn/map/route/monsal-trail\"><strong>Monsal Trail</strong></a> cuts through stunning limestone dales along an old railway line.

In research presented Friday at a conference of the Canadian Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, he takes aim at the fanged portrayal of the T rex, suggesting its teeth did not stick out when its mouth was closed. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/audio/2016/may/13/the-truth-of-the-tyrannosaurus-podcast\">The truth of the tyrannosaurus - podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The theory is based on the layer of thin enamel that covered the teeth of the T rex and fellow theropods. Reisz turned to modern-day reptiles to see how they keep this fragile enamel hydrated and protect their teeth from rotting. \u201cIf you have your teeth sticking out, you can\u2019t hydrate the enamel. You can\u2019t maintain it properly.\u201d </p> <p>Crocodiles get around this by spending time in water while monitor lizards have lips to protect the enamel on their teeth. Given that the T rex lived on land, the enamel on its teeth was probably kept moist by thin, scaly lips much like those of lizards. \u201cPeople have a hard time wrapping their mind around the idea of teeth that are in excess of 10-15cm still being in the mouth,\u201d Reisz said. \u201cBut it\u2019s all a matter of some big-headed animals.\u201d </p> <p>The research is ongoing, but Reisz said most so far had welcomed the theory. He expected it to stir up some controversy among those responsible for depicting how dinosaurs might have looked millions of years ago, however.</p> <p>The idea of lips on the T rex is not as far-fetched as it sounds, he said. Small theropods such as velociraptors are already often depicted with lips. It\u2019s just the larger theropods, such as the T rex, who are almost always shown with their teeth exposed. </p> <p>Still, he acknowledged that the theory might come as a blow to the dinosaur\u2019s fierce image. \u201cMaybe to children and a general audience they might look less ferocious without their teeth sticking out. But they are still big, impressive animals that were the top predators of their time.\u201d</p>",

She\u2019d happily read a poem, she said, whereupon she produced a slightly dog-eared sheet of paper and read Liverpool. When she saw my tears as she finished, she signed the paper and gave it to me.</p> <p>Duffy had given the poem to the Liverpool Echo, so it would be owned by the city; it was the paper\u2019s editor who read it at the ceremony. How did it feel to hear those words? \u201cThe first thing I felt was huge emotion for the families. It was an amazing ceremony that the city of Liverpool gave \u2013 the huge dignity of all the people either on the stage or in the crowd.

She steers clear of social media. \u201cI think poetry\u2019s the opposite of that. And obviously, people who go to poetry are far fewer than the people who go to Facebook and Twitter. But I think poetry is a unifying art, a way of talking across differences. The idea that a poet is a dead white man is risible now.\u201d</p> <p>Duffy is also a professor at the <a href=\"https://www2.mmu.ac.uk/english/mcr-writing-school/\">Manchester Writing School</a>. Has she felt the impact of the current vogue for \u201cno platforming\u201d controversial speakers? No, she says. \u201cMost people are good people, aren\u2019t they? Your own humanity, your own common sense, should guide you to the difference between deliberate offence and free speech.\u201d</p> <p>Duffy has perhaps done more than any other poet to demystify contemporary poetry \u2013 her work is at once easy to understand and filled with emotional profundity. But she is also unafraid of laughter and informality, particularly when it comes to children, remembering the time when a little boy asked her, at the end of a talk, whether she had \u201ca poem about a balloon, at all\u201d. She wrote one on the blackboard for him.</p> <p>She has three years of laureateship left: has she begun to assess what the experience has meant, or to envisage a life afterwards? \u201cI\u2019m quite a live-in-the-moment person,\u201d she says, \u201cso I think it\u2019s going to have to be after the 10 years that I look back. But it\u2019s almost entirely a joy.\u201d She has taken particular pleasure in the variety of opportunities and collaborations: she\u2019s just back from performing to 10-year-olds in Ireland; has recently written a libretto for <a href=\"http://www.sallybeamish.com/\">composer Sally Beamish</a>\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/24/shakespeare-odes-review-david-garrick-thomas-arne-holy-trinity-church-stratford-upon-avon-ex-cathedra\">Shakespeare Odes</a>; and is writing another for the <a href=\"http://www.durham.gov.uk/article/7734/Durham-Hymns-premieres-at-Cathedral-as-part-of-BRASS\">Durham Hymns</a>, to be performed in the cathedral there in July, not long after she sets her suitcase down from this tour.</p> <p>***</p> <p>Before the poets set off, I press them on what they hope their road trip will achieve. Kay points to the different places that poetry can find its home \u2013 at festivals such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/latitudefestival\">Latitude</a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/glastonbury\">Glastonbury</a>, even at football grounds: she <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/26/jackie-kay-poetry-football-racism\">read an anti-racist poem at Sheffield United\u2019s Bramall Lane</a> back in 2012; as she said at the time, \u201ca poet on the pitch, but not a pitch-perfect poet\u201d.</p> <p>Poetry, Duffy agrees, \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to show its passport\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d3ab8e3d0893ecbaa82f3008b6d0a5a53c50b871\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d3ab8e3d0893ecbaa82f3008b6d0a5a53c50b871/5_168_2828_4088/692.jpg\" alt=\"Gillian Clarke, national poet for Wales, at the Edinburgh International Book Festival, Aug 2009\" width=\"692\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gillian Clarke: \u2018biggest show-off\u2019 on the tour, Duffy says. Photograph: Geraint Lewis/Rex Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Kay tells a very moving story about her own experience of the power of words. \u201cI went and saw my birth mother recently [She was adopted as a baby], who\u2019s got vascular dementia and lost all her ability to speak. And she hadn\u2019t spoken at all for three months and I couldn\u2019t think what to do to communicate. So I read her a poem in Scottish, because she\u2019s from the Highlands, and at the end, she grabbed hold of my hands and said, \u2018Yes!\u2019\u201d Kay ascribes that connective quality to the recognition of rhythms, repetitions and word-sounds buried deep in our brain, all of which can survive the loss of more overt comprehension. \u201cPoetry is who we are in words,\u201d Duffy says.</p> <p>But who we are also includes fun and celebration. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly allowed to be silly,\u201d Dharker says. \u201cWe\u2019re allowed to go out and imagine ourselves as a rock band.\u201d Who\u2019s the best performer? \u201cGillian\u2019s the biggest show-off,\u201d Duffy says. (\u201cWho needs enemies?\u201d Clarke responds.)</p> <p>There is, I remind them, a noble tradition of bands splitting up while on tour \u2013 even on stage. Any danger of that?</p> <p>\u201cI might just go my own way,\u201d Kay says. \u201cJump off the bus. Have a massive tantrum.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cHas anyone got Kate Tempest\u2019s number?\u201d Duffy asks.</p> <p>\u2022 The Shore to Shore poets tour runs from 19 June to 2 July; for details, go to <a href=\"https://www.panmacmillan.com/carolannduffytourhttps://www.panmacmillan.com/carolannduffytour\">carolannduffyandfriends.com</a>. </p> <h2>A poem by Gillian Clarke</h2> <p><strong>In A Cardiff Arcade, 1952</strong><br />One of those little shops too small<br />for the worlds they hold, where words<br />that sing you to sleep, stories<br />that stalk your dreams,<br />open like golden windows in a wall.</p> <p>One small room leads to another,<br />the first bright-windowed on the street,<br />alluring, luminous.

      "body": "<p>The appearance in Cannes of Asghar Farhadi\u2019s interesting if contrived drama Forushande, or The Salesman, is a moment to ponder if a new genre of world cinema is being born: The Haneke/Antonioni Shock Event. Some nice, complacent middle-class people tootle along with their lives and then they\u2019re sideswiped by a horrible event \u2014 mysterious, anonymous and malevolent \u2014which shatters their calm and cracks open the carapace of their daily routine. It reveals the raw nerve of guilt and shame within.</p> <p>Both Cristian Mungui\u2019s Bacalaureat and to a lesser extent the Dardennes\u2019 The Unknown Girl here in Cannes were H/A shock events: all about sexual assault, middle-class complicity, barricaded comfort, people buzzing on doors to be allowed in, or not allowed in, with CCTV footage revealing glimpses of marginalised lives which are scary to the overclass. The Salesman is beginning to fit a certain pattern, and however well-managed it undoubtedly is, it is starting to look like a mannerism.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/19/graduation-review-cristian-mungiu-romania-cannes-2016\">Graduation review \u2013 a five-star study of grubby bureaucratic compromise</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Farhadi\u2019s brilliant films A Separation (2011) and About Elly (2009) had something of Haneke and Antonioni respectively, though in my view The Salesman is closer in many ways to his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/06/fireworks-wednesday-review\">Fireworks Wednesday</a> (2006) and it starred the female lead of this film, the excellent Taraneh Alidoosti. That movie had the same idea of a living space being disrupted, and the resulting intimate discomfort and upheaval causing a good deal to be revealed about the relationships of the people who live there. It was less showy and more subtle than The Salesman.</p> <p>This story is about a happy middle-class couple in Tehran: Rana and Emad, played by Alidoosti and Shahab Hosseini. He is a teacher and she stays at home, and there are some thoughts about starting a family. But more than this, they are talented members of a semi-professional theatre group, and putting on a production of Arthur Miller\u2019s Death Of A Salesman, with Emad playing the failed salesman Willy Loman and Emad playing Willy\u2019s wife Linda: both putting on grey wigs and makeup and playing older, careworn characters. Just as the run starts, they are forced to move out of their apartment because the whole building appears to be collapsing due to construction faults \u2014 Farhadi creates a very disturbing scene in which cracks snap across window panes. An imminent Titanic catastrophe.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"247c1397c9c47a9d2f01f0bf6e1439348084d3e1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/247c1397c9c47a9d2f01f0bf6e1439348084d3e1/0_162_4928_2956/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Asghar Farhadi at the 2013 Cannes film festival\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Asghar Farhadi at the 2013 Cannes film festival</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Anne-Christine Poujoulat/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The couple eventually find an alternative apartment, set up for them as a favour by a fellow cast member. But they only find out too late this flat was once inhabited by a young woman who appeared to work as a prostitute, and unsavoury people have got used to calling round at all hours of the night. Rana one night buzzes open the outer door thinking that it must be her husband. But it isn\u2019t.</p> <p>There is a formal pleasure and fascination in the way Farhardi juxtaposes the grim, complex scenes of the couple\u2019s real life with the scenes from Arthur Miller\u2019s play, with its formal demonstrations of emotion. Messy realism and classically proportioned tragedy are set down, side by side. Emad himself is a restrained, cerebral guy, but it could well be that starring in Miller has given him a conceited, dramatic, morally heroic view of himself. Willy Loman wondered in anguish what sort of a man can\u2019t give his wife and family the good things in life. Emad is wondering what sort of man can\u2019t protect his wife from assault. Cleverly, Farhadi allows his audience to make assumptions as to where the Willy Loman parallel lies, and then upends them in the film\u2019s final minutes \u2014 yet in such a way that the new connection is a little glib.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/18/the-unknown-girl-review-dardennes-brothers-cannes-2016\">The Unknown Girl review \u2013 a marginal, passionless offering from the Dardennes brothers</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s a smart, ambitious film, but very plot-dependent on one of Emad\u2019s pupils having a father who works in the motor vehicle licensing department. The Salesman is trying harder for a bigger effect and bigger payoff than his previous films, and it doesn\u2019t have the enigmatic quality of A Separation. In fact, its revenge-justice theme almost reminded me of Denis Villeneuve\u2019s crime melodrama Prisoners (2013).</p> <p>Having said all this, the sheer IQ of Farhadi\u2019s film-making makes this very watchable; only a film-maker of his confidence could have found space for a audacious bit of comedy: exhausted in class, Emad falls asleep and the kids pose for cheeky selfies around his snoring face. The Salesman is a well-crafted, valuable drama.</p>",

      "body": "<p>A suspect has been arrested after he approached a White House security checkpoint with a firearm on Friday afternoon. </p> <p>The man was shot by secret service and transported to George Washington University hospital in critical condition.</p> <p>The secret service put the White House on lockdown immediately after the incident but that was later lifted. </p> <p>A section of Pennsylvania Avenue, part of 17th Street and Lafayette Square, remained closed to the public, cordoned off by yellow \u201cauthorized personnel only\u201d tape. Onlookers were gathering and taking pictures, prompting occasional shouted warnings from the secret service to stay back.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>A secret service spokesman, David Iacovetti, said that just after 3pm the man approached the publicly accessible White House entrance at 17th and E Streets with a firearm visible. </p> <p>\u201cUniformed division officers gave numerous verbal commands for the subject to stop and drop the firearm,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen the subject failed to comply with the verbal commands, he was shot once by a secret service agent and taken into custody.\u201d</p> <p>A White House official said no one in or associated with the White House was injured and that everyone inside was safe and had been accounted for.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4d2fff3b0812a341be127741220c62e4202dc3bb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4d2fff3b0812a341be127741220c62e4202dc3bb/0_0_775_620/500.jpg\" alt=\"Location of the shooting near the White House\" width=\"500\" height=\"400\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Location of the shooting near the White House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mapbox/OpenStreetMap</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ranjit Singh, who works near where the incident happened, said he saw a \u201cwhite guy\u201d with a gun in his right hand approaching police who were yelling at him to drop it.</p> <p>Barack Obama was not at the White House at the time of the incident. The president had left earlier in the day for the golf course at Andrews air force base in Maryland. Officials have not said how or if Obama was secured after the secret service learned about the shooting incident. Obama has been made aware of the shooting.</p> <p>Vice-President Joe Biden was in the White House complex at the time and was secured during the lockdown, his office said. </p> <p>First lady Michelle Obama was wrapping up a speech in downtown Washington at midday on Friday. Her office would not say where she and the Obama daughters were at the time. <br /></p> <p>Veteran peace protester Philipos Melaku-Bello, 54, was outside the White House when the panic began. He estimated there were about 250 people and it was just before 3.20pm. \u201cI knew from the immediacy in the secret service\u2019s voice how dire it was,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cSome people were in a panic because when they hear the secret service shouting they know it\u2019s serious. I\u2019m a protester for world peace so it\u2019s too close for comfort.\u201d</p> <p>Melaku-Bello said he has been demonstrating outside the White House for 34 years and evacuations of the public can take place 10 times a week, but ones with \u201cthis immediacy\u201d only happen about 15 times a year.</p> <p>The regular flow of tourists has been abruptly halted. Colleen McKearney, 29, visiting from Seattle, said: \u201cWe have no idea what\u2019s happening. We were going to look at the White House. We\u2019ll be patient and come back in a little bit.\u201d</p> <p>Jason Wilson, 45, was lining up for entry to the White House, where he and about 60 other people were due to receive awards for volunteer service, when he heard a gunshot.</p> <p>\u201cI thought it was a tyre on a truck that exploded,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThen I looked at my friend and said, \u2018Could that have been a gunshot?\u2019 Then the secret service said, \u2018Move! Move!\u2019 They were prompt.\u201d</p> <p>Wilson, founder and chief executive the NGO The Yunion, added: \u201cOf course at the back of your mind you think \u2018Could it be a terrorist attack?\u2019 but we were all calm. I\u2019m from Detroit. Just stay calm. What\u2019s there to be scared of?\u201d</p> <p><em tabindex=\"-1\">Reuters and the Associated Press contributed to this report</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>House prices could take an 18% hit over the next two years and there will be an \u201ceconomic shock\u201d that will increase the cost of mortgages if the UK votes to leave the EU, George Osborne has warned.</p> <p>The chancellor said he would publish an official analysis next week saying house prices would be lower by at least 10% and up to 18% compared with what is expected if Britain remains in the EU. He made his claim as it emerged that property investors were inserting \u201cBrexit clauses\u201d in commercial deals to allow them to pull out.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/testing/2016/06/brexit-companion/embed/embed.html?sheet=advanced&amp;id=house_prices\" data-alt=\"Brexit explained: house prices\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/testing/2016/06/brexit-companion/embed/embed.html?sheet=advanced&id=house_prices\">Brexit explained: house prices</a> </figure>  <p>Speaking at the G7 summit in Japan, Osborne said: \u201cIf we leave the European Union, there will be an immediate economic shock that will hit financial markets. People will not know what the future looks like. </p> <p>\u201cIn the long term, the country and the people in the country are going to be poorer. That affects the value of people\u2019s homes and the Treasury analysis shows that there would be a hit to the value of people\u2019s homes by at least 10% and up to 18%.\u201d</p> <p>It is the latest in a series of warnings from Downing Street forecasting dire consequences if voters decide to leave the EU. Osborne has already claimed that households would be \u00a34,300 a year worse off and millions of jobs would be at risk, while David Cameron argued last week that Brexit could jeopardise peace in Europe.</p> <p>The prime minister and chancellor have been accused of scaremongering and negativity by Vote Leave, the official out campaign, but Downing Street argues that voters need to be presented with the government\u2019s view on the consequences of Brexit.<br /></p> <p>Andrea Leadsom, a Conservative minister campaigning for Brexit, who used to work in the Treasury with Osborne, said it was a \u201can extraordinary claim and I\u2019m amazed that Treasury civil servants would be prepared to make it\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/19/rents-property-values-drop-after-brexit-landlords-house-prices-eu-referendum\">Rents and property values would drop after Brexit, say landlords</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She added: \u201cThe truth is that the greatest threat to the economy is the perilous state of the euro; staying in the EU means locking ourselves to a currency zone, which Mervyn King, the ex-governor of the Bank of England, has rightly warned \u2018could explode\u2019. The safer option in this referendum is to take back control of the vast sums we send to Brussels every day and vote leave on 23 June.\u201d</p> <p>In a sign of property market jitters, City lawyers said investors in commercial property were adding Brexit clauses to contracts allowing them to pull out of purchases. </p> <p>Law firm Nabarro said buyers were putting down deposits that would be refundable if the UK voted to leave. The firm\u2019s senior partner, Ciaran Carvalho, said: \u201cWe have seen a marked increase in the number of contracts which include clauses to protect the position of buyers investing in UK real estate ahead of the European Union referendum,\u201d he said. \u201cBrexit is a leap into the unknown. Brexit clauses are a pragmatic, legal response to that uncertainty.\u201d</p> <p>Earlier this week, the developer behind new luxury flats in London said it would give buyers the chance to pull out of purchases if they did not like the outcome of the vote. </p> <p>Peter Wetherall, an estate agent who covers the Mayfair market, said sellers were telling nervous buyers \u201cstay calm but carry on and, if you do not like the result, then we will rescind the contract\u201d. He said this was enabling deals to progress in the weeks running up to the vote.</p> <p>Critics of the new Treasury analysis are likely to point out that the fall in prices is only compared with where they would have been if there was no vote for Brexit. The Office for Budget Responsibility predicts a rise of 9.4% over the next two years, meaning the government forecast suggests homes would be worth between 0.6% and 8.6% less in cash terms than they are now.</p> <p>Moody\u2019s, the credit rating agency, has highlighted the possible benefits of the UK leaving the EU for first-time buyers, as there would be \u201clower competition for housing, as house price and rental inflation would slow down if immigration is curbed\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/20/nigel-farage-tories-lose-third-members-ukip-eu-referendum-remain\">Third of Tories could defect to Ukip if UK stays in EU, says Farage</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However, Osborne dismissed that argument, saying first-time buyers would be \u201chit because mortgage rates go up and mortgages become more difficult to get\u201d. It would be a \u201close-lose situation\u201d for anyone who owned or wanted to buy a home, the chancellor said.</p> <p>On top of his house price warning, Osborne used his attendance at the G7 to claim that other European finance ministers were adamant that the UK would have to accept free movement of people and pay into the EU budget if it wanted access to the single market.<br /></p> <p>The chancellor said the first two years after a Brexit vote would be a \u201clong, costly and messy divorce\u201d, as the UK would be forced to negotiate an exit deal with 27 other countries and new trade deals with more than 50 non-EU countries.<br /></p> <p>Earlier, Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European commission, made it clear that Britain would not get a friendly reception from other EU countries, ominously telling French newspaper Le Monde that \u201cdeserters will not be welcomed with open arms\u201d.<br /></p> <p>\u201cIf the British say no \u2013 which I hope they will not \u2013 community life will not carry on as before. The United Kingdom will have to accept being considered as a third party, which does not have its hair stroked in the right direction,\u201d he said.</p> <p>However, Nigel Farage, the Ukip leader and out campaigner, said the warnings of Juncker and others were a sign those campaigning for the UK to stay in were moving from \u201cproject fear to project threat\u201d.<br /></p> <p>Vote Leave tried to move the argument on to immigration by releasing a video warning that the prime minister could not be trusted to stop Turkey joining the EU. Michael Gove, the justice secretary, gave a speech arguing that the NHS would be put at risk by the immigration of an extra five million EU citizens, equal to adding the entire population of Scotland by 2030 if the UK voted to stay in.</p> <p>In response, a senior source in the remain campaign claimed Vote Leave was \u201creleasing video nasties about Turkish people\u201d because their economic case for leaving the EU had failed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2016/may/20/staying-in-eu-migration-influx-scottish-population-reality-check\">Will staying in EU really lead to an influx equal to Scottish population?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Although the remain camp feel they are convincing voters about the financial case, they are still worried that their voters will be less likely to turn out than those of the leave camp.</p> <p>Gordon Brown, the Labour former prime minister, is to urge Labour voters on Saturday to turn out to vote to stay in the EU for positive reasons that it supports jobs and growth.</p> <p>\u201cMy message to mothers, worried about their children\u2019s future, is that the biggest job creator of the next decade will be Europe\u2019s single market,\u201d he will say. </p> <p>\u201cMy message to those who feel globalisation is like an out-of-control runaway train is that only through cooperation \u2013 starting with the European Union \u2013 can we manage global change in an interdependent world in the public interest.\u201d</p> <p>As the 23 June vote draws closer, Downing Street intends to point to a growing range of independent bodies who are on their side, such as the Bank of England, OECD and International Monetary Fund, as well as business chiefs and world leaders. </p> <p>Justin Trudeau, the prime minister of Canada, became the latest to warn that Britain would be better off in the EU as striking trade deals from outside was not \u201ceasy or automatic\u201d.</p> <p>Boris Johnson, the former London mayor and prominent leave campaigner, had held up Canada as example of a country that had recently struck a trade deal with the US. </p>",

The November terrorist attack on the Bataclan theater in Paris, he said, might have been averted if concertgoers had been carrying firearms. </p> <p>\u201cIf [the attackers] knew there were guns in the room, it might not have happened,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there would have been bullets going in the other direction and the carnage would not be the same by any stretch of the imagination.\u201d</p> <p>One hundred and thirty people were killed in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/paris-attacks\">the Paris terrorist attacks</a>, including <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/19/inquest-hears-of-britons-nick-alexander-final-moments-in-bataclan-attack\">89 at the Bataclan</a>. <br /></p> <p>Many of Trump\u2019s properties, including the <a href=\"http://www.maralagoclub.com/\">Mar-a-Lago resort</a> in Palm Beach, Florida, are gun-free zones.</p> <p>Trump also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/08/trump-accuses-clinton-of-wanting-to-abolish-the-second-amendment\">repeated his accusation</a> that Clinton wanted \u201cto abolish the second amendment\u201d.

But occasionally I see a\u00a0picture and think, \u201cOoh, from a\u00a0great distance, I\u00a0could almost have been <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/gallery/2014/sep/20/brigitte-bardot-her-life-and-times-so-far-in-pictures\" title=\"\">Brigitte Bardot</a>.\u201d<strong> </strong></p> <p>\u2022 Joanna Lumley is supporting <a href=\"http://www.marksandspencer.com/shwopping\" title=\"\">Marks &amp; Spencer\u2019s Shwopping initiative</a> to raise money for Oxfam.</p>",

      "body": "<p>I am a local government manager and proud of it, working for a local unitary authority in the north. Reading some of the red tops, though, I wonder if they are talking about the same sector as me. </p> <p>It\u2019s just not true that we are lazy and own gold-plated pensions, as the Sun suggests. Reading an Express article last year that regurgitated something from the Taxpayers\u2019 Alliance about the amount spent by councils on biscuits led to accusations from friends that my colleagues and I eat \u00a310m of biscuits each per year. If only. </p> <p>It is this inaccurate, headline-grabbing drivel that causes people to think we all earn \u00a3200k per year, drive expensive cars, work four hours a week and retire aged 30. In truth, I earn \u00a330k for a 50-hour week, drive a Toyota Aygo and cannot afford a mortgage. I\u2019ll currently retire at 68 with an \u00a318k pension. Bring on the gold.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/apr/09/government-villifies-people-public-sector-intelligence\">This government vilifies people who put their lives on the line for their job</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I manage a regeneration team at my council and witness people doing their utmost to improve the local area, working long hours for low pay. Yes, there are cuts and inefficiencies and there are certainly ways the sector can improve, but my local authority and the wider sector is resourced by hardworking people with a passion for the locality and a quiet professionalism that will never cease to impress me.</p> <p>The first project I worked on for my current local authority showed me the positive role we play. Running an employability skills project in one of our most deprived areas, we took 12 long-term unemployed people and spent time building a relationship, understanding their lives, their wants and the barriers to them accessing training or employment. We found them courses that plugged any training gaps they had. We wrote CVs with them, went to interviews with them and worked on implementing feedback from unsuccessful interviews.</p> <p>We didn\u2019t change the world, but we improved a few lives: five of them got jobs, three still did the job a year later; all undertook accredited training. And we stayed in touch in case they wanted advice afterwards. Most of them did.</p> <p>Here is another example of the distance between the rhetoric and reality about councils: my town, supposedly suffering a death knell via the ailing steelworks industry, is leading one of the largest housing developments in the north of England, with \u00a31.2bn invested and 6,000 homes built. Thousands of jobs are being created in the offshore wind energy sector in our patch, with the largest enterprise zone in the country. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2016/may/14/bed-manager-mental-health-scapegoat-nhs\">I'm a bed manager in mental health \u2013 and the scapegoat of the NHS</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As soon as the local steelworks redundancies were mooted, the council established a taskforce to coordinate a response and bring key partners together to support those exiting that industry. It secured \u00a312m as grants to local business for retraining and investing in other industries, as well as for one-to-one support for people facing redundancies. So much for the slow-moving bureaucracies of local government.</p> <p>It\u2019s this quiet, dignified dedication that probably allows misinformation about the public sector to go unchallenged \u2013 so consider this a polite rebuttal. I am biased, I admit it: I have experience of being a looked-after child. The state fed me, educated and housed me, as well as being my (corporate) parent on-off for a period. I remain utterly grateful for them being there and despair at what the alternative would mean without such a safety net for the vulnerable.</p> <p>It is that gratitude and belief in the sector that led me to choose the graduate management programme for local government. I\u2019ve worked in the sector for nine years now, across frontline and corporate services and have yet to find a service that was not underpinned by that core value of wanting to improve a person\u2019s life, family or area. Some may mock, but it\u2019s a good thing to go to work for \u2013 and despite the cuts, efficiency drives and press hostility, I\u2019ll still be here, because it\u2019s worthwhile and I love it.</p> <p><em>The views expressed here are personal and do not represent the views of any council. </em></p> <p><em>This <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/series/public-servant-my-letter-to-the-public\">series</a> aims to give a voice to the staff behind the public services that are hit by mounting cuts and rising demand, and so often denigrated by the press, politicians and public.

But investigators appeared no closer to explaining why flight MS804 suddenly plunged into the sea killing all 66 on board during a routine flight between Paris and Cairo. <br /></p> <p>Egyptian naval vessels found the wreckage 180 miles (295km) north of the coastal city of Alexandria. A European satellite saw an ominous mile-long oil slick about 25 miles south of the aircraft\u2019s last known position.</p> <p>\u201cA short while ago we were briefed by the Egyptian authorities ... on the discovery of a body part, a seat and baggage just south of where the aircraft signal was lost,\u201d the Greek defence minister, Panos Kammenos, told reporters in Athens.<br /></p> <p>The plane had taken a normal course through Greek airspace before abruptly taking sharp turns, he said, adding that the cause of the crash was still a matter of speculation. The plane <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/19/fears-for-missing-egyptair-flight-804-with-66-people-on-board\">crashed at around 2.30am local time on Thursday </a>while carrying 56 passengers and 10 crew from Paris to Cairo, including Briton Richard Osman. All those on board died.</p> <p>According to reports on Friday night, flight data suggested there were smoke alerts aboard MS804 minutes before it crashed.</p> <p>Smoke was detected in the toilet and the aircraft\u2019s electrics, according to data from the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System (Acars). Acars routinely downloads flight data to the airline operating the aircraft. The warnings came at about 2.26am on Thursday local time, just before air traffic controllers lost contact with the plane, the AFP news agency reported.</p> <p>Despite theories that a bomb may have been smuggled on board, no claim of responsibility has so far been made by Islamic State or other terrorist groups. Typically, Isis claims responsibility for its attacks soon afterwards on Twitter and video.</p> <p>Egypt\u2019s military said it had found personal belongings and parts of the wreckage floating in the sea. It did not post photographs. The spokesman for the armed forces wrote<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Egy.Army.Spox/?fref=nf\"> on Facebook that the search was continuing.</a></p> <p>Greek authorities said they had received information that the wreckage was discovered 10 miles \u201cfrom the last known point\u201d of flight MS804.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d43dd145f894eb9a3a6aabeabfa7fac1c44b794\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d43dd145f894eb9a3a6aabeabfa7fac1c44b794/0_0_2000_1057/1000.jpg\" alt=\"An image released by the Egyptian defence ministry from an Egyptian plane searching the Mediterranean.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"529\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">An image released by the Egyptian defence ministry from an Egyptian plane searching the Mediterranean.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Uncredited/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Greece\u2019s lead air accident investigator, Athanasios Binis, said the \u201cpoint of reference\u201d was an area 130 miles south of the Greek island of Karpathos. The location is now the centre of a major international air and sea operation to find the plane\u2019s black boxes.</p> <p>\u201cThe most important thing is that the plane\u2019s two black boxes are found,\u201d Binis said. \u201cIf the cockpit flight recorder and flight data recorder are found, along with wreckage, then a real investigation can begin.</p> <p>\u201cThere are three reasons for a plane [to go down],\u201d he said. \u201cMeteorological, technical and human. The first has now been ruled out because the weather was quite good. Whether a technical factor or human factor, either inside or outside the plane, is to blame remains to be seen. All possibilities are open.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/debris-confirmed/giv-12515yhRDxbG9LwgM/\" data-alt=\"egypt map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/debris-confirmed/giv-12515yhRDxbG9LwgM/\">egypt map</a> </figure>  <p>It now seems increasingly likely that it will take weeks, if not months, before a definitive account of MS804\u2019s last moments can be pieced together. Egypt has been leading the search effort, with support from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/france\">France</a>, Greece, Turkey and the UK. The US navy dispatched a P-3 Orion maritime surveillance aircraft from a base in Sicily.</p> <p>But Egypt\u2019s previous record suggests a capacity for obfuscation, and even cover-up. It took nearly four weeks before the Egyptian president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, admitted that a Russian passenger jet which crashed last October on the Sinai peninsula had been blown up \u2013 a conclusion which Russia, the US and UK reached within a few days. </p> <p>In 1999 Egypt also refused to accept that one of its pilots had deliberately flown his Boeing 767 into the Atlantic, killing all on board. Instead it insisted the crash was due to mechanical failure. </p> <p>EgyptAir said on Thursday that it had found part of the wreckage and lifejackets from MS804 near Karpathos, east of Crete. The report turned out to be erroneous and the airline\u2019s vice-president, Ahmed Adel, later retracted the statement.</p> <p>The plane, built in 2003, made \u201csudden swerves\u201d before dropping off the radar, Kammenos said on Thursday.<strong> </strong>It made a 90-degree turn left, and then dropped from 11,000 metres to 5,000 metres before swerving 360 degrees right, he said. Contact was lost at 3,000 metres, he said.</p> <p>The plane\u2019s captain, Mohamed Said Shoukair had clocked up 6,275 flying hours. He did not send a distress signal. There was no hint from his Facebook page of any Islamist proclivities. His posts included criticism of the Muslim Brotherhood, articles supportive of President Sisi, and photographs showing him wearing aviator sunglasses.</p> <p>Khaled al-Gameel, head of crew at EgyptAir, said Shoukair had 15 years\u2019 experience and was in charge of training and mentoring younger pilots. \u201cHe comes from a pilot family; his uncle was a high-ranking pilot at EgyptAir and his cousin is also a pilot,\u201d Gameel said. \u201cHe was very popular and was known for taking it upon himself to settle disputes any two colleagues were having.\u201d</p> <p>Egypt\u2019s aviation minister has said the Airbus A320\u2019s sudden disappearance was more likely to have been caused by a terrorist attack than technical failure. But the French foreign minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, said on Friday that there was \u201cabsolutely no indication\u201d of why the flight came down.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e305fc5268d683888ddfa01f7e48070df6c7f64a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e305fc5268d683888ddfa01f7e48070df6c7f64a/172_613_5379_3227/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Egyptians pray for the victims of EgyptAir flight 804 at a Cairo mosque.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Egyptians pray for the victims of EgyptAir flight 804 at a Cairo mosque.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Amr Nabil/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Mike Vivian, former head of operations at the UK\u2019s Civil Aviation Authority, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-africa-36328976?ns_mchannel=social&amp;ns_source=twitter&amp;ns_campaign=bbc_live&amp;ns_linkname=573ed2bee4b020b88536234c%26Egyptian%20Air%20Force%20says%20it%20has%20found%20debris%20from%20plane%26&amp;ns_fee=0#post_573ed2bee4b020b88536234c\">told the BBC</a> he thought the plane\u2019s sudden swerves before dropping off radar were more likely to be caused by human interference than by a bomb.</p> <p>\u201cIt looks highly unlikely that this was consistent with some sort of explosive device,\u201d he said. \u201cOne\u2019s inclined to go towards the theory that there had been some interference in the aircraft and on the flight deck, with the control of the aircraft.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/ms804_previous_flights/giv-12515xXU3GagZwqLc/\" data-alt=\"Egypt map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/ms804_previous_flights/giv-12515xXU3GagZwqLc/\">Egypt map</a> </figure>  <p>Officials from multiple US agencies told Reuters that a preliminary examination of satellite imagery had not shown any signs of an explosion.

      "body": "<p>For the first time in the history of the UN, countries competing for a non-permanent seat on the security council will participate in an open debate to present their candidacies to the world. </p> <p>The security council, the body within the UN charged with maintaining global peace and security, is something everyone wants to see work more effectively and efficiently. The <a href=\"http://www.wfuna.org/\">World Federation of UN Associations</a> has a mandate focused on strengthening and improving the UN, and has worked hard to make <a href=\"http://www.wfuna.org/wfuna-security-council-election-initiative\">election debates</a> \u2013 which will take place in New York from Monday \u2013 a reality.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/apr/25/the-worlds-humanitarian-burden-is-too-big-how-can-we-lessen-it\">The world's humanitarian burden is too big. How can we lessen it? | Robert Glasser and Stephen O'Brien</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Through the debates, the UN ambassador representing each candidate country will present the platform and policies they will be pursuing at the security council. There will be none of the antics seen during the US presidential election debates; discussion will instead focus on policy issues that matter. For a slow-moving, reform-phobic institution, this will be a huge step forward towards a new era.</p> <p>While there have been many proposals on security council reform, the body has not changed in procedural make-up since 1965. Every year, five seats for a two-year term are up for election on the 15-seat council. This year, seven candidates are competing to assume a place on 1 January 2017. <a href=\"http://www.wfuna.org/wfuna-security-council-election-initiative\">Elections will be held earlier than usual, on 28 June</a>.</p> <p>To maintain a geographic balance in the membership, spots on the security council are granted on a regional basis. It is not uncommon for just one candidate to be put forward from each regional grouping. This year, though, there will be two regions with contested elections.</p> <p>Competing for two seats from the group Western Europe and Other will be Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden. In the Asia-Pacific group, meanwhile, Kazakhstan and Thailand will contest a seat. The remaining seats will go to Ethiopia, the sole candidate for the Africa group, and Bolivia, the only representative from the Latin American and Caribbean states.<br /></p> <p>The stakes are high. Those outside the permanent members of the security council \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2015/sep/23/un-security-council-failing-70-years\">known as the P5</a> (US, UK, France, Russia and China) \u2013 are often quick to criticise the body\u2019s role, yet many member states still invest vast resources in campaigns to get elected. Elected members of the security council cannot have the influence of the veto-wielding P5, but they can pursue important agendas and affect crucial decisions.</p> <p>In December, Jordan was instrumental in pushing forward <a href=\"http://www.un.org/press/en/2015/sc12149.doc.htm\">security council resolution 2250</a>, the body\u2019s first motion on youth, peace and security.

Candidates will be expected to adhere to their stated policy positions during their time on the council.</p> <p>Those who agree to take part will be offering a refreshing show of partnership , confirming their commitment to making the UN more fit for purpose. Standing for transparency and accountability in principle is very different from acting upon it, and it will be a great testament to each participating country that they are willing to be pioneers for the debates.</p> <p>Change, however incremental, is always viewed with suspicion at the UN, but it seems to be the flavour of the day with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/12/candidates-for-un-top-job-given-public-hearing\">recent opening up of the secretary general selection process</a> through campaigns such as <a href=\"http://www.1for7billion.org/\">1 for 7 billion</a>. </p> <p>What we are trying to do is bring these candidacies into an era of openness, where votes are secured for policy substance, rather than for favours owed. If each member state now has to think slightly longer about the platform and promises they will put forward, then this initiative is an overwhelming success. This is what partnership looks like at the UN: member states working with civil society to try to improve the work of the organisation as a whole.</p> <p>The debates will be a vital way of promoting better engagement between member states, civil society and the wider UN community, to ensure that the security council works not just for a few, but for us all. </p> <p>\u2022 <em>Bonian Golmohammadi is the secretary general of the World Federation of United Nations Associations, a global civil society network of almost 100 nationally </em><em>based UN associations</em></p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-21T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Before her death in 1999, aged just 28, the playwright Sarah Kane had made it known that she did not want her work to be adapted into other mediums. So when composer <a href=\"http://philipvenables.com/\">Philip Venables</a> approached her estate with a view to writing an opera version of her last play, <em>4.48 Psychosis</em>, for a joint project between the Royal Opera House and the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, he says it was more in a sense of hope than expectation.</p> <p>\u201cWe thought it was unlikely we would get the rights to adapt it, because so many requests had been turned down in the past,\u201d he says. \u201cBut our timing was good. While Kane did say she didn\u2019t want any adaptations, she also said she didn\u2019t want her work to become museum pieces. Really, those requests are contradictory, and after 15 years her estate was looking to open up the work to a dialogue with the contemporary. I think our production is therefore a bit of a test case, they are dipping their toe into the water.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/may/11/448-psychosis-sarah-kane-new-opera-philip-venables-royal-opera-house\">'The strange thing is we howled with laughter': Sarah Kane's enigmatic last play</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Kane wrote <em>4.48 Psychosis</em> shortly before she killed herself, and ever since its posthumous staging a few months later, it has been crudely characterised as a suicide note. It is not an unreasonable assumption. The story \u2013 such as it is, in a very free form in which the script provides no indication of cast or which character is speaking at any one time \u2013 apparently takes in someone waking up in the early hours of the morning and realising they need psychiatric help, being diagnosed with depression, undergoing drugs and ECT treatment, neither of which provide long-term solutions, entering a brief period of remission and moments of sanity before suffering a relapse and making a decision not to continue living.</p> <p>\u201cBut it is very discursive and none of it is really in a timeline,\u201d explains Venables, who says when he met Simon Kane, Sarah\u2019s brother who looks after the estate, he didn\u2019t so much make a pitch as just talk about what he thought of the play. \u201cFirstly the text is so musical. Not just on a sentence by sentence basis \u2013 which includes things such as lists of numbers and drugs, with which you can do a lot musically \u2013 but in the way it is structured as a whole. It lends itself well to music. I know it was condemned at the time as being somehow chaotic and random. It is absolutely not. The way it is formally constructed is incredible, with so much clarity of thought and lucidity.\u201d</p> <p>In agreeing to the first adaptation of Kane\u2019s work, the only stipulation from the estate was that the opera stayed \u201cfaithful to the spirit and integrity of the play\u201d, although they acknowledged there would have to be some minor cuts to make space for the music. \u201cThe main request was that I didn\u2019t cut anything just because I didn\u2019t understand it,\u201d says Venables. \u201cIn fact we haven\u2019t done very much cutting at all, and one of the best decisions I made was to do a great deal of preparatory work on the text before setting any music. It provided me with a sense of where I was within the whole thing, even when I was struggling with little bars here and there.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e98932ee153a106271435951045ee91ecca6f3d2\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e98932ee153a106271435951045ee91ecca6f3d2/12_7_936_635/500.jpg\" alt=\"The six female singers in rehearsal for 4.48 Psychosis\" width=\"500\" height=\"339\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The six female singers in rehearsal for <em>4.48 Psychosis.</em></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Cummiskey/Royal Opera House</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In all, the opera has retained 95% of the text \u2013 \u201cin the right order\u201d \u2013 that will be conveyed through singing; spoken dialogue, with a background of music; and visual projection. The production features six female singers and the Chroma ensemble made up of 12 musicians \u2013 violas, saxophones and percussion to the fore \u2013 as well as pre-recorded music. Venables talks about using \u201ccomputer-type music, post-romantic arias, percussion duets, elevator music and also recorded sound. It\u2019s very eclectic. Although the structure is in a single direction to a point at the end, it is not an organically through-composed text. It\u2019s as if there are ribbons of differently cut bits of material running through it, which is a little reminiscent of Stravinsky.\u201d</p> <p>Director <a href=\"http://tedhuffman.com/\">Ted Huffman</a> says the melding of the text with music has felt, dramatically, like a natural process. \u201cThere is such a wide variety of register in the writing, many recurring motifs and especially there is text that clearly wants to overlay other parts of the text. This is a rarity in theatre, but something that occurs in opera all the time, where the music helps define individual lines so you can hear several things being sung at once.\u201d</p> <p>Rather than cast a single protagonist, the six singers combine to become a sort of hive mind, all contributing to the thought processes being played out. \u201cSometimes opera singers can take their role and go their separate ways from other members of the cast,\u201d explains Huffman. \u201cBut this has been written for an ensemble, with all six singers together all the time, contributing to a collective consciousness. The whole piece feels like you are being wound up for something at the end. And when it finally happens there is a sense of release. The play is structured to do that, and hearing it happen through music helps that feeling of catharsis.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a78c9c82a71a9bca94ea4c4e0d9308ddb4e0eb11\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a78c9c82a71a9bca94ea4c4e0d9308ddb4e0eb11/11_12_939_632/500.jpg\" alt=\"The cast in rehearsal for 4.48 Psychosis\" width=\"500\" height=\"337\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The cast in rehearsal for <em>4.48 Psychosis</em>.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephen Cummiskey/Royal Opera House</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>While opera is no stranger to extreme emotions, violence, madness and death \u2013 Huffman cites <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/oct/17/poulenc-the-complete-songs-review\">Poulenc</a>\u2019s 1958 adaptation of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/jeancocteau\">Jean Cocteau</a>\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2006/nov/07/classicalmusicandopera\"><em>La Voix Humaine</em></a>, which deals with suicide and a woman\u2019s loneliness \u2013 the directness of Kane\u2019s language has required some thought. One of the highlights of an early workshop was the singers practising a passage containing multiple repetitions of the phrase \u201cFuck you\u201d. Venables laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t think people will be surprised or shocked. A lot of people coming to the opera will know about Kane and the play. But we did develop that section, and have moved away from it being more of a song thing, which risked becoming a bit too <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2003/apr/30/theatre.artsfeatures2\"><em>Jerry Springer</em></a>. It is now more spoken, which makes the scene not so musically perfect and choreographed. At first it felt a little cleaner and controlled than it should. It is not a controlled speech.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/mar/15/448-psychosis-sheffield-crucible-review\">4.48 Psychosis review \u2013 painfully funny revival of Sarah Kane\u2019s last work</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The issues of gender and mental health explored in <em>4.48</em> are subject to far more mainstream debate today than when the play was written. But Venables, who has specifically dealt with gender in some of his previous work, says social or political issues were not at the forefront of his thinking. \u201cOf course they are in there and we have made decisions about gender, for instance, by having an all-female cast. But we\u2019re not doing anything representational. The main attraction was more an avant-garde structural thing. Can the way the text was written be mirrored in an operatic structure that is also nonconformist?\u201d</p> <p>Despite the \u201calmost inextricable link between the history and the theatre\u201d, between Kane\u2019s life and death and the play, Venables was adamant that they didn\u2019t want to \u201cproduce a biopic. There is very little in the text that identifies the author as a writer, and some of that is quite opaque, so we don\u2019t reference Kane the person in terms of how she looked or the specifics of where she was. Our approach has been the opposite. This could be a story about anybody, and she was so imaginative in the way she reframed, again and again, an emotional idea. She looks at depression from so many different angles that you get a bird\u2019s-eye view of it, but also feel that you are right in it. And while there is no getting away from the fact that the play leads in one direction and is all about that final moment, it is about more than an individual act of violence and horror. Many productions end with blood and guts, but what is also at the heart of the play \u2013 and in Kane\u2019s work in general \u2013 is love, and we have incorporated that into our approach. What it shows is that Kane\u2019s work is not becoming narrower and more biographical as the years go by, but instead it is becoming richer, more flexible and more open to possibilities. I hope our version helps to continue that process.\u201d</p> <p><em>\u2022 </em><a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/productions/448-psychosis-by-philip-venables\"><em>4.48 Psychosis</em> is at the Lyric Hammersmith</a>, London W6, from 24 to 28 May.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-21T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Another week, another Netflix innovation that seems to upend everything we know about the entertainment industry. Firstly, the company made a mockery of traditional TV scheduling by issuing its original series 20 episodes at a time. Then it commissioned full-length feature films for immediate online distribution, much to the dismay of the world\u2019s cinema operators. Now comes the final insult: a new show filmed and released within a 48-hour window, a new frontier for the platform, and a slap in the face of Saturday newspaper supplements that go to print half a week before they hit newsstands.</p> <p>At the time of writing, Netflix has released three episodes of its flagship talkshow Chelsea, fronted by outspoken US comedian Chelsea Handler. By the time you read this, that sample size will have doubled, but I\u2019m guessing it\u2019ll still feel like a lukewarm debut. Despite a lengthy development process that began when Handler signed a seven-year deal with the platform in June 2014, it\u2019s hard to identify a single way in which Chelsea breaks with US talkshow convention.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mIBYBJ5Wkc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/-mIBYBJ5Wkc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Guests are jarringly juxtaposed for maximum viral potential (one episode sees US secretary of education John King sit down with hip-hop punchline Pitbull) but their contributions only occasionally stray from the promotional matter at hand. In an episode focused entirely on Captain America: Civil War, Handler has her studio audience applaud the film\u2019s box-office tally, before straightfacedly claiming that Marvel Studios \u2013 whose \u201ccinematic universe\u201d will gain its first non-white lead in 2018 \u2013 is singlehandedly keeping black actors in work.</p> <p>Pre-taped skits and travelogues fill the gaps between the interviews, but prove just as unimaginative. Where Handler\u2019s previous Netflix project, Chelsea Does, breathed new life into the staid world of the celebrity-fronted docuseries by refusing to shy away from touchy subjects, the documentary segments in Chelsea feel choreographed to the point of anaemia.</p> <p>Perhaps it\u2019s too soon to properly assess the show, given that conventional wisdom dictates that US talkshows take three or four decades to fully hit their stride, and perhaps in the coming weeks Handler will make good on her promise to usher in a revolutionary new era of entertainment broadcasting. In the meantime, there\u2019s no getting around at least one of Chelsea\u2019s flaws: while broadcasting a show two days after it\u2019s produced might outpace the rest of Netflix\u2019s programming, in US talkshow terms, it\u2019s two days late.</p>",

      "body": "<h2><strong>The priests</strong></h2> <p><strong>Father Wilfrid McGreal, 77, was ordained 52 years ago and is a Carmelite friar, based at </strong><a href=\"http://www.carmelite.org/index.php?nuc=content&amp;id=111\"><strong>the Shrine of St Jude, Faversham</strong></a><strong>. Father Leonard Tatt, 52, was ordained in 2013, after a long career with Royal Mail. He is now a parish priest at St Boniface, Tooting, south London.</strong><br /></p> <p><strong>Wilfrid</strong> I went into the order straight from school. At the time, there was a lot of interest in being a priest; six of my classmates were also ordained. My uncle was a Carmelite friar, and he used to come and visit us as part of his holiday. He was also profoundly deaf, though able to lip-read. He had a catch-all phrase, so when he hadn\u2019t deciphered something, he\u2019d say, \u201cIs that so?\u201d So somebody might say, \u201cI\u2019m going to get married.\u201d \u201cIs that so?\u201d \u201cThe house is burning down.\u201d \u201cIs that so?\u201d He had a great sense of humour, and through him I could see this was a way of life where you could be fully human, fully alive.</p> <p>I studied in Rome during the Second Vatican Council, which was very exciting. There were some famous battles that took the church in a new direction. A lot of the bishops had experienced the horrors of the second world war, so there was a strong sense that the church had to be in dialogue with society, rather than telling society what to do.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There's still a stereotypical image of what priests are meant to be</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Leonard</strong> My route into the priesthood was a bit different. I was married at 22 and divorced by 23. In those days, it didn\u2019t matter what had happened, you were both automatically at fault. You couldn\u2019t go to communion or have another relationship. So I struggled with my relationship with the church for a long time. It was only when my father got ill and I started praying with my mum that I came back.</p> <p>I started off thinking I was saying the words just for her, but the more I said them, the more I realised how much they meant to me. After my father died, I started to investigate whether I could become a priest.</p> <p>There\u2019s still a stereotypical image of what priests are meant to be, but at the seminary where I studied, there were other divorcees and widowers. There was a former high court judge, teachers and an ex-postman \u2013 me. You understand the experiences people go through in a different way.</p> <p><strong>Wilfrid </strong>There is still a big controversy around admitting people who are in second marriages to holy communion. I think there are a lot of issues around sexuality that need to be looked at. There\u2019s the issue of gay and lesbian and transgender people. It\u2019s important for the church to have pastoral care for everybody, so nobody feels excluded.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In confessional, people would ask, 'How far can you go with your girlfriend before it\u2019s a sin?'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Leonard</strong> Do you think the way people see priests has changed? They used to be put on a pedestal. Now, particularly with modern technology, we\u2019re more accessible.</p> <p><strong>Wilfrid </strong>Yes, and there used to be far more concern for laws that dictated people\u2019s behaviour. For instance, when I made my first communion as a kid, you weren\u2019t allowed to eat past midnight \u2013 even if you swallowed a tiny bit of toothpaste, you weren\u2019t supposed to go to communion. In confessional, people would ask, \u201cHow far can you go with your girlfriend before it\u2019s a sin?\u201d</p> <p><strong>Leonard </strong>Do you find there\u2019s a difference in your congregation now, too? In Tooting, the people come from everywhere. When I was growing up, it would have been all English or Irish, but we have people from the Philippines, South America, Poland \u2013 there\u2019s probably not a country that\u2019s not represented on a Sunday. The Poles have brought a great devotion back into the Catholic church. But we\u2019re also seeing people convert to Anglicanism because they like women priests.</p> <p><strong>Wilfrid</strong> And that\u2019s something we have to continue to reflect on. While there are no women priests in the Catholic church, it\u2019s important we support them in other churches.</p> <p><strong>Leonard</strong> But it can be difficult, can\u2019t it, because opinions are diverse. I also talk to people who think it would be a backward step having women priests in the Catholic church. But we have women working as Eucharistic ministers, young girls acting as altar servants, which wouldn\u2019t have been allowed before. You see them grow in confidence, and it\u2019s great. So there are real signs of change.</p> <h2><strong>The police officers</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"cc0c1bb3d5032ca58f9d54e71325ae477c028dc1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cc0c1bb3d5032ca58f9d54e71325ae477c028dc1/452_105_2755_3444/800.jpg\" alt=\"Lamorna Trahair and Sue Scott.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lamorna Trahair and Sue Scott.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gareth Iwan Jones for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You might go from dealing with sudden death and a highly emotional situation, to a call about a dispute over a hedge</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Detective chief superintendent Sue Scott, 49, joined </strong><a href=\"https://www.avonandsomerset.police.uk/\"><strong>Avon and Somerset Constabulary</strong></a><strong> in 1985 and retired in December 2015. </strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/pctrahair?lang=en-gb\"><strong>PC Lamorna Trahair</strong></a><strong>, 31, finished her two-year probation in April last year and has just passed her sergeant\u2019s exam. </strong></p> <p><strong>Sue</strong> When I joined, aged 17, my uniform was an A-line skirt, black tights and black shoes. There wasn\u2019t another option. I remember standing on the parade ground in the snow and losing feeling in my toes. I had this cape when I was on patrol. What was really good about it was that you could skulk away in the shadows; if I crouched down, it touched the floor, so it was really warm. That was an excellent bit of kit, unlike the old-fashioned handbag you got issued, which came with a little truncheon. So there I was, a teenager, on patrol at night with a handbag and a cape. It was ridiculous, looking back now.</p> <p><strong>Lamorna</strong> So you joined in 1985? At the risk of losing my job, that\u2019s the year I was born. It\u2019s amazing how much has changed in a short time. Did you spend a lot of time dealing with people who were mentally ill?</p> <p><strong>Sue</strong> I think the difference is, when I was in your position, we\u2019d probably have thought of them as a nuisance \u2013 the homeless, for example. We didn\u2019t look at them through the lens of vulnerability, didn\u2019t see them as people who needed our care. I think it\u2019s good \u2013 it\u2019s right \u2013 that the attitude has changed and we now do our best to help vulnerable people. The problem is, now that we\u2019re more aware of the issues affecting them, such as child sexual exploitation, the demands on us have increased.</p> <p><strong>Lamorna</strong> I don\u2019t think the public realise how much of our time is taken up with keeping people safe. The statistics show something like only one in five of the incidents we deal with is a purely criminal offence.</p> <p><strong>Sue</strong> And the long-term cases, dealing with issues like child exploitation and modern slavery, are far more complicated these days. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/female-genital-mutilation\">FGM</a>, for example, wasn\u2019t on the horizon when I started out, and it\u2019s such a complex area. You\u2019ve got child protection issues, cultural nuances, multi-agency working \u2013 and that\u2019s one small part of the raft of things you guys now have to deal with.</p> <p><strong>Lamorna</strong> It\u2019s a really fast pace. You start work the minute you step into a police station, not when your shift starts. Because we have toughbooks [in-car laptops], we don\u2019t have to return to the station to deal with paperwork, so we go from one job to the next, then the next, and that can be pretty draining.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I joined, you wouldn't show emotion, just as a self-preservation mechanism</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>You might go from dealing with sudden death and a highly emotional family situation, to a call about a neighbour dispute over a hedge. And that second call, it\u2019s important to them, but you carry the emotions of the first call with you. I\u2019m not sure people always appreciate that we do have genuine empathy.</p> <p><strong>Sue</strong> When I joined, you wouldn\u2019t show emotion, just as a self-preservation mechanism. My role models were either austere, autocratic men or women who looked and operated like men, and I don\u2019t think that helped. Perhaps that\u2019s how we got ourselves into that \u201cus and them\u201d position with the public. When I started, the attitude was very much, \u201cWe\u2019re the police, we know best.\u201d We\u2019re much better at listening now.</p> <p><strong>Lamorna</strong> Your son is coming up to the age you were when you joined as a cadet: if he wanted to be a police officer, would you encourage him?</p> <p><strong>Sue</strong> I look at him and think, that\u2019s so young to have been on that path. I\u2019d want him to get some life experience first. The great thing for your generation is, you can do anything. At one point I was interested in going into firearms, and my aptitude test showed I was quite a good shot, but I couldn\u2019t fire off more than two or three rounds because my hand span was too small. Now, they have different sizes of gun, so it\u2019s not an issue. The world is your oyster: take advantage of that.</p> <h2><strong>The social workers</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c988d07a8c9651f7376e499d5bc702da3a1d273a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c988d07a8c9651f7376e499d5bc702da3a1d273a/393_364_3908_2345/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iain Brown and Manisha Patel.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Iain Brown and Manisha Patel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I had to place four children in care, I didn't have time to think, am I ready for this?

She wouldn\u2019t disclose where her children were, but we eventually found them. She had been leaving them with babysitters she\u2019d found through Gumtree. We placed all four children in emergency foster care. Their safety was paramount. I didn\u2019t have time to think, \u201cAm I ready for this?\u201d It broke my heart, though, for the siblings to be separated. </p> <p><strong>Iain</strong> As you become more qualified, you realise how much you have to take care of yourself, look after your wellbeing. I like to walk a lot, that\u2019s how I find time to reflect. There\u2019s such a high level of burnout. I think the average time people stay in the job is seven years. And when you think it takes some people six years to train, that\u2019s pretty serious. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>You have to take care of yourself to avoid burnout</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Manisha</strong> And you never switch off, do you? That\u2019s what I\u2019m finding. </p> <p><strong>Iain</strong> You find it changes how you talk to your family, to your friends. You\u2019re a lot more guarded. You try not to get involved in things that don\u2019t concern you. </p> <p><strong>Manisha</strong> Do you think you are born to be a social worker or can a good social worker be made?</p> <p><strong>Iain</strong> I think you adapt. We have to believe we can make a difference. In the last five years, there has been a reduction in the number of young people coming into the criminal justice system, which is good. But we find the cases that are coming in are more complex. They\u2019ve just employed another manager to do half my role \u2013 that shows you how much pressure we\u2019re under. What austerity has done is highlight the level of deprivation in society. There are families who are really, really struggling. The people who are coming through to us are high priority, high risk, high vulnerability.</p> <p><strong>Manisha</strong> The families I see are at breaking point. With that first family I mentioned, the mother had in the past experienced severe physical violence from her partner, who is now in prison. You might find you\u2019re working with a family where there\u2019s a child with gender dysphoria, then there\u2019s another child in the same family who is taking explicit pictures and sending them to people, and they don\u2019t even have an awareness that it might be wrong.</p> <p><strong>Iain</strong> That\u2019s a much bigger problem than it was. We\u2019re seeing greater numbers of young people entering the criminal system, because they\u2019re engaging in sexual acts with other young people, imitating things they\u2019ve seen online. </p> <p><strong>Manisha</strong> I\u2019d really like to do more work with cases of human trafficking. It\u2019s not just a border issue, it\u2019s a child protection issue. I don\u2019t think people realise how much it\u2019s happening. It could be happening in the house next to you.</p> <p><strong>Iain</strong> And, again, we\u2019ve seen a huge rise in trafficking cases. This is why we need people to stay with the profession. We need people with enthusiasm like you.</p> <p><strong>Manisha</strong> And newly qualified social workers need support. We need people like you, too.</p> <h2><strong>The teachers</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2d4f0ad7212649ad1b8fff4c8fa56a02ec83c029\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2d4f0ad7212649ad1b8fff4c8fa56a02ec83c029/64_286_4965_2979/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rohan Knox and Ann-Marie Wade.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rohan Knox and Ann-Marie Wade.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I started there was no Ofsted. You could get on with teaching. Today's expectations are just not realistic</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Ann-Marie Wade has been a teacher for 27 years and is currently vice-principal of a school in Lewisham, south-east London. Rohan Knox is an NQT (newly qualified teacher) at a primary school in north London.</strong></p> <p><strong>Rohan</strong> It\u2019s inspiring for me to meet a teacher who has been in the profession for so long, because you\u2019re constantly hearing horror stories about how many people drop out. </p> <p><strong>Ann-Marie</strong> I get fed up with those sorts of stories. But I can see the pressures are different now. I knew when I was three years old that I wanted to teach. I remember watching the nursery school teacher ticking off the register and thinking, \u201cThat\u2019s what I want to do.\u201d But apparently the average for people now going into the profession is five years before they leave, which is pretty depressing. </p> <p>When I qualified, things were a little more laissez-faire. We had lesson observations, but we didn\u2019t have proper performance management. There was no Ofsted. You could get on with teaching. This is what concerns me with the new tests for key stage 3 and 4. I am not convinced that what we are teaching children has much relevance to their lives now or in the future. And how often in the workplace are you told to prepare something using pen and paper in only one and a half hours? It\u2019s an outdated process.</p> <p><strong>Rohan</strong> It\u2019s difficult to prepare for the realities of the job. Behaviour management has been a bit of a baptism of fire, I must say.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I worry that it's demoralising for the children who struggle to keep up</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Ann-Marie </strong>Children are coming in with much more complex needs. Dyslexia is on the rise, and autism. Whether that\u2019s because they weren\u2019t recognised before, I have no idea. Back in the 1980s, a typical report from the special educational needs department would have said something like, \u201cSome behavioural and emotional problems, perhaps a little bit slow in their reading.\u201d There was nothing on the scale of what we\u2019re seeing now. And with the new reforms, there are fewer children who can actually access a statement and funding.</p> <p><strong>Rohan</strong> Expectations are constantly rising. I know it can be great for motivation, but we had a meeting recently where we were shown the expected writing levels for a child leaving year three. I knew not all the children in my class would get to that level; it\u2019s just not realistic for some of them. And I worry that it\u2019s demoralising for children who struggle to keep up. I suppose it\u2019s a constant learning curve. </p> <p><strong>Ann-Marie</strong> Yes. But the moment you start thinking, \u201cOh, I know it all\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s when you need to get out of teaching.</p> <h2><strong>The nurses</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ae394a93c7813ca3763bc4eb5d9be1cfd64c8ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ae394a93c7813ca3763bc4eb5d9be1cfd64c8ae/237_289_4051_2431/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kath Fawcett and Hayley Blenkinsop.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kath Fawcett and Hayley Blenkinsop.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Gary Calton for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There are expectations that are unachievable \u2013 Dr Google has got a lot to answer for</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Kath Fawcett, 66, is a deputy sister in acute medicine; she has chosen to freeze her pension and continue working. Hayley Blenkinsop, 27, qualified a year ago and works in acute medicine with a respiratory speciality. Both work for the County Durham &amp; Darlington NHS trust.</strong></p> <p><strong>Kath</strong> I came to work here as a cadet at 16. I\u2019d work at the hospital every Saturday morning. You weren\u2019t allowed near the patients, but you\u2019d take notes and run messages. Pharmacy was the best place to be, because you got to mix all the creams and count out the tablets. Then, in my second year, I was full-time Tuesday to Saturday in the hospital, and spent Mondays at college, learning English, maths and human biology. We had to see an ECT [electro-convulsive therapy] treatment taking place. People think ECT is banned, but we still do it.</p> <p>When you got to work on a ward, you were thrown in at the deep end, doing everything that everybody else did. My first Christmas, I was on a men\u2019s surgical ward, and all the others wandered off to have a little jolly on the other ward and left me. In my second year as a student nurse, three out of four nights I was in charge of admissions on an orthopaedics ward. I think, for us, it felt like more of an adventure.</p> <p><strong>Hayley</strong> Yes, my course was half theory and half practice. These days, until you put on a blue uniform, you\u2019ve no idea what you\u2019re getting into. You being in charge of a ward as a student nurse \u2013 that scares me!</p> <p><strong>Kath</strong> Well, I suppose we were better prepared for things actually happening. Your generation is more protected. You should be able to take more decisions. I was lucky because there were jobs around \u2013 there was a period when they were training people, but there was little chance of a job at the end of it.</p> <p><strong>Hayley</strong> I\u2019ve had friends in that situation. One ended up working in a nursing home for six years. When she came back to a hospital setting, so much had changed.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I've been shouted at. I've been in tears</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Kath</strong> It\u2019s not just the pace of it, it\u2019s that the needs of patients are so different. It\u2019s been much more noticeable in the last five, 10 years, patients now are so much sicker. They\u2019ve got more complex needs. If someone comes in with heart failure, for example, you\u2019ll then find they\u2019ve got osteoarthritis and all sorts of other things, so they don\u2019t follow the pathway for a normal recovery.</p> <p><strong>Hayley</strong> There\u2019s so much paperwork. I was told during my training there would be, but I don\u2019t think anything prepares you for the amount there is. And it feels as if you have to get it all down, or it could come back on you. All you want to do is be able to look after the patients. People\u2019s relatives don\u2019t understand why we can\u2019t make things happen. I\u2019ve been shouted at. I\u2019ve been in tears.</p> <p><strong>Kath</strong> Society has been given expectations that are unachievable in the care environment we have \u2013 Dr Google has got a lot to answer for. People shout at us, but they won\u2019t shout at the consultants. Consultants are gods. It\u2019s only in the last couple of years that I\u2019ve been able to call consultants by their first names.</p> <p><strong>Hayley</strong> We\u2019re all going for a night out in a couple of weeks and our consultants are coming. But I suppose it\u2019s all changing \u2013 nurses are prescribing now. It feels as if there are opportunities out there again.</p> <h2><br /></h2>",

Omari would spend school holidays in Thornton Heath library in Croydon, which ran a scheme called Book Trail. \u201cYou read a book, write a detailed review as proof you\u2019ve read it and they give you a badge,\u201d the MC explains. \u201cThat\u2019s where my competitive nature came out. Give me the badges! I would sit in the library all day, not \u2019cos I loved reading, just because I needed those badges.\u201d It\u2019s also how he found his way with words. \u201cI read so many books when I was a kid that I didn\u2019t even know were shaping me up.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/apr/01/stormzy-review-o2-academy-islington-london\">Stormzy review \u2013 accessible flow that shows his range</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When Omari was 10, two big moments happened: he became too old for Book Trail and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/07/dizzee-rascal-boy-in-da-corner-red-bull-music-academy\">Dizzee Rascal</a>\u2019s Boy In Da Corner was released. Dizzee\u2019s debut was the first grime record to make a dent in the mainstream and remains the London estate-born genre\u2019s masterpiece. Its ectopic beats, menacing bass and frantic take on life on the streets sounded like nothing that had gone before. Even <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/jul/18/popandrock.artsfeatures\">the Guardian\u2019s review of it</a> at the time said it \u201cappears to borrow from nothing.\u201d</p> <p>Boy In Da Corner was also Omari\u2019s musical year zero. Soon after it made the top 40, he became infatuated with the new breed of MCs, with crews like Roll Deep, Ruff Sqwad and N.A.S.T.Y, and their stars: Wiley, Dizzee and Kano. He would swap new tracks with classmates using the Bluetooth functionality on old Nokia phones. Grime at that time worked like social media does today: hundreds of tracks would come out each month, responding and interacting with each other, music videos were filmed on phones, and rappers jostled for prominence during freestyle clashes on radio station <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/rinsefm/slimzee220216\">Rinse FM</a>, YouTube channel <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwG_ozkZQMk\">Risky 2 Roadz</a> or on Jammer\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTF_T47CDnI\">Lord Of The Mics</a> battle series.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7xA8Hzuyac\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/C7xA8Hzuyac?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Then, as Omari grew up he saw the genre develop. Dizzee became a pop star, but other MCs who tried to follow his grime-lite model isolated their fanbases and eventually lost the attention of the mainstream. At the same time, in the late 2000s, the police were hellbent on shutting down grime events using the notorious risk-assessment form 696. Artists who thought they would make a living from grime started to give up. Omari did a bit of MCing at school, but within a few years he had become a small-time drug dealer. By the time he\u2019d graduated, grime had retreated back to the underground and Michael Omari seemed a long way from becoming Stormzy.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>\u201cEvery thing that I was told that I couldn\u2019t do without a label, I\u2019ve done.\u201d</p> <footer> <cite></cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In 2016, it\u2019s a very different scenario.

Yesterday he interviewed David Beckham in front of a live audience; tonight he\u2019ll be a surprise guest at Wretch 32\u2019s show at Camden\u2019s KOKO.</p> <p>Grime, meanwhile, has rebuilt itself around him. US hip-hop giants such as Kanye and Drake will tell anyone who\u2019ll listen about their love for the genre (the former famously performing at the 2015 BRITs <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/feb/25/kanye-west-debuts-new-track-all-day-at-the-brit-awards-2015\">with a crew of UK grime rappers</a>, including Stormzy); Skepta, now the scene\u2019s biggest star, was outselling both Beyonc\u00e9 and Drake in the midweek charts with his <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/06/10-things-we-learned-from-skeptas-konnichiwa\">new album Konnichiwa</a>. Last summer, the grime movement came full circle when Dizzee Rascal joined Stormzy on stage at Wireless festival. The scene \u2013 and it <em>is</em> a scene \u2013 is in rudest-ever health, thriving on collaboration and supportive MCs, instead of constant beefing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"95f98e26a5183fe97d4e283d5e1e4a6f6880011d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/95f98e26a5183fe97d4e283d5e1e4a6f6880011d/556_74_2788_1673/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stormzy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Live and direct\u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Chris Lever/REX</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But Stormzy\u2019s connection to grime has obscured the many other ways in which he is a unique and outspoken figure in British music. He still hasn\u2019t signed a record deal and is the first unsigned British artist to have a top 10 single (if we\u2019re ignoring YouTuber Alex Day, who once managed the feat with novelty song Forever Yours). </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/12/skepta-konnichiwa-review-boy-better-know-album-of-the-week\">Skepta: Konnichiwa review \u2013 rhymes that are dextrous, sharp and very British</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I was at a music industry seminar recently where people were already talking about \u201cthe Stormzy model\u201d. Other artists would likely make this their story, but Stormzy\u2019s desire to score high chart positions and win accolades (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/nov/03/grime-music-proper-recognition-at-last-from-the-mobo-awards\">he won the best male act at the 2015 Mobos</a>) doesn\u2019t come from some political opposition to the industry machine, just the same place that makes a boy read for badges. \u201cI just feel like there is nothing I cannot do,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery single thing that I was told that I couldn\u2019t do without a label \u2013 get in the charts, get on to the Radio 1 playlist \u2013 I\u2019ve done.\u201d</p> <p>The diverse fanbase he has cultivated over the past two years has gone some way to help. Stormzy\u2019s skill as an MC and strict adherence to grime first-principles (140bpm tracks, freestyles, performing over classic instrumentals from grime forefathers) means he attracts groups of clued-up teenagers who buzz off whatever off-the-cuff tracks he puts online next. But Stormzy\u2019s gigs can also feel like punk shows, complete with suburban boys in moshpits. He has also, whether unwittingly or not, been taken under lad culture\u2019s wing, held up alongside footballer Jamie Vardy, doing nine J\u00e4gerbombs on a night out, wearing vests, and going for a \u201ccheeky Nando\u2019s\u201d (which is lad parlance for, er, going for a Nando\u2019s).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e71eda35c26b687f023a0c0f1aecc5f33ed85973\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e71eda35c26b687f023a0c0f1aecc5f33ed85973/0_1269_6192_3715/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stormzy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Dan Wilton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYeah I had to learn about lads,\u201d says Stormzy, without skipping a beat, aware that a cool, \u201curban\u201d grime star seems like an unlikely figurehead for banter-loving uni guys. \u201cWhen I was about 19, I made the decision to stop being a thug and a gangster, and I got a prestigious engineering apprenticeship in Birmingham. When I first got there, I remember walking into a room and seeing about 17 white faces.\u201d He says they were all taking the mick out of each other in the most vulgar language imaginable, and laughing about it. He was shocked. \u201cGrowing up in the ends, you don\u2019t do that. You meet someone: you\u2019re very wary of them, you already don\u2019t trust them. We were young kids who are going to war every week, there\u2019s no time to make a joke.\u201d But once he realised that it was okay to break a smile, he reassessed his image. \u201cI realised I don\u2019t want to be a negative bad boy in the corner, not talking to anyone.\u201d </p> <p>Today, he dips in and out of his laddy side, but insists, \u201cI\u2019ve always been a banter king!\u201d One month he\u2019ll be <a href=\"https://i-d.vice.com/en_us/article/what-stormzy-taught-us-at-oxford-university-last-night\">giving a talk at the Oxford Guild</a>; the next hanging out in Ayia Napa with a guy who\u2019s got \u201cStormzy\u201d tattooed on his bum. But what runs through everything Stormzy does is a self-effacing British sense of humour. It sticks out at a time when pop is having a bit of a po-faced moment. Most artists take themselves very seriously, preferring to only talk about the music. </p> <p>Stormzy, however, is more of a personality in the Robbie Williams mould: his mum appears in his video rapping his lyrics, and he challenges his fans to Fifa competitions on social media. He says that after living with a group of lads during college, he realised he was \u201cthe banter king\u201d. He\u2019s similar in that sense to his icon Dizzee, who was always happy to balance his weightier stuff with moments of levity. \u201cI don\u2019t want to have to put a mask on,\u201d he explains. \u201cFuck that \u2013 sometimes I\u2019m pissed off, sometimes fuck off, sometimes I\u2019m up for banter, sometimes I can playfight for 12 straight hours with the mandem.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1b475e6e712374b6a054e243cfab0dc9685edbf3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1b475e6e712374b6a054e243cfab0dc9685edbf3/0_27_594_356/500.jpg\" alt=\"Stormzy accepts his award for Best Grime Act during the Mobo awards 2015.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stormzy accepts his award for Best Grime Act during the Mobo awards 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Dave J Hogan/Getty</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Here\u2019s a story that shows the many sides of Stormzy. Last year, he dropped his freestyle track Shut Up, which takes as its instrumental the early-00s grime track Functions On The Low. It first emerged as a one-take YouTube video filmed in a park near his former home in Thornton Heath, Stormzy performing on the fly in a red tracksuit flanked by fans. For your average MC, that would have been the end of it. But Stormzy then performed the track during British boxer Anthony Joshua\u2019s ring-walk for his fight against Dillian Whyte and it soared in popularity. It prompted Stormzy to make a bid for the naffest of British music institutions, the Christmas No 1, tweeting \u201cLET\u2019S DO THIS BUN X FACTOR!!!\u201d. Within a week he was dressed as Santa performing a festive version of the track on 1Xtra with the lyrics changed to \u201cReally I shouldn\u2019t be in the rave/ \u2019Cos I don\u2019t drink when I\u2019m riding my sleigh.\u201d It ended up at No 8, one place higher than the X Factor winner\u2019s single.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/18/party-politics-why-grime-defines-the-sound-of-protest-in-2016\">Party politics: why grime defines the sound of protest in 2016</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite all this, Stormzy is more than just the jester of the grime scene. As well as being up for a laugh, he\u2019s politically outspoken. After the Brits this year, for example, he called out organisers for the \u201cembarrassing\u201d lack of \u201cgrime and underground\u201d artists nominated. He says he has since had a \u201cproper chat\u201d with the Chairman of the awards to discuss \u201cmaking the list of voters more diverse\u201d so as to prevent \u201cnational outrage over discrimination\u201d but wants to make sure that any changes don\u2019t feel like tokenism - \u201cif <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/12/years-years-communion-review-pastel-chords-obvious-key-changes\">Years &amp; Years</a> win the award, that\u2019s cool, they deserve it.\u201d</p> <p>He\u2019s more open to engaging with traditional party politics, too. In the past, grime\u2019s main political stance has been anti-establishment (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MQOG5BkY2Bc\">Skepta\u2019s Shutdown</a> claims that \u201cwe don\u2019t listen to no politician\u201d, in part a reaction to form 696). Stormzy seems happier to take sides. He recently tweeted \u201cBeg no one vote for this Zac Goldsmith bruddah he seems like a proper pussyhole\u201d only to find himself minutes later followed by the official Jeremy Corbyn account. Stormzy grins when I bring this up.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqQGUJK7Na4\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RqQGUJK7Na4?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>\u201cMy man, Jeremy! Young Jeremy, my guy. I dig what he says. I saw some sick picture of him from back in the day when he was campaigning about anti-apartheid and I thought: yeah, I like your energy. Have you seen that footage of House of Commons? They\u2019re all neeky dons! The way they all laugh and cheer. Is this fucking Game Of Thrones? You lot have got real issues to talk about and deal with. That\u2019s why I like Jeremy: I feel like he gets what the ethnic minorities are going through and the homeless and the working class. That Zac guy, he just seems like a fucking arsehole.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>How is my bredren from the ends ever gonna buy a house?

How is my bredren from the ends ever gonna buy a house? It\u2019s mad out here.\u201d</p> <p>You might say that Stormzy\u2019s sides don\u2019t really fit together: the grime credibility, the range of admirers, the pop star antics, the political conviction. Isn\u2019t there a danger in trying to be all things to all people? \u201cYou know, I feel like I am a package of different flavours. I\u2019m having a beer with you and all these people,\u201d he gestures at the City boys, \u201cbut last night I was on my balcony with my bredren who\u2019s just come out of jail after 13 years, smoking a zoot, talking about what we used to do.

To date he\u2019s released blistering verses, mostly over classic grime beats, but he hasn\u2019t, like Dizzee did all those years ago, made something that sounds like nothing else.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2015/mar/02/was-kanye-patronising-or-boosting-grime-with-his-brits-performance\">Was Kanye patronising or boosting grime with his Brits performance?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He says that\u2019s coming too, on his debut album, out some time this summer. \u201cSo far I committed myself to being a sick guy, a sick performer, but I think that triggered something in me, to be a great musician who makes great music. I think it\u2019s boring when you go to a grime show and you know exactly what you\u2019re going to see: a guy walking up and down and a DJ. I want to think so much bigger than that.\u201d </p> <p>At the same time, Stormzy recognises the dangers of trying to take the underground overground and suffering the same career stalls as his heroes. \u201cI feel like a lot of our time with our scene, people get very scared and rightfully so, because of what\u2019s happened with artists coming through grime and coming out at the pop end of it. But I just want to make a record that is very musical and very spiritual and from the heart.\u201d<br /></p> <p>The rapper seems remarkably calm for a 22-year-old experiencing a sudden rush of fame, and managing to be funny, political, outspoken, credible all while staying desperately self-assured. Where does all that come from? What makes a guy release without a label? Or read 100 books in a summer just to get a badge?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab76b0f42595207b8248eb04cea94de848e21733\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab76b0f42595207b8248eb04cea94de848e21733/1406_1736_6071_3643/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stormzy\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Photograph: Dan Wilton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cYou know what I feel like I\u2019m full up of so much different crazy shit,\u201d he says. \u201cI used to think I weren\u2019t an interesting person.

I didn\u2019t have a fortunate upbringing, things weren\u2019t lovely \u2013 things were terrible growing up. In terms of street life, financially, behaviourally, shit was the worst. I never had no money. You know the trampy kid in the class? I was that don. I used to think, fuck my childhood. But now I think look, that made me. Fortunate events have led to this, and I\u2019m here now.\u201d</p> <p>We get in a taxi and head out. As we arrive at a club, the rapper <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/example\">Example</a> is waiting outside. Someone\u2019s forgotten to put him on the list and the security guard is having none of it. But when Stormzy arrives, the security guy breaks into a smile and gives him a high five. Stormzy has to point out Example to say he\u2019s allowed in, too. It could have been a moment of tension \u2013 Example being the older and more established of the two \u2013 but both of them just smile. \u201cOh, I can only get in the club with you now, Stormz,\u201d he jokes.

Anti-establishment sentiment within countries is somehow echoed by the way the rule book of international relations is being torn up. These dynamics feed on each other. They are at play in America (the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/02/donald-trump-battle-for-the-soul-republican-party\" title=\"\">rise of Donald Trump</a>), Europe (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jun/16/guardian-view-on-populism-in-european-politics-shaken-and-stirred\" title=\"\">growing populism</a>) and Asia (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/28/whats-behind-beijings-drive-control-south-china-sea-hainan\" title=\"\">nationalism and an arms race</a>). Finding a way to address them will be crucial if democracies are to have any hope of resisting instability.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/08/dutch-referendum-europe-ukraine-eu\">This Dutch referendum spells trouble for Europe | Joris Luyendijk</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I recently attended the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/apr/07/barack-obama-usa-russia-nato\" title=\"\">Lennart Meri conference in Estonia</a> \u2013 a transatlantic gathering where much of the talk focused on how the <a href=\"http://lmc.icds.ee/\" title=\"\">\u201cdream of a Europe whole and free\u201d might be fading</a>, and how that is affecting security and stability. And this week in London, at a meeting on global governance, and what needs to be done to improve it, a key focus of British and other European participants was: how do we restore the legitimacy of international institutions?</p> <p>In democracies it is only natural that public opinion influences actions taken by governments on the international stage. But the way that pressure is exerted has changed. The Dutch government would never have sought a review <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/08/dutch-referendum-europe-ukraine-eu\" title=\"\">of an association agreement between the EU and Ukraine</a> if a referendum in the Netherlands \u2013 with a turnout of only 32%, triggered by a petition that had just over 300,000 signatures \u2013 hadn\u2019t signalled a rejection of that treaty.</p> <p>Angela Merkel would never have pushed for a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/may/16/turkey-renew-talks-european-union-membership\" title=\"\">relaunching of EU membership talks with Turkey</a> (something she had been blocking for almost 10 years) if the German far right hadn\u2019t started doing better in opinion polls. In my country, France, although Marine Le Pen\u2019s Front National failed last year to win control of any region in local elections, her admiration for Vladimir Putin has made it more difficult for the socialist government to stick to its <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/06/world/europe/francois-hollande-says-destabilizing-sanctions-on-russia-must-stop-now.html\" title=\"\">policy of renewing EU sanctions against Russia</a> later this year. In Austria, where the far-right seems within reach of the presidency (ahead of voting on Sunday), populist pressures have already led to borders being shut to refugees. And in the US Donald Trump\u2019s success is already beginning to frame the foreign policy debate .</p> <p>Just as the traditional domestic politics of many nations is being upended by groups who claim that elites have lost all legitimacy, global politics is being shaken up by the way institutions created after 1945 have lost much of their credibility. The UN has failed dismally to put an end to the war in Syria; and the EU is widely criticised for its inability to address a variety of crises \u2013 its very functioning as an institution is questioned as never before. Meanwhile, Russia and China are disrupting international rules that were once deemed rock solid: force has been used to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/mar/17/crimea-success-ukraine-putin-russia-borders\" title=\"\">change borders unilaterally (Crimea)</a>, and territorial claims are made through the creeping <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/27/tensions-and-territorial-claims-in-the-south-china-sea-the-guardian-briefing\" title=\"\">militarisation of islands</a> (in the South China Sea).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The parallel between disgruntlement on the inside and disruptive behaviour on the outside may well define our era</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Both in Europe and Asia alliances are being put to the test, with many asking if they will hold. The result of much of this is that global governance appears weakened, if not powerless. Passions and frustrations, often with strong nationalistic undertones, have become a major driving force of events, both domestically and internationally. Increasingly we see the rule of force \u2013 even rule of the mob \u2013 prevailing over the rule of law and over diplomatic mechanisms designed to defuse tensions.</p> <p>To a large extent that\u2019s because the very legitimacy of institutions, and the way we have known them, has eroded. Many citizens feel their voices are not being heard. The influence of the internet means representative democracy is losing ground to grassroots mobilisation \u2013 spontaneous or orchestrated \u2013 that often exists outside a recognised framework. And on a global stage tensions between powers fester because the forums meant to settle them aren\u2019t working. Accepted rules and limits are increasingly set aside. Broadly speaking, what we are seeing is a growing cacophony in which it is unclear who, or what, will ultimately act as an arbiter.</p> <p>The parallel between disgruntlement on the inside and disruptive behaviour on the outside may well define our era. It\u2019s as if a race is under way between the growing aspirations of citizens (not least driven by a massive, instant spread of information and disinformation) and the struggling capacity of governments and international institutions to address them.</p> <p>So what can be done? Reforming the UN system entirely is much talked about, though all but impossible right now. Reinventing the way democracies function is just as difficult. So perhaps small steps might be taken. At the Tallinn conference some speakers suggested EU officials could embark on \u201ctown hall meetings\u201d across the continent, to reach out to citizens who resent what they see as a dehumanised Brussels bureaucracy.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/28/whats-behind-beijings-drive-control-south-china-sea-hainan\">What\u2019s behind Beijing\u2019s drive to control the South China Sea? | Howard W French</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And in the London discussion, several participants spoke of the need to create a \u201cmulti stakeholder\u201d model for international institutions in which not just states but NGOs and citizens would have a say in open and transparent deliberations. Depending on the issue at hand, ad hoc groups of stakeholders could be convened. One idea was dubbed \u201cthe skateboard model\u201d after the sport\u2019s eschewing of judging panels in favour of competitors marking each other\u2019s performances in open discussions \u2013 apparently everyone comes out more satisfied.</p> <p>It\u2019s easy to see the flaws (for example, how do you make sure the results aren\u2019t manipulated?). But the key point is that if passions are to be managed in an orderly way, both within societies and globally, new mechanisms are needed to restore the legitimacy of decision-making. That this issue is increasingly being discussed is a good thing \u2013 because the risk of sticking to the status quo is that populists, everywhere, will continue to thrive.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s 40 years since the summer of punk. (At this point it\u2019s customary to pause and reflect on the fact that going back 40 years before that would have taken us to 1936 and sigh.) In <strong>Punk, The Pistols And The Provinces</strong> (<em>Tuesday, 11.30am, Radio 4</em>) Mark Hodkinson looks at how that convulsion connected the capital and Joe Strummer\u2019s \u201cfaraway towns\u201d in a way that still haunts those affected. Much as the Beatles were shaped by the experience of travelling as far south as Aldershot in 1961, drummer Paul Cook recalls that the Sex Pistols hadn\u2019t previously been much further north than Hampstead when they ventured out to Doncaster and Northallerton. Here they connected with an audience which was less blase and, according to writer John Robb, took the movement to heart.</p> <p>In those days, the country seemed less connected than it is now, and yet still the idea of <strong>Jeremy Vine</strong> (<em>Tuesday, 12noon, Radio 2</em>) broadcasting from Huddersfield \u2013 the town that hosted the Pistols\u2019 last UK show \u2013 in the run-up to the EU referendum has the feeling of a bit of a culture clash in the making.</p> <p>Soho Radio, the community station that broadcasts from a coffee shop near Leicester Square, celebrates two years broadcasting on the web (<a href=\"http://www.sohoradiolondon.com/\">sohoradiolondon.com</a>) this month. Among its anniversary programming there\u2019s <strong>Hip Hop Karaoke Live From The Social</strong> (<em>Thursday, 10pm, Soho Radio</em>), an event which, with its fissile admixture of tried-and-tested rappers and heart-in-the-right-place hopefuls, sounds like the kind of high-risk entertainment that the mainstream radio industry would like to see stamped out entirely. Hence it should be encouraged.</p> <p>The boys of summer are back with <strong>Test Match Special</strong> \u2013 England v Sri Lanka from Headingley (<em>Saturday, 10.30am, Radio 4 LW &amp; 5 Live Sports Extra</em>). It\u2019s traditional for the team to be joined by one commentator from the visiting nation, in this case Roshan Abeysinghe. These voices enjoy a unique place in the broadcasting mix, generally serve for years and earn the affection of the cricket-loving fraternity, as was reflected in the recent passing of Tony Cozier of the West Indies.</p> <p>Miles Kington died of pancreatic cancer in 2008. Upon diagnosis he decided to make the cancer pay its way by coming up with unpublishable titles for a book about his situation. In <strong>How Shall I Tell The Dog</strong> (<em>Monday, 2.45pm, Radio 4Extra</em>), Kington\u2019s part is taken by Michael Palin.</p> <p>US public radio network NPR\u2019s daily arts and culture magazine show <strong>Fresh Air</strong> (npr.org) makes an excellent podcast, as much because it\u2019s there all the time as for the fact that Terry Gross is a strong host and it\u2019s clearly the kind of programme the interviewees really want to do. Recent shows have featured Gary Cole of Veep, a tribute to the soul great Clarence Carter and the history of the American Pit Bull.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Last week there were several sunny days in succession, arousing hopes that a teasingly hesitant spring might finally be arriving. A few birds showed up. One neat little bird\u00a0that perched for a full minute in\u00a0my maple tree was identified by a\u00a0bird-wise friend as a coal tit. Provocatively, I suggested that, in view of the current hostility to anyone still evincing tolerance of fossil fuels, it might be better to call it a renewables tit. The bird flew off and my expert friend went home, leaving me trembling at the daring of my own heresy.</p> <p><a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/GDRNorminton\">One of my most easily angered critics</a> has been posting tweets, railing against my \u201cclimate blindness\u201d. Already hard to please by my work in general, he says that the occasional remarks in which I\u00a0flaunt my \u201cscience denial\u201d have tested his patience \u201cto the limit\u201d. I\u00a0am left to guess what he might do if his patience is tested beyond the limit. If he shows up at my door in a\u00a0tank, I could try engaging him in a\u00a0discussion of the renewables tit I\u00a0just saw in my garden. Or I could try calling the police.</p> <p>The latter option might still be possible in Britain, where it is not yet against the law to be frivolous about the oncoming disaster detectable by everyone except those suffering from climate blindness. In the US, on the other hand, climate blindness has been considered by the attorney general, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/loretta-lynch\">Loretta Lynch</a>, as a reason for handing names to the FBI.</p> <p>Lynch, President Obama\u2019s personal appointment, is a woman of integrity, so it can only be genuine fear of universal climate death that prompts her to contemplate calling in the G-men against those suspected of science denial. While figuring out the rules of engagement \u2013 are dithering old men suffering from climate blindness to be mown down for failing to raise their hands above their heads? \u2013 she might consider that she is perhaps copying a tainted example.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/07/clive-james-on-victoria-wood-death\">Clive James: \u2018If Victoria Wood had caught us moping over her death,\u00a0she might have been quite strict\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_N._Mitchell\">John Mitchell</a>, who was attorney general under President Nixon, preceded Lynch in the belief that it was only logical to send the Justice Department in pursuit of citizens who declined to echo their president\u2019s opinions. When the facts came out, Nixon escaped by helicopter, but Mitchell went to jail.</p> <p>We can hardly expect Lynch to place herself under arrest, so for as long as Obama is president, she will probably go on with her plans for silencing dissent. The thought would depress me if I were not so elated from watching a TV nature show in which a baby elephant was stalked by a pride of seven full-size lions but it toddled safely back to the herd, no doubt to be told to quit wandering off.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>My kitchen is \u2026</strong> quaint. It\u2019s rather small and right in the middle of my 1900 farmhouse, with a dining room off of one end, and a breakfast nook off the other side in New England. Being the size it is, there\u2019s not much room for cute extras \u2013 it\u2019s more functional than charming. We have open shelving for our dishes, jars and vessels, and some artwork on the walls. We like barn wood and antique kitchen tools, with a touch of modern design, a juxtaposition of old and new.</p> <p><strong>My favourite kitchen tool is \u2026</strong> my stereo. I\u2019m often in the kitchen for hours at a time by myself. I listen to the news in the morning, podcasts later on and I usually end the day with a glass of wine and Whitney Houston, Shirley Bassey, or some Bollywood.</p> <p><strong>My storecupboard staple is \u2026</strong> maple syrup. Here in Vermont it\u2019s almost a rite of passage to tap a couple trees and make your own. Whenever we have a dinner party, it\u2019s pretty much garanteed someone will bring a bottle as a gift. Subsequently, almost everything I make starts with maple syrup \u2013 glazing a ham, making salad dressing, frying up a pork chop, baking bread. Just last night I made a spicy stir-fry with a splash. It\u2019s my go-to source of sweetness.</p> <p><strong>When I\u2019m starving \u2026</strong> I make something Mexican: enchiladas, tacos, even nachos (because we\u2019re grownups and we can have nachos for dinner!). We\u2019ve an endless supply of meat on the farm \u2013 we raise our own pork and poultry, as well as raising goats for milk \u2013 so as long as I have an avo and a lime, I can whip up a meal in a matter of minutes. We also always have our own lard, so I can always make authentic tortilla.</p> <p><strong>My culinary inspiration is \u2026</strong> the seasons. In fact, since we started farming, they\u2019re not just an inspiration \u2013 everything we eat is about the time of year. Right now it\u2019s ramps [wild leeks]; soon, it\u2019ll be asparagus and rhubarb, and then berries. We spent the winter eating potatoes, roots, meat \u2026 so we\u2019re ready for springtime greens.</p> <p><strong>My best-kept kitchen secret is \u2026</strong> the power of using good ingredients. A lot of people have a tendency to pick up a bargain. But \u2013 certainly in baking \u2013 good flour, organic dark chocolate, eggs from chickens that are well cared for, it all makes such a difference.</p> <p><strong>My current obsession is \u2026</strong> tarts.Not something you see in the States that much. I love how much more delicate they are, compared to pies. Right now, I\u2019m working on a rich buttery shell with a layer of soft caramel topped with dark chocolate ganache and pink Himalayan salt.</p> <p><strong>Everything tastes better with \u2026</strong> butter, of course \u2013 no explanation needed! I\u2019ve even been known to use melted butter in a salad dressing.</p> <p><strong>When I go shopping I \u2026</strong> am meticulous. And always, always with a list, organised by section, and aisle, wherever possible. It\u2019s the pastry chef in me. I don\u2019t think I ever divert from the list \u2013 unless avocados are on sale and the price and quality is right.</p> <p><strong>For dinner tonight \u2026 </strong>we\u2019re having burgers, to celebrate the fact that it\u2019s the most beautiful day of the year so far. With roast potatoes and a cabbage salad.</p> <ul> <li><em>Thomas McCurdy is a farmer and a pastry chef at </em><em><a href=\"http://www.ardeliafarm.com/\">Ardelia Farm and Co</a>; <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ardeliafarm/\">@</a></em><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ardeliafarm/\">ardeliafarm</a></li> </ul>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-21T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Exciting news, trend watchers! The look of the season is\u2026 Adolf Hitler. Yes, as you may have heard, Adolf is having quite a moment these days, getting trotted out by British politicians like a new charity ribbon on a lapel. This It boy is so zeitgeist, I\u2019m amazed I didn\u2019t spot him on the red carpet at the Met Ball: here\u2019s Alexa Chung, so darling in vintage Yves Saint Laurent; there\u2019s Beyonc\u00e9 looking very on trend in Givenchy; and oh look, there\u2019s Adolf, really owning that Waffen-SS look. Work it, Adolf.</p> <p>For a while I believed there were two types of politicians: those who would choose flight as their superpower and those who would opt for invisibility. The former are the idealists, the romantics, determinedly pursuing their higher aims. The more numerous latter are sneaky, snaky, more concerned with besting people around them than bettering the world.</p> <p>Boris Johnson clearly would choose invisibility, and I don\u2019t think entirely for reasons of opportunism (although obviously I do <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3510848/My-amitie-amoureuse-boris-johnson-Boris-loner-actually-rates-Dave-personal-close-friend.html\">partly think that</a>). Johnson is so calculating, he has an abacus for a heart. There is no way he actually <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/16/tories-divided-by-boris-johnsons-eu-hitler-comparison\">believes the EU is Hitler\u2019s ambition realised</a>, as he said last weekend. For \u00a337,000 a year, I assume Eton teaches the difference between European unity and European domination. But who needs facts when you have distracting, jazz-handsy Hitler? What clearly happened is that Johnson looked at the amount of attention Ken Livingstone received for riding the Hitler pony two weeks previously, considered how at least part of Donald Trump\u2019s improbable electoral success lies in the <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/upshot/measuring-donald-trumps-mammoth-advantage-in-free-media.html?_r=0\">amount of coverage he has received in the media</a>, added one and one together and got Hitler.</p> <p>Johnson activated the Hitler button the day after the 75th anniversary of the day my great-uncle, Jakob Glass, was, along with 5,000 other Jews, <a href=\"http://www.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/france/may1941.asp\">arrested in Paris</a>, after which he was sent to Auschwitz, where he was killed. I don\u2019t find it especially insulting when politicians casually cite the man who murdered him and the parents and grandparents of millions of people just for political point scoring. But I am a little insulted that they think voters are so stupid they\u2019ll be too excited by the Hitler analogy (Hitler! Like in the movies!) to fuss over the inaccuracy of the analogy. Because the problem isn\u2019t that citing Hitler is offensive, it\u2019s that the comparisons are always wrong. Politicians\u2019 Hitler references are becoming like <a href=\"http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/m/marilyn_monroe.html\">Marilyn Monroe motivational quotes</a>: frequently made up and invariably self-serving. Relying on Hitler for an analogy makes people sound as if their history lessons were limited to Indiana Jones And The Raiders Of The Lost Ark.</p> <p>But why is Hitler being deployed by politicians at a speed that outpaces <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2013/oct/29/mike-godwin-nazi-analogies-meme-update\">Godwin\u2019s law</a>? Well, it turns out I was wrong about there being only two kinds of politicians. Because there is a third: the one who pretends he wants flight but secretly aims for invisibility. The insider who affects to be an outsider; the one who claims to say-it-like-it-is as opposed to those slick career politicians. Referring to Hitler is a very good way of achieving this aim because citing the F\u00fchrer as evidence in an argument is an excellent way to make yourself look deranged, sorry, \u201crefreshingly unspun\u201d. Spin doctors tend to cross out references to Hitler in political speeches.</p> <p>The appeal of the unspun is obvious, especially now when the alternatives are ham-faced smoothies and political androids. Johnson has been working this image for decades. But it feels as if his nonsense, Fritz-baiting and all, is finally about to have its moment, and to see why you have only to look across the ocean.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/07/hadley-freeman-labour-party-hitler-antisemitism\">Hadley Freeman: it\u2019s time the left faced up to antisemitism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Both Johnson and Donald Trump have long been mocked in their own countries as chumps, and both are now closer to leadership than anyone could have ever predicted. Most of all, both are expensively educated men who play dumb with stupid analogies to appeal to ignorant voters.</p> <p>By dragging out the Hitler analogy, Johnson confirmed, once again, that he has the Trumpian willingness to say absolutely any old garbage to get attention. If Johnson dislikes being compared to Trump, well, imagine how the EU feels. At some point, maybe we should all sit and have a think about what kind of politicians we actually want \u2013 because right now it feels like a choice between the careerist and the phoney clown.</p> <p>I hope there are more politicians who dream of flight. Until then, we\u2019re stuck on the ground with Hitler.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Spring is here, migration season in the Mediterranean. Warmer temperatures and fewer storms mean more boats putting out for Europe from Africa and Turkey. More boats mean more destitute migrants landing in Lesbos, Kos, Lampedusa \u2013 over 185,000 so far this year. More boats mean more wrecks, more losses: 100 people drowned or missing one April weekend, 500 the week before that, nearly 300 the month before.</p> <p>How did these holidaymakers\u2019 paradises become the scene of postwar Europe\u2019s greatest humanitarian crisis? The Romans called the Mediterranean <em>mare nostrum</em>, \u201cour sea\u201d, cuddling it like a pet in Europe\u2019s mighty arms. But to understand what is happening now, it helps to look at a map in Fernand Braudel\u2019s epic history <em>The Mediterranean</em>, which turns the cartographer\u2019s usual north-south orientation on its head. Africa plunges through the frame like a giant fist, bashing into snaggle-toothed Europe. By geographical rights, the Mediterranean is Africa\u2019s sea. The disaster we are witnessing now, as two new books by journalists Charlotte McDonald-Gibson and Patrick Kingsley make clear, is what happens when right lacks might.</p> <p>At the beginning of 2015 the Guardian appointed Kingsley to be its first \u201cmigration correspondent\u201d, a roving commission to chronicle what turned out to be \u201cthe year\u2019s defining European issue\u201d, as more than a million undocumented migrants pressed into the European Union from the south and east. <em>The New Odyssey</em> provides, in effect, his reporter\u2019s notebook from the migrant trail.</p> <p>Kingsley starts in Niger, where he tails the traffickers who truck migrants across the \u201csecond sea\u201d of the Sahara. On the waterfronts of Libya and Egypt he interviews the smugglers who herd them into northbound boats. Next he sets sail himself on a merchant ship chartered by M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res to rescue castaways, and visits the headquarters of the Italian coastguard, which coordinated a very successful if shortlived search-and-rescue programme \u2013named, appropriately enough, Mare Nostrum. In the final part of the book Kingsley describes what happens as migrants make their way across Europe, by walking from Greece through the Balkans with refugees, guided past border checks by Facebook updates: \u201cAt a time when traditional travel guides seem increasingly irrelevant, I\u2019d stumbled across a Baedeker for the refugee era.\u201d For a fortunate few \u2013 notably a Syrian named Hashem whose story Kingsley interleaves throughout the book \u2013 the journey ends with permanent residency granted somewhere in Europe.</p> <p>Kingsley has been a determined reporter, and his book captures the remarkable range of actors involved in making this migration happen. He promotes an urgent message: \u201cIt is \u2026 not the arrival of the refugees that has caused a crisis but Europe\u2019s heartless and brainless border management.\u201d But urgency is a cousin of haste, and <em>The New Odyssey</em> misses chances at deeper reflection. There is a fascinating study embedded here, for instance, of the economy of migration: what it costs to charter an inflatable Zodiac versus a fishing boat, to bribe a policeman in Niger or customs agent in Egypt, to buy a lifejacket in Izmir. Kingsley does his best to capture the lives of the refugees themselves. \u201cWomen are often warier than men\u201d of telling their stories, he says, \u201cwhich is why this book doesn\u2019t contain many female voices.\u201d Though it might depend on who is asking.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/15/william-shakespeare-handwritten-plea-for-refugees-online-sir-thomas-more-script-play-british-library-exhibition\">William Shakespeare's handwritten plea for refugees to go online</a> </p> </aside>  <p>McDonald-Gibson\u2019s <em>Cast Away</em> is a closely reported, passionately argued, often deeply moving account of five refugees\u2019 journeys to Europe. The unapologetically narrative style creates an effect similar to that of the photograph of the corpse of three-year-old <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/alan-kurdi\">Alan Kurdi</a> in his red T-shirt in 2015. It yanks away the anonymous screen of numbers and brings you face to face with real people \u2013 people you can recognise, in situations you can\u2019t.</p> <p>McDonald-Gibson portrays her subjects as they were before they had been through the process of migration. Take Hanan, an upper-middle-class Syrian with four college-educated children, regularly manicured hands and a domestic servant. When bombs went off near the family house in Damascus in 2012 she paid for safe transit to Beirut, but it was already impossible to settle there due to the high number of refugees. For $32,000 (\u00a322,000), the family sailed with a smuggler to Greece, in the grip of its economic crisis. For another \u20ac3,000 each, Hanan sent her two sons to Austria in a truck; for hundreds more she got false papers for her daughters to go to Norway. Hanan spent her last \u20ac1,500 to join her sons in Vienna. Four years after fleeing Syria, the family, now penniless, remains scattered.</p> <p>European policymakers generally distinguish \u201ceconomic migrants\u201d (often sub-Saharan Africans) who are supposedly moving \u201conly\u201d to get benefits or better jobs, from \u201crefugees\u201d (chiefly Syrian) fleeing the immediate perils of war. Both Kingsley and McDonald-Gibson deplore this division, and two of McDonald-Gibson\u2019s stories show in harrowing detail just why it is so invidious. Majid, a teenager in northern Nigeria, watched his father hacked to death by a Christian mob and fled towards Libya, where he was first held in debt slavery and then expelled by Gaddafi. Sina, a chemical engineer in Eritrea, experienced with her husband the forced labour characteristic of this ruthlessly repressive police state, and faced a life of prolonged servitude or punishing imprisonment. It doesn\u2019t take a civil war, let alone radical Islamists, to generate persecution and poverty on a level no human should have to experience.</p> <p>The Mediterranean crossing as Sina, Majid and others experience it, jammed into overcrowded, fetid holds, with scant water and toilets, and many people being sick, resembles accounts of the Middle Passage of the Atlantic slave trade. Though most people associate the migration crisis exclusively with the Syrian civil war, it is just as fair to see it as a giant form of postcolonial blowback. The global scales of wealth, stability and rights \u2013 long tilted in Europe\u2019s favour \u2013 have now skewed so precipitously that the best way those in the south have to stop from sliding off altogether is to rush en masse toward the other side.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b3720f3bdbf7a18b374d3348f5584ed6fbf7f346\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b3720f3bdbf7a18b374d3348f5584ed6fbf7f346/0_0_5760_3840/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children play in a makeshift refugee camp of the northern Greek border point of Idomeni, Greece\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Children play in a makeshift refugee camp of the northern Greek border point of Idomeni, Greece.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Petros Giannakouris/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><em>Cast Away</em> and <em>The New Odyssey</em> start to do for the refugees what British abolitionists did for the slave trade. They mobilise eyewitness testimony to promote empathy, and through empathy, better policy. Unfortunately, where the abolitionists of the 1780s could press for a single law \u2013 a parliamentary ban on the slave trade \u2013 Europe\u2019s migration crisis involves far greater social and political challenges, to say nothing of economic costs. It has been much easier for Europeans to hunker down inside their nations, closing borders, withdrawing from international agreements, shoring up exclusionary sentiments. Not only do such impulses make a mockery of liberal ideals (freedom, tolerance, that sort of thing); they are also likely to worsen the underlying problems.</p> <p>Against the horrors \u2013 both personal and political \u2013 Kingsley and McDonald-Gibson produce individual tales of compassion. There is the Greek army sergeant who rescues Sina from drowning, the volunteers who hand out food and clothes to new arrivals on the beaches of Lesbos, the activists in Rome who offer Majid a home of sorts in their squat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/18/top-10-refugees-stories\">Top 10 refugees' stories</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These books also point toward some broader remedies. First, Mare Nostrum should be revived and refunded. After the abolition of the slave trade, the Royal Navy patrolled the Atlantic for slave ships and liberated their human cargo; navies should play a similar role by rescuing migrants now. Second, processing centres need to be set up for asylum claims in Turkey, Libya, Jordan and Lebanon, so migrants can travel legally, without smugglers\u2019 boats. Third, Europe should invest in refugee support in the overwhelmed nations of Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon. Finally, European and prosperous non-European nations should welcome larger numbers of refugees than the shamefully low numbers currently being accepted. As McDonald-Gibson reminds us, 1.3 million refugees were resettled from Indochina after 1975 \u201cwith no discernible impact on the cultural fabric of the host nations\u201d. Fear of terrorism and racism should not be allowed to prevent the same from happening now.</p> <p>Kingsley points out that the migrants\u2019 journeys deserve \u201cto be considered a contemporary Odyssey\u201d. What has been unfolding on Europe\u2019s southern borders certainly has the proportions of an epic, replete with heroes and monsters. But Odysseus braved the beasts while finding his way back home, and, eventually, he made it. These migrants have fled their homes only to be denied, more often than not, the chance of a new one. That makes this no mere odyssey. It is a crime. And with migration season upon us once again, Ithaca is nowhere in sight.</p> <p>\u2022 To order<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/406149/s/new-odyssey//?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\"><em>The New Odyssey</em></a> for<strong> </strong>\u00a39.99 (RRP \u00a314.99)<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/401986//?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\"><em>Cast Away</em></a> for \u00a311.99 (RRP \u00a314.99) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.</p>",

But it\u2019s not just airless inter-office tunnels: an open green walkway connecting rooftops <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/jan/29/stockholm-plans-public-park-connecting-high-rise-rooftops\">has been proposed in Stockholm</a> as a public park with views over the city. </p> <h2>Floating Tokyo</h2> <p>Cities see new developments spring up all the time. But for every project that breaks ground there are others which are shelved, or even too unrealistic to be considered. King\u2019s Cross in London <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/apr/14/london-kings-cross-airport-outlandish-plans-almost-got-built\">almost got an airport</a>. In Tokyo, renowned architect Kenz\u014d Tange envisaged a floating extension of the city in 1960 with Tokyo Bay Plan. As <a href=\"http://thelongandshort.org/cities/canned-designs-tokyo-kenzo-tange\">Christopher Beanland explains in The Long + Short</a>, Tange planned a grand axis across the bay: \u201ceach side of the axis (comprising freeways and services) would be platforms like oil rigs on which would sit crazy combinations of buildings stacked up and plugged in to each other\u201d.</p> <p>Although the project was cancelled, a similar project (perhaps inspired by Tange\u2019s designs?) <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2016/feb/08/next-tokyo-2045-japan-plans-mile-high-skyscraper-flood-defence\">has been proposed</a> as a floating flood defence for the Japanese capital. Designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates with Leslie E Robertson Associates, the \u201cNext Tokyo 2045\u201d proposal involves the creation of a whole new city built on reclaimed islands in Tokyo Bay, arranged in a series of hexagons and including a mile-high skyscraper, to act as a flood barrier protecting Tokyo.</p> <h2>Moving a city</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/jul/30/kiruna-the-arctic-city-being-knocked-down-and-relocated-two-miles-away\">As we reported last year</a>, the northernmost city in Sweden, Kiruna, is in the process of demolishing its city centre and rebuilding it two miles down the road, to avoid collapsing into the huge iron-ore mine that the city grew up around.

But in a week when two diamonds, the Unique Pink and the Oppenheimer Blue, sold for $32m (\u00a321.6m) and $58m (\u00a339.8m) respectively \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/18/oppenheimer-blue-diamond-most-expensive-ever-sold-at-auction\">the latter a new record at auction</a> \u2013 a more fitting title might be Diamonds Are Forever Increasing in Price.</p> <p>The Unique Pink diamond ring was sold at a Sotheby\u2019s auction at the Beau-Rivage hotel in Geneva on Tuesday. A day later, Christie\u2019s auctioned the Oppenheimer Blue at the Four Seasons hotel des Bergues, just a two-minute walk along the shore of Lac L\u00e9man from the Beau-Rivage.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/diamonds/giv-12515EvLK6cX3j7a6/\" data-alt=\"Graphic showing the size, shape and price of the most expensive diamonds ever sold at auction\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/diamonds/giv-12515EvLK6cX3j7a6/\">Graphic showing the size, shape and price of the most expensive diamonds ever sold at auction</a> </figure>  <p>Many other diamonds were sold across both auctions for (relatively speaking) much smaller prices. And the most expensive diamonds are not necessarily the largest ones. So what makes one diamond so much more expensive than another?</p> <p>The Gemological Institute of America (GIA) grades diamonds according to the <a href=\"http://www.gia.edu/diamond-quality-factor\">four Cs</a>: clarity, cut, carat weight and colour.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"61b0411b9db5839dfa05c244da6d996ebe1c8a34\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61b0411b9db5839dfa05c244da6d996ebe1c8a34/0_81_469_352/469.jpg\" alt=\"Gemological Institute of America image showing the anatomy of a diamond\" width=\"469\" height=\"352\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The anatomy of a diamond, as defined by the Gemological Institute of America</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It is the fourth criterion that can confer serious value: every one of the 10 most expensive diamonds ever auctioned are \u201cfancy colour\u201d diamonds.<br /></p> <p>White diamonds increase in value the more colourless they are. But in the case of fancy colour diamonds, <a href=\"http://www.gia.edu/fancy-color-diamond\">the opposite</a> is true: the intensity of the colour adds to their worth at auction.<br /></p> <p>The rarity of the so-called \u201cfancies\u201d is the other determining factor: red, green, purple and orange are considered the most rare, followed by pink and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/12/billionaire-buys-7-year-old-daughter-blue-moon-diamond-for-record-48m\">blue</a>. The top 10 includes five blues, four pinks and one orange diamond.</p> <p>Of course, a notable history \u2013 particularly celebrity ownership \u2013 can also inflate a stone\u2019s price. A diamond that Richard Burton bought for Elizabeth Taylor for $1.1m in 1969 <a href=\"https://www.worthy.com/famous-diamonds/the-taylor-burton-diamond\">sold for almost five times</a> that amount a decade later. </p>",

Unfortunately Audrey had to leave school due to a traumatic bullying problem which remains a mystery within the pages of the book. It left her pushing away everyone and closing herself off. </p> <p>Unable to leave the house, Audrey hasn\u2019t seen anyone but her family and counsellor. When Audrey\u2019s brother Frank brings his friend Linus home, Audrey accidentally sees Linus when he stumbles into her dark hole of a room, where no one goes but her. This blooms into an early romance. </p> <p>Throughout the book, Audrey also visits her counsellor frequently and they have a very close relationship from this personal soul bearing. From this we learn Audrey\u2019s stressful thought process and how well she is battling with her anxiety issues. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"0fda4890b9a923caf397e5b355a111bc41fc7b48\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0fda4890b9a923caf397e5b355a111bc41fc7b48/0_0_1300_2104/618.jpg\" alt=\"Finding Audrey\" width=\"618\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I enjoyed the graphs in the book because sometimes they showed statistics which helped my understanding. </p> <p>Audrey addresses the reader when talking. The constant comedy between Audrey\u2019s family softened the tone of the book, which made parts hilarious to read and also added a gracious silver lining. </p> <p>Audrey\u2019s character development in the book is phenomenal. At the start of the book she is pressuring herself to quickly get rid of her disorder and brush it under the rug; she thinks that she is a freak because she is not like everyone else. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/childrens-books/2011/mar/02/how-do-i-get-involved-guardian-childrens-books\">How do I get involved in the Guardian children's books site?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>However her therapist Dr Sarah teaches her that in life, not everything will go perfectly or in your favour, and having imperfections is what makes you you.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-21T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Maeve Brennan didn\u2019t have to be a woman for her work to be forgotten, though it surely helped. She did not have to become a bag lady for her work to be revived, though that possibly helped too. The story of her mental decline is terrifying for anyone who works with words, who searches her clean, sour sentences for some hint or indication of future madness, and then turns to check their own.</p> <p>Brennan is, for a new generation of female Irish writers, a casualty of old wars not yet won. The prose holds her revived reputation very well, especially the Irish stories. These feel transparently modern, the way that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jun/12/dubliners-100-15-new-stories-inspired-by-original-review\"><em>Dubliners</em></a> by Joyce feels modern. It is partly a question of restraint. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2007/feb/12/guardianobituaries.booksobituaries\">Benedict Kiely</a>, Walter Macken, perhaps even Mary Lavin, ran the risk of being \u201cIrish\u201d on the pages of the New Yorker, which is to say endearing. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/oct/23/brief-survey-short-story-frank-o-connor\">Frank O\u2019Connor </a>was the cutest of the lot, perhaps, as well as the most successful. Brennan remains precise, unyielding: something lovely and unbearable is happening on the page.</p> <p>Despite the lack of surface charm, Brennan was very Irish indeed. Her mother, Una, took part in the fighting during Easter 1916, alongside her father, Bob, who was arrested and sent to prison for it. Maeve was born 37 weeks later: conceived along with the Irish state you might say, she was a true daughter of the Rising. A few years later, Bob Brennan left his young family to take part in the war of independence and in the Irish civil war. He spent months in hiding and on the run and Maeve\u2019s childhood home was raided several times by men carrying guns. After the state was founded, he set up the Irish Press for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/14/eamon-de-valera-will-to-power-review\">\u00c9amon de Valera</a>, and in 1933, when Maeve was 17, her father was appointed to Washington as Ireland\u2019s first envoy to America. The Brennans could not have seen this remarkable future when they fell in love in the Gaelic League in Wexford, but they both saw some great ideal. Their three girls were named after ancient Irish queens: Emer, Deirdre and Maeve.</p> <p>She was a \u201cGaelic princess\u201d. Her hair was chestnut, her eyes were green. A pixie, a changeling, she was admired for the sharpness of her wit. It is hard to find a description of Brennan that is not code for her ethnicity. In 1941 she moved to New York and found a job at Harper\u2019s Bazaar and when her family returned to Ireland, she stayed behind. Already reclusive, she moved from one rented room to another and rarely had a kitchen to call her own. Still, she seemed to miss some idea of Ireland, or of domesticity. Her biographer Angela Bourke wrote that: \u201cThroughout her adult life, to the point of eccentricity, Maeve drank tea and sought out open fires.\u201d<br /></p> <p>In 1949, at the age of 32, she secured a staff job at the New Yorker where she had the great good fortune to be edited by William Maxwell, who became a loyal friend. \u201cTo be around her,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwas to see style being reinvented.\u201d Brennan was a beautiful, unmarried woman in a dingy office full of men. She wore a fresh flower in her lapel and smelled of Cuir de Russie, a perfume designed by Chanel for women who dared to smoke in public. She worked all the time, produced very little, and ate boiled eggs to keep her figure neat.</p> <p>By the early 1950s the descriptions of her Irishness had tipped from fey to fierce. Her tongue \u201ccould clip a hedge\u201d she had \u201ca longshoreman\u2019s mouth\u201d, she said \u201cfuck\u201d in company and drank in Costello\u2019s on Third Avenue. Once, when nobody came to take her order as she sat in a booth there, she lifted a heavy, full sugar bowl and dropped it on the floor. There was no sense, when she married her New Yorker colleague, St Clair McKelway, fellow drinker \u2013 fellow madman, indeed \u2013 that he was taking a virgin Irish bride. Brennan was 36. They were, a friend said, \u201clike two children out on a dangerous walk: both so dangerous and charming\u201d.</p> <p>It is worth saying that no middle-class Irish woman at the time would set foot in a Dublin pub. Irish drinking culture, for all its famous good fun, was deeply shame-bound. Maeve\u2019s thirst had its origins in a terrific social uncertainty, but also in a great want. As her posthumous editor Christopher Carduff said, her work showed \u201ca ravenous grudge, a ravenous nostalgia and a ravenous need for love\u201d.</p> <p>Brennan\u2019s progress as a fiction writer was far from steady. She wrote a column of city observations as \u201cThe Long-Winded Lady\u201d, and short pieces of memoir, in the sad, bright tone the New Yorker did so well. Her first published stories were lightly satirical and set in America. These were published between 1952 and 1956, after which came silence. The Irish stories, on which her reputation was revived, did not start to appear until 1959, a year after her mother\u2019s death, when her marriage had fallen apart. There was a second rush, of more hopeful fictions, after the death of her father in 1964.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Her book was well received but did not make it across the Atlantic. It was a promising start for a career already over</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The stories involve two couples, the Bagots and the Derdons, who live in Ranelagh, where Brennan grew up. The Bagots are happier than the Derdons, but it can be hard to distinguish the memoir pieces from the fiction and one couple from another \u2013 they are all so lonely and their compass so small. They live, interchangeably, in Brennan\u2019s childhood home at 48 Cherryfield Avenue, they climb the same little stairs and look out on the same laburnum tree. The stories are painful acts of reclamation. Brennan circles around the few events of these people\u2019s lives. A new sofa arrives at the house, to great excitement. A man selling apples knocks at the door. People get married, they walk in the park, go to work and die. There are visits, disappointments and interminable, small cruelties \u2013 especially between the Derdons, whose only son John becomes a priest, leaving his mother bereft. Some of the most affecting stories are almost entirely without incident. A man goes into his dead wife\u2019s bedroom and finds nothing there. A woman sees her own shadow on the wall of her children\u2019s room, and is comforted by it.</p> <p>In the 1950s, there was nothing to indicate, as you read a New Yorker piece, whether it was true or made up and the writer\u2019s name, if it was given, came at the end. This put a wonderful pressure on the sentences, and the order in which they happened. A high value was placed on precision and physical detail; revelation came slow and in a low key. The culture of the pages may add to the feeling that Brennan is always starting out, somehow. Some of the pieces, as Maxwell observes, stay slight. They are, however, \u201cdefinitely stories, written with great care and radiant with the safety and comfort of home\u201d. (This was a nice thing to say, but there is little comfort in the story of the Derdons, who annoy each other to death, almost, never mind the warm fires and the many cups of tea.)</p> <p>A collection of The Long-Winded Lady\u2019s columns was published in 1969 and reviewed in the Atlantic magazine by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/johnupdike\">John Updike</a>. Brennan, at 52, was neither the impeccable style queen of her youth, nor the mad woman of her old age. She was \u201ca woman of legendary but fading Irish beauty, spectacular red hair and marvellously eccentric intelligence\u201d, or so said the writer William McPherson. A collection of stories was published that year, too, under the slightly whimsical title, <em>In and Out of Never-Never Land</em>. This was well received but did not make it across the Atlantic, or into paperback. It was a promising start, in publishing terms, for a career that was already over.</p> <p>In her New York Times review of this collection, Anne O\u2019Neill-Barna wrote about how hard it could be to tell Irish writers apart: \u201cThe intoxicating mention of Dublin street names \u2026 or of country counties and towns with their surges of inhibition and passion \u2026 could have been the possession of any of the New Yorker Irish writers.\u201d It must have been suffocating to be so mixed up like that, especially for Brennan, who was obsessed with the particularity of things.</p> <p>She was a Dublin writer, there are no rural cadences rolling through Brennan\u2019s prose. She was, besides, impatient of \u201cthe bog and thunder variety of stuff that has been foisted abroad in the name of Ireland\u201d. The Irish oral tradition has a performative aspect that can tip a writer\u2019s persona into \u201cpersonality\u201d, but Brennan\u2019s characters had very little \u201ccharacter\u201d to speak of. Even the word \u201cvoice\u201d caused her anxiety.</p> <p>Brennan is described by those who knew her as stylish or Irish and they seem to know what these terms mean, but she is also described as either silent or voluble, and it is hard to reconcile the two. Perhaps she was like her mother. When Maeve brought her husband home in 1957, Una, who had long suffered bad health, was changed: \u201cInstead of the pale, patient and suffering cypher that used to confront people, McKelway has seen only a bad little woman who hisses like a cat, laughs like a fiend, and chatters from morning to night telling interminable stories \u2026 none [of them] containing, as McKelway said, a good word about anyone.\u201d</p> <p>In \u201cThe Clever One\u201d, a piece about her own childhood, her sister Derry was \u201calways with me, and always silent, while I talked endlessly\u201d. Silent but ruthless. The young Maeve announces that she wants to become an actress and Derry says, \u201cDon\u2019t go getting any notions into your head.\u201d These memoir pieces circle around ancient difficulties, and refuse to move on. Maeve is wrongly accused of mouthing the words at choir practice, and is obliged to sing in front of the whole school as punishment, but when she opens her mouth, only a dreadful cawing comes out \u2013 proof, if it were needed, of the devil at work in her.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e20a35bd7a7196df32385593adefc586ae0e4770\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e20a35bd7a7196df32385593adefc586ae0e4770/0_141_2760_2275/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Frank O\u2019Connor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"824\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Frank O\u2019Connor in 1958.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: CBS via Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cWhy couldn\u2019t you have kept your mouth shut?\u201d her mother asks in \u201cThe Lie\u201d, a strange non-story that works like a negation of Frank O\u2019Connor\u2019s classic <a href=\"http://www.ireland-information.com/firstconfession.htm\">\u201cFirst Confession\u201d</a>. Maeve breaks her sister\u2019s sewing machine in a fit of envy, and confesses the sin, along with the fact that she lied to her mother about it. But there is no absolution, no victory over the maddening sister. Speech itself is the mistake.</p> <p>Long after Una died, Brennan told Maxwell how she longed to find her mother\u2019s voice again. It was \u201cthe voice you can say anything in \u2026 infinite, always changing, endlessly responsive, and capable of containing anything, and everything\u201d. She also said it was the voice she heard in a Mozart symphony, which is a big description for a small woman, even if she was her mother.</p> <p>Maeve\u2019s letters, that end anguished and delusional, start witty and sad. In 1959 a reader wrote to the magazine asking if any more of her stories were on their way and Brennan wrote a fake reply: \u201cI am terribly sorry to have to be the first to tell you that our poor Miss Brennan died. She shot herself in the back with the aid of a small handmirror at the foot of the main altar in St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral one Shrove Tuesday. Frank O\u2019Connor was where he usually is in the afternoons, sitting in a confession box pretending to be a priest.\u201d</p> <p>O\u2019Connor was by this time a mainstay of the magazine. He often wrote about priests, he felt the loneliness of their vocation echoed that of the writer. Brennan was not so enthusiastic. When Father John Derdon comes back to his family home, \u201cthe black cloth gave him a bad air\u201d and his priesthood (whatever that is) is not entirely believed. \u201cThere was something thin and jaunty about him, in the tilt of his head, or in one of the conscious, unnecessary gestures he was always making, that belonged more to an actor than to a priest.\u201d</p> <p>The later stories are occupied by the idea of \u201cnotions\u201d, with the sense that people are not made foolish by their desires so much as fraudulent. In \u201cThe Springs of Affection\u201d, Min cannot believe her twin brother wants to leave to get married. \u201cIt was as though a bad trick had been played on them all.\u201d The whole family is devalued, when he goes. \u201cInstead of being reflections of Martin they became copies of one another, or three not very fortunate copies of a face that was gone.\u201d Delia, the woman he marries, is of no consequence, nor is the idea that he might love her.</p> <p>Anxiety about madness runs through \u201cThe Springs of Affection\u201d. Min\u2019s own father, whom she holds in contempt, is described as queer, and her sister Clare takes after him \u2013 30 years after the wedding, Min feels \u201cobliged\u201d to have her \u201clocked up in the Enniscorthy lunatic asylum\u201d. Perhaps it is the effort to stay sane that makes Min vicious. There is no tenderness in her, even as a girl. \u201cMin despised her father,\u201d Brennan writes, \u201cbut she hoped her mother wouldn\u2019t hit him.\u201d It is hard to think of another Irish writer who would put such a flat and finished thought into the mind of a child.</p> <p>By his own account, Bob Brennan suffered a breakdown in 1921 and again in 1922, under the pressure of the fight for Ireland\u2019s independence, and it is possible that Una had her problems too. Maeve expressed huge guilt about leaving her family, but it does not seem to inhere in the usual things \u2013 sex, religion or lifestyle. Her biggest sin was writing itself.</p> <p>In 1963 she wrote from Dublin: \u201cThe pain radiated by the Envious One is terrible to endure. The pain that envious people feel, it is frightful, it must be. And this shame I feel all my life \u2013 I was as ashamed of having a little talent as another would be of being born without a nose.\u201d</p> <p>The Envious One is her father, who was, like his daughter, a writer. Over the years, he had sent her his unpublished stories as well as published books and Maeve was convinced he was jealous of her success. This may be true \u2013 Bob might have been a bit mad \u2013 or it might be a mad thing to say. Already, in this letter, she could not distinguish between his pain and her own.</p> <p>If you look at the Irish women who were successful after Brennan, many of them were some man\u2019s daughter. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2004/feb/11/fiction.rosiecowan\">Jennifer Johnston</a>\u2019s father was the playwright Denis Johnston. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/apr/13/trespassers-julia-o-faolain-review\">Julia O\u2019Faolain</a> is the daughter of Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Faol\u00e1in. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/feb/21/a-woman-without-a-country-by-eavan-boland-review-shadowlands-myth-history\">Eavan Boland</a> is the daughter of another Irish ambassador \u2013 this time to the UK \u2013 and all of these women wrote at a time when few women made it on to the published page. Many of them were, like Mary Lavin, born and educated abroad. The sons of writers did not survive their Oedipal impossibilities to imitate this trend.</p> <p>If Bob Brennan was jealous of his daughter, he must have been keenly aware of Frank O\u2019Connor who, like him, had been involved in the fight for independence \u2013 they had even worked together on the Cork Examiner in 1922. O\u2019Connor grew famous in Ireland, a country where Maeve remained completely unknown. He was, for a while, manager of the Abbey theatre and some of his work was banned by the Irish censorship board. By the time he was invited to lecture at Harvard in 1952, his reputation was secure both at home and abroad.</p> <p>Publishing in the New Yorker might enhance a reputation at home, but it could not make one. The country, still deep in postwar poverty, remained wary of foreign influence and jealous of foreign success. Maeve Brennan may also have managed that female trick of being both well regarded and completely unimportant, one that played out in America, often enough \u2013 but the deafness to the female voice in Ireland made these issues of reputation moot.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>No Irish paper published an obituary when she died,  in a home where no one knew her history, not even Brennan herself</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On the same day in 1969 that a review of her short stories appeared in the New York Times, the paper led with a long piece about Philip Roth\u2019s <em>Portnoy\u2019s Complaint</em>. They also reviewed Simone de Beauvoir, as well as diaries and recollections by Ann Bridge, Lesley Blanch and Cynthia Asquith. In the main pages there were more reviews of books by women than by men, and some of those names endured. In the corresponding Saturday edition of the Irish Times, the books reviewed are all by men. None of them is now well known (EV Cunningham, anyone?), as though the aversion to female writers bent the critics towards forgettability. It is a miracle that Brennan made it into the paper in 1998; the paper has only recently stepped up \u2013 it was still blithely publishing male-only book pages in 2013.</p> <p>No Irish paper published an obituary when she died in 1993, in a nursing home where no one knew her history, not even Brennan herself. \u201cI write every day in the Irish Press and get paid,\u201d she wrote in one of her last letters. A perfect life, clearly. The New Yorker never happened. She was back on the pages her father had made.</p> <p>In 1997, Christopher Carduff published <em>The Springs of Affection</em> in America and the Irish stories were warmly endorsed by Alice Munro and Edna O\u2019Brien. She was introduced to the Irish public by Fintan O\u2019Toole, then an arts columnist for the Irish Times, in January 1998. Brennan was one of the \u201cchildren of the revolution\u201d, he said, who, by the end, \u201cmore or less lived in the women\u2019s toilets in the New Yorker building\u201d. He found in her work \u201ca vague but powerful anxiety about how women\u2019s lives could get lost\u201d.</p> <p>Angela Bourke\u2019s landmark biography came out in 2004. It was a great work of literary reclamation, and Brennan\u2019s reputation as an Irish writer was set. The image of Brennan as lost or discarded, destitute and psychotic, was offset by iconic photographs taken by Karl Bissinger, of a beautiful, fragile woman. Feminist editor Sin\u00e9ad Gleeson laments the current interest in Brennan\u2019s \u201cvintage wardrobe and fabulous up-dos, as opposed to the world she created on the page\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"af23cb3ab1907e62799b6df22bc38e16ac33f6d6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/af23cb3ab1907e62799b6df22bc38e16ac33f6d6/0_0_2679_2768/968.jpg\" alt=\"Maeve Brennan Karl Bissinger\" width=\"968\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Maeve Brennan photographed by Karl Bissinger.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/roddydoyle\">Roddy Doyle</a>\u2019s mother, Ita, is Brennan\u2019s cousin and he remembers a long visit she made to the family in Kilbarrack, when she was sober, hard-working and completely normal. Some of Brennan\u2019s surviving relatives wrote to complain to the Irish Times when she was depicted onstage as \u201cfoul-mouthed\u201d (in Emma Donoghue\u2019s 2012 play <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/oct/08/talk-of-the-town-review\"><em>The Talk of the Town</em></a>). They never heard her swear, they said. \u201cShe may have picked up some vulgar language at the New Yorker, but it would not have been part of her Irish heritage.\u201d</p> <p>The house at 48 Cherryfield Avenue was part of a new suburb when Una and Bob moved there in 1921. This was a time when a certain kind of Irish life became set in bricks and mortar and the house still exists just as described. There is a small, provisional looking shop on the corner, a commercial garage abutting the back wall, and a sports ground beyond. It is possible the laburnum tree still blooms in the garden. My mother\u2019s family lived in a mirroring terrace on the north side of the city, a slightly bigger house in the less affluent suburb of Phibsboro. The walnut furniture described in \u201cThe Springs of Affection\u201d matches the furniture my grandmother bought at around the same time the Brennans set up home. I spent 40 years eying the veneer, in a room where a whole family was made, born, died. When Brennan\u2019s work was republished in the 1990s, I did not think of her as beautiful or lost. I thought of her as being from these new suburbs: the world on the page as familiar and horrible as your own foot. As with <em>Dubliners</em>, the language moves through the stasis of her characters\u2019 lives with a beautiful and painful precision. Each one of Brennan\u2019s stories is a victory over sameness and the loss of meaning: she makes a bid for her sanity, one sentence at a time.</p> <p>\u2022 A new edition of <em><a href=\"http://www.stingingfly.org/book/springs-affection\">The Springs of Affection</a></em> is published by Dublin\u2019s Stinging Fly Press. This essay was first presented as part of the Laureate for Irish Fiction\u2019s programme under the Arts Council of Ireland. <em>The Springs of Affection</em> will be launched on 27 May as part of the <a href=\"http://ilfdublin.com/event/maeve-brennan-a-celebration/\">International Literature Festival Dublin</a>.</p>",

      "body": "<p>LG\u2019s new G5 phone is a curious bit of kit: essentially a workaday-looking smartphone, but one that features a weird slidey thing at the bottom to remove, and quite likely lose, your battery. LG have branded this design kink as modular and \u201ctransformative\u201d, so who better to get across this sense of transformation than Jason Statham, the hyper-versatile actor known for playing a chiselled hard man in Lock Stock And Two Smoking Barrels, a chiselled hard man in the Transporter series, and a chiselled hard man in Crank and its even crankier sequel Crank: High Voltage?</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOpsnNf9Wj0\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/tOpsnNf9Wj0?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>In fairness Stath\u2019s turn in the ad suggests that he might have a bit more range than his IMDB page. Here, he plays an entire bloody city, with his face transposed on to everyone from a hipster to a newborn baby (a sight which will require an extensive period of brain bleaching to unsee). The plot, or what there is of one, sees the city\u2019s inhabitants\u2019 crippling phone addiction, leading them to fight each other for a glimpse at a screen, setting off a bizarre sequence of events involving a motorcyclist on fire and a load of rampaging bulls. No less nonsensical than the rest of Statham\u2019s output, then.</p>",

      "body": "<p>There is only one gate at Newquay Airport\u2019s departure lounge, where the planes park as close as cars to a petrol station, and the wireless broadband doesn\u2019t work. At the coffee shop\u2019s \u201cDestination Cornwall\u201d display, you can buy clotted cream shortbread, clotted cream fudge and, if your lily required further gilding, Poldark-themed Cornish ale.</p> <p>There\u2019s a newspaper rack, too, which has run out of this week\u2019s edition of the Cornish Guardian. It was published on Wednesday and, next to a voucher for a two-for-one \u201ccoffee and traybake\u201d offer at Warrens Bakery, carried a startling front-page story.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/18/queens-speech-2016-the-key-points-explained\">Queen's speech 2016: the key points explained</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cSPACE RACE IS ON,\u201d read the headline, over a photograph of a giant rocket in lift-off, and a smaller illustration of this airport\u2019s potential transformation. \u201cTourists looking for a holiday that\u2019s literally out of this world could soon be blasting off into space \u2013 from Newquay,\u201d began the report.</p> <p>It was the day of the Queen\u2019s speech, in which the government confirmed its support for Britain\u2019s first spaceport, where aircraft, taking off horizontally rather than vertically, are set to launch satellites and tourists into orbit. In 2014, coalition ministers announced a shortlist of eight potential sites. There are now six contenders: four in Scotland, Llanbedr Airport in Wales and Newquay, where the sign on the way into town says: \u201cWelcome to the coast of dreams.\u201d</p> <p>This tiny airport, which sits among grazing sheep just three miles from the renowned surf at Newquay, is being tipped locally and in Westminster as the frontrunner in an unlikely domestic space race. And while all of this is news to the town\u2019s wetsuit wearers (\u201cMate, I\u2019m more worried if there\u2019s any surf,\u201d says Dan at the Slide &amp; Glide surf shop), local business and political figures are fighting hard to launch Britain\u2019s poorest region into the new space age.</p> <p>But the dream exists under a cloud of uncertainty. The government had intended to launch the first planes into space by 2018. But at Newquay, the asphalt remains untouched. No architect has been employed, nor any deal struck with a spaceflight company. Nobody knows what exactly the proposed Modern Transport Bill will require of the chosen site, or what it will cost to build.</p> <p>\u201cI think things need to accelerate now, but we\u2019re confident we can deliver by the end of this parliament, in 2020, says Miles Carden, who manages Aerohub, an aerospace enterprise zone based at the airport. During a tour of the airfield, Carden, who leads the spaceport bid with unbowed enthusiasm, shows off Newquay\u2019s intergalactic credentials alongside Steve Gardner, the airport\u2019s airside manager.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"61cb63549512236d435a9a31e5b121c693b30d9f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/61cb63549512236d435a9a31e5b121c693b30d9f/143_232_2339_3498/669.jpg\" alt=\"Newquay space poster\" width=\"669\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>\u201cThere in front of you is three and three-quarter million square feet of runway surface,\u201d says Gardner, a former RAF air traffic controller. He has parked the airport\u2019s minibus at the eastern end of one of Britain\u2019s longest runways. Extended to accommodate giant bombers in its former life as a military airport, the 2.7km (1.7 mile) strip catapults aircraft over the Atlantic into relatively clear airspace, and away from built-up areas. The furthest you can fly thereafter today, or at least on Wednesdays and Sundays, is to Alicante, with Ryanair. But the runway\u2019s length and position, and close links to London (just 40 minutes to Gatwick) make Newquay a strong contender for much more distant flight.</p> <p>There is also plenty of land \u2013 850 acres owned by the council, including 650 acres that do not require planning permission. On the south side of the airfield, across the runway from the passenger terminal, sit eight cold-war-era hangars rusting slowly.<strong> </strong>One houses a museum, while another is already accustomed to the sounds of big engines; it is the test base for Bloodhound SSC, the British attempt to drive a rocket-powered car at more than 1,000mph.</p> <p>Carden and Gardner are more modest about what a Cornish spaceport would look like than the local paper\u2019s front page. As they return to the glorified huts that serve as the airport\u2019s HQ, an adapted Dassault Falcon jet comes into land. \u201cEvery Thursday, which is locally called the Thursday war, it goes out to sea and simulates naval attacks,\u201d Gardner says. Sensors and emitters hang below the wings like missiles. \u201cOne of those could easily be a detachable rocket with microsatellites in it,\u201d Carden adds.</p> <p>The physical and safety challenges of vertical rocket launches mean any UK spaceport will be a base for spacecraft strapped to traditional planes, to be released at altitude. Virgin Galactic announced last December that its LauncherOne vehicle, which will put satellites into orbit, will be unleashed from the belly of a retired 747 airliner. It had planned to use its own White Knight aircraft, with its distinctive twin fuselages, but this will now only be used to launch the SpaceShipTwo passenger plane, one of which disintegrated during a test flight in 2014, killing the pilot. This setback, and other challenges, make it likely that, in the UK, satellite launches will come some time before human spaceflight.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/apr/10/virgin-galactic-richard-branson-interview\">Richard Branson: \u2018Millions of people would love to become astronauts\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Whatever its use, a Newquay spaceport could look like a more polished version of its current self, with new hangars and a terminal working alongside the existing flight schedule. \u201cIf they said today, \u2018We\u2019re going to start work on it next week,\u2019 this is where it will go,\u201d Gardner says, pointing at the land next to the cold war shelters. But they haven\u2019t said that, and the taxiway to takeoff looks long and bumpy.</p> <p>The airport\u2019s business plan relies on the support of a major player in commercial space flight. Virgin Galactic, which has bases in California and New Mexico, is the most prominent, but it has expressed only vague interest in a British outpost. \u201cWe look forward to continuing to participate in the ongoing dialogue with industry,\u201d is the closest a spokesperson comes to an endorsement. XCOR Aerospace, a large US rival of Virgin\u2019s, does not respond to questions at all.</p> <p>Buried deep in the minutes of the government\u2019s Science and Technology Committee\u2019s evidence lie further seeds of doubt. As part of its ongoing satellites and space inquiry, which launched last year, the committee has canvassed opinions from big industry players of the sort Newquay may depend on. Airbus and the British satellites giant Inmarsat have questioned the economic and scientific case for a UK spaceport. Inmarsat has said it has no problem finding sites elsewhere to launch satellites and that \u201cthere is no particular reason to require a UK site\u201d. In January, Avanti, another satellite firm, said the UK\u2019s thriving space sector could grow sufficiently without a spaceport.</p> <p>\u201cIf it gets built and used well it will be fascinating,\u201d says Dr Robert Massey, deputy executive director at the Royal Astronomical Society. \u201cBut I\u2019m not convinced of the commercial case, and if big companies like Inmarsat seem sceptical, we should be arguing whether this is something we should be spending a lot of time and money on.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"465b64ee2bd27c193a45e9f60bbbb06d2e245caa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/465b64ee2bd27c193a45e9f60bbbb06d2e245caa/0_254_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Cornwall is officially the poorest county in Britain.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Anything that gets more people here is a good thing\u2019 \u2026Cornwall is officially the poorest county in Britain.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Not that it\u2019s even clear where that money will come from. Carden says that significant public funding will be required to get the project off the ground, but there are no clear signs that it will be forthcoming. In March, the science minister Jo Johnson told the same committee that the government intended to facilitate rather than fund the development of a spaceport. \u201cWe have always made it clear that this is primarily a commercial enterprise,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The EU might be relied upon to step in, having invested almost \u00a32bn in Cornwall over the past 20 years. But, to the consternation of many there, five of Cornwall\u2019s six MPs \u2013 all Conservatives \u2013 want to leave the EU. \u201cWe would need to make the case to the UK government to continue to support the Cornish economy and I\u2019m confident we can do that,\u201d says Steve Double, the MP for St Austell and Newquay. \u201cThat has such a hollow ring to it,\u201d Loveday Jenkin says. The councillor and leading figure in Mebyon Kernow, Cornwall\u2019s nationalist party, accuses Westminster of neglecting the county, and does not expect that to change.</p> <p>Kim Conchie, the pro-EU chief executive of the Cornwall Chamber of Commerce, worries about the impact of politics on the spaceport bid, which he also supports. \u201cThe referendum comes at a tricky time,\u201d he says. \u201cIf the shit hits the fan, Cameron resigns and political machinations take over, this could very easily be put on the back burner again.\u201d</p> <p>Add to the cloud of confusion a number of unresolved questions about regulation, licensing, unreliable weather, and safety, and it becomes increasingly hard to see the future at a rain-soaked Newquay Airport. But there is no dampening the enthusiasm of locals. Carden and Gardner are confident that Newquay can deliver space flight. Moreover, they envisage the spaceport as the cornerstone of an existing plan to use science to create high-quality jobs and inspire young people, many of whom tend to leave Cornwall in adulthood.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/feb/19/virgin-galactic-unveils-new-spaceship-16-months-after-fatal-crash\">Virgin Galactic unveils new spaceship 16 months after fatal crash</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Local businesses are generally also positive. Newell\u2019s travel agency welcomes the opportunity to add space to its list of destinations, while wondering how many locals will be able to afford tickets. Will they even want to go? \u201cI will if there\u2019s a job up there,\u201d says Graham, a surfer walking up Fore Street. Suzanne Postings, a local reiki healer and taxi driver, wonders if the arrival of new, high-skilled jobs will just drive rents and property prices to ever-higher levels.</p> <p>The businesses that rely most on tourism are keen. \u201cWe suffer because we\u2019re not by the coast, but if we had something like a spaceport, gosh, it would be brilliant,\u201d says John Hicks, who runs the Smuggler\u2019s Inn. The modest pub has eight rooms opposite the current passenger terminal. \u201cAnything that gets more people here is a good thing,\u201d says Bonita Snook, who runs the village stores, post office and tearoom in St Mawgan, a tiny village just a mile down the hill from the runway.</p> <p>At the airport, where passengers are starting to arrive for the evening Flybe flight to London, Gardner points to a photograph pinned next to his desk. It was taken at a science museum in Toronto, where he took his young son on holiday three years ago. Father and son look at each other from behind life-size cutouts of astronauts. \u201cWhen I grow up I want to be a spaceman!\u201d Gardner says in a speech bubble next to his helmet. \u201cBy the time he grows up I WILL be a spaceman!\u201d the boy says back. It was a joke at the time, but, Gardner says, \u201cMaybe my son can do that, and do it in Cornwall.\u201d</p>",

They complain that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/31/huge-cruise-ships-will-worsen-london-air-pollution-campaigners-warn\">air pollution from such nautical behemoths</a> is getting worse every year as cruising becomes the fastest growing sector of the mass tourism industry and as ships get bigger and bigger.</p> <p>The Harmony, owned by Royal Caribbean, has two four-storey high 16-cylinder W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 engines which would, at full power, each burn 1,377 US gallons of fuel an hour, or about 66,000 gallons a day of some of the most polluting diesel fuel in the world.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/12/air-pollution-rising-at-an-alarming-rate-in-worlds-cities\">Air pollution rising at an 'alarming rate' in world's cities</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In port, and close to US and some European coasts, the Harmony must burn low sulphur fuel or use abatement technologies. But, says Colin MacQueen, who lives around 400 yards from the docks and is a member of new environment group Southampton Clean Air, the fumes from cruise liners and bulk cargo ships are \u201cdefinitely\u201d contributing to Southampton\u2019s highly polluted air.<br /></p> <p>\u201cWe can smell, see and taste it. These ships are like blocks of flats. Sometimes there are five or more in the docks at the same time. The wind blows their pollution directly into the city and as far we can tell, there is no monitoring of their pollution. We are pushing for them to use shore power but they have resisted.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThe liners pollute, but the road traffic that they and the cargo ships generate is also huge,\u201d he adds. </p> <p>Royal Caribbean, the US owners of the Harmony of the Seas, said that the latest and most efficient pollution control systems were used and that the ship met all legal requirements. </p> <p>Industry body Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) added that companies had \u201cinvested significantly over the last decade to develop new technologies to help reduce air emissions\u201d.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2016/may/17/worlds-largest-cruise-ship-harmony-seas-southampton-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4ja5v\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2507166\"            data-video-name=\"World\u2019s largest cruise ship arrives  in Southampton \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"AP\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-573b0203e4b05be498d5fb90\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/17/160517Ship_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/17/160517Ship.m3u8\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/17/160517Ship_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11508236&amp;format=video/3gp&amp;minwidth=700\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/webM/2016/05/17/160517Ship_synd_768k_vp8.webm\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/video/2016/may/17/worlds-largest-cruise-ship-harmony-seas-southampton-video\">World\u2019s largest cruise ship arrives in Southampton on Tuesday</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>But marine pollution analysts in Germany and Brussels said that such a large ship would probably burn at least 150 tonnes of fuel a day, and emit more sulphur than several million cars, more NO2 gas than all the traffic passing through a medium-sized town and more particulate emissions than thousands of London buses.<br /></p> <p>According to leading independent German pollution analyst Axel Friedrich, a single large cruise ship will emit over five tonnes of NOX emissions, and 450kg of ultra fine particles a day. </p> <p>Bill Hemmings, marine expert at Brussels-based Transport and Environment group said: \u201cThese ships burn as much fuel as whole towns. They use a lot more power than container ships and even when they burn low sulphur fuel, it\u2019s 100 times worse than road diesel.\u201d<br /></p> <p>\u201cAir pollution from international shipping accounts for around <a href=\"https://www.transportenvironment.org/what-we-do/shipping/air-pollution-ships\">50,000 premature deaths</a> per year in Europe alone, at an annual cost to society of more than \u20ac58bn [ $65bn],\u201d says the group on its website.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/cruise_ship-zip/giv-12515Tc5MAdgDOdnR\" data-alt=\"Cruise ship emissions\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/cruise_ship-zip/giv-12515Tc5MAdgDOdnR\">Cruise ship emissions</a> </figure>  <p>Daniel Rieger, a transport officer at German environment group Nabu, said: \u201cCruise companies create a picture of being a bright, clean and environmentally friendly tourism sector. But the opposite is true. One cruise ship emits as many air pollutants as five million cars going the same distance because these ships use heavy fuel that on land would have to be disposed of as hazardous waste.\u201d</p> <p>Nabu has measured pollution in large German ports and found high concentrations of pollutants. \u201cHeavy fuel oil can contain <a href=\"https://en.nabu.de/issues/traffic/cruiseships.html\">3,500 times more sulphur</a> than diesel that is used for land traffic vehicles. Ships do not have exhaust abatement technologies like particulate filters that are standard on passenger cars and lorries,\u201d says Rieger.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fbea644b295b1881d91e5c160b53fa28ba5c8c8a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fbea644b295b1881d91e5c160b53fa28ba5c8c8a/0_0_4928_3280/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The upper deck of the Harmony of the Seas cruise ship\" width=\"1000\" height=\"666\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The upper deck of the Harmony of the Seas cruise ship.

We are now seeing more, bigger liners but also very large bulk cargo ships.\u201d<br /></p> <p>According to CLIA, the cruise ship industry is now one of the fastest growing sectors in the mass tourism market, with <a href=\"http://www.cruising.org/myclia/my-news/state-of-the-cruise-industry-outlook-continued-evolution-of-cruise-travel-drives-industry-growth\">24 million passengers expected to sail in 2016</a>, compared to 15 million in 2006 and just 1.4 million in 1980.<br /></p> <p>\u201cThe industry shows no signs of slowing down.

An earlier version said the Harmony of the Seas had three 16-cylinder engines which, if running at full power, would burn 96,000 US gallons of fuel a day. It has two such engines which together would burn about 66,000 US gallons of fuel a day if running at full power, and is understood to have four 12 cylinder engines. The article also said the ship must burn low-sulphur fuel in port and close to some coasts; it can also use abatement technologies to meet emissions guidelines.</p>",

Lumley originally conceived the bridge as a memorial to Princess Diana; eventually found a likely site for it just to the east of the Southbank arts complex, in the gap (all half a mile of it) between the crossings at Waterloo and Blackfriars; and got Heatherwick excited by the idea. The two were friends. In fact, Heatherwick\u2019s company listed Lumley as an associate. A third friend \u2013 Lumley had known him since his childhood \u2013 was Boris Johnson, who as London mayor held the power to take the scheme forward.</p> <p>Chummery is an interesting word; it originally described the bachelor quarters shared by officers in the Indian army and other imperial enterprises. Here, a different kind of chummery got to work. The mayor had to persuade officials at Transport for London that a new bridge was necessary in the city centre rather than across the long unbridged, unglamorous stretches downstream; the department then invited tenders for the work, specifying a pedestrian rather than a garden bridge but nevertheless selecting the Lumley/Heatherwick proposal above bids from two other firms with far greater experience of bridge-building.</p> <p>Later <a href=\"http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/news/heatherwick-and-boris-promoted-garden-bridge-before-rigged-tfl-design-contest/10002173.article\" title=\"\">investigations by the Architects\u2019 Journal</a> discovered that TfL officials \u2013 sometimes with Johnson in attendance \u2013 had met Heatherwick four times before the tendering process began in February 2013; and that, shortly before tendering opened, Johnson and Heatherwick had travelled to San Francisco to solicit corporate sponsorship for the bridge from Apple. In the well-chosen words of <a href=\"http://www2.hull.ac.uk/hubs/aboutus/ourstaff/allstaff/b/bovis_c.aspx\" title=\"\">Christopher Bovis</a>, an internationally respected expert on public procurement standards, the story of the garden bridge\u2019s tendering was \u201clittered with procedural irregularities\u201d. City Hall said in a statement at the time that the meetings had \u201cno bearing\u201d on a \u201cfair and transparent procurement process\u201d.</p> <p>In any case, Apple, in fact, didn\u2019t bite; too few businesses did. An ornamental project meant to be funded by private money has in the end been bailed out by the Treasury and TfL, which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/12/garden-bridge-osborne-public-cash-inquiry\" title=\"\">each invested \u00a330m</a> to add to the \u00a383m donated, often anonymously, by private companies, foundations and individuals \u2013 leaving a gap in capital funding of roughly \u00a333m and a question mark over how the \u00a33.1m a year in operating and maintenance costs will be met by the charity charged with its management, the Garden Bridge\u00a0Trust.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0caee6921de4f1d0ff42d3810cc7d2580264ae12\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0caee6921de4f1d0ff42d3810cc7d2580264ae12/0_46_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Impression of the proposed garden bridge, London\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The publicity shots show a line of foliage floating above the river as ethereal as a Chinese print: lovely!\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Heatherwick Studio</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How many people want this bridge is hard to know. The London Evening Standard likes and promotes the idea, but evidence of popular support is mixed. Two opinion polls last year<a href=\"http://www.comres.co.uk/polls/garden-bridge-trust-survey/\" title=\"\"> found 78%</a> and <a href=\"http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/opinion/what-do-polls-tell-us-about-support-for-the-garden-bridge/10003732.fullarticle\" title=\"\">42% of Londoners</a> in favour, a difference almost certainly achieved by how the question was asked. Many people knew nothing about the bridge, and only one in 10 claimed to know much; the more information the question contained, the more likely it was to prompt a negative response.</p> <p>This year a third poll found 60% against. Locally, and among all kinds of environmental and community-minded activists, opposition is fierce. On Monday evening about 400 critics of the plan <a href=\"http://www.tcos.org.uk/\" title=\"\">crowded out the spacious church of St John\u2019s, Waterloo</a>, to hear the scheme denounced by the local MP, Kate Hoey, and a succession of hostile architects, planners and local politicians. They wanted the new mayor, Sadiq Khan, to initiate an inquiry into the procurement process and to promise that no more public money would be spent. But this was just the means; the end was to stop the bridge.</p> <p>That seemed more than a possibility on Monday evening. Khan had previously expressed what he called \u201creal concerns about the procurement process at City Hall\u201d, which needed to be \u201cfully investigated by the next mayor\u201d. But on Tuesday morning, when the next mayor did his first <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/17/sadiq-khan-lbc-radio-phone-in\" title=\"\">Speak to Sadiq</a> phone-in on LBC, his position had softened. What mattered now was that the Garden Bridge Trust made the bridge \u201ca genuinely public and\u00a0open space\u201d by reducing the number of days \u2013 12 have been scheduled \u2013 that the trust plans to close it for private fundraising events; by reducing the hours of those events; and by guaranteeing that children at local schools will be involved in planting and watering the gardens.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Like his objections, Khan\u2019s endorsement of the bridge looks rather half-hearted</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Only the first of these demands causes much difficulty. According to the trust\u2019s business plan, the trust will raise its yearly \u00a33.1m budget from a mixture of merchandising, visitors\u2019 donations from contactless-card payment points (the trust expects 5% of visitors will touch in, at \u00a32 a time), but most of all from the summer days and nights when the gates will be shut to the hoi polloi, and black-clad waiters will move through the pontine shrubbery to serve wine and miniature crab cakes to the staff and friends of the PR company, bank or law firm that has hired the space for \u00a360,000 a time. To reduce that revenue would be awkward; but some compromise, surely, will be found.</p> <p>Like his objections, Khan\u2019s endorsement of the bridge looks rather half-hearted: the standard word, iconic, the standard comparison with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/sep/22/final-stretch-new-york-high-line-complete\" title=\"\">New York\u2019s High Line</a> as a city lung and tourist attraction. Michael Ball of the campaign group Thames Central Open Space, thinks that Khan is simply \u201ctrying not to lose lots of friends\u201d. Compared with building good houses that averagely waged Londoners can afford, the garden bridge amounts to very small beer. But treating it so cautiously is not a good portent.</p> <p>How thrilling it would have been \u2013 how refreshing to his supporters and the political system \u2013 if Khan had denounced the bridge in every way: not only as an unnecessary claim on public funds, a folly that won\u2019t allow cycling, a thoroughfare that will shut its gates every midnight, an out-of-this-world oddity that will clutter a historic riverscape; not only as all those things, but also as a symbol of the chummery \u2013 the chumocracy, even \u2013 that so offends the democratic and egalitarian traditions he is proud to represent.</p>",

      "body": "<p>On a good night, my daughter and I will be up once or twice. In the dim, cool hours, her cries pull me from sleep and I carry her to the bathroom. She is crying, struggling, but she will become calm as we go about our nocturnal rituals. It might be 20 minutes or half an hour before she\u2019s back in bed.</p> <p>On a bad night, we are up five, six, seven times. I am unable to soothe her. She screams, she writhes, she tears at her skin, her handcoverings, her clothing. Whatever I try doesn\u2019t help. We pace the floor together. We change her bandages. We try a bath. We try going outside.</p> <p>These are the nights I fear, when the bedclothes might be covered in blood, when she howls in agony, yelling, \u201cPlease make it stop.\u201d My child, you see, is not a newborn. It isn\u2019t night feeds that she and I are engaged upon, although sometimes the nocturnal wakings, the dark loneliness, the wild swings from hope to despair bring those to mind. Astrid is six. She suffers from chronic eczema.</p> <p>One night, just as dawn approaches, when we have been awake for several hours and she is at last drifting off, she opens her eyes and looks at me with an alert, insightful gaze. I\u2019m sitting on the edge of her bed, holding one of her arms and one of her legs, which is the only way, we\u2019ve discovered, that she can manage to drop off, the only way to combat sudden bouts of auto-scratching. \u201cMama,\u201d she whispers, \u201cI can\u2019t take it any more.\u201d</p> <p>If there is a more upsetting sentence for a parent to hear their child say, I haven\u2019t yet come across it.</p> <p>When I am sure she is asleep, I tiptoe from the bed and into my study. I slump at my desk, laying my head down on its warm, familiar surface.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When people approached her pram, I braced myself. Please, I willed them, find something nice to say. Don\u2019t reel back</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We have, earlier in the week, seen the top consultant dermatologist at the hospital. He surveyed Astrid, as she lay, itching and writhing, on his examination couch. He glanced at her notes, her traumatised, lacerated skin. He exchanged looks with the two junior doctors behind him. There is a particular facial expression that doctors adopt when faced with someone like Astrid, who is already exceeding the maximum dosage of steroids, who adheres to every piece of NHS advice, who is doing everything to get well and yet only seems to get worse. It is part-diagnostic, part-nervous.</p> <p>\u201cHmm,\u201d he said, and I knew what that meant. That we had come to the end of the road. That he had nothing else to offer us. That we had tried everything, but everything wasn\u2019t working.</p> <p>In my study, the weak light of a new day is sliding in around the curtain edges. I switch on my computer and type, as I have done countless times, \u201csevere eczema\u201d into a search engine.</p> <p>***</p> <p>On the second day of Astrid\u2019s life, when I was still wired up to a drip, woozy from anaesthetic, I removed the sleepsuit the nurses had put her in. My hands shook, with the novelty or the drugs, it\u2019s hard to say which, and as I eased the suit away from her, there was a shower of something the consistency of snow. Suddenly my lap was dusted with white. Odd, I thought, then tossed the sleepsuit aside and forgot all about it.</p> <p>When doctors ask me when Astrid first got eczema, I say: she was born with it.</p> <p>A week later, Astrid\u2019s skin was peeling off in strips, like dried glue. The cuffs of jackets seemed too harsh for the petal delicacy of her; the circle backs of poppers and the undersides of zips were a metallic outrage, printing her with red, raw lesions.</p> <p>Her skin never looked like skin should. It was patchy, hot, sand-dry, crepey. By the time she was a month old, she was encased in the livid, raw bodycast of eczema. Her skin split open if she flexed her wrist, her arm, her leg.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If I catch Astrid starting to scratch, I must move fast: I have three, maybe four seconds before she draws blood</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When people stepped up towards Astrid\u2019s pram that spring, eager to see the baby, I found that I was gripping the handle, bracing myself. Please, I was silently willing them, find something nice to say: compliment her blue eyes, her blond curls. Don\u2019t reel back in horror. Don\u2019t gasp, what\u2019s wrong with her?</p> <p>When I think back to those days, I am overcome by an urge to go up to the person I was then, put a hand on her shoulder and say: you have no idea what is coming. At that time, you see, I still thought it was something that could be sorted out. It was only eczema, right? How bad could it be?</p> <p>***</p> <p>Eczema affects one in five children in the UK and one in 12 adults. Its causes are mostly genetic, but environment plays a large part. <a href=\"http://www.eczema.org\">The National Eczema Society</a> describes it as \u201ca highly individual condition which varies from person to person and comes in many different forms\u201d. The word \u201ceczema\u201d comes from \u201cekzein\u201d, the Greek for \u201cto boil\u201d, which is a horribly accurate root. Most people think of eczema as dry skin, but chronic eczema is scalding, fiery, scarlet in hue.</p> <p>Some things I didn\u2019t know, as I pushed Astrid\u2019s pram up the hill: that there is no known cure for eczema. That even though her skin seemed as bad as it could possibly be, it would get an awful lot worse. That it indicated more serious health problems. That eczema, at its most severe, can be dangerous and even life-threatening. That her skin would dictate our lives, our home, our plans, our holidays, her schooling. That it would torture her every minute of every day, and that it would absorb my time, attention, concentration, patience, stamina and a not inconsiderable amount of money.</p> <p>People sometimes can\u2019t see beyond her condition, as if the eczema is a synecdoche for Astrid herself. I overhear someone at school refer to her as \u201cthe girl with the gloves\u201d, and I want to go to them and say, is that the only thing about her you can see?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ffd8b23406a258534e831a46b42d71ce173a6999\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ffd8b23406a258534e831a46b42d71ce173a6999/0_1481_6494_5733/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A young model scratches her back\" width=\"1000\" height=\"883\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Several standard NHS-prescribed products for eczema contain ingredients that are known skin irritants. Posed by a model.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Felicity McCabe for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Astrid\u2019s eczema is a fluid, febrile force. Some weeks, it seems to be on the wane; others, it will colonise and rampage over her. Devious, relentless, unforgiving, it will swarm up her ankles and legs; we spend days attending to it there, and just when we think we\u2019ve got the better of it, it will relocate to her arms and chest.</p> <p>The discomfort of it is a constant presence, like tinnitus or background music. All those cyclical daily tasks that go along with small children become intensely problematic, often impossible. I might be feeding the baby or cooking dinner or helping with homework, and I will catch sight of Astrid starting to scratch. Here, I must move fast: I have three, maybe four seconds before she draws blood, five or six seconds before she creates a wound that may take weeks to heal or, worse, become septic.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>We are, I tell my baffled family, going to use only natural soap products \u2013 for everything, from laundry to hair</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Down the baby or wooden spoon or maths homework must go; off to the box of creams; over to the miserable child; coax her out of clothing, taking care to hold her hands in a one-handed grip so fingernails are immobilised; apply creams, allay screams and howls; cuddle; stagger back to baby/cooker/miffed older sibling, taking eczematous child with me; attempt to restart task. Two minutes later, repeat. And repeat, and repeat, until I, my child, the floors, the furniture, my baby, the table, all my clothes and hair are sticky with lotion. And still the itch will not stop. It\u2019s like Groundhog Day, except with a lot more emollient.</p> <p>Avoid triggers: you are told this constantly, by doctors, by dermatology nurses. I once wrote down the things that triggered Astrid\u2019s eczema: dust, animal hair, nuts, eggs, perfume, cleaning and laundry products, flour, soil, sand, bedding, pillows, cushions, soap, carpets, curtains, wool, synthetic fibres, paint, glue, leaves, seeds, wood smoke, petrol, the seams of clothing, lace trim, chlorine, soft toys, rope, firelighters, plastic cutlery, elastic, erasers, sea water, feathers, tree pollen, grass, plant sap, mould.</p> <p>How, I wondered, do you give someone a life, a childhood, while avoiding all those?</p> <p>More than anything, what I want for Astrid \u2013 for all my children \u2013 is for her to be herself, for her to live her life as it was meant to be. But how to achieve this if she can\u2019t swim in the sea or pet a dog or sit on upholstery or go on a playdate or roll on the lawn or build a sandcastle? How is she to engage with the world if the world makes her ill?</p> <p>These questions and more circle my head as I sit at my computer, compulsively Googling \u201ceczema\u201d and \u201ctreatments\u201d and \u201ccauses\u201d. I want a reason. I want an explanation. I want a way out. I am awake, reading and researching, until the household rises for the next day. I come down to breakfast armed with a list. On the basis of an article by an American scientist, I decide to banish all detergents from the house, even plant-based ones. According to him, instances of atopic illnesses such as eczema and asthma rose sharply after the second world war, which is also when detergents were introduced as a household cleansing agent.</p> <p>All our cleaning products, which were ostensibly \u201cgreen\u201d and \u201cnatural\u201d, are not as innocuous as they seem, this man\u2019s research claims. Every single one, that very day, is removed from the house. We are, I tell my baffled family, going to use only natural soap products \u2013 for everything, from laundry to hair.</p> <p>It is a long shot, I know, but we have to try it. At this point, I am the definition of desperate. I would hang upside down from a tree in the moonlight, chanting spells, if there was even the slightest chance it might work.</p> <p>I also go through the fine print of what we have been using on her up to now \u2013 the battery of NHS-prescribed products \u2013 and what I discover makes me so furious, I hurl most of them across the room. Several standard products for eczema contain ingredients that are known skin irritants. Sodium lauryl sulphate, isopropyl myristate, sorbitan laurate, triethanolamine, phenoxyethanol: you\u2019ll find all these in eczema products, but a quick internet search will make you want to know why.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I must find an alternative to standard moisturisers. I'm a woman possessed. Never underestimate a mother on the warpath</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>A few days later, a friend points to the algae-coloured shape in the kitchen sink. \u201cWhat is that?\u201d she asks warily.</p> <p>\u201cOlive oil soap,\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s going to change my life.\u201d I shrug. \u201cMaybe.\u201d</p> <p>Strange, lumpen parcels begin to appear at the door: cold-pressed oils, salts, shea butter, beeswax, anything I can find that is said to have skin-soothing properties. I have to find an alternative to these conventional moisturisers. I am a woman possessed. Never underestimate a mother on the warpath.</p> <p>In the evenings, I melt and mix and stir. I test each one on my very patient husband, bursting into his study to rub some mixture into his wrist and ask, how does it feel? Does it sting? Is it moisturising? This happens so often that he begins to wordlessly hold out his arm whenever I enter a room.</p> <p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, a character with eczema appears in the novel I am writing. My husband returns the pages with the note \u201cStill too angry\u201d scrawled in the margin. I rework the chapter, with Astrid\u2019s input, from the child\u2019s point of view. \u201cYou need to say that it also feels hot,\u201d she instructs. \u201cIt burns.\u201d</p> <p>It takes several months of experimenting to devise a viable emollient. One ghoulishly green version makes Astrid look a bit worried; another, in which the beeswax doesn\u2019t quite melt, leaves lumps throughout. One batch is so solid, it bends a spoon.</p> <p>The breakthrough comes when I work out how to emulsify beeswax: at a terrifyingly high temperature, is the answer, with the kids shut out of the room. Suddenly, I have a mixture that is smooth, absorbent yet waterproof. It is golden yellow and smells of flowers, of spring, of honey, of all things nice.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the detergent ban is slowly working its magic. I find an aloe vera gel, sold by a company in south Wales, that is 99.9% pure, and this proves to be more effective at calming the worst of Astrid\u2019s skin inflammation than any steroid cream.</p> <p>My husband and I witness untroubled, peach-like skin emerge from under the eczema. Astrid, bathing now in magnesium salts and olive oil, instead of dermatological soap substitutes, looks \u2013 dare I say it? Dare I even think it? \u2013 better. The eczema is retreating, fading. Is this really happening, or is it a false dawn?</p> <p>She sleeps through a night. Then another. On holiday, she hesitates on the shoreline, watching her siblings in the sea, then takes a step into the waves, then another. Farther up the beach, I weep mawkishly into a towel.</p> <p>I don\u2019t call what happened to Astrid a cure. It\u2019s a means, a solution, a way to make life liveable. Her skin regimen still takes an inordinate amount of time; we rely on an extensive arsenal of potions and specialist clothing to keep her comfortable. Eczema is part of her life and probably always will be. It\u2019s just not taking over her life any more. She is no longer \u201cthe girl with the gloves\u201d.</p> <p>One day, she finds one of these at the back of a cupboard. She lifts the glove out, draws it on to her hand and stares at it. \u201cI used to wear these all the time,\u201d she says, almost to herself.</p> <p>I nod. \u201cYou did.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cNot any more, though.\u201d She yanks it off with a grin, flings it to one side and runs away to play.</p> <p>\u2022 Maggie O\u2019Farrell\u2019s new novel, This Must Be The Place, is published by Tinder Press at \u00a318.99. <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/394852/s/this-must-be-the-place/\">Order a copy for \u00a315.19, with free UK p&amp;p, from the guardian bookshop</a>.</p>",

But the trend actually dates back more than 400 years, and one of the earliest books intended for amateur colouring \u2013 a series of maps adorned with delicately drawn images of nymphs, water sprites and fairies \u2013 is about to be republished, centuries after it was first printed.</p> <p>The maps in <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/409604/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\">Albion\u2019s Glorious Ile</a>, out in June from Unicorn Press, were commissioned to illustrate the poet Michael Drayton\u2019s 17th-century, 15,000-line poem, Poly-Olbion. Describing England and Wales \u2013 Drayton didn\u2019t get round to Scotland \u2013 the vast poem tours the country, county by county, evoking the topographical features and legends of each location. \u201cOf Albions glorious Ile the wonders \u2026 I write, / The sundry varying soyles, the pleasures infinite,\u201d writes Drayton, in the poem he dubbed his \u201cstrange Herculean labour\u201d and spent 30 years honing.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d560890d3a8840e242a273d8a928260482d6e5d0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d560890d3a8840e242a273d8a928260482d6e5d0/0_0_1090_1699/642.jpg\" alt=\"A anthropomorphised goddess figure of Albion, from Albion\u2019s Glorious Ile.

Hole\u2019s maps, printed uncoloured and bound with the poem, anthropomorphise each feature of the landscape, hills becoming country gentlemen, forests huntresses, rivers gods and water nymphs, would have subsequently been hand-coloured by both amateur and professional colourists.</p> <p>\u201cYou could have asked for it to be coloured by a professional, but it became quite fashionable to hand-colour it yourself. It was an activity for nobles,\u201d said art historian Anne Louise Avery. \u201cBefore the printing press, you had manuscript maps which were so valuable you would have wanted a professional, plus the pigments were so expensive. Then there were woodblock maps, which needed heavy pigments. But these were copperplate maps, so they needed lighter paints, and this tied in with the development of watercolours. They became really popular - there was the theory that they would improve your mind \u2013 it was early mindfulness.\u201d</p> <p>Avery pointed to the words of Henry Peacham, in his 1622 Compleat Gentleman, in which he advised that the basics of hand-colouring were easy to learn, and highly beneficial. \u201cI could wish you now and then, to exercise your Pensill in washing and colouring, which at your leasure you may in one fortnight easily learne to doe: for the practise of the hand, doth speedily instruct the mind, and strongly confirme the memorie beyond any thing else,\u201d wrote Peacham, predating the spiritual claims of colouring-in publishers today.</p> <p>\u201cColouring became consistently popular as an activity, and this went on until the 19th century, when technology meant that you could print full-colour maps,\u201d said Avery, who discovered the maps when researching the writings of Drayton. Also director of the arts and education nonprofit organisation Flash of Spendour, she went on to direct the Children\u2019s Poly-Olbion project, which introduced children to Drayton\u2019s poetry and Hole\u2019s cartography, <a href=\"http://poly-olbion.exeter.ac.uk/\">culminating in a major exhibition</a>, and the publication of Albion\u2019s Glorious Ile next month.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e95f68f1bacb8df5aa69dca99c2330c78f57486f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e95f68f1bacb8df5aa69dca99c2330c78f57486f/0_0_2551_1530/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Surrey and London, from Albion\u2019s Glorious Ile.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">For the metrosexuals ...

The books have already won advance praise from Simon Schama, who called it \u201csuch a wonderful idea\u201d, while Philip Pullman said that he welcomed \u201cthe reappearance, in any form, of this vivid and slightly crazy poem, and the picturesque images that accompanied it\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cDrayton the poet was an early environmentalist, and so the subtext of the maps is this great message for England not to have its natural landscape destroyed,\u201d said Avery.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/gallery/2016/may/21/albions-glorious-ile-the-400-year-old-colouring-book-in-pictures\">Albion's Glorious Ile, the 400-year-old colouring book \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Drayton never got to include Scotland due to the changing tastes of his contemporaries. \u201cWhen the second volume was published in 1622, he was supposed to do Scotland, but it hadn\u2019t sold very well. At the time of the first publication, in 1612, people were in the Elizabethan way of thinking, about fairies and mystical beings. By the second, everyone was very Jacobean and dark and sinister; they didn\u2019t want Elizabethans flitting around, and it didn\u2019t sell. Drayton called his publishers \u2018base knaves\u2019 and was feeling ill about it all, so he didn\u2019t do Scotland.\u201d</p> <p>With colouring books for adults continuing to storm the book charts, and the genre cited as a crucial factor in the growth of print book sales in 2015, those yet to buy into the craze could do worse than remember Peacham\u2019s advice in 1622: \u201cnor thinke it any disgrace unto you, since in other Countries it is the practise of Princes \u2026 also many of our young Nobilitie in England exercise the same with great felicitie.\u201d</p>",

But hop on a bike and cycle around the city centre and you can still discover empty plots of land. <br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/rotterdam-flood-proof-climate-change\">Rotterdam: designing a flood-proof city to withstand climate change</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This is how a young couple, Nina Aalbers and her boyfriend Ferry in \u2018t Veld, architecture graduates of the Technical University of Delft, found the perfect place to build their first house together. The twist? They\u2019re building it from waste.</p> <p>Their four-storey home will be made from bricks that started out as an experiment in a laboratory in Limburg \u2013 a southern province in the Netherlands. It\u2019s here where Tom van Soest, co-founder of circular economy startup <a href=\"http://www.stonecycling.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">StoneCycling</a>, spends his time concocting new recipes and cooking up <a href=\"http://www.stonecycling.com/wastebasedbrick/\" rel=\"nofollow\">WasteBasedBricks</a>. <br /></p> <p>The ingredients \u2013 waste from the ceramics, glass and insulation industries, and rejected clay from traditional brick manufacturing \u2013 are all sourced within a 100km radius. The composition of different recipes can lead to unusual aesthetics, such as the aptly named Aubergine brick (below).</p> <p>When a recipe works on a laboratory manufacturing scale (five to 10 bricks) and the technical properties are in line with market and regulatory demands, production is scaled up. <br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da08b5fad67adb07cfc4fb8173fbb42fac3555aa\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da08b5fad67adb07cfc4fb8173fbb42fac3555aa/250_221_4996_2997/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018The Aubergine\u2019 waste based brick.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018The Aubergine\u2019 waste based brick.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: StoneCycling</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The startup also uses demolition waste and is working on a project turning waste from a demolished neighbourhood into new products that can be used to rebuild it. <br /></p> <p>Re-using materials diverts construction waste from landfill and reduces the demand for virgin materials. In the EU, waste from construction accounts for <a href=\"http://www.euractiv.com/section/sustainable-dev/opinion/building-towards-a-circular-economy-in-construction/\" rel=\"nofollow\">one-third of all waste</a> generated.<br /></p> <p>The exact recipes used to make WasteBasedBricks are kept secret but, as with any signature dish, there are ingredients to be avoided. These include fly ash, which can contain heavy metals, and waste containing cement, which reacts badly with other materials. <br /></p> <p>Getting uncontaminated waste streams from demolition is one of StoneCycling\u2019s biggest challenges and it is calling for better ways of demolishing buildings. <br /></p> <p>One idea being discussed in the Netherlands is a building material passport (a document clearly describing the materials used in a building), which would make it easier at the end of a building\u2019s life to identify materials for reuse. <br /></p> <p>Companies such as StoneCycling could then guarantee to use or buy certain materials from building owners and demolishing companies, incentivising strategic demolition over cheap demolition. This is something it has been working on with waste management company <a href=\"http://www.suez-environnement.com/group/profile/history/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Suez Environment</a>.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b7357b0339779294bc006336e743e8872401337\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b7357b0339779294bc006336e743e8872401337/0_11_640_384/500.jpg\" alt=\"Tom van Soest in Limburg, a prominent area for brick manufacturing, creating making waste based bricks recipes.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tom van Soest in a laboratory in Limburg, a prominent area for brick manufacturing.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: StoneCycling</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>StoneCycling mainly produces special bricks which are unique in terms of colour, shape and texture compared to commonly used building bricks. Within this market segment, it says its price point is mid-level. All StoneCycling bricks are subjected to standard market tests to ensure they are safe to use according to European standards. They are checked, for example, for frost resistance and the maximum pressure the brick can take. But still, this is a new product in an industry that is typically risk averse and profit driven.</p> <p>\u201cIn general [architects] love the products because it opens up a whole new range of possibilities in terms of colours and textures,\u201d says StoneCycling co-founder Ward Massa. \u201cOn the other hand, they want to see proof. Realising a number of projects is extremely important to take away any scepticism about building from waste.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"46802d692fb97c598c338afed296fb8ed90af028\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/46802d692fb97c598c338afed296fb8ed90af028/130_1457_4103_6122/670.jpg\" alt=\"Artist\u2019s impression of Nina and Ferry\u2019s finished house.\" width=\"670\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Artist\u2019s impression of Nina Aalber and Ferry in \u2018t Veld\u2019s house.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: architectuurMAKEN</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s quite amazing that [Nina and Ferry] decided to invest more money and time and take an extra risk to be the first to live in a waste-based house,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it is inspiring to see a new generation that believes in a different way of designing, living, building, maintaining and demolishing.\u201d</p> <p>Massa believes the first market to take up their product will be the likes of fashion and coffee brands that want sustainable features in their buildings to serve as a marketing tool and unique selling point. StoneCycling has already worked with an Eindhoven design studio to make a <a href=\"http://www.stonecycling.com/projects/2016/3/17/as2c5wys89k1jkosyxqsxcmhv75kfj\" rel=\"nofollow\">bar from old Heineken beer bottles</a> for a restaurant in Amsterdam. <br /></p> <p>The products have been included in designs for hotels, office buildings and houses that will be built in 2017 and onwards, but still have to survive budget-cut rounds. <br /></p> <p>Veld admits using the new brick is exciting but also challenging, \u201csince you can never be sure how it will work out on the building site and how it will look in a few years.\u201d But he was reassured by the impressed mason who built the test wall. \u201cHe showed us by breaking the brick with his trowel in two, apparently a lot of bricks nowadays break into a thousand pieces.\u201d</p> <p>The first WasteBasedBricks are being laid at <a href=\"http://architectuurmaken.nl/de-bouw/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aalbers and Veld\u2019s house</a> this week and the couple plans to move in by August.</p> <p><br /></p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-21T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>The hugely popular YSL foundation <a href=\"http://www.boots.com/en/Yves-Saint-Laurent-Le-Teint-Touche-Eclat-Foundation-30ml_1806554\"><strong>Le Teint Touche Eclat</strong></a> (\u00a332.50) has been reformulated to make it longer-lasting. That\u2019s great news if your skin is oily, or if you\u2019re experiencing hot flashes; it\u2019s not so good if you loved the soft, dewy glow of the original \u2013 which I did. The newer Le Teint Touche Eclat has, to my eye, a flatter, more matte finish, and will consequently no longer be my default foundation of choice for brides, most mature skins or anyone else looking for decent coverage plus glow.</p> <p>All is not lost, however. While YSL is apparently shunning the light, several brands are positively striding towards it with their own glow-giving bases. Bourjois upholds my belief that no one else in the high street price bracket does foundation better. Its new <a href=\"http://www.boots.com/en/Bourjois-City-Radiance-foundation_1800908/\"><strong>City Radiance</strong></a> (\u00a39.99) is sheerer than I\u2019d generally choose, but if your skin is pretty even in tone, I think you\u2019ll love it. It\u2019s a comfy wear and spreads on very easily, with barely a need for a mirror. Also sheer is Becca\u2019s new <a href=\"https://www.cultbeauty.co.uk/becca-aqua-luminous-perfecting-foundation.html\"><strong>Aqua Luminous Perfecting Foundation</strong></a> (\u00a334), but this builds up very nicely for increased coverage (be thin with your layers). It feels extremely lightweight on the skin and looks glorious in photographs \u2013 plenty of glow and brightness, but with neither grease nor glare. You\u2019ll need to try it on your face before buying, however, because the colours are weirdly dark for their corresponding names. (I assumed I\u2019d be Light. I was Fair.)</p> <p>That said, the new Becca foundation is yet another in a pipette-style bottle. Brands seem infatuated with these right now, even though they don\u2019t really work and get far messier than a less poncey pump. A case in point is the pipette-bottled <a href=\"http://www.johnlewis.com/giorgio-armani-maestro-glow-nourishing-fusion-makeup-spf-30/p2447160\"><strong>Giorgio</strong> <strong>Armani Maestro Glow</strong></a> (\u00a340), which seems to be loved by everyone but me. It gives good glow, but application is patchy, the finish a little ashy and it cannot hold a candle to the magnificent <a href=\"http://www.selfridges.com/GB/en/cat/giorgio-armani-luminous-silk-foundation_317-77011643-LUMSILKFDT/\">Luminous Silk Foundation</a> from the same range (this is one of the all-time greats).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/apr/30/dark-circles-beauty-makeup-sali-hughes\">Beauty: how to banish dark circles</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Easily my favourite of the new crop is <a href=\"http://www.johnlewis.com/laura-mercier-candleglow-soft-luminous-foundation/p2465250\"><strong>Laura Mercier Candleglow Soft Luminous Foundation</strong></a> (\u00a335). I\u2019ve been using this for several weeks and my love for it only deepens. Unlike the others, it provides a medium coverage and deft handling of uneven skintone. It gives noticeable glow without the pearlescence I know many of you hate, and garners more compliments than almost any foundation I\u2019ve worn.</p>",

      "headline": "Hystopia by David Means review \u2013 the virtuoso short story writer\u2019s tricksy first novel",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-21T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>It\u2019s not just generals who make a\u00a0habit of fighting the last war rather than the one at hand; artists do it, too. The novels, films and television shows that best captured the dark paradoxes of the Vietnam War\u00a0for Americans \u2013 <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catch-22.html?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Catch-22</em></a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/apr/15/fiction.kurtvonnegut\" title=\"\"><em>Slaughterhouse 5</em></a> and <em>M*A*S*H</em> \u2013 were set during the second world war or the Korean war. So while David Means\u2019s new novel features characters damaged by and obsessed with \u201cNam\u201d, the unspoken, urgent presences on its pages are the US\u2019s recent conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, or, rather, what they have done to the men and women who fought them.</p> <p>But another war makes itself felt in this novel as well: the struggle between a writer and his times. Means has published <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/nov/27/spot-stories-david-means-review\" title=\"\">four short-story collections</a> and is acknowledged as a master of the form. His great subject is suffering and its transmission, through loneliness, grief and violence. With sentences that seem carved from granite, he depicts, typically, a dark midwestern landscape populated by the forsaken people who once served as the US\u2019s industrial working class, as well as cannon fodder for the architects of the nation\u2019s wars in Asia and the Middle East. Harm and bad luck are their legacy, passed on to strangers, friends and kin.</p> <p>As exquisite as Means\u2019s stories are, their emotional tenor ranges from the grim to the tragic, which on top of the fact that they are short stories, limits their appeal to all but the most stout-hearted readers. Publishers tend to view short-story collections as warm-ups to the inevitable novel, which is why <em>Hystopia</em> has been described more than once as long-awaited. But not every virtuoso of\u00a0one form excels equally at the other, and <em>Hystopia</em> shows the strain of an author pushing to adapt to a form in which he is not at\u00a0home.</p> <p>The novel comes with a lot of metafictional apparatuses. It is framed with editor\u2019s notes and appendices explaining that the main body of the book is the work of a veteran named Eugene Allen. The novel within the novel takes place in an alternative version of the 1970s, one in which <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/john-f-kennedy\" title=\"\">John F Kennedy</a> was not assassinated in 1963, but instead has survived multiple attempts to kill him and has prevailed on the US public to (unconstitutionally) elect him to a third presidential term. In <em>Hystopia</em>, Vietnam grinds on and on at Kennedy\u2019s command and has been stripped of all elements of geopolitical strategy or significance, however misguided or trumped up. The novel is set entirely in the state of Michigan, and while many of its characters are veterans psychologically swamped by the horrors they endured or perpetrated in the war, no one bothers to speak of why. The war simply is. Like, perhaps, life itself, it is a factory for producing trauma, and the management of trauma is what preoccupies every character in <em>Hystopia</em>.</p> <p>A government agency known familiarly as Psych Corps has developed a medicated technique, called \u201cenfolding\u201d, that allows veterans to partition off their memories of horrific events in an inaccessible corner of their brains. They have institutionalised denial. A\u00a0big chunk of Michigan has been set aside for the rehabilitation and reintegration of the \u201cenfolded\u201d, but since the process, when it goes awry, causes the subject to become fantastically violent, other parts of the state have been nearly taken over by \u201cwayward\u201d vets and motorcycle gangs. The novel focuses on two heterosexual couples: a pair of Psych Corps agents assigned to track a psychopathic \u201cfailed enfold\u201d named Rake and two hostages held by Rake in a rural house in the lawless sector of northern Michigan.</p> <p>For the first two thirds of the book, these characters seem mired in a drug-fuelled state of gluey semi-stasis, while all around them the novel sizzles and hisses with proliferating what-is-real palaver reminiscent of the fiction of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/may/06/don-delillo-kid-from-the-bronx-interview-xan-brooks\" title=\"\">Don DeLillo</a> or <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/david-foster-wallace\" title=\"\">David Foster Wallace</a>. Singleton, an enfolded Psych Corps agent, suspects that his assignment might be his boss\u2019s new variation on enfolding: \u201cIf this is some sort of treatment, or if we\u2019re supposed to be thinking this is treatment, he\u2019d want us to be aware that\u00a0we\u2019re aware of our own awareness of the situation.\u201d</p> <p>Can Means himself really care much about this flimsy paranoia and the elaborate conceit of Eugene Allen? It\u2019s as if he feels that the stuff that novels are made of \u2013 multiple storylines, rising and falling cadences of narrative excitement, the construction of a plausibly imagined world \u2013 are merely the extraneous, padded scaffolding erected around a truth, rather than a\u00a0form that truth can take. When he turns, instead, to another character\u2019s beautifully precise observations of the natural world (\u201cThe trees thinned where the rocky berm began, showing shards of slate-colored lake\u201d), the book settles into itself, but to keep things moving forward it must revert to its frantic efforts to wrestle with \u201cbig ideas\u201d. For Means, whose great theme is the starkness and communicability of pain, as well as those flashes of beauty that make it worth bearing, many of the elements required by a novel are superfluous. Like enfolding, they keep us from looking at what he most wants us to see.</p> <p>\u2022 To order <em>Hystopia</em> for \u00a312.99 go to <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/400251/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\">bookshop.theguardian.com</a> or call 0330 333 6846.

But things have changed recently.</p> <p>Last year, the prime minister was the only one of five party leaders to drop out of the Leaders Live debates aimed at the youth vote, hosted by Bite the Ballot before the general election. Yet three weeks before the voter registration deadline for the European Union referendum, Sani got the call from Downing Street, meeting the Cameron with a delegation from Google, Facebook, Twitter and Buzzfeed. </p> <p>Young voters, twice as likely to vote to remain as to vote to leave, are suddenly the voters Cameron needs. As good as it is now to have the prime minister on board, Sani said he was worried it had all come too late. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive element--supporting\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/testing/2016/06/brexit-companion/embed/embed.html?sheet=intermediate&amp;id=conservatives_brexit&amp;format=expandable\" data-alt=\"Brexit explained: Conservatives\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/testing/2016/06/brexit-companion/embed/embed.html?sheet=intermediate&id=conservatives_brexit&format=expandable\">Brexit explained: Conservatives</a> </figure>  <p>\u201cTo be going into No 10, to talk about how you increase voter registration at this stage, it\u2019s like \u2018are you kidding me?\u2019 But you gotta go,\u201d he said. \u201cWould I have put the referendum on the same day as Glastonbury? Has it been thought through? Probably not. But that\u2019s always the way when people are making decisions and not thinking outside their own community. I\u2019m sure they have reasons why it\u2019s on that day, but it feels a bit rushed.\u201d</p> <p>Bite the Ballot, which has a staff of 12, will now push for 500,000 new registrations before the 7 June deadline for the EU referendum, in a campaign called #TurnUp in collaboration with Hope Not Hate, an anti-fascist group which has turned its attention to wider civic engagement. </p> <p>Hope Not Hate\u2019s director Nick Lowles said he had realised that the feelings of alienation that led to the rise of fascist groups were still present despite the demise of the British National party.</p> <p>\u201cPart of the alienation is the feeling that the political process doesn\u2019t support them and now we want to say to people, you can change things, you can punish your MP or your councillor if they aren\u2019t doing stuff that you like,\u201d Lowles said. \u201cI think that\u2019s empowerment; you don\u2019t have to go down the extremist route.\u201d</p> <p>Before starting Bite the Ballot six years ago, Sani, 33, was a business studies teacher in a Dartford comprehensive school. \u201cMy boss turned up to work one day and asked me, three weeks before the general election, \u2018have you decided who you\u2019re going to vote for?\u2019 I said, \u2018I don\u2019t vote. Politics doesn\u2019t affect my life\u2019.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/11/are-you-aged-18-34-how-will-you-vote-eu-referendum\">Are you aged 18-35? How will you vote in the EU referendum?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cAnd he just shot me down, he couldn\u2019t believe it: \u2018You drove here today and politics affects your petrol prices, if your nightclub can have a late licence.\u2019 I couldn\u2019t really believe I\u2019d got to the age of 27 and I didn\u2019t really know this, and I\u2019d worked in two educational establishments and no one is teaching the next generation this.\u201d</p> <p>Sani said he was not driven by a political ideology but by the fundamental inequality of young people being excluded from the political debate. \u201cKnowledge is power, and some people are educated about how the country is run and some people are not,\u201d he said. \u201cYoung people are just seen as consumers, not citizens.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think most people even know what a political ideology is. Why should they? You don\u2019t just automatically pick this stuff up. It\u2019s a typical British blame culture of how it\u2019s your fault if you don\u2019t know.\u201d</p> <p>Bite the Ballot began as a lunchtime club for Sani\u2019s students but he decided after a year to quit teaching and devote himself to the cause full time. </p> <p>In 2012, the group held its first voter registration rally at the Ministry of Sound for the London mayoral elections and it created the UK\u2019s first national voter registration day in 2014. On the first anniversary of the drive, three months before the UK general election, almost half a million people registered over the course of a week. </p> <p>It was a world record, the most successful registration drive in any western democracy per capita, and the group\u2019s achievement was hailed by Barack Obama in his address to 500 young leaders in London last month.</p> <p>Sani said he believed Bite the Ballot was seen as more of a nuisance than a help before the referendum and relations were at a low ebb after Cameron pulled out of the Leaders Live debate. </p> <p>\u201cThey dragged it along and along, and we had an email chain for so long,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then they pulled the plug and said they wouldn\u2019t do it, nine months after. All of us involved, everyone said \u2018we need to say that that\u2019s not on\u2019. So we launched this social media attack.\u201d</p> <p>That response, he says now, was probably \u201ctoo emotional\u201d and Sani said he had learned to adapt his behaviour now the campaign had the ear of government. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t change it but it was a learning curve for us,\u201d he said. \u201cJust because we are small, we are not afraid to spotlight when things are not done right. </p> <p>\u201cI think in the lifecycle of Bite the Ballot, there have been times we\u2019ve just been very vocal, but then there have to be times where you check in with yourself and think, \u2018right, OK, people are listening now, let\u2019s evolve\u2019.\u201d</p> <p>The blame was not entirely with politicians and educators for low voter turnout, Sani said. Young people who want to fight for issues that matter to this generation, such as better mental health care, opposing university fees or de-colonising their curriculums, have to take their fight to the polling booth, too.</p> <p> \u201cThis is an active generation, speaking out particularly on issues like mental health,\u201d he said. \u201cYoung people do have to know that the world doesn\u2019t owe it to them if they don\u2019t step up.</p> <p>\u201cMy point would be to students: you\u2019re not registered in enough numbers to be taken seriously. Time was spent organising rallies, not enough on making sure every single student was registered to vote. Why did fees come in? It came down to the fact politicians knew students wouldn\u2019t punish them at the ballot box.\u201d</p> <p>Once the registration deadline is passed, Sani and Lowles both want to turn their attention to education. \u201c[Education secretary] Nicky Morgan came out and said very recently how important it was for young people to vote and get involved and use your rights. And it\u2019s like, \u2018yeah, well done\u2019. </p> <p>\u201cNicky Morgan has actually got the power to ensure they do. Change the education system. Let\u2019s make sure there\u2019s a good, engaging political education for everyone, rather than just allowing politics to be done to them.\u201d</p>",

      "headline": "A rental market that\u2019s more hellish than London",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-21T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>In the summer of 2013 my job at an advertising agency in London was transferred to New York. I was excited; who wouldn\u2019t grab the opportunity to work in one of the world\u2019s most exciting cities? What\u2019s more, for a short period my company even paid for an apartment for myself and a colleague while we explored different neighbourhoods and found our own place to stay.</p> <p>When the time came to navigate my way through New York\u2019s real estate market, however, I was shocked to be confronted with prices and practices even London\u2019s letting agents would shy away from.</p> <p>I had previously lived in four different flats and house shares in and around King\u2019s Cross and Angel over a period of six years. My last flat was on a Camden council estate and was a two-bed converted into a three bed, for which I was paying \u00a3550 a month before bills.</p> <p>I thought the capital\u2019s rental market was fast and aggressive \u2013 decisions had to be made on the spot and deposits paid quickly in order to secure a place. But that was before I moved to New York. Compared to London it felt like the wild west: I was shown apartments that didn\u2019t seem legal or safe, usually by agents who were utterly clueless.</p> <p>Learning the jargon was the first hurdle. When I arrived I had no idea what \u201cpre-war\u201d or \u201crail-road\u201d meant. Pre-war sounds classy; you imagine big parlours and arches \u2013 but in reality it means a large room split up to cram in more people. This means one of you will have a sunlit bedroom but the other gets a tiny room with no windows. We saw several pre-war apartments. Some landlords, in an effort to improve the second room, had added a window \u2026 looking into another room \u2013 not ideal for privacy.</p> <p>Rail-road style apartments are worse. There is no corridor. Instead, one room leads directly into the next, the ones in the middle having two doors. That means walking through your roommate\u2019s bedroom every time you need to use the bathroom or leave the house.</p> <p>And if an advert does not have \u201ctwo true bedrooms\u201d then prepare for the worst. In London two bedrooms means two bedrooms, each with four walls, a window and a door. I wasted so much time in New York being shown apartments where one of the rooms was in fact a corridor. Or have a window looking into the living room, or no window at all. Sometimes it would be no more than a glorified closet.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In New York, landlords request evidence that you earn more than 40 times the monthly rent ... I wasn\u2019t even close</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I learned that \u201cwalk-up\u201d is also something to be wary of. It means no elevator, and stairs are no fun if you live in a high rise and have heavy shopping bags or a pile of laundry \u2013 New Yorkers don\u2019t have washing machines in their homes. All this is before you even start thinking about the hassle of moving furniture in or out. I discovered that if an agency had taken professional photos, this usually meant something was wrong with the flat and they could not get it rented.</p> <p>Eventually we found a place, and once we agreed to take it we were whisked to an office and told to put in an application. This could only be completed if we could give them a cheque for the first and last month\u2019s rent, and our guarantor\u2019s bank statement.</p> <p>In New York the standard is for landlords to request evidence that you earn more than 40 times the monthly rent to prove you can comfortably afford it. I wasn\u2019t even close. No one outside the US is allowed to be a guarantor, so I had to ask our company\u2019s vice president to be mine.</p> <p>There was no guarantee our application would be successful \u2013 multiple applications are accepted at once and you cannot be sure you will get back all of your money if you are unsuccessful. Although the deposit and rent are returned if you don\u2019t secure the apartment, most realtors will keep some of the money to cover their admin charges, including the cost of background checks. I doubt very much that the background checks were even carried out.</p> <p>In London I was accustomed to forking out the first month\u2019s rent, a deposit and an admin fee. In New York you can expect to pay a fee of around $2,000 for an average room or cheap studio \u2013 essentially their commission as they charge 12%-15% of the yearly rent. There are also additional admin fees: agents will usually charge you a $75 application fee for every person on the lease, including guarantors. So two people moving in together, with a guarantor each, results in a $300 fee. A fellow New Yorker told me that \u2013 depending on the rent \u2013 you should have $5,000-$10,000 to hand in order to cover the costs of the agent, the first month\u2019s rent, the deposit and the moving company. In London I had a better understanding of what fees I would have to pay and what those fees covered.</p> <p>Infuriatingly, you also have to work to the agent\u2019s time, not your own busy schedule. New York letting agents are paid for by the tenant rather the landlord, but in spite of this they do not fit in around the schedule of a 9-5 working adult. In London, most flat viewing appointments would be made in the evenings or at weekends. In New York you have to work around their schedule and take time away from your job because agents only work 9-5 Monday to Friday.</p> <p>Numerous agents also show the same apartment. But who has the keys and is the real representative? You\u2019ve no idea. I visited apartments where the agent picked up the keys from the neighbours or the deli downstairs, and in many cases the keys could not be located. That\u2019s because the agents themselves found the properties online and they are not exclusive to them. In fact, the agents would often see the apartment for the first time when showing me around, and had zero prior knowledge of it.</p> <p>Fortunately, for my second apartment I was able to cut out the agents \u2013 I moved into a room which my friend had been letting. She was paying incredibly low rent for New York as her roommate was friends with the landlord. That girl then moved on herself, and I used a flatsharing site, SpareRoom, to find someone to replace her.</p> <p>Both my apartments in New York have been in Manhattan and have felt very central, and if I wanted I could have found apartments further out that were cheaper. So I\u2019m paying $1,100 (\u00a3768) a month for a room in a two-bed apartment with a living room, compared with the \u00a3550 in London, although that would be higher now. And notice how I didn\u2019t say \u201ctwo true bedrooms\u201d?

      "body": "<p>Some of the music industry\u2019s leading players are demanding that ticket touting be made a criminal offence for all UK concerts, plays and sporting events, Guardian Money can reveal.</p> <p>The calls for ministers to take action come on the eve of the publication of a government-commissioned review of the secondary ticket market, which is dominated by four players: Seatwave, Viagogo, Get Me In and StubHub.</p> <p>The review has been looking at <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/review-of-consumer-protection-measures-applying-to-ticket-resale-call-for-evidence\" title=\"\">whether consumers are sufficiently protected by legislation</a> introduced last year, amid claims that ticket resale websites are flouting the rules. The panel is due to issue its findings next week.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/may/15/shady-world-of-the-ticket-touts\">How the ticket touts get away with bleeding fans dry</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the wake of a growing outcry over the reselling of tickets at vastly inflated prices \u2013 in February it emerged that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/27/adele-ticket-resale-prices\" title=\"\">seats at Adele\u2019s London shows were being offered for sale for up to \u00a324,000</a> each \u2013 an <a href=\"https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/128969\" title=\"\">anti-touting petition</a> launched about three weeks ago has amassed 38,500 signatures after winning the backing of stars including Mumford &amp; Sons, Little Mix, and Florence + the Machine. One idea gaining support is for the UK to copy <a href=\"http://www.stadiums.qld.gov.au/Policies/Ticket-Scalping.aspx\" title=\"\">Queensland in Australia</a> by banning people from selling on tickets for more than 10% above the original price. The idea of such a cap on resale prices was first floated in 2011 by Labour MP Sharon Hodgson, who is co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on ticket abuse.</p> <p>In recent years there has been an explosion in the number of so-called bedroom touts, many of whom use software known as \u201cbots\u201d that automatically sweep up huge numbers of tickets the moment they go on sale. They then resell them via secondary market websites. These market themselves as a safe, easy way for fans to buy and sell, but, say some critics, are merely a hi-tech version of the old-fashioned street tout.</p> <p>In February 2015, in the face of a growing clamour for action, the government reluctantly agreed to change the law. New rules in the Consumer Rights Act 2015 require anyone reselling tickets via a secondary market website to provide details of the block, row and, crucially, seat number, as well as the face value and information about any restrictions. It was hoped these rules would deal a major blow to touts because disclosing the seat number means promoters and venues can, in theory, log on to a secondary market site, check who bought a ticket being sold for profit, and cancel it. But campaigners and consumer bodies such as Which? claim the websites are <a href=\"http://www.which.co.uk/news/2015/11/which-probes-ticket-resale-rip-off-422307/\" title=\"\">failing to ensure that the required information is provided when people list tickets for sale</a>.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Touting is illegal in football. Touting was made illegal when the Olympics hit the UK. The government needs to intervene</p> <footer> <cite>Adam Tudhope</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Adam Tudhope, whose management company represents Mumford &amp; Sons, Laura Marling and Keane, told Money: \u201cTouting is illegal in football. Touting was made illegal when the Olympics hit the UK. The government needs to intervene and make touting a criminal offence for all music, arts, theatre and sporting events. The existing civil legislation isn\u2019t doing the job.\u201d</p> <p>He adds: \u201cIf we had a blanket law that tickets can only be resold for their face value, plus a small handling fee along the lines that the primary ticketing services use \u2013 no more than 10% of the face value, for example \u2013 it would stop the large-scale industrial touting of tickets dead in its tracks.\u201dThe idea of a 10% cap on resale prices was first floated in 2011 by Labour MP Sharon Hodgson, who is co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on ticket abuse. She said that despite the legislation introduced last year, \u201cfans are still being ripped off\u201d, adding: \u201cThe public outcry to the failure to enforce the Act is clear from the many tens of thousands of people who have signed the online petition on the parliament website calling for this very fact to be addressed.\u201d</p> <p>Hodgson\u2019s proposal was based on what happens in Queensland, where since December 2006 it has been an offence to sell or buy tickets to events at nine major venues for more than 10% above the original price. The venues include the Suncorp Stadium in Brisbane, which last year played hosts to acts including Foo Fighters and Ed Sheeran, and the Brisbane Entertainment Centre, where Madonna performed two shows in March and Little Mix played earlier this month.</p> <p>The 10% cap means that if and when Adele decides to take her world tour to Queensland there would probably be no repeat there of what happened in the UK, where some resale websites were offering seats for her arena dates for 290 times their face value.</p> <p>Queensland police are responsible for enforcing the legislation and can issue on-the-spot fines. Sellers of \u201cscalped\u201d tickets face a maximum fine of AU$2,356 (\u00a31,200) while buyers face a maximum fine of AU$589 (\u00a3300) \u2013 however, it is not clear what impact the legislation has had.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/mar/21/online-ticket-fraud-social-media-users-warned-twitter-facebook-get-safe-online\">Social media users warned over rise in online ticket fraud</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hodgson chose the 10% figure in order to restrict the amount of profit that people could make, while at the same time ensuring the original buyer was able to recoup any fees and costs, such as paying for the ticket to be sent to someone else. The petition, generated by online fan-to-fan ticket exchange Twickets and sponsored by Adam Tudhope, calls on the government to enforce the act, and to go further by forcing ticket resellers to reveal their identities, and by bringing in tougher sanctions for resale websites that do not comply.</p> <p>In October, the UK government announced an independent review of how the secondary ticket market is working. The review panel, chaired by Professor Michael Waterson, is due to publish its conclusions and recommendations by 26 May. Those worried that the government may decide to resist a tightening of the rules point to the fact that business secretary Sajid Javid, whose department is leading on this issue, has previously spoken out in support of ticket touts, saying they \u201cact like classic entrepreneurs because they fill a gap in the market that they have identified\u201d. Some campaigners have also expressed concern that one of the Department for Culture, Media &amp; Sport\u2019s non-executive directors (senior business figures from outside the department) is Ajay Chowdhury, who until 18 months ago was chief executive of Seatwave.</p> <p>The resale websites say they rely on sellers to provide accurate information and comply with the law. They say they make it very clear to sellers what their obligations are, but it is possible that they do not always have confirmation of the row and seat number at the time of listing.</p>",

      "body": "<p>I\u2019m a firm believer that everything happens for a reason and the current climate in education is no exception. We\u2019ve all read the headlines: Sats stress made children cry, teachers are quitting in droves, forced academisation against our wills \u2013 and so it goes on. The danger is that we teachers feed off the media and get so caught up in the outcry that we fail to maintain a sensible \u2013 or even professional \u2013 perspective.<br /></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>No politician takes on educational reform with the sole purpose of eroding a workforce or destroying self-esteem</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>For me, it started with articles appearing on Facebook. When the first headlines emerged, it felt like the tone of the national media had begun to shift from teacher-bashing to recognising the difficulties our profession faces. I liked and shared posts with gusto. Sympathetic comments and supportive words of encouragement from the online community fuelled an acceleration in awareness-raising.</p> <p>Before I knew it, my newsfeed was full of posts, from disillusioned-teacher blogs to open letters and hyped-up articles of outrage at the latest incompetence from the Department for Education (DfE). With each new directive, the air in the staffroom turned blue.</p> <p>Somewhere in all of this, negativity quickly became the norm. It\u2019s far easier to fight against an oppressive regime than be the lone voice defending it. Just to be clear, I don\u2019t defend many of the recent policy and curriculum changes, nor the way they have been implemented without sufficient consultation or preparation. But what I do defend are the motives behind them. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2016/apr/02/secret-teacher-refuse-negativity-teaching-bring-down\">Secret Teacher: I refuse to let the negativity in teaching bring me down</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When it comes to the bigger picture, I honestly think policymakers\u2019 hearts are in the right place. Providing a world-class education for our children, raising standards, improving outcomes for children from disadvantaged families and fairer funding are not objectionable aims. No politician takes on educational reform with the sole purpose of eroding a workforce or destroying children\u2019s self-esteem.</p> <p>We are inevitably going to be resistant to the upheaval of change \u2013 even if it is for the better \u2013 because our plates are already so full. But as teachers, we also know better than anyone that the best of intentions are quickly usurped. We\u2019re in the job for all the right reasons and have big ideas about the utopian classroom we would like \u2013 achieving academic success through inspired and creative means. Yet many of us probably feel we fall short every day. I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not the only one who, in times of stress, has resorted to dictatorial rule I later regretted. Perhaps one day the DfE will feel the same.</p> <p>And you know what? I like the new primary maths curriculum. Yes, it\u2019s harder, but you can\u2019t raise standards without having higher expectations. I like the focus on reasoning and the \u201cdepth over breadth\u201d focus. I even like the early introduction of algebra and so do lots of my year 6s. I don\u2019t like the spelling, punctuation and grammar (Spag) so much, but we\u2019ve found ways to teach it without anyone handing in their notice.</p> <p>I walked into a year 6 class recently during a timetabled art lesson to find the teacher running an extra Spag-revision session. The children had (only slightly) reluctantly accepted this as a pre-Sats measure and had been promised extra art lessons the week after. It struck me that if 10- and 11-year-olds could see this as a reasonable adjustment to meet a deadline, we were preparing them for the reality of later life and the choices we sometimes have to make.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Self-pitying blogs and political rants, however cathartic, do not help the fragile wellbeing of our workforce</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Of course, the DfE has to take some responsibility for our current negativity. I\u2019m sure that if teachers had been better prepared for changes in standards and assessment, with clear guidance and training for a gradual and manageable introduction, we would have been far better equipped to ensure they were successful. And if reforms hadn\u2019t accompanied a shift in Ofsted criteria, a void in information about assessment, threats of academisation and the introduction of performance-related pay we would have been able to maintain a healthy and rational perspective. </p> <p>But I also realised that self-pitying blogs and political rants, however cathartic, do not help the fragile wellbeing of our workforce. Rather it relies on the support we give each other to succeed \u2013 harnessing our resources, focusing on the bigger picture and not losing sight of the children\u2019s best interests.</p> <p>Take testing as an example. It has both positive and negative effects. It\u2019s time that could be spent teaching, it can put children under pressure and some would argue it doesn\u2019t tell us anything we wouldn\u2019t already know. But it\u2019s also right that teachers are held accountable for the education they deliver, that children learn to persevere and be resilient with things they find tricky, and that our expectations of learning are high. </p> <p>And we can choose how it works. There is no requirement to do endless class tests, nor to administer the Sats to any child clearly working below the expected level. There is no requirement to test in every subject or every year group, or to increase the time spent on core subjects at the expense of a balanced curriculum. It\u2019s often schools who convince themselves such measures are necessary; we\u2019ve lost sight of the bigger picture.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2015/apr/04/secret-teacher-best-jobs-world-moaning\">Secret Teacher: we have one of the best jobs in the world, so stop moaning</a> </p> </aside>  <p>A change of approach might be enough to circumnavigate the destructive spiral we talk ourselves into. If \u201cWhy do we have to do this?\u201d becomes \u201cHow might the children benefit from this?\u201d, we could get more constructive responses. The prospect of becoming an academy might be terrifying \u2013 or an exciting venture into new territory. </p> <p>We may feel we are fighting against changes we wouldn\u2019t have chosen. But a lot of the power to decide how we implement them is in our hands. Positive. Mental. Attitude.

      "body": "<p><strong>I know there\u2019s been no shortage of complaints about Goldcar car rental, but I had an experience with them in Nice airport last week that I thought would be interesting to your readers. </strong></p> <p><strong>My flight was delayed, so when I arrived at Goldcar the office was closing. I called from the terminal and the agent agreed to wait for me. After we spent about 10 minutes filling in the paperwork, the agent suddenly announced that I must take excess insurance for \u20ac65 (\u00a350). If I chose not to take this optional extra he would, in his words, not have time to rent me a car and I would have to return in the morning. I queried this and he raised his voice, stood up and become quite threatening. He told me to leave the office as he was now closing. </strong></p> <p><strong>By this point it was nearly 11pm, I was in an unknown part of town and was painfully aware that I would be sleeping rough if I did not comply, so I had to sign. The experience left me shaken. </strong></p> <p><strong>When I had booked the car, the CarTrawler site said the hire location was five minutes from the airport terminal using the free shuttle service. What it doesn\u2019t say is that the shuttle only runs until 7pm. Any customers arriving after this must take a \u20ac25 taxi. </strong></p> <p><strong>I contacted CarTrawler within the hour. Its representative suggested it might refund my taxi (if I could present a receipt, which I hadn\u2019t got, given the pressure to get to the agent before he shut), but said that, once the insurance was signed, it was a legal document and could not be disputed. </strong></p> <p><strong>On the advice of Guardian Money, I had taken out hire excess insurance from a third party, so I was forced to buy insurance I didn\u2019t want or need. </strong><em>JC, London</em></p> <p>By happy, or unhappy, coincidence, Juan Carlos Azcona, the chief executive of Goldcar, came into the Guardian last week to explain how his company has changed, and how he is on a mission to make these sorts of stories a thing of the past. Goldcar has been the subject of some horror stories, in this and other newspapers\u2019 money sections, and at one stage we warned consumers to avoid the company.</p> <p>So what, if anything, has changed and is it time to review our advice given that it\u2019s quite hard to avoid the company in Europe?</p> <p>Azcona says staff will continue to earn commission from selling extra insurance but was clear that they will also be judged and rewarded for having happy customers. Goldcar is introducing self-service terminals at its busiest locations and, he says, a host of other improvements. He suggests UK buyers should book using the company website, as customers that do tend to have much higher satisfaction scores because they aren\u2019t given wrong information by broker websites.</p> <p>Naturally we asked him about this case too. Having looked into the matter, he said the branch had told his office that, rather than impose the after-hours fee of \u20ac40, it had offered you the extra insurance instead.</p> <p>Happily between Goldcar and CarTrawler, you have been refunded the \u20ac25 taxi fare and the \u20ac65 that the extra insurance cost. Goldcar has confirmed that, contrary to your information, the bus service does run until 10pm when the office closes.</p> <p>Readers who use Goldcar will no doubt want to say how their rentals went. We\u2019ll report back at the end of the summer, when our postbag usually swells with car hire complaints.</p> <p><strong>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-21T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>The Douro river is wild and tamed, fertile, rich and dust poor. She is the heart, soul and life force of the region she gives her name to. For 900km, from central Spain to Atlantic Porto, she pushes and runs, fat, green, inexorable. The Douro region is about the size of Suffolk but, unlike East Anglia, has barely a metre of flat ground. Instead, dizzying mountain slopes are creased and folded and combed with the millions of vines that make those juicy Douro table wines and its celebrated ports.</p> <p>Visitors have been welcomed here for centuries but it\u2019s taken until just now for the Dourense region to cotton on to eno-tourism, that happy marriage between travel and tippling. Though frequented mostly by cashmere-and-smart-slacks travellers, the Douro is also a fine destination for the thirsty but thrifty.</p> <p>Getting to the region can be fun. There are hotel boats from Porto, but these seem mostly to be witless, Duplo-like affairs into which you\u2019re tightly packaged and drably excursioned. It\u2019s better by far to take the train to Pocinho. This is one of the world\u2019s great train rides and, once away from Porto\u2019s concrete suburbs, offers twisting, sighing, soaring riverine views for much of its three-hour route.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/travel_portugal_web/giv-125154zsCjsHLaWNC/\" data-alt=\"Douro map.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/travel_portugal_web/giv-125154zsCjsHLaWNC/\">Douro map.</a> </figure>  <p>The bus network form here on is sketchy; to get the most out of your visit, you\u2019ll need a car from Pocinho. But be warned: these roads are for confident drivers only. They are intestinally curly. Climbs are crazily steep. Cliffs must be tightly hugged and other vehicles may well be kissed. Safety barriers seem anathema. Most roads are breathe-in thin. Heroic cyclists with Hoy-like thighs might enjoy the suffering these roads provide.</p> <p>Millions of hot, tough hours of manual work have gone into terracing and training these great hills of schist into vineyards. Neat terraces corrugate every horizon, rows and stairs intricate as cornrows, maps with living contours. The visual effect is mesmerising even before the first drinking \u2013 sorry, tasting \u2013 session of Douro wines. And, like the river beneath you, these sessions sail along smoothly to begin with. Until you get into those seductive ports.</p> <p>There are three parts to this wine region. Baixo Corgo is westernmost and mostly produces ports to be drunk young. Its main town is Peso da R\u00e9gua, commonly known as R\u00e9gua.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"792ec28531646bcd8daad1652711e7f02f8a2228\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/792ec28531646bcd8daad1652711e7f02f8a2228/0_0_3413_5120/667.jpg\" alt=\"Aerial view of vineyard terraces and the Douro river in the Alto Douro region\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Aerial view of vineyard terraces and the Douro river in the Alto Douro region.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alex Robinson/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The posh section of the Douro is Cima Corgo, whose classy <em>quintas</em> are run by a manicured handful of intermarried wine dynasties, often with British and Dutch names and/or branches on their French-polished family trees. Even here, though, visitors who stray one vineyard away from the main routes will boggle most locals simply by being foreign. Cobbly, sleepy Pinh\u00e3o with its gorgeous blue-tiled station, is at Cima\u2019s centre. Then, closest to the Spanish border, is Douro Superior, the largest area, which is mostly national park. It also has the fewest people: the only town of any size is Vila Nova de Foz C\u00f4a, home to 3,300 people.</p> <p>The Douro is perfect for a long weekend, especially when tacked on to a stay in Porto. But beware: the wiggly roads mean distances that look tiddly on the map can take hours to negotiate. Talking of tiddly, in Baixo Corgo I aim straight for R\u00e9gua and the wine hotel at <a href=\"http://www.quintadovallado.com/wine-hotel/161/wine-hotel/en/\">Quinta do Vallado</a> (doubles from \u20ac100 including cycle hire), with its 13 cool and light rooms and (hurray!) all-day wine tastings and bibulous visits to their renowned winery. R\u00e9gua isn\u2019t immediately beautiful but has a light and bustling riverfront vibe and the <a href=\"http://www.museudodouro.pt/\">Douro Museum</a> on Rua Marqu\u00eas de Pombal, where \u20ac7.50 buys me entrance and a schooner of port. The museum also provides intensive wine tastings for the unwary and unwise visitor.</p> <p>Now needing a sugar hit, outside the train station I spot two aproned ladies with wicker baskets selling paper-twisted <em>rebu\u00e7adas</em>, the Douro version of barley sugar. These fuel my two-minute dignified stagger down Avenida Jos\u00e9 Vasques Os\u00f3rio to <a href=\"http://www.castasepratos.com/\">Castas e Pratos</a> (+351 254 323 290). It\u2019s a young-ish and stylish food and drinks hangout in an upcycled railway shed. As everywhere in the region, its wine list is exciting and affordable (three courses from \u20ac30).</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5e437ab605407d8dab2944079e36bcbd01a82f65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5e437ab605407d8dab2944079e36bcbd01a82f65/0_10_2048_1229/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Castas e Pratos in Peso da R\u00e9gua\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Castas e Pratos in Peso da R\u00e9gua</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But I\u2019m feeling more dishevelled than chic, so lunch instead at the down-home A Velha Tendinha (around \u20ac15 a head, Largo 25 de Abril, +351 254 318 160). It\u2019s a wonderful almost-riverfront grill joint, and my octopus <em>grelhado</em> is a charry tangle of spectacular tentacles. The rest of the day is spent traversing the sheer breadth of wine styles produced by the Douro\u2019s sheer slopes.</p> <p>Cima Corgo is the most-visited part of the region. Across the river from Pinh\u00e3o, is <a href=\"http://eng.sograpevinhos.com/regioes/Douro/locais/Quinta%20do%20Seixo\">Quinta do Seixo</a>, where the huge Sandeman winery does the region\u2019s slickest tours (from \u20ac6pp) at its grand quinta. Lu\u00eds Sottomayor is Sandeman\u2019s head winemaker \u2013 fiftyish, wiry and tanned. After an in-depth \u201ctasting\u201d session, he points me back to Pinh\u00e3o to experience Qualifer (45 Rua Ant\u00f3nio Manuel Saraiva, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/qualifer\">on Facebook</a>). This is a tiny <em>fumeiro</em> (smokery) where butcher Fernando \u2013 part black-clad ninja, part conjuror, part psychologist, part naturopath \u2013 retails a magical selection of fresh and smoked meats, plus his own-baked bread, local cheeses and his daughter\u2019s jams. From these, I assemble the picnic hamper of champions and head for the Chapel of S\u00e3o Salvador do Mundo (off EN222-3), near S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o da Pesqueira, a <em>miradouro</em> (viewpoint) that makes the heart soar like the Bonelli\u2019s eagles wheeling below. Luis\u2019s other miradouro tip is a stunner as well. S\u00e3o Leonardo de Galafura, high above R\u00e9gua, also has an in-season cafe that serves excellent and sustaining snacks and lunches.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7e4612b1f62c55c482f309da76a990c4f9f41ae6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7e4612b1f62c55c482f309da76a990c4f9f41ae6/0_151_4000_2399/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pinh\u00e3o railway station, with its traditional blue-tiled walls.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pinh\u00e3o railway station, with its traditional blue-tiled walls.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Five of the leading new-wave Douro winemakers have banded together as the <a href=\"http://www.douroboys.com/\">Douro Boys</a>. One of these is the eccentric, inspired <a href=\"http://www.niepoort-vinhos.com/en/\">Dirk Niepoort</a> , whose family have been winemakers since 1842. Dirk\u2019s wines \u2013 both table and fortified \u2013 are always intriguing and enlightening. Wine has been made at his Quinta de N\u00e1poles at Santo Adri\u00e3o since the 15th century. Today, you taste in a secret subterranean cellar (book ahead on +351 254 855 436, no charge). Over a tasting where I completely forget to spit, Dirk explains how the Douro\u2019s schist rock forces the vine\u2019s roots to thrust deep to establish themselves, creating more flavour intensity in the tens of local \u201cfield\u201d varieties that go into his blends. My favourite grape is <em>sous\u00e3o</em>, which pretty much sums up my situation by lunch. This is taken at local posh restaurant <a href=\"http://ruipaula.com/web/doc-en/presentation/?lang=en\">DOC</a> (222 Estrada Nacional, +351 254 858 123), built like a gin palace over the river at Folgosa. Note to self: port at lunch, all at sea all afternoon.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f5476bfd43eeb1a37a5799a52e4def60991ab5af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f5476bfd43eeb1a37a5799a52e4def60991ab5af/73_102_1939_1163/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Posh nosh at DOC restaurant, the Douro\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Posh nosh at DOC restaurant</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On 25-26 June this year, the Douro Boys will hold their annual <a href=\"http://www.douroboys.com/news/feira-do-douro-25-26-june\">Feira do Douro</a>, this year at <a href=\"http://www.niepoort-vinhos.com/en/\">Niepoort</a>, where \u20ac10 buys you entrance (and a free Riedel glass) plus tastings (natch) and a farmers\u2019 market.</p> <p>Dinner is at Dirk\u2019s \u201csecret\u201d tip: 16-seat Papas Zaide (1 Largo de Pra\u00e7a, +351 254 731 899), snoozing in the pretty hill village of Provesende. Here you eat olives dipped in honey (weird, but great), sheep\u2019s cheese and great knuckles of melting meat, tinkling the goat bell on your table for cook Gra\u00e7a to bring \u2013 yes! \u2013 more wine. In the square below is the never-modernised 1940s Fatima bakery, where craft baker Antonio Jos\u00e9 bakes only 180 impeccable sourdough loaves a day. Like me, they\u2019re gone by lunchtime. In the same square is the bonkers Caf\u00e9 Arado (no phone, opening hours erratic), a winery, bar, craft shop and farm-implement museum.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"f54a7e847e3245392abd7a1bda6e60dc38f6b9c4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f54a7e847e3245392abd7a1bda6e60dc38f6b9c4/0_301_5596_3358/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Douro Boys.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Douro Boys</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Also in Provesende is the charming, simple, self-catering <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/quintacostacima\">Quinta da Costa</a> (doubles from \u20ac65, +351 917 985 956). Alternatively, at river level, there\u2019s the grand <a href=\"http://quintadocrasto.pt/\">Quinta do Crasto</a> (one-night stays only, from \u20ac140 a night, +351 934 920 024), with four rooms above the winery. One eats, drinks and swims in elegant aristo splendour here.</p> <p>There are loads of river excursions offered in both R\u00e9gua and Pinh\u00e3o. Most are in the now-motorised vessels that once carried port \u201cpipes\u201d (barrels) down to Porto for maturing. To feel less of a tourist, book a trip on <a href=\"http://pipadouro.pt/\">Pipadouro</a> (from \u20ac35, +351 939 196 262) which runs two beautifully restored 1950s wooden launches from the pier at Pinh\u00e3o. The larger was an admiral\u2019s boat, now bookable for a cosseted night\u2019s stay aboard. Drinks flow on board until I no longer know my port from my starboard.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a1889335b4362868d774795387bb25bd0df41ee9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a1889335b4362868d774795387bb25bd0df41ee9/0_102_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sampling wine at the annual Feira do Douro.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sampling wine at the annual Feira do Douro</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Back in Pinh\u00e3o, <a href=\"https://www.symington.com/\">Quinta de Bonfim</a> (+351 254 730 370) has just started offering guided tours, tastings and charming, bowered vineyard lunches. Here, Joe Alvares Ribeiro \u2013 chiselled jaw, clean chinos, ineffable charm \u2013 gently insists that I swing up to the two-street town of Favaios, where moscatel wines are made. The lovely, small Museum of Bread and Wine is on Rua Direita, where the \u20ac1.50 entry also scores a tumbler of sweet moscatel that smooths out any wrinkles remaining in my morning. About 800 metres out of town, at Alto da Portela, an anonymous, ugly modern house with a car park on the right is Padaria Queir\u00f3s (+351 259 949 514), where Fernanda and her two cousins bake good bread and a stupendous <em>bolo de carne</em>, which is what every meat pie wants to be when it grows up. They\u2019re hot out of the oven around noon.</p> <p>And so to wilder, empty Douro Superior. Unlike Cima, Superior has little traffic, though its roads are hardly less tortuous. I drive up to the dog-and-donkey village of Parambos near Carrazeda de Ans\u00ed\u00e4es, where svelte, sprite-like Puri at <a href=\"http://www.docesdapuri.com/pt\">Doces da Puri </a> (30 Beco de Jaime) produces extraordinary jams, cookies and pastes in her 300-year-old, low-beamed kitchen. The fruit comes from her heavenly organic garden next door and her tomato-and-port preserve deserves a DOC status of its own. Puri\u2019s generosity and energy are matchless. After a glass of something lovely, she directs me to Taberna da Helena (Avenida Aquilino Ribeira \u2013 below the church in Carrazeda) for a sit-down with a platter of chops and a mountain of chips in company with local cattle farmers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"7752c5f3400e0f8afc57235e41043e5b833d9fa8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7752c5f3400e0f8afc57235e41043e5b833d9fa8/615_0_2952_1772/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Niepoort\u2019s Quinta de N\u00e1poles with view over the vineyard.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Niepoort\u2019s Quinta de N\u00e1poles</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Forty minutes from here, I pause in the sturdy medieval hill town of Torre de Moncorvo, where my rewards include a bag of warm sugar-crunched almonds from a shop opposite the church. Near Vila Nova de Foz C\u00f4a, <a href=\"http://www.arte-coa.pt/index.php?Language=pt&amp;Page=Museu&amp;SubPage=Edificio\">Museu do C\u00f4a</a> sweetly interprets the area\u2019s thousand examples of Paleolithic rock art. A bookable, guided three-hour dusk/night tour of the art in the valley below is a snip at \u20ac17.</p> <p>Outside Foz, a small and unlikely turning takes me down (and, worryingly, further down) a steep, twisty, schisty track. My trust is rewarded when it delivers me to <a href=\"http://www.quintadovallado.com/wine-hotel/367/accommodations/en/\">Casa do Rio</a> (from \u20ac190 a night B&amp;B/wine-hotel) where dynamic Douro Boy Jo\u00e3o Ribeiro of Quinta do Vallado has built a bridge over a dip in his vineyard, and on it a wooden hotel of six pale, sexy rooms. Here I join what feels like the Douro\u2019s most chic house party: Danish rosewood, hanging Cocoon fires, an orchestra of crickets, no neighbours for miles, an infinity pool amid the vines, and the Douro below \u2013 peaceful and long, strong and unique.</p> <h2><strong>Kevin\u2019s top tips</strong></h2> <p>\u2022 <strong>Best for picnics</strong> The miradouro at S\u00e3o Leonardo da Galafura, above R\u00e9gua<br />\u2022 <strong>Hidden gem</strong> Casa do Rio wine hotel near Foz de C\u00f4a<br />\u2022 <strong>Best tasting</strong> Niepoort wines and ports at Quinta do Napol\u00e9s</p> <p>\u2022 <em>Trains run from Porto to Pocinho (\u20ac13 each way each way, </em><a href=\"http://www.cp.pt/passageiros/en/\"><em>cp.pt</em></a><em>); the really pretty bit starts at R\u00e9gua.

      "body": "<h2>I\u2019m worried a bad job interview is going to count against me in future</h2> <p><strong>I am in my 50s, work in a niche market overseas and am looking for a new job in the same field.\u00a0I recently had an interview for an excellent post a long way from home. I was very well qualified for the position, have all the necessary experience and did well in the assessments. Unfortunately, the logistics of taking the job, coupled with insufficient preparation, flummoxed me\u00a0on the day and I totally lost confidence and performed very poorly in the interview itself.</strong></p> <p><strong>I feel I let myself down and that I possibly showed a lack of respect in performing so badly.</strong></p> <p><strong>My real worry now, looking back on the whole sorry experience, is that it could be held against me in future. As I say, I work in a niche market which is quite a close-knit working community. </strong></p> <p><strong>Could I credibly apply for a post at the same institution again? Is it just a matter of live and learn and put it down to experience and try again? In short, how should I handle it?</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>I wish I knew why and how \u201cthe logistics of taking the job\u201d managed to flummox you so badly. But I assume that this was uncharacteristic behaviour on your part and that you don\u2019t easily fall apart when under slight stress.</p> <p>That being so, I think you\u2019re overreacting to this setback. I very much doubt if news of your unfortunate interview has spread throughout this community, however close-knit it may be. Indeed, I believe you\u2019d even be wrong to write off your chances of getting a job with this same organisation.</p> <p>The positives still stand: you\u2019re well qualified for the job, you\u2019ve got the relevant experience, and you did well in the assessments. To a potential employer, these should be more important considerations than your performance in a single interview.</p> <p>Employing great thoughtfulness, I think you should write a letter (not an email) addressed to the most senior person who interviewed you. Say that your brief exposure to the organisation greatly increased both your admiration for it and your serious interest in working with it, so your mortification at having made such a poor showing at the interview is all the more frustrating and is still bothering you. Since in every other respect you believe you\u2019ve shown yourself to be a potentially valuable member of the company, you wonder if they might make an exception to their usual recruitment practice and grant you a second interview. You might want to add some explanation for your poor showing at the interview but my instinct is that you\u2019d be better advised to leave it open.</p> <p>If the impressions you made prior to the interview were as positive as you hope and believe, I think you\u2019ve got a realistic chance of receiving a second opportunity to reveal your real and more collected self.</p> <p><strong>Readers say </strong></p> <p>\u2022 You won\u2019t know if it\u2019s an issue unless you apply again. Chalk it up as a learning experience, identifying what needs improvement for next time. The worst thing you can do is approach new interviews with a negative mindset as it could affect your performance. If anything, use it as motivation that you want to prove yourself and show the interviewers what you\u2019re really like. <strong>FatherChewyLouie</strong></p> <p>\u2022 The important thing is that you\u2019ve identified why the interview went badly \u2013 particularly the poor preparation. Addressing the causes of a poor result is the best way to approach future interviews with confidence. Go into the next interview with better prep and the objective of being the most impressive candidate they will encounter. <strong>starterforten</strong></p> <p>\u2022 You\u2019ve identified why you didn\u2019t do well, and will need to address these things next time around, but there\u2019s no good reason not to apply again \u2013 if you\u2019re capable at your job I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll want to hear from you. <strong>VSLVSL</strong></p> <h2>How can I manage a forceful colleague who is undermining my authority?</h2> <p><strong>I manage someone who is a real game player. I very definitely am not. I\u2019m pretty sure she is manipulating me, using my niceness and lack of guile against me: my manager has warned me that she is doing this. She is a strong and forceful person, with definite ideas of how everything should be done, and a bit of a ruthless streak.</strong></p> <p><strong>I don\u2019t want to stoop to her level. I\u2019m not cut out to play her at her own game \u2013 it\u2019s not in my nature \u2013 but I\u2019d like her to know that I do see through her. How can I make sure she doesn\u2019t undermine me or make me look stupid to others, and manage her effectively?</strong></p> <p><strong>Jeremy says</strong></p> <p>You describe a familiar set of characteristics. People like this can be fiendishly difficult to manage, and you are absolutely right in your determination not to attempt to play her at her own game. You couldn\u2019t possibly win and would only end up looking foolish.</p> <p>But I\u2019m not so sure that you\u2019re right in wanting her to know you see through her. I believe the only way to deal with such complicated and manipulative characters is to treat them as you would treat everyone else. Ignore her games and attempts to get under your skin. Don\u2019t respond in any way when she goads you or teases you, other than to be immovably, unshakeably, boringly placid. It won\u2019t be easy to start with, but once you get the hang of it, it will become almost second nature. Her initial reaction is likely to be to become even more provocative \u2013 and this will test you still further. You mustn\u2019t give the slightest indication that she\u2019s getting to you.</p> <p>The kicks she gets from her behaviour depend on an appreciative audience enjoying the sight of her running rings round someone who\u2019s meant to be in authority over her. By remaining utterly unmoved, you\u2019ll deny her audience such enjoyment and so, in turn, her own satisfaction. Sooner rather than later, she\u2019ll realise that her audience is beginning to enjoy the spectacle of you remaining totally impervious to her gibes, and the increasing frustration she\u2019ll in some way exhibit. When that happens, you\u2019ll have won. But you mustn\u2019t, by even the smallest of reactions, show that you\u2019ve noticed.</p> <p><strong>Readers say </strong></p> <p>\u2022 You need to realise that unless you are willing to be more assertive you will forever have problems as a manager. It is very simple, use sentences like: \u201cThat is not appropriate\u201d; \u201cThat is not part of your role\u201d; \u201cIf you are not happy with how I do X then we will have a meeting to discuss it\u201d. Make sure you let slip that upper managers have noticed her behaviour. If she tries to challenge you, say: \u201cOK, we will discuss your work performance in a meeting,\u201d and if she continues, say: \u201cOK, this is more of a company issue, let\u2019s have a meeting with higher managers involved, too, and that way we can address your concerns\u201d. You could take it further and say: \u201cUpper manager/management policy is \u2026 \u201d. <strong>caramel10</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Language is often a useful tool. Even a simple \u201cthank you for your opinion\u201d is often enough, because you have obviously demonstrated respect. Also: \u201cWell, of course, speaking as the manager here ...\u201d and such. <strong>oommph</strong></p> <p>\u2022 Give clear reasons why you\u2019re making certain decisions, but try to come to a mutual agreement \u2013 one of the reasons she may be going off-piste is because she feels disengaged and she may actually have some valid opinions. It might be worth reminding her about courtesy and respect at work. <strong>lace675468</strong></p> <p><strong>Do you need advice on a work issue?

      "headline": "How did we get pension calculations so wrong?",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-21T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>There is a rule of thumb that financial advisers and asset management companies use to tell us how much we need to save, and how long our pensions will survive in retirement. But research released this week finds that we\u2019ve been getting it wrong all along.</p> <p>The rule of thumb is that the safe level of withdrawal from your pension is 4% a year. Advisers say that as long as you don\u2019t take more than that your money should last 30 years, and give some protection from inflation.</p> <p>But research by investment analysts Morningstar <a href=\"http://www.morningstar.co.uk/uk/news/149651/how-much-can-you-safely-withdraw-annually-from-your-pension-pot.aspx\">has found little support for the suggested 4%</a>. It says that figure arose in the US and is based on projections that are questionable when applied in the UK. Its conclusion is that British savers should actually take out no more than 3.2% a year, while the more cautious saver should rely on no more than 2.5% a year.</p> <p>These differing figures may seem small in themselves, but have a devastating affect on the amount you will need to save for a reasonable retirement income. Using the 4% figure, someone wanting a \u00a310,000 income in retirement would have to save \u00a3250,000. Once the withdrawal rate is cut to 3.2%, then the sum of money needed to create a \u00a310,000 income rises to \u00a3312,500. It gets worse if you use the 2.5% safe withdrawal rate: you\u2019ll need \u00a3400,000 in the bank.</p> <p>Broadly, what Morningstar is saying is that workers should decide what income level they think they need for retirement, then multiply it by 30 to work out how much they need to save.</p> <p>In the past, this sort of esoteric analysis needn\u2019t have bothered workers saving for their pensions. Either they had a final salary-related pension or were forced to use their pension savings to buy an annuity. But the pension world has changed dramatically in recent years. Final salary pension schemes have all but disappeared in the private sector; what\u2019s more, savers no longer have to buy an annuity. Instead, they have to decide what to do with their money on retirement. They will be joined by the millions of lower-income workers being auto-enrolled into pensions this year.</p> <p>All of these people will have to work out what they can safely do with their money once they reach their retirement date. Given that most people are unable to significantly increase their savings, what it suggests is that incomes in retirement for most of today\u2019s workers are going to be dire.</p> <p>The new state pension, if you have a full national insurance record, will be worth about \u00a38,000 a year. We can only guess how much people are going to save through auto-enrolment or in their company pension schemes, but most of the figures kicking around at the moment make for miserable reading.</p> <p>The typical sum that was used to buy an annuity was only about \u00a330,000-\u00a335,000. Applying a safe withdrawal rate of 3% to that means a pensioner would get \u00a31,200 extra a year \u2013 and have to survive on just \u00a39,200 a year through their retirement. Many will have saved more, but if they wish to retire on two-thirds of today\u2019s \u00a327,000 average UK salary \u2013 equating to \u00a317,800 a year \u2013 they need to have put away about \u00a3300,000.</p> <p>How did advisers get it so wrong on the 4% figure? Morningstar says it was an \u201coverly optimistic\u201d figure based on historical US stock market returns that were higher than returns earned by British savers \u2013 and, in any case, not applicable to a world in which interest rates have fallen to zero and where longevity continues to rise steeply. \u201cRetirement is going to last longer and longer. This is a risk that is not likely fully understood by UK investors today,\u201d it says.</p> <p>So what should you do? Save more is the trite answer; work until you are 70 or beyond is more likely. Older pensioners will have to turn to equity release, where available. And younger pensioners may take another look at annuities and decide that maybe they weren\u2019t such bad value after all.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-21T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Experts are split over whether a vote next month to leave the EU would make European holidays more expensive. Last weekend\u2019s Sunday People newspaper said Labour had calculated that \u201cfears of Brexit\u201d would add \u00a3115 to the average family holiday this summer. But whatever the result on 23 June, picking the wrong plastic to use on a European holiday this summer could definitely prove a costly mistake.</p> <p>Financial data provider Moneyfacts published research this week showing that some debit cards will charge \u00a39.50 for a \u00a3200 withdrawal from an overseas ATM, while some credit cards will charge almost \u00a312 a time for the same transaction. Guardian Money, meanwhile, found that some credit cards from companies such as MBNA and Virgin Money would be even more pricey, charging almost \u00a316 for someone to withdraw \u00a3200 in cash, before interest applies.</p> <p>Moneyfacts says the \u201csometimes excessive\u201d charges incurred abroad can lead to a costly headache, and Some people with high-charging plastic may feel they can\u2019t be bothered to take out a credit card or open a current account to avoid these fees, but others \u2013 particularly those who go abroad regularly \u2013 may take the view that now is the perfect time to switch to a cheaper alternative.</p> <p>one of the big problems for consumers is that the fees and charges for using plastic abroad are often head-scratchingly complex. However, they are an unnecessary expense, because there are fee-free cards specifically designed for use overseas. Here we look at how you can save yourself from excessive charges.</p> <p><strong>Who charges what</strong></p> <p>Most people using their debit card to withdraw cash from a foreign ATM will typically be charged 2.75% or 2.99% of the money in hidden commission. In the case of Halifax, HSBC, NatWest and Santander the typical charge for a debit card is 2.75%, while at Barclays and Lloyds it is 2.99%.</p> <p>On top of that there is often a separate ATM fee, which is sometimes expressed as a percentage of the amount taken out. At Halifax and Barclays it is \u00a31.50; at Santander and Lloyds it is 1.5%; and at NatWest and HSBC it is 2%. Adding up these fees shows that a current account holder would typically pay from \u00a37at Halifax to \u00a39.50 at NatWest and HSBC for withdrawing \u00a3200 from a foreign ATM.</p> <p>Many credit card issuers also impose both a currency conversion fee and an ATM fee, although perhaps not surprisingly some cards cost more than others. HSBC is fairly typical in charging a standard credit card holder \u00a311.96 to withdraw \u00a3200 from an overseas ATM (the \u00a311.96 is made up of two lots of \u00a35.98, as both fees are 2.99%), says Rachel Springall at Moneyfacts.co.uk.</p> <p>However, some charge more. For example, MBNA and Virgin Money have credit cards that impose an ATM fee of 5% on top of a 2.99% currency conversion fee. For a \u00a3200 ATM withdrawal that adds up to \u00a315.98.</p> <p><strong>Watch out for \u2018purchase fees\u2019</strong></p> <p>Some debit cards come with an extra sting in the tail in the form of a purchase fee, slapped on when you use the card in a shop or restaurant overseas.</p> <p>If you have a Lloyds, Santander, Halifax or TSB debit card, be aware that in most cases they will hit you with this fee on top of the 2.75% or 2.99% for currency conversion when you buy something in anything other than sterling. The purchase fee is \u00a31.50 at Halifax, \u00a31.25 at Santander and \u00a31 at Lloyds and TSB. It is applied on each transaction.</p> <p><strong>How to cut your costs</strong></p> <p>There are a number of cards out there that won\u2019t charge you a penny in foreign exchange loading fees or other bank charges when you use them in shops, hotels and restaurants, or to withdraw money from cash machines.</p> <p>These include the <a href=\"http://www.halifax.co.uk/creditcards/clarity-card/\" title=\"\"><strong>Halifax Clarity credit card</strong></a>, which has no usage fees (ie commission charges, ATM fees etc) however or wherever you use it. The Clarity card applies MasterCard\u2019s exchange rate at the time you make the transaction and doesn\u2019t add any \u201cloading\u201d, fees or charges. Be aware, though, that there is no interest-free period on cash withdrawals made with the Clarity card, so you will be charged interest from the day you take the money out at the rate for purchases. The representative APR is 18.9%.</p> <p><strong>Norwich &amp; Peterborough building society\u2019s </strong><a href=\"http://www.nandp.co.uk/current-account/gold-classic-current-account/\" title=\"\"><strong>Gold Classic current account debit card</strong></a> offers free debit card usage abroad \u201cwith no withdrawal charges, retail transaction charges or handling fees\u201d (remember that an overseas ATM or retailer may add its own charge). This current account is suitable if you are able to pay in at least \u00a3500 a month or hold an average balance of at least \u00a35,000, otherwise a \u00a35 monthly account charge will be imposed.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.metrobankonline.co.uk/Personal/Using-your-Debit-or-Credit-Card-abroad/Using-your-Debit-or-Credit-Card-abroad1/\" title=\"\"><strong>Metro Bank</strong></a> is well worth investigating as its debit and credit cards are free of fees, provided you are within Europe. For transactions outside Europe Metro imposes a \u201cnon-sterling transaction fee\u201d of 1.9%, plus a \u00a31 fee if you are using a cash machine.</p> <p><strong>MBNA\u2019s </strong><a href=\"https://www.mbna.co.uk/compare-credit-cards/low-rate-credit-cards/everyday-plus/\" title=\"\"><strong>Everyday Plus American Express credit card</strong></a>, meanwhile, has no fees on non-sterling transactions and no fees on ATM withdrawals.</p> <p><strong>Nationwide building society\u2019s </strong><a href=\"http://www.nationwide.co.uk/products/current-accounts/flexplus/features-and-benefits\" title=\"\"><strong>FlexPlus packaged account</strong></a><strong> debit card</strong> offers commission-free and fee-free cash withdrawals abroad. However, the account isn\u2019t free \u2013 it costs \u00a310 a month. The commission charge for purchases made in a foreign currency is 2% of the transaction amount.</p> <p>Pre-paid cards are another option for people who want to budget on holiday or avoid taking cash, says Springall. \u201cConsumers can load their spending allowance on to the card and feel safe in the knowledge that if they lose their card, it can be replaced without any loss of money. There are even pre-paid cards that do not charge for ATM cash withdrawals,\u201d she adds. For example, <a href=\"http://www.mytravelcash.com/travel-money-products/euro-currency-card/\" title=\"\"><strong>my Travel Cash\u2019s Euro currency card</strong></a> has no ATM fees in Europe. It is free to order with a minimum load of \u20ac30.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Only idiots, we know, use \u201cpassword\u201d as their password. Or \u201c123456\u201d. Or \u201cfootball\u201d (the seventh most common password in the world). Maybe you carefully add an upper case letter, an unusual character or two, plus a few numbers to your Pa$swOrd.</p> <p>But with hackers using \u201cbrute force\u201d software to make as many as 8m <a href=\"http://awdnews.com/top-news/new-bruteforce-password-cracking-software-tries-8-million-times-per-second-to-crack-password\" title=\"http://awdnews.com/top-news/new-bruteforce-password-cracking-software-tries-8-million-times-per-second-to-crack-password\">password guesses</a> a second, don\u2019t kid yourself you are safe. This week <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/18/hacker-advertises-details-of-117-million-linkedin-users-on-darknet\" title=\"\">LinkedIn told users to reset their accounts after more than 100m passwords appeared for sale online</a>.</p> <p>So how can you better protect yourself? First, find out how exposed you are, and then follow some easy steps towards creating easily memorable passwords that are different for every site you visit \u2013 so even when the hackers behind LinkedIn sell your password, you know you are safe.</p> <h2><strong>Check your existing password</strong></h2> <p>The most foolish thing is to use a single word as your main password. So-called \u201cdictionary attacks\u201d run through every word in a language at lightning speed. On the dark web, hackers share the millions of passwords that have been stolen in data breaches, which are then added to the default dictionary and searched.\u00a0Single-word passwords are often the first to be broken in a brute force attack.</p> <p>Let\u2019s take the word \u201cguardian\u201d. As a password it would be cracked instantly, according to website <a href=\"https://howsecureismypassword.net/\" title=\"https://howsecureismypassword.net/\">howsecureismypassword.net</a>. Adding an upper case letter \u2013 changing it to \u201cGuardian\u201d \u2013 does absolutely nothing to make it more secure. Swapping a letter for a number isn\u2019t much help either. \u201cGuard1an\u201d will take hackers about two hours to discover, it says. But adding a number does help a bit \u2013 so \u201cGuardian1\u201d will take hacking software\u00a0four days to crack, or possibly less. Words with one or two digits added at the end are usually easily tested by software and take little extra time to crack.</p> <p>But estimates of how quickly passwords can be cracked should be treated with caution, say experts. And, while it can be a useful exercise to help understand how poorly some passwords might perform, never type\u00a0your actual password(s) into an online checker.</p> <h2><strong>Make it long</strong></h2> <p>Security experts agree that a password should have a minimum of 12-14 characters. Richard Cassidy, technical director of cyber security company Alert Logic, says a 14-character password could take 811\u00a0trillion guesses to crack. \u201cLength is the thing that gives you protection, not complexity,\u201d he says, adding that even eight-digit passwords can be cracked in a matter of hours.</p> <p>Very few people have passwords of 12 characters or more, and that\u2019s understandable: they are difficult to remember and laborious to type in. So what do you do?</p> <h2><strong>Passphrase not password</strong></h2> <p>While the password \u201cGuardian\u201d will be cracked instantly, changing it to \u201cIReadTheGuardian\u201d might take upwards of two years to crack. Change it\u00a0to \u201cEveryDayIReadTheGuardian\u201d and it will take billions of years to bust open,\u00a0according to the password checking sites.</p> <p>\u201cIf there\u2019s one thing people should be doing, it\u2019s using passphrases not words,\u201d says Fraser Kyne of Bromium, a company that fights viruses and malware. \u201cTake a line from a favourite film, or a poem you know, or a children\u2019s rhyme, then maybe swap a word. Phrases are much easier to remember than random strings of text.\u201d</p> <p>As an example, he says, use \u201cNellie the elephant packed her trunk\u201d but change \u201cNellie\u201d to another memorable name. \u201cIt will be very easy to remember, but very, very hard to crack.\u201d</p> <h2><strong>Use versions of the same password on multiple sites</strong></h2> <p>The conventional advice is to have a different password for every site that you visit.</p> <p>Morgan Slain of SplashData says that, ideally, you should use different passwords for each site since it\u2019s inevitable that, over time, some of your logins will be compromised. \u201cAt a minimum you should use a different password for each financial account, email account and social media account,\u201d he says</p> <p>But remembering a wide variety of passwords is beyond most people. Two of the experts we approached recommended an alternative approach: remembering a core, long and safe passphrase, then prefixing or suffixing it with the name of a specific site. For example, \u201cNellietheelephant\u201d becomes \u201cNelliethelephantAmazon\u201d or \u201cNellietheelephantLinkedIn\u201d.</p> <p>Richard Cassidy from Alert Logic says: \u201cIt is perfectly OK to use something like \u2018thisismypasswordforNatWest\u2019 or \u2018thisismyBritishAirwayspassword\u2019, but change one or two of the characters into numbers. It\u2019s about keeping it simple and memorable.\u201d Crucially, it means that when your password is compromised during an attack, such as at LinkedIn, it can\u2019t be used elsewhere.</p> <h2><strong>Be clever about your \u2018special\u2019 characters</strong></h2> <p>Lots of people like to exchange an \u201ca\u201d for an \u201c@\u201d and an \u201ci\u201d for a \u201c1\u201d, so \u201cGuardian\u201d becomes \u201cGuard1@n\u201d. The trouble is, hackers know they do this and search accordingly. \u201cGuard1@n\u201d takes only 19 minutes to crack with standard software. In one notorious case, a Dutch certificate authority company was hacked because an employee had \u201cproduction/administrator\u201d as a username with the password \u201cPr0d@dm1n\u201d. A 21-year-old hacker broke in and caused so much mayhem the company later filed for bankruptcy.</p> <h2><strong>Maintain your digital hygiene</strong></h2> <p>Don\u2019t use your dog or cat\u2019s name, or a variant, as your password, and then post up fluffy pictures on Facebook naming them. What Cassidy calls APTs, advanced persistent threat groups, will scour the internet for personal information that will guide them in attacking bank accounts. Avoid using passwords that may be connected to family and pet names, or past addresses.</p> <h2><strong>Consider a password manager</strong></h2> <p>When researching this article our first stop was the Guardian\u2019s tech reporters. They <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/05/life-hacks-apps-i-use-pretend-competent-adult\" title=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/05/life-hacks-apps-i-use-pretend-competent-adult\">nearly all use password managers</a>. These are the downloadable apps that will encrypt and store passwords for all your online accounts and profiles, saving you from having to remember them and input them on each visit. Most will flag up a poor password and help you create a more robust one.</p> <p>But some people will feel uneasy. What if your password manager is hacked? \u201cIt\u2019s the \u2018keys to the kingdom\u2019 worry \u2013 break the master lock and you\u2019re in,\u201d says Kyne, though he reckons the benefits outweigh the risks.</p> <p>Password manager LastPass <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/16/lastpass-hack-online-storage-vault-tells-users-to-change-master-passwords\" title=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jun/16/lastpass-hack-online-storage-vault-tells-users-to-change-master-passwords\">detected an intrusion</a> last year, prompting it to ask users to change their master passwords, although it said the stores of encrypted passwords were not compromised. Users have also been targeted with <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/18/phishing-attack-steal-lastpass-password-manager-details\" title=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/18/phishing-attack-steal-lastpass-password-manager-details\">sophisticated phishing attacks</a> aimed at grabbing master passwords.</p> <h2><strong>Write it down on paper</strong></h2> <p>If you create a very long password and worry about remembering it, then write it down on paper and secure it somewhere safe at home, such as a locked drawer. It\u2019s far safer than storing it on your computer.</p> <h2>The worst passwords</h2> <p>1. 123456</p> <p>2. password</p> <p>3. 12345678</p> <p>4. qwerty</p> <p>5. 12345</p> <p>6. 123456789</p> <p>7. football</p> <p>8. 1234</p> <p>9. 1234567</p> <p>10. baseball</p> <p>11. welcome</p> <p>12. 1234567890</p> <p>13. abc123</p> <p>14. 111111</p> <p>15. 1qaz2wsx</p> <p>16. dragon</p> <p>17. master</p> <p>18. monkey</p> <p>19. letmein</p> <p>20. login</p> <p>21. princess</p> <p>22. qwertyuiop</p> <p>23. solo</p> <p>24. passw0rd</p> <p>25. starwars</p> <p><em>Source: SplashData</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>When French television journalist H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Hadas-Lebel from Paris booked a hire car for her family for a visit to Britain, she was impressed by the environmental credentials of franchised rental company Green Motion.</p> <p>At Birmingham airport, in the pouring rain, she says they collected the car and pointed out a few scratches to the agent, but were told not to worry about them. However when they returned the vehicle, after a problem-free break, she says they were told that \u00a3200 would be taken from\u00a0their credit card for a tiny scratch to the vehicle (red car, pictured above).</p> <p>\u201cWhen we came back, the car was in perfect condition \u2013 my husband is an excellent driver. At the last minute, [the agent] pointed out a mark the size of a needle on the door edge (we took a picture of it). Back at the agency, his colleague told him we should pay nearly\u00a0\u00a3200 for it, despite the insurance\u00a0my husband had paid!\u201d She claims that it felt like blackmail when the company, threatened to deduct an even larger amount if he did not pay on the spot.</p> <p>Ms Hadas-Lebel\u2019s complaint is not the only one made to Guardian Money about tiny scratches that result in large bills from Green Motion. Fiona Kerly, who works in Dubai, says she was charged \u00a3400 in February at its Birmingham airport depot for alleged damage to a bumper. She says she drove just 68 miles in the rental vehcile, to and from hospital to see her father, and returned the car after a week.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They said I had to pay \u00a3400 before I could leave \u2026 There is no way the bump happened during the week I had the car</p> <footer> <cite>Fiona Kerly</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>\u201cThe guy checked the car and pointed to a bump in the bumper which, if it was there before, I would never have noticed it as the car was so dirty when I picked it up. They said I had to pay \u00a3400 before I could leave. If I refused to pay I was threatened with a \u00a31,000 excess. I panicked that I would miss my flight so was in a very vulnerable situation. There is no way the bump happened during the week I had the car,\u201d she claims.</p> <p>Jamie Moss hired a car from the Luton branch of Green Motion in February. \u201cAfter an hour\u2019s wait I was given a Peugeot 208 with a missing wing mirror case and an apparent and obvious scratch on the front left wheel and a few other obvious dents. This was all marked on the form, which I had to check over myself. When I returned the car a member of staff came out to inspect the vehicle.\u201d Moss was told there was a 2mm scratch. \u201cI could hardly see what he was pointing out.\u201d He was charged \u00a3216. Later, after making vigorous complaints, including on Twitter, he says he was refunded.</p> <p>Lee Haines says that after hiring from Green Motion in April he was told he would have to pay \u00a3340 for the damage to the white car pictured above. \u201cThe damage was so small I would have missed it or thought it incidental on a pre-rental inspection.\u201d</p> <p>Green Motion rejects the allegations. It says it is justified in charging post-rental fees, which are set out in a \u201cprice matrix\u201d displayed to customers. It said that customers sign a post-rental inspection form, that it is a member of industry body BVRLA for dispute resolution, and that the vast majority of its 45,000 rentals so far this year have been trouble free.</p> <p>The battles between Green Motion and the customers who have contacted us revolve around two areas: the alleged existence of the scratches before the vehicle was hired, and what is the fair price for a repair if it was indeed caused by the driver.</p> <p>Money contacted several firms that offer to repair minor scratches. An agent for ChipsAway, the UK\u2019s biggest damage repair firm, told us that for the smallest scratch the cost would be around \u00a330 plus VAT, while a deeper scratch that has gone through the paint would cost \u00a3120 plus VAT.</p> <p>When Kamlesh Khetia returned a car to Green Motion\u2019s Edinburgh branch, he says the agent pointed out a scratch and initially asked for \u00a31,495. After a row broke out, staff offered to end the matter if he paid them \u00a3194.40.</p> <p>In the Leicester branch, Ismail Seedat says he was told he would have to pay more than \u00a31,600 for three alleged scratches and scrapes, including \u00a3492 to repair a front bumper (pictured above).</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Hand on heart I did not cause the 15mm scratch on the alloy trim. The \u00a3192 charge will hopefully be refunded by Axa</p> <footer> <cite>Gren Robinson</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Other Green Motion hirers are adamant they did not cause the scratches. Caroline Shirley, who hired from the company\u2019s Heathrow branch, says she was charged \u00a3138 for a scratch on the back-left wheel: \u201cI am 100% sure that was not caused by us.\u201d</p> <p>Meanwhile, Gren Robinson says he was charged \u00a3192 after a three-day hire from Stansted airport. \u201cI booked it via Holiday Autos and, fortunately, took the optional excess protection insurance. Hand on heart I did not cause the 15mm scratch located on the alloy wheel trim. The \u00a3192 charge will hopefully be refunded by Axa.\u201d</p> <p>Last October, Money reported on the case of PJ from Australia, who was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/oct/31/car-hire-green-motion-damage\" title=\"\">charged \u00a3351 after staff at the Leicester branch alleged he caused a blemish on the bumper\u2019s underside</a>. This was only fully visible when kneeling down, he says. \u201cI asked to see the manager who went into what appeared to be a well rehearsed speech. He told me that the price for repair was \u00a3500. Eventually he reduced it to \u00a3351.\u201d</p> <p>In a statement, Green Motion said: \u201cIn the rare instance that damage has appeared on a vehicle that was not otherwise there before the rental period, Green Motion is entirely justified in charging post-rental fees.</p> <p>\u201cCustomers are required to sign a vehicle condition report prior to taking possession of a vehicle, accepting all pre-existing damage and confirming that there are no further instances of damage to the vehicle. It is the customer\u2019s responsibility to carefully inspect the vehicle.</p> <p>\u201cAt the end of the rental the vehicle is inspected again for additional damage and the customer is again asked to validate this inspection by signing a post rental inspection form.</p> <p>\u201cWe use a pre-calculated estimate of what it will cost to effect the repairs, set out in a price matrix. The prices are calculated using average repair cost data provided by valuation experts. The matrix is available at all locations and is displayed on the walls. We are a member of the British Vehicle Rental and Leasing Association, an independent trade body. As a member we are required to provide justification for any charges raised and must demonstrate a method for the calculation of those charges. We have provided the BVRLA with a copy of our price matrix.\u201d</p>",

He married later in the 60s and had a long and happy marriage until his wife died in 2011.</p> <p>When my sister placed this photo next to his bed at St Thomas\u2019s hospital in south London in 2012, the medical staff were intrigued by the young man in the photo and surprised that he was the same person as their frail patient in his 80s, who was by then too ill to tell any more stories about his rich and colourful life.<br /><em>Maggie Cox</em></p> <h2>Playlist: We tried to make my son a teenage rebel <br /></h2>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9Ic_9ehFxU\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y9Ic_9ehFxU?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption>Listen to Younger Generation by the Lovin\u2019 Spoonful, founded by John Sebastian</figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>Younger Generation by </strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Sebastian\" title=\"\"><strong>John Sebastian</strong> </a><br />\u201c<em>Why must every generation think</em> t<em>heir folks are square/No matter where their heads are, they know mom\u2019s ain\u2019t there</em>\u201d</p> <p>As teenagers, we would use music as a weapon against our parents.

Danny, the eldest, was developing a passion for classic rock. And he actually valued my opinion \u2013 Eric or Jimi? (Jimi of course); <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/jul/04/fender-telecaster-andy-summers-graham-coxon\" title=\"\">Tele</a> or Strat? I was worried. How could he rebel if he never tried to eviscerate me with his music. I consumed this conflicting cocktail of anxiety and pride with each new discovery. (\u201cIf Judas Priest got their name from Dylan\u2019s John Wesley Harding, was there ever a band named Frankie Lee?\u201d).</p> <p>We\u2019d even played John Sebastian\u2019s Younger Generation at Danny\u2019s naming ceremony in anticipation of the customary adolescent insurgence.</p> <p>After discovering some of my old <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/gunsnroses\" title=\"\">Guns N\u2019 Roses</a> cassettes he tweeted, \u201cMy dad and Axl Rose! \u2013 I wasn\u2019t expecting that.\u201d</p> <p>My credibility soared when I told him that my PE teacher had dated <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/1999/jan/18/features11.g25\" title=\"\">Grace Slick</a> on a year\u2019s exchange to California in 1970 and that I\u2019d actually worked alongside a cousin of Robert Plant.</p> <p>So despite our shared enthusiasm for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/mar/23/our-first-gigs-tell-us-yours\" title=\"\">Whitesnake</a>, I feel I\u2019ve let him down.

As he tweeted recently, \u201cI thought my dad was the expert on classic rock. He\u2019s never even heard of Heart.

Place centrally on the lettuce. Peel a cucumber stripily and slice into discs thin enough to allow the light to shine through. Slide the slices between the lettuce and the sides of the bowl, overlapping slightly; save a few for decoration. Peel the cooled eggs, cut into quarters and then eighths. Arrange these on the top of the bowl around the tomato.

Mop up the juices which collect at the bottom of the bowl with extra chunks of bread and butter.</p> <p>My grandfather George became a career army man after losing his first wife, Jennie, in childbirth in 1904. He and his elder brother had been forced from the land because of mechanisation. George joined the Royal Horse Artillery and William the Royal Sussex in 1898, both under age, but both with \u201ca build comparable to that of an 18-year-old\u201d. There were eight younger siblings to feed at home.</p> <p>In Lucknow, George developed a love of curry that was to last a lifetime, and he caught malaria. At the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/century/1899-1909/Story/0,6051,126325,00.html\" title=\"\">siege of Ladysmith</a>, he ate his horse and boiled his boots for any possible nutrition in the leather. In 1916, in his early 40s, his horse fell from under him while delivering supplies to the front line near Albert, near Amiens. George suffered crushed ribs and a punctured lung. He was transported home on a hospital ship to recover and ended up in a hotel-turned-convalescent home, where he met my grandmother, who was 15 years his junior.</p> <p>George returned to war and began an exchange of love letters with the woman who was to become his second wife and have two children with him.</p> <p>Until she was 93 (34 years after George\u2019s death in 1950) my grandmother continued to make the salad she had learned how to do in that hotel. Simple by today\u2019s standards, time-consuming and laborious, it displays a love for family and natural, fresh ingredients. It\u2019s delicious and a million tastebuds away from army rations. <br /><em>J Samways</em></p> <h2>We\u2019d love to hear your stories<br /></h2> <p><em>We will pay \u00a325 for every Letter to, Playlist, Snapshot or We Love to Eat we publish.

      "body": "<p>\u201cWell, I come from Leicester, so I suppose I\u2019ll have to say Leicester City,\u201d says Nina near the start of <strong>Love, Nina</strong> (BBC1). </p> <p>You don\u2019t get anyone supposing they\u2019ll have to support Leicester City these days, but it isn\u2019t these days. It\u2019s 1982. Nina Stibbe has come to London to interview for the job of nanny to the two boys of a grand literary editor in their big Camden home, with paintings on the walls, cracks between the floorboards, distinguished neighbours, etc. It\u2019s the boys doing the interviewing: this makes sense, as their mother says, because \u201cthey\u2019re the ones who have to get on with you\u201d. Hence the football questions. </p> <p>Nina doesn\u2019t get the job (younger son not keen on LCFC), then later she does, moves in, becomes part of the family, and writes letters home to her sister in Leicestershire about them and their friends which almost 30 years on will be published as a book and become an unlikely bestseller. And now adapted into a five-part television drama by Nick Hornby, who can\u2019t have known at the time of writing that the Leicester line would end up being funny. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/18/nina-stibbes-letter-to-her-younger-self\">Nina Stibbe's letter to her younger self: 'Try not to have a weave perm'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Names have changed. Mary-Kay Wilmers has become George, Will and Sam have become Max and Joe. Neighbour AB (Alan Bennett), who was always round to share \u2013 and critique \u2013 their evening meals, has become a Scottish poet named Malcolm Tanner. Perhaps for literary types, happy to appear in the pages of a book, the gogglebox is a bit vulgar (though it\u2019s nice to see it on a lot at 55 Gloucester Crescent). Actually the real Sam (Frears) is in it, playing another neighbour.</p> <p>The most important thing is that Hornby and director SJ Clarkson have captured the spirit and hilariousness of the book. It\u2019s a joy, like having a spy in an extraordinary north London world of writers and film directors and academics \u2026 no, maybe not spy, because that suggests they\u2019re the enemy and they\u2019re not \u2013 it\u2019s very affectionate. More like an embed, then, but the essential thing is that Nina is an outsider, which she needs to be in order to fully appreciate them. Lovely performances from Faye Marsay as Nina, Ethan Rouse and Harry Webster as the boys, and especially from Helena Bonham Carter as George, exuding the sort of terrifying confidence that only comes from being really, really brainy. </p> <p>Leicester incidentally finished the 1982-3 season in third place \u2026 in the second tier. They were promoted, though. Arsenal finished below Spurs. </p>",

      "body": "<p>Our story goes back a quarter of a century. We first met shortly before I become engaged to your son,\u00a0your only child. I was young, gauche, new to your country and, coming from a mild-mannered British family, totally unprepared for\u00a0the onslaught of the French mother-in-law. I have to admit, I was a little intimidated.</p> <p>You were always immaculately turned out and your constant chatter in a language that I hardly understood (but enough to know you were talking about me) unnerved me and played on my insecurities.</p> <p>Your criticism and ridicule knew no bounds \u2013 with my lack of chic and stumbling schoolgirl French, I must have seemed like an easy target. You rolled your eyes at the waiter when I tried to order in your language in restaurants or you would look aghast at how I was dressed for a family gathering, \u201cOoh la la, what, no jewellery?!\u201d You hardly deigned to touch the food I prepared. Your poor son! What could he expect from a wife coming from a country where they eat \u201cde la merde\u201d.\u00a0</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I got pregnant you told your son that I had done it on purpose to trap him \u2013 we were already married!</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>My poor husband, your emotional punchbag, wearied from years of your\u00a0demands for constant flattery and\u00a0attention, would run himself ragged trying to keep you happy.</p> <p>Then the children came along and there was no stopping you. When I got pregnant, you told your son that I had done it on purpose to try to trap him. We were already married, for God\u2019s sake! You would titter into your hand at my nine-month pregnant belly, as if I should be ashamed, and there was no question of breastfeeding in your presence \u2013 I was sent off to another room.</p> <p>Nothing was good enough for your grandchildren: the food I prepared, the sleeping routines, the discipline \u2026 And when you held out your arms to my exuberant toddler saying \u201cCome to Maman\u201d, did you do it to annoy me? You certainly succeeded. I felt so undermined at times that I feared that I would lose my children.</p> <p>But the years have passed and I have learned to bare my teeth and bite back, and you have backed off. The children have grown up and we both take pride in what they have become. You always loved them unconditionally and I am grateful for that.</p> <p>Old age has softened and diminished you and, dare I say it, you seem to appreciate and even admire me. When\u00a0I was very sick with breast cancer you were hugely supportive.</p> <p>I hope, in turn, that I have become good company for you with our shared\u00a0interests in art and cinema. I am\u00a0glad that we have become friends and that the antagonism and the competition for your son\u2019s attention has disappeared.</p> <p>One day, my boys will probably find a partner, a mother for their children. Will I treat them as you treated me? To be honest, I wouldn\u2019t expect them to stick around if I did.</p> <p><em>Anonymous</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>I put down the bank statement and groan. Were this an old TV ad, the music would begin, the characters would suddenly start dancing and Nat King Cole would\u00a0break into song \u2013 \u201c<em>There may be trouble ahead, but while there\u2019s moonlight and music and love and romance, let\u2019s face the music and dance</em>.\u201d</p> <p>Well, I\u2019m not dancing but I am drinking \u2013 a large glass of Italian red \u2013 as I contemplate the cost of music lessons, grocery shopping, holidays, ballet, mortgage, car and a whole new raft of childcare costs that, with Helen\u2019s death, will now come out of one salary.</p> <p>I look again at the list of outgoings and wonder how I, of all people, could\u00a0have ended up underinsured. Back in the day, I\u2019d massively admired that Dennis Potter-inspired 1990s television advert. It featured a bloke on\u00a0an operating trolley hearing surgeons find unexpected problems, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWCK0hCxGjI\" title=\"\">a\u00a0man overhearing in the toilet that he\u2019d been made redundant</a>, a middle-aged couple dealing with the discovery of a positive pregnancy test that is not their daughter\u2019s but the wife\u2019s and even the grim reaper warning an overworked commuter. They all ended\u00a0in the line \u201cFor the life you don\u2019t yet know.\u201d</p> <p>At the time, I\u2019d been working with a number of life insurance companies and one day had gone out with Barry, a top insurance salesmen, who\u2019d tell me, \u201cDeath is such a tough subject to talk to couples about that you almost have to reverse a hearse up to their front door and let them smell the flowers!\u201d The form this took was to get a husband and wife to both fill in estimates of how much money would\u00a0be needed if\u00a0the wife/mother died. Almost always, the husband would call it ridiculously low and his\u00a0wife would be spot on. During the row that followed, no selling was required by Barry to make the\u00a0sale.</p> <p>The problem with developing life insurance ads has always been that one couldn\u2019t make a life-changing event too dreadful as absolute grief would be the problem not money.</p> <p>In truth, they shouldn\u2019t have worried. I know beyond any doubt that the time between the death of a loved one and the first financial fear for the future barely leaves time for the last note of the funeral\u2019s final hymn to fade. Despite my knowing the devils of under-insurance, helped by Barry\u2019s spiv-edged master class, I\u2019d had the usual denial and lack of interest, fear and avoidance of acknowledging death and planning for it. It meant that Helen and I were far from well covered. I take a deep gulp of the barolo (an indulgence whose days may be numbered).</p> <p>Had I died, Helen would have received a ton of cash due to our payout being bolstered by my major death-in-service cover at work. The kids would have their mum and the household few\u00a0money worries. In fact, we\u2019d joked, \u201cTo find a new husband you\u2019ll need all the cash you can get \u2013 new clothes, sports car, boob job, etc,\u201d \u2013 this in the days when an early death for either of\u00a0us seemed so unlikely as to be laughable.</p> <p>But at 3am in Helen\u2019s study, I look miserably at her finances, seeing that pretty much all her salary paid for childcare. This shows how much she loved her job. I made\u00a0the usual mistake of thinking only of the mortgage, not our ongoing\u00a0lifestyle as a single-salary household. Our brilliant nanny, Annie, who had been with us for 10 years and allowed us both to work, whom Millie and Matt need more than ever, requires getting on for half my gross salary. Christ!</p> <p>All of that is sustainable if I keep my job and income stable. But my job means travelling regularly \u2013 and how sustainable is that with two children who already show signs of hating me being away and massive anxiety that something else bad will happen? I might need to work less intensely or not at all for a while.</p> <p>Trouble ahead? I pick up the glass and take another hefty swig.</p> <p>I\u2019m not a financial adviser but consider yourselves nagged \u2013 check and improve your cover now. So if, heaven forbid, the worst happens, you can raise your own glass to me because it won\u2019t be money worries that stop you dancing. Cheers.</p> <p><em>Adam Golightly is a pseudonym</em></p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-21T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p><strong>1</strong> <strong>Your days of exciting dining are done</strong>. Where once you thought nothing of eating in swanky Michelin-starred establishments or queuing up outside the hot new artisanal burger joint, your priorities have now shifted. Now all you want is cheap food brought to you as quickly as possible by a sympathetic waiting staff. Anything else is a bonus.</p> <p><strong>2 Don\u2019t stroll in blind</strong>. The more you know about a place, the better. Are there highchairs? Is there a kids\u2019 menu? Is there somewhere you can store your buggy? Are the tables too small or close together? Are there steps? Are there adequate changing facilities? Seriously, find out. Surprises are your worst enemy right now.</p> <p><strong>3 Go off-peak</strong>. If you want a toddler to eat in public, you need time and space, ie when nobody else is there. Get used to 5pm meals. Especially if your child gets ratty when tired.</p> <p><strong>4 Make sure they serve something familiar</strong>. Since I had my baby, my favourite restaurants are the ones that include \u201cPenne in Red Crap\u201d on their kids\u2019 menus. I don\u2019t care if they\u2019ve got poor TripAdvisor reviews or are unethical about sharing their tips, or if there are piles of warm rat faeces on every table. All I want is Penne in Red Crap because I know my son will definitely eat Penne in Red Crap.</p> <p><strong>5 Order your child\u2019s food first</strong>. This is important. Many babies like food tepid but many restaurants pride themselves on serving bubbling hot dishes on just nuked plates. Here\u2019s my workaround: get their food brought out with your starters. Better yet, order it with your drinks. The earlier it arrives, the more time it has to cool and the less likely you are to go bald with stress.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Yes, your child is your world but not everyone else\u2019s, so try to let the other diners enjoy their meal</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>6 Give them space</strong>. My son\u2019s reach has suddenly become enormous. Look away for a second and he\u2019ll lean over and grab your knife, plate or glass. To combat this, pile everything they can grab into a ramshackle barricade on the opposite side of the table.</p> <p><strong>7 Avoid tablecloths</strong>. A child will never be able to damage a wooden table by rubbing a slice of pizza on it. Tablecloths are a different matter entirely. Only eat at clothless establishments or get used to apologising relentlessly.</p> <p><strong>8 Be considerate</strong>. Yes, your child is your world but not everyone else\u2019s, so try to let the other diners enjoy their meal as much as possible. Obviously a toddler is an uncontrollable timebomb of noise and emotion, but do whatever you can to minimise it. Take them out for walks. Load an iPad with CBeebies shows. Anything it takes not to become the most hated table in the restaurant.</p> <p><strong>9 Clean up</strong>. This is just basic politeness. When the meal is over, look down. Look at that wasteland of half-chewed breadsticks and splattered vegetables at your feet. It will take two seconds to bend down and pick it up. Even if you don\u2019t leave it spotless, the staff will appreciate the gesture. Which brings me to the most important point of all \u2026</p> <p><strong>10 Tip like you\u2019ve never tipped before</strong>. I guarantee that you\u2019ve been a difficult diner. You asked for special equipment and special dishes. You were noisy, disruptive and covered everything in a thick spray of mauled, saliva-covered penne. The least you can do is to tip a little more. And apologise on the way out. Remember, this won\u2019t last for ever. Fifteen more years, tops.</p> <p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/stuheritage\">@stuheritage</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s at once evocative, delicious and reassuring: the taste of my mother\u2019s homemade Iraqi pastries. Folded circles of aromatic, buttery dough that are popular across the Middle East, these bite-sized treats can be stuffed with dates or with crushed sugary nuts; there are fried savoury versions filled with spiced chickpeas or meats. But my favourite was always the cheese variety \u2013 served hot out of the oven, so that the filling is wonderfully gooey, the pastry still soft and fragrant, a small piece of Iraq giving comfort and sustenance throughout my childhood and beyond.</p> <p>Now aged 82 and dealing with some of the physical hindrances of later age, my Iraq-born mother, Maureen, recently told me that she could no longer bake the pastries \u2013 rolling and shaping them was too unwieldy. She has been making sambusak, along with various other Middle Eastern pastries, for some six decades, and so this information marked another closing, another limitation, another tear at one of many small things that all together make up a person, a personality, a life.</p> <p>It later occurred to me that bound up in my mother\u2019s statement was another one: that the family responsibility for pastries was being passed on to me, the only one of her three children with an abiding interest in making (as opposed to just eating) these fiddly, labour-intensive snacks.</p> <p>In truth, our shared interest in food more generally, and these pastries in particular, is a welcome pathway between my mother and me, something that narrows what might otherwise be a yawning gap. She grew up in Kirkuk, in northern Iraq, left for Israel in 1951, just after that nation\u2019s creation, and then moved again to the UK, where I was raised in the 1970s.</p> <p>All the differences contained in our divergent life experiences have at many times felt unbridgeable, in that way that is so often the case for migrant kids who end up as \u201cthird culture\u201d children: not culturally like their parents, nor like the country in which they now reside, but some new amalgam in between.</p> <p>Iraqi pastries are not the only subject to connect my mother and me, but there is something about the immediacy of this bond that is surprising in its warmth and durability. Perhaps that\u2019s why we both like to dwell there \u2013 how else to explain our capacity to talk endlessly, between us, on this same subject? We might focus a particular discussion on the Iraqi sambusak, discussing variations on the recipe or running through which carefully tested combination of the cheeses available in the UK are the best approximation of the ones used in Iraq. Then there\u2019s the matter of the hawayij spice mix that goes into the pastry, shop-bought in Iraq and in Israel (with its large population of Iraqi Jews), but mixed at home ever since. It\u2019s a combination of ground fennel seeds, fenugreek, mastic and mahlab \u2013 a fragrant spice obtained from the ground stone of the St Lucie cherry tree, cultivated for this purpose, and often used in Middle Eastern baking.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fa45da30390cbb0c206c8dccb5dbe4d6eeaab374\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fa45da30390cbb0c206c8dccb5dbe4d6eeaab374/281_157_502_407/500.jpg\" alt=\"Rachel and her mother Maureen, in 1973.\" width=\"500\" height=\"405\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rachel and her mother Maureen, in 1973.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sometimes my mum and I roam into other treasured recipes that have passed from her kitchen to my own: baklava, malfouf \u2013 puff pastry fingers stuffed with almonds \u2013 or baba b\u2019tamar \u2013 date-filled pastries round garnished with sesame seeds. On other occasions, we might ponder the variations of Iraqi kleicha, dough biscuits often filled or rolled with a sweet date paste.</p> <p>I\u2019m very much a novice and so often check in on the particulars of any given recipe with my mother who, to my delight, seems happy to tap into her vast hinterland of pastry experience and offer advice. My pastry shortcomings, described over the phone or when I visit her, are met with thorough investigations to provide possible remedies: what kind of flour are you using? What type of oil? Are you kneading for long enough? Once these essential components are taken care of, she might then review the pastry aesthetics: how am I turning the edges? Am I folding them over twice, to create a piped edge?</p> <p>When I speak to Middle East food expert and writer <a href=\"http://www.anissas.com/\" title=\"\">Anissa Helou</a> about these sweets and pastries, she explains why the experience goes beyond the culinary: \u201cIt\u2019s very much a part of the hospitality and a part of the culture,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about bringing people together to celebrate or to commemorate. They take a lot of effort\u00a0and carry a lot of memories. If your mother left Iraq during the days when she made sambusak, she will have all those memories bound up with the pastries.\u201d</p> <p>That is true, she does: my mum can easily recollect, for instance, making mounds of date, cheese, walnut or almond-filled sambusak as a teenager in Kirkuk, for the Jewish festival of Purim, when those pastries are traditionally served. She recalls a lull in pastry activity, when she first moved to Israel, aged 17, into the transit camps that awaited so many of the different Jewish communities arriving from across the Middle East during the early 1950s. And she recalls another pause in the pastries in the UK, during a period when work opportunities moved our family to the south-west of England, where some of the ingredients used to\u00a0flavour the dough were impossible to source.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0349c100644819a1b1108fcdf30fa5e76c2bd23\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0349c100644819a1b1108fcdf30fa5e76c2bd23/936_0_3744_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rachel Shabi sambusak\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A plate of sambusak made by Rachel.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alicia Canter for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Often, in the midst of one of our discussions about a particular type of Middle Eastern baking, it seems clear to me that something more than just the food is being passed between us, along with the pastries. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/mar/18/claudia-roden-spanish-food-interview\" title=\"\">Claudia Roden</a>, a cookbook writer and cultural anthropologist, prefaces her recipe for sambusak in A New Book of Middle Eastern Food with a poem celebrating the pastries by Ishaq ibn Ibrahim of Mosul, which, she notes, was recited at a 10th-century banquet held by the Caliph Mustakfi of Baghdad.</p> <p>Researching her books and asking people for family recipes, Roden says she found that people were making particular foods as a way of remembering parents or grandparents. \u201cIn some cases they were making extraordinarily labour-intensive things,\u201d she says. \u201cBut they enjoyed making and eating those dishes because they meant so much.\u201d</p> <p>As cuisine is a carrier for identity, family, heritage and culture, Roden says that migrants often cling to recipes and dishes. \u201cFor people who are immigrants or who are wandering, it is about continuity, a way of keeping something of who you are, wherever you are.\u201d</p> <p>So for my mother, the diminishing capacity to make these pastries \u2013 a constant pursuit for her during many moves, through a string of homes and across several countries \u2013 may be tinged with a particular loss, a break in the chain that she resourcefully managed to maintain throughout.</p> <p>Mine don\u2019t taste as delicious as hers \u2013 how could they? \u2013 but perhaps these days, when I take my own home-baked Iraqi pastries to my mother, they might provide her with the reassurance and comfort with which her sambusak nourished me over so many years.</p>",

A joint working group involving judges and Ministry of Justice (MoJ) officials endorsed the scheme and is examining how it can be expanded.</p> <p>Announcing the initiative, the justice minister Caroline Dinenage said she hoped it would provide alternatives to prison for female offenders who are particularly at risk behind bars.</p> <p>The justice secretary, Michael Gove, has expressed enthusiasm for the type of problem-solving courts developed in New York and met some of the US judges who run them.</p> <p>The US tribunals focus on identifying and dealing with each offender\u2019s underlying problems and preventing their re-offending. If they fail to engage with rehabilitiation efforts they can be sent to prison.</p> <p>Gove has pledged to reform prisons <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/mar/01/gove-prison-reform-reducing-inmate-numbers\">without reducing the inmate population</a> but this latest initiative derives from New York judges whose explicit aim is to end America\u2019s enthusiasm for mass incarceration.</p> <p> Addressing a meeting in the Royal Courts of Justice in London earlier this week, the most senior judge in New York\u2019s state courts, Judge Lippman, said: \u201cIt is up to those who care about the administration of justice to think out of the box to make it happen \u2013 not to be soft on crime or tough on crime but rather to be smart on crime.</p> <p>\u201cWe are grappling with the issues of over-incarceration in New York and around [the US].\u201d Courts, he said, could serve as an agent for change. Imprisonment for six months, he added, increased the chance of reoffending. \u201cSending people to jail may actually harm public safety.\u201d <br /></p> <p>The lord chief justice, Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, attended the meeting, which was held in his court. The MoJ has not revealed how many courts will be involved in the pilot programme nor how much money has been allotted to the scheme. Lippman said investment in problem-solving courts, which involve judges spending longer on each offender, would save money overall by reducing the more expensive bills incurred by keeping inmates locked up. <br /></p> <p>The initiative will also draw on the experience of the few specialist courts already running in England and Wales such as the family, drug and alcohol courts. Other specialist courts have fallen by the wayside because of lack of official support. <br /></p> <p>Dinenage said: \u201cOver the coming months, together with the judiciary, we will be developing our plans for the first pilot courts in England and Wales. Criminal behaviour is often driven by underlying problems \u2013 alcohol and drug addiction, for example \u2013 that are not being properly adressed. <br /></p> <p>\u201cThese problem-solving courts, by looking at each offender as a person to be helped as well as punished, place their underlying problems at the heart of each case. <br /></p> <p>\u201cJudicial supervision, with appropriate levers and sanctions, becomes key to real change. It\u2019s about turning someone\u2019s life around and making the public safer.\u201d</p> <p>Current re-offending rates are \u201cscandalous\u201d, she said. \u201cFar from being an easy option, problem-solving courts \u2013 like prison reform \u2013 become part of a problem-solving strategy that will benefit the public and keep them safe. That\u2019s why breaking the cycle of reoffending is such a priority for this government.<br /></p> <p>\u201cThe more ideas from the frontline judiciary, the more effective these reforms will be.\u201d <br /></p> <p>Dinenage, who is also the minister responsible for female prisoners, added: \u201cIt\u2019s abundantly clear that the question of women offenders should be looked at very carefully, especially those who are pregnant or with young children, because of the negative effect of a custodial sentence. Problem-solving courts \u2026 may be particularly helpful in diverting women to the services they need.\u201d</p> <p>Phil Bowen, director of the UK\u2019s Centre for Justice Innovation, which has championed New-York-style problem-solving courts, welcomed the government\u2019s commitment. \u201cWe know from research,\u201d he said, \u201cthat a defendant in a problem-solving court is a third less likely to go on to commit more offences than those going through a traditional court.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a new way of seeing the role of courts in this country \u2013 as places offering real opportunity to change people\u2019s behaviour and lives for the better. If done right, the tough-love, practical approach will slot into and strengthen our court systems \u2013 cutting crime and improving public safety.\u201d<br /></p> <h2>How problem-solving courts work</h2> <p>Last summer the justice secretary, Michael Gove, visited Newark municipal court in New Jersey, where convicted offenders are brought back regularly to have progress on community sentences assessed. The judge can send offenders to prison for failing to comply with rehabilitation orders.</p> <p>Judge Alex Calabrese, who presides over criminal courts in <a href=\"http://www.courtinnovation.org/project/red-hook-community-justice-center\">Red Hook, Brooklyn,</a> also <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/2015/dec/25/give-magistrates-leeway-us-judge-alex-calabrese-tells-michael-gove\">met Gove in London last December</a> and explained more about the pioneering US community courts he oversees.</p> <p>The Red Hook court uses an enhanced range of community and social service sentencing options. A proportion of defendants are given medium- or long-term judicially supervised treatment orders for drug addiction, mental illness, or other problems.</p> <p> The majority of defendants receive short-term social or community service sanctions, typically five days or less in length. The aim is to identify and resolve problems in the community and reduce the number of conventional jail sentences handed down.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.courtinnovation.org/research/they-treated-me-person-inside-red-hook-community-justice-center\">first such community court in the US was set up in Manhattan\u2019s midtown area in 1993</a>. It worked with businesses that were losing trade because crime was so disruptive around Times Square.</p>",

      "body": "<p>A bowl of miso soup is as instant a homemade meal can get, and as satisfying an instant one can be. It has the saltiness that makes bacon so addictive, the warming depth you long for when you\u2019re really hungry, and a lightness that doesn\u2019t usually go hand in hand with something this savoury. And while that soup might be reason enough to always have a pot of miso in your fridge, the potential this paste contains within its robust bulk is nothing short of remarkable.</p> <p>Made by fermenting soya beans with salt and koji (the fungus <em>Aspergillus oryzae</em> used to make soy sauce and other Asian ferments), it is what is added to those basic ingredients that determines the type of miso achieved. Hatcho (or mame) miso is 100% soya bean miso; rice gives kome miso, and barley, mugi miso; aka miso is red and aged, while shiro (white) miso is sweet and young, made with more rice and barley than soya.</p> <p>If you\u2019re into fermentation, try making your own. Koji can be purchased online, and other beans and grains used if you\u2019ve no soya beans to hand: a friend of mine makes hers with chickpeas. As something to make, and a flavour range to work with, miso is the curious cook\u2019s dream ingredient.</p> <h2><strong>The winning recipe: </strong><strong>Miso, ginger and garlic dressing</strong></h2> <p>While she and her husband were running a guest house in rural Kyoto, writes <a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/guardianUser16004424\"><em>Anna Thomson</em></a>, she had at her disposal several vats of rich, dark miso in the basement that the owner had made \u2013 which is as beautifully evocative as the flavour of the simple dressing she made with it. The ginger, garlic, soya and honey enhances the intense depth of flavour the miso harbours with quasi Korean brightness: the perfect condiment for an Anna Jones style bowlful of grains and crunchy greens, or to follow Thompson\u2019s little boy\u2019s lead, simply atop a bowl of rice.</p> <p><strong>Makes 1 jar</strong><br /><strong> </strong></p> <p>3 tbsp hatcho or mame miso<br />4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil<br />3 tbsp rice vinegar<br />2 tbsp honey<br />1 tsp soy sauce (optional)<br />1 garlic clove, finely minced<br />3cm knob of ginger, finely grated</p> <p>1 Whisk all ingredients in a jar, thinning with water if necessary.</p> <h2><strong>Miso walnut butter</strong></h2> <p><em><a href=\"https://uk.pinterest.com/comeconella/\">Mehrunnisa Yusuf</a> </em>was inspired to make this excellent spread by the udon with mushrooms and walnut miso that were on the menu at Koya, in London\u2019s Soho \u2013 an erstwhile favourite haunt of Cook\u2019s. And it really is inspired \u2013 the astringent notes of the nuts are couched in the remarkable savoury sweetness of white or shiro miso. She recommends spreading liberally on toasted sourdough \u2013 I can\u2019t wait to use it in making a variation on the winning spelt thumbprint cookies from a few weeks back.</p> <p><strong>Makes 1 jar </strong><br />250g walnuts<br />2 tbsp white miso<br />2 tbsp runny honey</p> <p>1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Place the walnuts on a rimmed baking sheet in a single layer. Toast for around 10-15 minutes, moving them around every five minutes. Take care not to let the nuts burn. When toasted and fragrant, remove from the oven and set aside to cool for around five minutes.</p> <p>2 Reserve six whole walnuts before placing the rest in the bowl of your food processor. Process until they release their oil and become a smooth butter \u2013 depending on the strength of your processor, this might take 2-10 minutes.</p> <p>3 Now add the miso and process to mix. Then add the honey and process for a further 30 seconds.</p> <p>4 Lastly, add the whole reserved walnuts and pulse briefly, to achieve a chunky texture.</p> <h2><strong>Aubergine and butternut squash in spicy miso</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/Ofer%20Guez\">Ofer Guez</a><em>\u2019s </em>marinade for roast veg here shows a) how lovely miso is in spicy settings and b) that it\u2019s the vegetarian\u2019s best friend: the beautifully rich savouriness that a mere blob of miso brings to any dish makes the need for meat or fish simply evaporate. Also, while miso is such a Japanese staple \u2013 usually paired with sake and mirin \u2013 it works just as well in entirely unrelated culinary settings too, as is demonstrated by the white wine, sriracha and maple syrup here.</p> <p><strong>Serves 2</strong><br />1 aubergine, peeled, cut into 8 wedges and then in half lengthways<br />\u00bd butternut squash, peeled, cut into similar size as the aubergine pieces<br />Tofu (optional), cut into similar sized pieces</p> <p> <strong>For the roasting sauce</strong><br />\u00bd tsp coarse salt<br />\u00bd tbsp olive oil<br />4 tbsp white wine</p> <p> <strong>For the marinade</strong><br />1\u00bd tsp red or white miso<br />1 tbsp Chinese dark soy sauce<br />1 tbsp maple syrup<br />1 tbsp peanut butter, tahini or other nut butter<br />1-2 tsp sriracha (according to desired spiciness)<br />\u00bd garlic, crushed (optional)<br />2 tbsp white wine</p> <p>1 Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas mark 4. Arrange the vegetable pieces on a tray, brush with the roasting sauce, and roast for 30-40 minutes until soft on the inside and browned on the outside.</p> <p>2 Brush and mix with the miso marinade and set aside to cool.</p> <p>3 When at room temperature, sprinkle with white sesame seeds and serve with rice.</p> <h2><strong>Miso yoghurt chicken</strong></h2> <p>Of course, a miso marinade is a thing of beauty with many a cut of meat. <em>Megumi Yamashita</em> makes her own miso and her own yogurt, and has come up with a beautifully simple marinade using both. The former keeps the meat moist and tender while the latter brings out its flavour.</p> <p><strong>Serves 4</strong><br />4 chicken thighs, skin on bones cut out<br />120g natural yogurt<br />40g miso<br />1 tsp fresh ginger, grated (optional)</p> <p>1 Mix the yoghurt, miso and ginger together and marinate the chicken in this mixture for at least one hour.</p> <p>2 When ready, place the chicken, skin side up, on an oiled baking tray, smear with the remaining marinade and roast in the oven at 190C/375F/gas mark 5 for 20\u201325 minutes or until the skin is crispy.</p> <h2><strong>Miso-stuffed mushrooms</strong></h2> <p>Mushrooms, as we know, are the other secret weapon in the vegetarian\u2019s arsenal of ingredients, so <em>Alfred Dyck\u2019s </em>innovative pairing of mushroom with miso is undoubtedly a winning double whammy. Barley miso has a lovely nuttiness to it, and the partnership of tahini and miso is a combo to remember.</p> <p><strong>Serves 4-6</strong><br />A large handful of coriander<br />1 heaped tbsp barley miso<br />1 heaped tbsp tahini<br />Chilli flakes, to taste<br />Olive oil<br />12 chestnut mushrooms<br />, stalks removed</p> <p>A pinch of ground chilli pepper or paprika</p> <p>1 In an electric blender, combine the coriander with sufficient olive oil to achieve a consistent mixture.</p> <p>2 Add a heaped tablespoon of tahini and an equal amount of barley miso.</p> <p>3 Add chilli flakes to taste, and blend until smooth. Add more oil if the mixture becomes too stiff to blend easily.</p> <p>4 Finally, place the mushrooms upside down on a baking tray and fill them with the mixture. Now sprinkle with ground chilli pepper or paprika and bake at 180C/350F/gas mark 4 for 15-20 minutes.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/30/readers-recipe-swap-spelt-dale-berning-sawa\">Readers\u2019 recipe swap: Spelt | Dale Berning Sawa</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>Miso caramel chocolate pots</strong></h2> <p>I might cook with miso practically every day, but until coming across this recipe I had never contemplated its sweet potential. <em><a href=\"https://witness.theguardian.com/user/ColonialCravings\">ColonialCravings</a>\u2019s </em>caramel is a thing of beauty. In fact, if I\u2019m perfectly honest, I didn\u2019t want the chocolate \u2013 just an espresso-style shot of that caramel was the midnight feast I\u2019d been yearning for.</p> <p><strong>Serves 4-6</strong><br /><strong>For the caramel </strong><br />100g soft light brown sugar<br />75ml double cream<br />15g unsalted butter<br />1 tbsp white miso</p> <p> <strong>For the chocolate </strong></p> <p>200ml double cream<br />8 black peppercorns (optional)<br />100g dark chocolate<br />\u00bd tsp vanilla paste<br />A big pinch of cinnamon</p> <p>1 Melt together the ingredients for the caramel in a small saucepan and bring it to boiling point. Reduce the heat and then let it simmer for 2-3 minutes. Set the caramel aside to cool a little.</p> <p>2 Chop the chocolate and add it to a mixing bowl with the cinnamon and vanilla paste. Heat the cream and the peppercorns until just below boiling point and then strain the cream over the chocolate. Let this sit for a minute or two while you divide the caramel between ramekins or small serving glasses.</p> <p>3 Stir the chocolate and cream together, ensuring that it is well blended. Put this and the caramel filled serving dishes in the fridge and forget about it for an hour or so.</p> <p>4 Once the chocolate ganache has cooled and become quite thick (but not set firm) briefly whisk it to incorporate a little air into the mix, so that it is slightly moussy and then spoon it over the caramel layer in the serving dishes.</p> <p>Return the chocolate pots to the fridge to chill and set before serving. Serve with a grating of chocolate on top, if you like.</p>",

      "body": "<h2>Britain\u2019s Got Talent </h2> <p><strong>8pm, ITV<br /></strong>There\u2019s no escaping BGT this week, kicking off with the final round of auditions. The Golden Buzzers are absent, so it\u2019s a fight to the light-entertainment death for a place in those live semi-finals, which will dominate ITV\u2019s evening schedule from Monday to Thursday. As well as the wannabe stars, there are some big names performing in the live shows, with Nick Jonas and Fifth Harmony in the house. Saturday fun you could set your watch by. <em>Hannah Verdier</em></p> <h2><strong>Michael McIntyre\u2019s Big Show</strong></h2> <p><strong>7.50pm, BBC1</strong><br />Sneer if it makes you feel better, but McIntyre\u2019s variety muckabout does its Saturday night family entertainment job very well. After a neat bit of observation about our self-defeating desire to excel in eye tests, the host introduces Katherine Jenkins and mentalist Colin Cloud. In between are the centrepieces: Send To All, featuring the phone of Robbie Savage; and Unexpected Star, which is a five-minute X Factor without the flim-flam. <em>Jack Seale </em></p> <h2>Jutland: WWI\u2019s Greatest Sea Battle</h2> <p><strong>8pm, Channel 4</strong><br />One hundred years ago this month, the biggest naval battle of the first world war took place off Denmark, as more than 250 British and German ships traded salvos, resulting in nearly 9,000 dead. This film follows an expedition to find the wrecks of the lost ships, taking particular interest in one passenger: Nick Jellicoe, grandson of the Royal Navy admiral John Jellicoe, who was derided for failing to finish the German fleet off. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2>The Hollow Crown: the Wars of the Roses \u2013 Richard III </h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC2</strong><br />The saga concludes with the murderous Yorkist taking centre stage, wiping out the majority of his relatives in brilliantly unfeeling fashion. So bloody is this two-hour epic that the Richard III Society urged the programme-makers to emphasise its dramatic provenance. However \u2013 Tudor propaganda or otherwise \u2013 it makes for excellent viewing, as Benedict Cumberbatch leads an ensemble cast including Judi Dench and James Fleet. <em>Hannah J Davies</em></p> <h2>Hinterland </h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC4<br /></strong>The charred body of a convicted murderer, recently released on parole, is found in windswept dunes. It\u2019s a grisly prelude to Tom Mathias and his team investigating a case linked to an earlier killing and a bitter family feud. Matters are complicated further by chief superintendent Prosser\u2019s reluctance to dig too deeply into the past. A sometimes enigmatic series finale that, with a fiery flourish, suggests Mathias may be in deep trouble. <em>Jonathan Wright</em></p> <h2>Live Boxing: David Haye v Arnold Gjergjaj</h2> <p><strong>8pm, Dave</strong><br />Despite his Swiss opponent being undefeated, heavyweight Haye should make short work of this contest at the O2 in London. Perhaps too short work. The veteran could do with a test to see what he\u2019s really made of these days. Of more interest to those with long memories might be the undercard featuring American Shannon Briggs, who in 1998 briefly shook up Lennox Lewis before being TKO\u2019d. He could be next for Haye. <em>David Stubbs</em></p> <h2>Shackleton </h2> <p><strong>9pm, More4<br /></strong>Kenneth Branagh stars in this epic two-parter dramatising Ernest Shackleton\u2019s ill-fated expedition to the south pole in 1914. First shown in 2002, the film is hugely successful at capturing both the open-hearted idealism of the polar explorer and the eventual horror of the trip\u2019s descent into death and madness. It also does a fine job of evoking the last gasps of a certain kind of crazily intrepid, lavishly moustached British adventurer. <em>Phil Harrison</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a0da071cde67328ea640c63f32dd56f8d929f2df\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a0da071cde67328ea640c63f32dd56f8d929f2df/0_104_3007_1803/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Casey Affleck in The Assassination of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Casey Affleck in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Allstar/WARNER BROS</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Film Choice</h2> <p><strong>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford<br />(Andrew Dominik, 2007) Saturday, 9pm, TCM</strong><br />Andrew Dominik\u2019s sombre examination of the outlaw legend is a western of real grandeur and authority. Brad Pitt gives perhaps the performance of his career as Jesse James, an unstable blend of charisma and killer who, as the lawmen close in on his robbing, is increasingly attracted to his own death. Casey Affleck is twitchily affecting as Ford, the hero worshipper-turned-assassin. Shot with grainy, Sam Peckinpah-esque beauty, it\u2019s a dark and complex portrait of an American antihero. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <p><strong>The Hunger Games<br />(Gary Ross, 2012), 9pm, Channel 4</strong><br />The first in the series based on Suzanne Collins\u2019s books creates a dystopia in which a totalitarian state channels the frustrations of the downtrodden masses into a televised gladiatorial game that has teenagers fighting to the death. Nothing new there, except for the striking screen hero: Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s Katniss. <em>PH</em></p> <p><strong>Elena<br />(Andrey Zvyagintsev, 2011), 12.40am, BBC2<br /></strong>Elena (Nadezhda Markina) is a middle-aged nurse who has hit life\u2019s jackpot in marrying her wealthy patient Vladimir (Andrey Smirnov). The only problem is that they loathe each other\u2019s children from their previous relationships: his spoilt daughter and her wastrel son. A delicately nuanced, beautifully acted and photographed film from the Russian director of Leviathan. <em>PH</em></p> <h2>Today\u2019s Live Sport</h2> <p><strong>Test Cricket: England v Sri Lanka, 10.30am, Sky Sports 2<br /></strong>The third day from Headingley. </p> <p><strong>Premiership Rugby: Saracens v Leicester Tigers 12noon, BT Sport 1<br /></strong>Coverage of the opening semi-final featuring the European Champions Cup winners.

Then again, my local gym does classes for a fiver a pop.</p> <p><strong>What does it promise?</strong> Strength, endurance and a great cardio workout, plus it\u2019s terrific for improving coordination.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s it actually like?</strong> While professional MMA fights have been criticised for their violence and the risk of severe injury and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/15/mixed-martial-arts-mma-banned-joao-carvalho-fighter\">even death</a>, training in the gym is much less scary than it sounds. Led by pro fighter Richie Edwards, my mostly female class was split into three parts: punching, takedowns and groundwork. Punching involved the sort of heavy bag combos familiar to anyone who\u2019s boxed before, studded with bodyweight exercises such as press-ups and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/02/is-it-worth-it-burpees-exercise-review\">burpees</a>. The takedown section expanded on this, by letting you grab your sparring partner by the leg and yank them to the ground. Finally, groundwork saw us alternating between punching a\u00a0bag on the ground and crawling over a\u00a0medicine ball in the way you\u2019d crawl over an opponent. At this level, at least, nobody actually gets punched. For now, that\u2019s just how I like it.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/23/is-it-worth-using-swiss-ball-exercise-review\">Is it worth using a Swiss ball?

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s the time of year when Israelis and Palestinians mark the anniversary that matters most to each of them: May 15 is the date of the founding of the Jewish state in 1948. It is also the day that commemorates the Nakba, the flight, expulsion and dispossession of the Palestinians. Nothing underlines more starkly the depth of the unresolved conflict between these two peoples: the independence of the one meant disaster or catastrophe for the other.</p> <p>In the heat of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/28/jeremy-corbyn-denies-labour-crisis-over-antisemitism\">recent controversy</a> in Britain over Zionism and anti-semitism, relatively little attention was paid to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/15/palestinians-nakba-uk-balfour-declaration-dispossession\">the Palestinian side</a> of this ever controversial story. Europe\u2019s Jews were the victims of racism, persecution and extermination on a massive and unprecedented scale during the Nazi era. Palestinians, in their turn, in a different way, were victims too.</p> <p>Salman Abu Sitta\u2019s autobiography is a vivid and angry reminder of that. It tells the story of just one of some 750,000 Palestinians who became refugees in the war that followed the UN decision to partition the country in 1947. When he was growing up near Beersheba in the final decade of the British mandate, Jews were first a distant then a closer and menacing presence, well-organised foreign immigrants with guns and detailed maps. Their motives and experiences were remote and unfamiliar.</p> <p>Abu Sitta takes on board much of the \u201cnew history\u201d largely written by Israelis who punctured the older myths of the war, emphasising the military superiority of Zionist forces and the weaknesses and rivalries on the Arab side. He also provides fascinating glimpses of the Palestinian fedayeen - \u201cinfiltrators\u201d and \u201cterrorists\u201d to the Israelis - who crossed the border after 1948 not only to \u201cdefeat the invader\u201d but to visit abandoned homes and fields on which new settlements were being built.<br /></p> <p>Uprooted to Gaza, the Gulf and far beyond, he trained as an engineer and spent decades <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/nov/26/palestinian-refugees-middle-east-conflict\">tracking down maps</a> to document his lost homeland. In Cairo and Kuwait he met the \u201cindefatigable\u201d Yasser Arafat and others who formed the Palestinian liberation movement, Fatah, and the PLO, some later assassinated by the Israelis. \u201cWe all believed in armed resistance as the route to recovering our homes,\u201d he writes. Abu Sitta humanises a story which has been largely told from the Israeli side.</p> <p>His book is a forceful re-statement of the Palestinian conviction that Zionism is illegitimate, from the Balfour Declaration of 1917 to the present day. Compromise is treachery, as in 1974 when the PLO first began to make \u201ccalamitous concessions\u201d that held out the hope of a two-state solution as originally envisaged by the UN - and seemed for a while to be within reach after the first intifada. The Oslo agreement in 1993, offering self-rule but in fact leading to the expansion of settlements in the post-1967 territories, is portrayed as fatal error that was supported by an exhausted Arafat in the name of \u201crealism.\u201d</p> <p>In 1995 Abu Sitta, armed with a foreign passport, returned to the land of his birth to see his family\u2019s estate occupied by kibbutzim that had been founded by Jews hailing from Russia, Ukraine, Germany and South Africa. But by then the \u201cfaceless enemies\u201d he remembered as a 10-year-old child had been transformed into Israelis with their own language, culture, memories and psychology. Palestinians were not part of their world.</p> <p>Now, nearly 70 years since the Nakba, 70% of Israelis were born and raised in a country whose landscape has been transformed almost beyond recognition, most of its Arab character deliberately erased. Alongside that, Abu Sitta\u2019s calculation that the majority of Palestinian refugees live only a few miles from their places of origin in 1948 - and could thus go home again - looks like a case of so near yet so far.</p> <p>Even amidst intensifying talk of the death of the two-state solution, the idea that those aged refugees and millions of their descendants will be be able to exercise their \u201cright of return\u201d to what is now Israel looks like a forlorn hope. Abu Sitta\u2019s memoir conveys a still burning sense of outrage at the injustice of the dispossession of the Palestinians and the denial of their rights - a personal and collective Nakba without end. But it offers scant hope for a better future for two peoples suffering - albeit unequally - under the burden of their intertwined history.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.waterstones.com/book/mapping-my-return/salman-h-abu-sitta/9789774167300\">Mapping my Return: A Palestinian Memoir, by Salman Abu Sitta</a></p>",

      "body": "<p>During my book tour of the US last autumn, my assistant and I joked about an alternate Instagram universe \u2013 would-be posts from less-savoury things behind the scenes ...</p> <p><em>Post one</em>: I\u2019m flying alone, London to New York whilst six months\u2019 pregnant. Got an extremely heavy carry-on suitcase full of chef\u2019s knives, so making friends with the people on my aisle! (cocktail and aeroplane emoji).</p> <p><em>Post two</em>: Interviews and appearances from 6am-11pm today! Fainted in the restaurant this evening and was taken to A&amp;E by the nicest ambulance driver! (ambulance emoji).</p> <p><em>Post three</em>: Severe dehydration all sorted with two IVs of saline and one of potassium! Magnesium is delicious! (orange emoji).</p> <p><em>Post four</em>: Selfie with the OB/GYN who finally sees me after eight hours! Yay! (purple heart emoji).</p> <p><em>Post five</em>: Jet-lag means I can catch up on my emails whilst awake at 3am! #nevernotworking</p> <p>Joking aside, we discovered much incredible baking on the tour. So I am highlighting two recipes that use a single dough. I love a plain doughnut with chocolate glaze but there is always so much dough left over (I\u2019m not a fan of re-forming and re-rolling the scraps because the dough shrinks too much and gets a little tough). Inspired by the twisted chocolate and cinnamon Jewish babka breads we saw all over New York, it\u2019s a great way to use up all the scraps in a loaf where the second rolling would go undetected. Both recipes require a bit of time, but are rich and chocolatey and great fun to make (doughnut emoji).</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/07/mango-curd-recipe-chiffon-cake-anna-jones-baking-the-seasons\">Claire Ptak\u2019s mango buttercream chiffon cake recipe | Baking the seasons</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Chocolate ganache glazed doughnuts (on the cover)</strong></p> <p>You will need a deep-fat fryer or a Dutch oven for this recipe, as well as a 9cm and a 3cm round pastry cutter. This recipe makes enough dough for 6 large doughnuts with scraps to make the babka, below.</p> <p><strong>Makes 6</strong><br /><strong>For the dough</strong></p> <p>7g dried yeast (one sachet)<br />50g caster sugar<br />120ml water, warm from the tap<br />500g strong white flour<br />2 tsp fine sea salt<br />3 large eggs<br />125g butter</p> <p><strong>For the chocolate ganache glaze </strong><br />150g dark chocolate (70%)<br />100g double cream<br />50g sour cream or creme fraiche <br />100ml water<br />2 tbsp caster sugar<br />1 tbsp vanilla extract<br />\u00bd tsp fine sea salt <br />Chocolate sprinkles and cocoa nibs (optional)<br />1 litre vegetable oil for frying</p> <p>1 First, make the dough. Cut the butter into 1cm pieces.</p> <p>2 In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, dissolve the yeast and sugar in the warm tap water. Add the flour and salt, and mix to form a dough. Add the eggs one by one, and beat for about 10 minutes. Add pieces of butter one by one, until fully incorporated into the dough (about 10 more minutes). Cover the bowl loosely with clingfilm, and leave to rise until doubled in size (about 2 hours). Punch the dough down in the middle with a fist to knock out some of the air. Re-cover with clingfilm and chill overnight.</p> <p>3 When ready to make your doughnuts, use a dough scraper or spatula to remove the chilled dough from the bowl, and turn out on to a liberally floured surface. Sprinkle the dough with more flour, and roll out into a 1.5cm thick square.</p> <p>4 Use a 9cm round cutter to cut 6 rounds, and then use the 3cm cutter to cut holes out of the centre of each round to make a doughnut. Reserve the scraps for the babka recipe below.</p> <p>5 Carefully place the doughnuts on to floured baking trays, leaving plenty of room for them to rise. Leave to rise 45 minutes before frying.</p> <p>6 Line a baking sheet with kitchen paper and set aside. Also have a wire rack placed over a baking tray lined with paper to catch the drips, ready for your glazed doughnuts.</p> <p>7 Make your glaze. Take 100g of chocolate and chop into small pieces, then transfer to a small bowl. Heat the double cream in a small saucepan until just below the boil. You know it is at the right point when it starts to foam and steam. Watch that it doesn\u2019t boil over. Remove the pan from the heat, and pour over the chocolate. Let sit for 10 minutes to melt, and then stir until smooth \u2013 this is the ganache mixture.</p> <p>8 Wash out the saucepan used to heat the cream, and add the remaining 50g of chocolate, sour cream or creme fraiche, water, caster sugar, vanilla extract and salt. Heat over a medium-low flame, whisking periodically until all the ingredients have melted. Turn up to medium-high, and cook for 5 minutes more, to thicken the sauce slightly. Remove from the heat and whisk together with the chocolate ganache mixture to form your glaze.</p> <p>9 Leave in a warm place away from drafts until ready to use. If your glaze gets too cold and thick, you can place it over a pot of boiling water for a few minutes to melt it again.</p> <p>10 Use a clean pastry brush to dust off as much flour as possible from the doughnuts before frying them.</p> <p>11 Heat a deep pot of vegetable oil or your deep fryer to 180C/350F, and carefully lower the doughnuts into the hot oil. Fry for 5 minutes on one side then flip over and finish frying on the other side (roughly 2 more minutes). Lift the doughnuts out of the hot oil with a spider or slotted spoon, and place on the prepared baking sheet.</p> <p>12 While your doughnuts are still warm, dip them one by one with your hands into your melted chocolate glaze. I like to fully immerse them on both sides so they are completely covered wiht the glaze.</p> <p>13 Set the glazed doughnuts on the prepared wire rack. Sprinkle with cocoa nibs or chocolate sprinkles, if you like.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c7ab84fbb198fe235739a8f10de237c44811d0a6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c7ab84fbb198fe235739a8f10de237c44811d0a6/0_454_3934_2360/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Delicious chocolate babka\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Delicious chocolate babka</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Kristin Perers for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Doughnut babka</strong><br />Halfway between a challah bread and a cake, the babka is quintessential New York fare.</p> <p><strong>Makes 1 loaf</strong><br />\u00bd the quantity of doughnut dough (see recipe above; or dough scraps from making doughnuts)</p> <p><strong>For the filling</strong><br />80g hazelnuts<br />80g butter<br />100g brown sugar<br />100g dark chocolate (70%)<br />30g cocoa powder<br />\u00bc tsp fine sea salt</p> <p><strong>For the syrupy soak</strong><br />80g caster sugar<br />100g water<br />2 tbsp honey<br />A pinch of salt<br />1 tbsp Amaretto</p> <p>1 Butter and line a large loaf tin, approximately 13x25cm.</p> <p>2 To make the filling, toast the hazelnuts on a baking sheet for 5-7 minutes until golden. Chop finely and set aside.</p> <p>3 Measure the butter, brown sugar, chocolate and cocoa powder into a saucepan. Cook over a medium heat, whisking continuously until melted.</p> <p>4 On a lightly floured surface, push the doughnut scraps together into a ball and re-roll them out into a square roughly 30x30cm. Spread with the chocolate mixture, and sprinkle with chopped hazelnuts and salt. Roll the dough up into a log, then using a sharp knife, divide the log in half lengthwise, revealing the chocolate centre.</p> <p>5 Carefully twist the two log halves around each other in a rope-like fashion. You might lose some of the filling here, but don\u2019t worry. Carefully lift the rope of dough into your prepared baking tin, tucking the ends underneath.</p> <p>6 Cover loosely with clingfilm, and leave to rise for 2 hours, or until doubled in bulk. Heat your oven to 180C/160C fan/350F/gas mark 4.</p> <p>7 Meanwhile make the syrup. Boil together all of the ingredients, and set aside.</p> <p>8 Bake the babka for 45-50 minutes, or until a skewer inserted comes out clean. Remove from the oven and pour the syrup over the piping hot loaf. It is a lot of syrup, but don\u2019t worry, the babka will take it.</p> <p>9 Cool completely before removing from the tin and serving.</p> <ul> <li><em>Claire Ptak is an author and food stylist and runs Violet Bakery in London.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-21T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>My London teenage life revolved around a holy trinity: Stratford library, shopping at the Mango sale to feel sophisticated, and lots of <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106145/\">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a>. But imagine a teenagehood in which glamour was a life habit: school in Switzerland, being photographed by Andy Warhol, fashion catwalks. Oh, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHhb5HOjmEc\">your mum is Diana Ross</a>. This was the real teenage life of <a href=\"http://traceeellisross.com\">Tracee Ellis Ross</a>, and if I didn\u2019t love her so much, I\u2019d be wildly jealous.</p> <p>I know it sounds like a cliche: daughter of megastar tries to be famous in her own right as a Hollywood actor. But hold on: Ellis Ross, 43, is criminally underrated. I first saw her as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4iMpVCkrWY\">Joan Clayton</a>, a neurotic lawyer/mother hen to a group of friends in the LA sitcom <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0247102/\">Girlfriends</a>. In Joan, Ellis Ross spread her wings as a hugely gifted physical comedian. Her large eyes dance with mischief, widening for hyperbolic farce or narrowing for droll wit, and she excels at the dramatic stuff, too. She played Joan for eight years, and it\u2019s a mystery that she wasn\u2019t inundated with offers. She should\u2019ve been her generation\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000840/bio\">Lucille Ball</a>, because, listen: She. Is. Hilarious. She popped up in (<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWksjbnVdPI\">ex-neighbour</a>) Kanye West\u2019s video for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkwQbuAGLj4\">Touch The Sky</a> for less than 30 seconds, yet stole the show. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/traceeellisross/?hl=en\">Her Instagram</a> is fantastic fun. She plays around with two fabulous alter egos: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KP9sf7e6Pb4\">Caliope</a>, <a href=\"http://amushrm.tumblr.com/\">a too-cool French fashion blogger</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBICAmJ_T1o\">T-Murda</a>, a rapper of considerable (non-)talent. She wears clothes as if she\u2019s doing them a favour. Ellis Ross is the coolest girl in class, yet you don\u2019t hate her.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/apr/23/crush-on-danai-gurira-the-walking-dead\">Why I love\u2026 Danai Gurira</a> </p> </aside>  <p>These days, she\u2019s putting in her comedy hours as Rainbow on the superlatively good family sitcom <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3487356/\">Black-ish</a>. I hope it runs for years, but when it ends, give her all the roles. Please?</p>",

      "body": "<p>On Friday evening my wife receives a\u00a0text from a neighbour asking us to keep the noise down. It is a jokey, good-humoured text, but it contains a\u00a0grain of seriousness: there is too much noise. My wife\u2019s breezy reply has a similar frankness at its core. \u201cI\u2019m in Frome\u201a\u201d it says.</p> <p>We are both in Frome, on one of those rare occasions when my wife comes to see the band play. Our normal strategy when leaving the house overnight is to keep the news from the children until the last minute, to prevent them making plans. It seems we have not reckoned with their knack for impromptu socialising.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"100713d2c786b5a78e2bf57b0e8459c415a0815b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/100713d2c786b5a78e2bf57b0e8459c415a0815b/0_144_581_623/466.jpg\" alt=\"Benoit Jacques for the Guardian\" width=\"466\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>My wife sends a text to the youngest one telling him to vacate the garden. A few minutes later she receives another text from the neighbour assuring her that all is now eerily quiet.</p> <p>On Saturday my wife arrives home hours before I do \u2013 I have another gig to play. She sends me a text that makes our miscalculation plain: our night away coincided with the last day of classes for the upper sixth. Upwards of 30 of them found their way to our house. Everything, she says, is suspiciously clean.</p> <p>When I get home late that night the house seems to be in reasonable order. A few sofa cushion covers have been removed, presumably for washing. I don\u2019t look too closely at the rest of it.</p> <p>The next morning my wife is already out of bed when I wake up. I find her in the garden, picking plastic cups out of the wisteria.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m amazed there weren\u2019t more complaints,\u201d she says. The beds, I notice, are marked by deep\u00a0footprints.</p> <p>\u201cWhat are we doing?\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s a chicken,\u201d she says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c16b6084b120f6de858ae254dc8761abbe04fa02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c16b6084b120f6de858ae254dc8761abbe04fa02/0_103_543_653/416.jpg\" alt=\"Benoit Jacques for the Guardian\" width=\"416\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>I go back inside and turn on the oven.

The youngest will follow a year later.\u00a0All too soon eerie silence will be the norm.</p> <p>I look up to see Constance standing in the\u00a0doorway.</p> <p>\u201cGod I feel awful,\u201d she says. \u201cHave you got any nail varnish remover?\u201d</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s not staying for lunch,\u201d my wife says.</p> <p>\u201cI said I wasn\u2019t!\u201d Constance says, rolling a fag. \u201cI\u2019m playing tennis at two.\u201d</p> <p>Constance stays for lunch. The youngest one comes downstairs, brimming with hair-raising recollections from the party.</p> <p>\u201cOne guy was running up and down the stairs in your bathrobe,\u201d he tells me. \u201cGoing, \u2018I\u2019m Tim Dowling! I\u2019m Tim Dowling!\u2019\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhat?\u201d I say.</p> <p>\u201cHe doesn\u2019t like that,\u201d my wife says.</p> <p>The middle one appears, looking drained but pleased with himself. He shows me a picture on his phone of someone wearing my bathrobe. The\u00a0doorbell rings.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s Pat,\u201d my wife says. \u201cLet him in.\u201d</p> <p>Pat introduced me to my wife 30 years ago and regards our married life as a cautionary tale performed for his benefit. He surveys the scene before him with a look that says: another edifying chapter. Then he sits down to read the paper.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ee56cebddf83229cbfa6391f10df297dd44b9fce\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ee56cebddf83229cbfa6391f10df297dd44b9fce/48_0_586_907/323.jpg\" alt=\"Benoit Jacques for the Guardian\" width=\"323\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>\u201cHave you ever actually played tennis before?\u201d the middle one says to Constance.</p> <p>\u201cI lied and said I could,\u201d she says.

      "body": "<p>When Greek Cypriots head for the polls this Sunday more will be at stake than the make-up of their local parliament. </p> <p>For the island\u2019s two estranged communities, the ballot is being seen as a critical test for peace talks that could end its ethnic divide and, in turn, resolve Europe\u2019s longest-running diplomatic row. </p> <p> \u201cIt\u2019s crunch time,\u201d said Dr James Ker-Lindsay, a Cyprus specialist at the London School of Economics. </p> <p>\u201cThis is a major test for the government after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/cyprus\">Cyprus</a>\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/23/cyprus-crisis-russians-euro-europe-eu\">economic meltdown</a>. In recent months there has been concern that talks have slowed down. These elections are crucial for the negotiations and the prospect of a breakthrough.\u201d</p> <p>Fifty-six MPs stand to be elected to the island\u2019s parliament, the house of representatives, on ballots cast by nearly 543,000 voters. A strong result for president Nicos Anastasiades\u2019s centre-right Democratic Rally (DISY) would, say analysts, allow him to make the concessions necessary to reunite the island\u2019s feuding Greek and Turkish communities in a bi-communal, bi-zonal federation. </p> <p>\u201cIf DISY does well, Anastasiades can say: \u2018I\u2019ve proved myself on the economy, now let me prove myself on Cyprus,\u2019\u201d Ker-Lindsay said. \u201cHe will be in a much stronger position to press ahead with the talks.\u201d </p> <p>Since 1974, when the island was effectively split between its majority population of Greeks in the south and Turks in the north, there have been repeated attempts to solve the problem but all have floundered.<br /></p> <p>The division \u2013 sealed when Ankara invaded in response to an Athens-inspired coup aimed at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/06/turkish-invasion-divided-cyprus-40-years-on-eyewitness-greek-cypriot-family\">uniting Cyprus</a> with Greece \u2013 has only hardened with time. </p> <p>But recent financial turmoil in the internationally recognised south and increased isolation of Turks in the breakaway north have combined to reinvigorate negotiations. </p> <p>Both Anastasiades and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/apr/28/mustafa-akinci-solve-cyprus-problem-turkey-election\">Mustafa Akinci</a>, the Turkish Cypriot leader, are vocal advocates of the benefits of reunification. </p> <p>In the year since Akinci\u2019s own election last May, they have met regularly, with experts calling the peace talks a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reach a settlement. </p> <p>To mark a year of intensive negotiations the two men announced earlier this week that their goal was to reach a comprehensive settlement agreement within 2016. </p> <p>\u201cAlthough there are still difficulties and differences, we are determined to show the necessary will and courage to overcome the remaining outstanding issues,\u201d they said in a joint statement. </p> <p>While headway has been made on power-sharing and governance, territorial adjustments and property rights remain contentious issues. </p> <p>Anastasiades, who has overseen a remarkable economic recovery since the south\u2019s banking crisis three years ago, still faces vehement opposition from hardliners fiercely opposed to reunification. </p> <p>Polls have shown DISY to be well in the lead but supporters have also warned against complacency. </p> <p>About 200 Greek Cypriots who have remained in the north will be transported to voting stations after crossing the island\u2019s UN-patrolled ceasefire line on Sunday. </p> <p>Organisers say every vote will count. </p>",

      "body": "<p>Fifteen months ago I was on an evening flight from JFK bound for London. Very unexpectedly, I was seated alone, although I had bought two tickets a week before. As the plane raced up the east coast towards Newfoundland, the screen map briefly alerted me to New Haven. In that instant I was confronted with the inconceivably complex fact of having left my husband behind, somewhere below me. I love you so, so much he had said, only last night. That morning, he was alive. Now he was pulseless, no longer breathing, unseen, cold and unlit somewhere thousands of feet down there.</p> <p>A vicious, land-grabber of a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/cancer\">cancer</a>, latterly imperceptible to his expert oncologists, and even scans, killed my husband, on 8 February 2015. He died in a hospital in Yale, New Haven, Connecticut, having bludgeoned his way on to a drug trial. He believed it might cure him. I suspect it may even have hastened his death.</p> <p>Neither of us was remotely prepared for this outcome. We never believed it would happen. Our weakness was that we were not capable of living with the spectre of his death imposing itself on our life. Thus, as with several recent high-profile deaths caused by cancer, whose victims did not reveal their illnesses, we said nothing, stayed eerily calm and carried on as usual, with work, love and hope.</p> <p>Ours was a second marriage: we met when I was 42 and he was 49. We were profoundly happy. Andrew was very fit, apparently in perfect health. The words <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/lung-cancer\">lung cancer</a> landed from outer space one afternoon in a locum GP\u2019s consulting room. Andrew had never smoked a cigarette.</p> <p>Even if we had known how little time we had, we would not have done much differently. I am so lucky to have you he would say to me, before he was diagnosed \u2013 and daily after. We had 14 months left after that, mostly symptom-free, with the illness a secret from the outside world. Our children, both his and mine, our families, and those few friends we told complied with his wish to keep the news private, as if to disown the possibility of the disease taking him from us. For some, and we were in that number, denial is the only way. Of course, without him, I now wonder whether it makes the unsayable, death, even more of a shock, when it suddenly presents itself. When he was alive I was protected from this possible intruder into my life, by Andrew, its primary target. Now I am alone with the break-in complete.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Late that night, he winked at me and mouthed, 'I love you so, so much' when I kissed his forehead</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The night before he died he was quiet, but himself. His adult children had arrived in New Haven by now, anxious to help him rally. They left the hospital saying they would visit in the morning, knowing I would remain and call with updates. It had been a long day of interviews with doctors and numerous tests. He needed to sleep. Late that night, he winked at me and mouthed I love you so so much when I kissed his forehead.</p> <p>At 5am he woke up, asked me to get the nurse and, after a violent, brutal struggle to breathe, he died. The children rushed from their hotel but would not see their father again. We left the hospital some 20 minutes later, with his small, wheeled overnight bag. He had not thought he would be in hospital long. I went back to our hotel room, and packed his suitcase in a daze.</p> <p>Within 14 hours of his death I was flying home with an empty seat behind me. Our pair of seats had been given to a grinning couple who sat toasting themselves with glasses of wine, their hands interlinked. I sat upright, speechless, void of appetite, thirst, tears or anything but a void, greater, vaster than I had or have ever known. My clothes, thin jersey and T-shirt, jeans and trainers were the same clothes I had been wearing when he was still alive. For six hours, I stared blankly down at my legs and it all seemed improbable. Impossible. My jersey was his Christmas present to me. My denimed bottom he had patted the day before. He had stroked the grey wool on my forearm. These clothes were part of another world that he and I lived in together. That no longer existed because he no longer did.</p> <p>How would I ever make sense of this?</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/30/mother-cut-contact-abandoned-adult-daughter-mental-health-divorce\">My mother\u2019s 35 years of silence </a> </p> </aside>  <p>Neither of us had been ready in any way for this sudden fatal outcome, which is not to blame anyone but ourselves. The disease was serious; cancer always is. Yet his death was a profound shock.</p> <p>The truth is that when Andrew was alive he did not, could not, bear to ask the question. I would not have asked it on his behalf. I respected him too much and it was his disease, not mine. Perhaps therefore, no one dared to tell us that death might be on its way.</p> <p>Over the following year, with the help of a close group of friends, and family, I have become more used to life without him. It is hard going, painful, solitary, grinding, but there is no choice, no other option. My sons, my work and routine chores are balms, but I mourn and miss him every bloody minute.</p> <p>I will eventually reach the other side, of something, of what I don\u2019t yet know. Most of us <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/bereavement\">bereaved</a> will come to terms with the loss eventually, because we have to. Your life goes on, the one left behind, in a miserable and deformed way. You adapt \u2013 to a half life. Your expectations lower dramatically.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Post chemo and radiotherapy, we were given a tentative but joy-filling all clear</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I remain nonplussed, however, by one aspect of this loss. Perhaps it is the reason for committing to paper the facts. What confounds me is the actual death, the event of death. We use euphemisms such as passing, passing on, passing away, because it is a struggle to understand how a person goes in a split second. It reads idiotic, written down. Yet it is so strange, preposterous, unbelievable, that a human being should go in seconds from being alive \u2013 to dead.</p> <p>Andrew and I could not bear to contemplate his death from this illness when he was alive, though the situation was grave from the beginning. He submitted to extensive radio and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2014/oct/08/chemotherapy-world-war-cancer-mustard-gas\">chemotherapy</a> which unfortunately, one year in, we realised, had not worked. Yet what this meant to us was only, at the time, that we had to find another option.</p> <p>The problem is that the admission of something so alien, so anti-life into life is extremely hard to incorporate. It seemed to him and to me an impossible balance to strike \u2013 especially with the unpredictable and miraculous remissions and recoveries that are now, happily, so often part of a cancer diagnosis.</p> <p>Post chemo and radiotherapy we were given a tentative but joy-filling all clear. Sheer elation, a holiday, and a big new work project for him. Months later, however, new news. The cancer was on the march, fast. He managed to get to the US, where a 40% chance of arresting the disease on a new immunotherapy drug trial seemed great odds. But a few days after his first dose of the drug he started to feel very unwell. After a week, he was desperately uncomfortable. Over the ensuing days he became extremely weak, then unable to eat. Then he had excruciating back pain.</p> <p>Somehow, we lived through that month. There was still no conscious acknowledgement from anyone dealing with him that he might die. We returned to Yale for the second round of the trial. Andrew was admitted, but not given another dose of the immunotherapy drug. Six days later he was dead.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I knew what was about to happen and that he could not be saved. I stood frozen</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In his last days, scattered, micro-tumours hidden deep throughout his organs and skeleton provoked a dramatic systems breakdown. In his last hours, a carat-sized clot of blood ran through his veins to block an artery. In his last minutes, he suffocated in front of me as the frantic crash team ran in, but too late.</p> <p>I stood and watched him die. In those moments, time at once stood both perfectly still and yet seemed to be moving at some hyper-speed. I knew what was about to happen and that he could not be saved. I stood frozen next to him and wordlessly stepped outside as a dozen people I had never met rushed into his hi-tech bedroom.</p> <p>So, I know he is dead.</p> <p>Writing this I realised it reminded me of something else \u2013 equally shocking, although predicted, albeit roughly: giving birth, when life pulsed into the room as my two sons were expelled out of me as hot, wet small humans moving constantly, sucking in breath, struggling into life. Their beginning, in contrast with Andrew\u2019s end. His death, the contradiction of birth but sharing a dreadful synergy. A giant, powerful struggle against something much vaster than him, back to something still, quiet, not there. Not alive.</p> <p>And just as I could not imagine having a baby before I had one, so I could not imagine Andrew dead when he was alive.</p> <p>The physical absence of the dead does not mean psychological invisibility, which further confuses the issue. I have not found him \u201cto be with me\u201d, \u201cguiding me\u201d, \u201cwatching me\u201d, \u201cproud of me\u201d, or any of the well-meant phrases directed my way. He is definitely not here and yet he is blindingly, deafeningly, omnipresent in my days and my nights.</p> <p>He is in my dreams and our home; his DNA is probably on the cups I drink tea from, the toaster he endlessly stood by, his suits that press against my dresses.</p> <p>Too easily, we presume the fact of death can be digested, accepted and yet my experience has not been the case. I saw a coffin I have every reason to believe contained him, and saw it buried. I know he will not return, but his loss perplexes me still.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Here I was, waiting for a cab, but Andrew would not be getting in. He no longer existed</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>In the seconds after he died, the scene I saw<strong> </strong>was imaginable, had I dared to. Four strangers in scrubs now stood around his bed, while I was expected to say goodbye to the still warm body of my husband in front of them. Body temperature, but dead now. Of this I had no doubt, and the crude intubation, his strange position, but, most disconcertingly, the fact that he ignored me as I came in was proof of this. He did not move as I kissed his arm, his chest, stroked his head \u2013 in seconds gathering disturbing evidence of his new, final status. I recall saying: \u201cLove. Love? My love?\u201d, stopping when I realised I was talking to a corpse in front of people I had never met. They looked uncomfortable, tired and resigned as they waited for me to say goodbye.</p> <p>I knew right away I had to leave him. Logic had not deserted me. With a dead body on the bed there is not much to do. I did not say a long goodbye or stand weeping next to his body. I was incredulous I could still breathe because I was immediately no longer in the world I had been in.</p> <p>I collected up his belongings in minutes, all the while berating myself for not packing as neatly as he always did. I stuffed every familiar possession into his brown leather carry-on, then wheeled it smartly down the ICU corridor.</p> <p>I then went down to the hospital reception, marvelling at the fact that I could walk, that I could press the lift button. I waited in the reception for a taxi, to begin the long journey home. Death mingles the epic and the banal, the momentous and the ephemeral. Here I was, waiting for a cab, but Andrew would not be getting in. He no longer existed.</p> <p>A death can still startle when it comes unexpectedly. These days, when people talk of preparing for a good death what prospects for those of us who could not achieve this? Some people can prepare for death through some constitutional strength that Andrew and I simply did not possess. We loved with absolute confidence and trust, so how could we say goodbye to each other? We could never bring ourselves to do so, and so we never did. Our little human hearts.</p> <p>For us, to envisage what might happen was not possible. We could not live with his hypothetical death, we did not admit it into our lives and this, perhaps, is why the death haunts and confounds me still.</p> <p>Fifteen months on, there are daily, acute ambushes of sadness. However, there is little to do, other than to wait it out, oscillate between remembering my old world and the reality of the new one. This is what the bereaved do, carry on as before \u2013 except not, until recollections soften and wane and the dead person becomes a beloved memory. Most of us will grapple our way through the icy, biting loneliness and absence that seems neverending. There isn\u2019t a great deal of choice.</p> <p>In time, his sudden and dreadful death will be subsumed into everything else. I will see it not as the defining event, but in the context of a long life. Perhaps. Meanwhile, his absence remains the presence that contradicts the impossible, unbelievable fact of his death.</p>",

Though it has been seen in a few other places, it has only two strongholds, one in Essex and another in the New Forest, both very vulnerable. </p> <p>That\u2019s why <a href=\"http://www.new-forest-national-park.com/furzey-gardens.html\">I\u2019m visiting Furzey Gardens near Minstead</a> in Hampshire, where in the past it has been found in some numbers. It\u2019s sunny, warm enough for folk to be having tea on the lawn. The buildings close by are thatched. The gardens range down the valley into an area of moist grassland, before crossing paddocks grazed by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2011/aug/09/alpaca-trek-norfolk\">alpacas</a>, donkeys and sheep, to more fields across the stream. </p> <p>For this rare beetle to breed successfully, it needs thatch \u2013 preferably old \u2013 and herb-rich meadows within short flying distance.

Ian Hughes, the project officer, has built a small thatched lodge just below the azalea gardens, and stuffed it with straw. This gives the beetles housing much closer to the rich nectar sources on which they depend. </p> <p>One of the gardeners takes me to the lodge, so that bit is easy. The beetles are known to be out and about, so I begin to search, checking every buttercup and dandelion, scanning the umbellifers, combing through the grasses and examining the flowering shrubs. </p> <p>I\u2019m looking for a handsome insect that can easily be distinguished from <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/species/red-headed-cardinal-beetle\">cardinal</a>, <a href=\"http://www.wildlifetrusts.org/species/red-soldier-beetle\">soldier</a> and other similarly coloured beetles. It has scarlet wing cases with a sharply defined tapering bronze-green patch where they meet. And, if I can get low enough for an eye-to-eye encounter, its face is yellowish, and it has a hairy body.
