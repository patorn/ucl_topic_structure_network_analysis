The transmission started with shots of the nominees arriving; the actor Hugh Bonneville entered wearing dark glasses, for reasons of either sunshine or privacy.</p> <p>Comparison between what was heard inside the Royal Festival Hall and shown on BBC1 revealed that an impassioned speech from Peter Kosminsky, director of Wolf Hall, had been trimmed of its suggestion that Britain without the BBC would resemble North Korea. However, viewers saw Kosminsky, brandishing the drama series statuette, urging politicians to \u201cstop this nonsense\u201d, culminating in a shout of \u201cNo! No!\u201d to Whittingdale.</p> <p>Kosminsky received a scattered standing ovation, those remaining seated possibly representing ITV and Sky, who, at many points during the evening, were at risk of suffering the calumny that the BBC produces the only decent TV shows in Britain.</p> <p>Perhaps sensing the gathering threat of self-congratulation, host Graham Norton began with a notably astringent opening monologue, including gibes at celebrities with injunctions, performers with a reputation for partying affecting their performance and even a Jimmy Savile-related gag.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fd5f27f30ce17761ff725f12ed688536494bcc6f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd5f27f30ce17761ff725f12ed688536494bcc6f/0_26_3000_1800/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sir Lenny Henry with his special award at the Bafta TV awards on Sunday\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sir Lenny Henry with his special award at the Bafta TV awards on Sunday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David M. Benett/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The prize juries had also been notably unsentimental. In the specialist factual category, they overlooked The Hunt, voiced by 90th-birthday boy Sir David Attenborough, in favour of BBC2 documentary Britain\u2019s Forgotten Slave Owners, and, in the leading actress section, ignored a double tug at the emotions \u2013 the much-treasured Sheridan Smith in a heartbreaking drama about cancer, The C-Word \u2013 to honour Suranne Jones for her tremendous tragi-comic turn in Doctor Foster.</p> <p>Both of those odds-beating decisions, though, involved one BBC show beating another, and the possibly threatened national broadcaster had an impressive night, winning in an easy majority of categories: Wolf Hall and Peter Kay\u2019s Car Share got two gongs each. Channel 4 continued its high awards-to-output ratio with a heavy shelf of statuettes for shows including the drama This is England \u201990, the documentaries My Son the Jihadi and The Murder Detectives and Michaela Coel, 28-year-old comedy writer-performer of Chewing Gum.</p> <p>Coel dedicated her award to Victoria Wood and that moment \u2013 linking two shy outsiders who came from outside TV\u2019s usual recruitment pools \u2013 was the most touching of the show.</p> <p>Although non-white prize presenters, including Romesh Ranganathan, made self-deprecating jokes about being \u201cgrateful to diversity targets\u201d for their involvement, the ceremony was far ahead of the Oscars in representation, with Sir Lenny Henry rightly given a special award for his contribution to the industry as both a performer and a campaigner, although he would be the first to tell British TV that only small wars have so far been won in this regard.</p> <p>It was an atrocious night for ITV (two prizes) and Sky (one, for cricket coverage).</p> <p>Executives from those networks seem likely to have gone away fuming that it mustn\u2019t always all be about the BBC.</p> <p>And the BBC\u2019s critics, in politics and the industry, would point out that their objections are not primarily to the programming that comes out of New Broadcasting House but to the internal structures and regulation. It is probably a blessing for the corporation that there are no Bafta categories for best value managers, most efficient public expenditure or best chair of the BBC Trust.</p>",

But then it did happen and we got a shock.\u201d<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"354fbd7ff82e3e27562741ae9a04ff8b4fba593c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/354fbd7ff82e3e27562741ae9a04ff8b4fba593c/0_0_2322_4128/563.jpg\" alt=\"Biagio Russo\" width=\"563\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sergio and Biagio Russu.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Tim Child, the medical director at Oxford Fertility, said NGS replaced older, less precise techniques already used in the pre-implantation genetic screening (PGS) of embryos. NGS costs \u00a32,000 to \u00a33,500 on top of standard IVF fees, which is about half the price of existing screening.<br /></p> <p>The procedure is not available on the NHS, but it may be offered in the future if the trial finds that NGS cuts costs and reduces the time infertile couples wait for a live birth. \u201cI think this will become the standard way to do PGS,\u201d said Child.<br /></p> <p>To screen an embryo, doctors remove a few cells at the five-day-old stage. The cells are taken from the tissue around the embryo that will turn into the placenta that attaches it to the mother\u2019s womb. Unlike traditional screening methods, NGS can spot embryos that have more subtle DNA faults, and embryos that have only some cells with chromosomal defects.</p> <p>More than half of embryos created through IVF do not have the right number of chromosomes, and the faults underlie nearly three-quarters of miscarriages. The NGS procedure should reduce the chances of couples having faulty embryos transferred and give them more confidence in the health of embryos they have frozen after screening.</p> <p>Sergio was working as a scientist in Britain when he met Ewa on a visit to Rome. When the two became close, Ewa explained that she could probably never have children because of past surgery for peritonitis and an ovarian cyst that exploded and nearly killed her at the age of 21.<br /></p> <p>They became a couple and tried to conceive but had no luck. When they married three years ago, they decided to visit an IVF clinic as a last-ditch attempt to have a baby. At Oxford Fertility, a partnership of clinics, doctors found no cause for the couple\u2019s infertility, and offered them a place on the NGS trial.<br /></p> <p>The couple\u2019s first cycle of IVF produced 10 embryos, but DNA screening revealed that only three of them had the normal set of chromosomes in their cells. The other seven had the wrong number of chromosomes and had little chance of producing a healthy baby.<br /></p> <p>Ewa had one embryo transferred to her womb, and the other two healthy embryos frozen for future use. It was the couple\u2019s first attempt at IVF and they did not have high hopes. But one morning, Ewa went downstairs to do a pregnancy test. \u201cIt was positive. She came up the stairs crying,\u201d said Sergio. \u201cWe still have the test.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Ewa had monthly screenings throughout her pregnancy. They showed that the baby was growing well. Then, in January, Biagio was born a very healthy baby. \u201cEverything went magically by the book,\u201d said Sergio.<br /></p> <p>Once the couple have settled into their role as parents, they plan to use the remaining embryos to add to their family. \u201cAs soon as we can support them, we\u2019ll go for the other two, for sure,\u201d said Sergio.</p>",

Finally they have been held to account in public and at great cost to them financially and reputationally.</p> <p>\u201cPreventing 3,213 workers earning a living to support their families was a gross injustice, and government and employers\u2019 organisations must never forget this sordid episode. Without strong regulation and penalties holding them to account, employers will always be tempted to put profit above people.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>The government\u2019s proposed bill of rights will hamper the fight against crime, undermine the UK\u2019s international moral authority and could start \u201cunravelling\u201d the constitution, a cross-party parliamentary committee is warning.</p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/lords-select/eu-justice-subcommittee/\">critical report</a> by the House of Lords\u2019 European Union justice sub-committee urges ministers to rethink plans to scrap the Human Rights Act and highlights fears expressed by the Irish government that the policy could damage the Northern Ireland peace process.</p> <p>Publication of the draft legislation, which is intended to replace the Human Rights Act, has been repeatedly delayed despite the bill of rights being a Conservative party manifesto pledge. It is now expected after the EU referendum.</p> <p>While the justice secretary, Michael Gove, has implied the bill may not be as radical as originally envisaged, others fear that a vote to remain within the EU on 23 June could force Downing Street to appease disappointed Brexiters with a more substantial attack on the European court of human rights in Strasbourg. Last month the home secretary, Theresa May, a supporter of remaining in the EU, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://0.0.7.224/apr/25/theresa-may-michael-gove-exit-tory-leadership-human-rights\">called for the UK to abandon the European convention of human rights</a>. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>\u201cWere the UK to depart from the standards of human rights currently recognised within the EU,\u201d the report states, \u201cthe system of mutual recognition which underpins EU justice and home affairs cooperation would be hampered by legal arguments over its application to the UK. </p> <li>\u201cWe urge the government not to introduce domestic human rights legislation that would jeopardise the UK\u2019s participation in this important area of EU cooperation in the fight against international crime.\u201d</li> <li><br /></li> <li>A bill of rights would upset the devolution settlement, the committee warns: \u201cThe evidence demonstrates that the Scottish parliament and Northern Ireland assembly are unlikely to give consent to a bill of rights which repealed the Human Rights Act.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></li> <li><br /></li> <li>\u201cWere the UK government to proceed without such consent, it would be entering into uncharted constitutional territory. The difficulties the government faces in implementing a British bill of rights in the devolved nations are substantial. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></li> <li><br /></li> <li>\u201cGiven the seemingly limited aims of the proposed bill of rights, the government should give careful consideration to whether \u2026 it means unravelling \u2018the constitutional knitting for very little\u2019.\u201d <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></li> <li><br /></li> <p>During the course of the inquiry, the committee was shown <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/documents/lords-committees/eu-justice-subcommittee/RepealofHRAeffectonEULaw/Minister-Frances-Fitzgerald-toSofSJus.pdf\">a letter sent by the Irish justice minister, Frances Fitzgerald</a>, to Gove asking him to give \u201cthe fullest consideration\u201d to the provisions of the Good Friday agreement which requires the European human rights convention to be incorporated into Northern Irish law.</p> <p>Her letter added: \u201c \u2026 external supervision by the European court of human rights [in Strasbourg] has been an essential part of the peace process and anything that undermines this, or is perceived to undermine this, could have serious consequences for the operation of the Good Friday agreement.\u201d <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p> Two former attorney-generals \u2013 Labour\u2019s Lord Goldmsith and the Conservative Dominic Grieve \u2013 told the committee that a reduced commitment to the ECHR would undermine the UK\u2019s standing within the Council of Europe and around the world. \u201cIt could also put the effective operation of the European Convention on Human Rights, which requires all contracting states to respect its obligations, in jeopardy,\u201d the peers concluded. </p> <p>If the UK did pull out of the Strasbourg court, the report noted, it would probably result in many more cases being taken on the basis of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in Luxembourg.</p> <p>The committee has four Labour members, three Conservatives, three cross-benchers and two Liberal Democrats. Labour peer Baroness Kennedy, who chairs the committee, said that government claims that the armed forces should be exempt from human rights challenges were misguided.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s not about clash of arms [on the battlefield],\u201d she said. It was about ensuring good behaviour in peace-keeping roles.<br /></p> <p>She added: \u201cMany witnesses thought that restricting the scope of the Human Rights Act would lead to an increase in reliance on the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights in UK courts, which has stronger enforcement mechanisms. This seemed to be a perverse consequence of a bill of rights intended to give human rights greater UK identity.</p> <p>\u201cWe heard evidence that the devolved administrations have serious concerns about the plans to repeal the Human Rights Act. If the devolved parliaments withheld their consent to a British bill of rights it might very well end up as an English bill of rights, not something we think the government would want to see.</p> <p>\u201cThe more evidence we heard on this issue the more convinced we became that the government should think again about its proposals for a British bill of rights. The time is now right for it to do so.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>The headline on this article was corrected on 9 May 2016. The report was written by members of the House of Lords, not MPs. </li> </ul>",

We can\u2019t sacrifice that now,\u201d one veteran says in the 60-second video. \u201cFor me, Britain is stronger in Europe because it reflects the values my generation fought for in Europe during the second world war.\u201d </p> <p>\u201cIf it breaks, or if we are not in that union, countries will fall apart. The only solution is to bind together, hold together \u2013 there we find the strength,\u201d says another.</p> <p>\u201cWe would be going backwards and not forwards in what we set out to cure after the terrible tragedies of the second world war,\u201d is the verdict of another.<br /></p> <p>The video will be shown during a speech to be given on Monday by David Cameron. The prime minister will use the address to stress the importance of maintaining ties with Brussels to protect the UK\u2019s national security. </p> <p>His speech comes two weeks after home secretary Theresa May argued that the UK will be better protected from crime and terrorism if it remains a member of the European Union.</p> <p>Lynne Owens, the head of the National Crime Agency, suggested efforts to fight serious crime could be at risk if Britain leaves, while Europol director Rob Wainwright said that 2,500 new cases of cross-border crime and terrorism were initiated through his agency last year by British authorities.</p> <p>However, former MI6 chief Sir Richard Dearlove has said that few would notice the loss of the European arrest warrant because other EU nations would still want to maintain their relationships with the UK. </p>",

I think all the lads know what this team is all about. So why not stay?\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/03/leicester-city-title-inside-story-premier-league-champions-claudio-ranieri\">Leicester City\u2019s triumph: the inside story of an extraordinary season | Stuart James</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It is a question that applies to some of the staff as well as the players, and at the other end of the corridor at the King Power Stadium the man recently described by Sir Alex Ferguson as \u201cthe most influential person in the Premier League\u201d was giving the newly crowned English champions the best possible answer in that respect. Steve Walsh, Leicester\u2019s joint assistant manager and the head of recruitment, confirmed that he would be staying at the club along with Craig Shakespeare, another of Ranieri\u2019s three No2s, for the foreseeable future. \u201cWe\u2019ve not signed [the new contract] but it\u2019s all agreed,\u201d Walsh said, holding a glass of bubbly in his hand.</p> <p>Walsh, with that knack of unearthing rough diamonds, has his fingerprints all over this Leicester team and there was a broad grin on his face when he was asked whether N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9, who has been such a revelation this season, is the pick of the lot. \u201cI keep telling the same joke over and over again,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cNo matter who we\u2019re playing we play three in midfield, we play [Danny] Drinkwater in the middle as a holding player and we play Kant\u00e9 either side.\u201d</p> <p>While it remains to be seen whether Leicester can keep the indefatigable Kant\u00e9, Riyad Mahrez and Jamie Vardy at the club now that the Champions League anthem has been added to the playlist at the King Power Stadium, a clear message has already been transmitted from the dressing room to Walsh about the type of players he seeks to bring in over the summer. \u201cThe players have said to me: \u2018We don\u2019t want any Bertie Big,\u2019\u201d Walsh said, leaving out the expletive. \u201cI think you\u2019ve got to bring in people who fit in.\u201d</p> <p>Targets were being drawn up a long time ago with a view to adding quality as well as depth to a squad that, as Ranieri acknowledged, will have a far greater workload compared with this season because of their involvement in Europe. \u201cI hope we can find good players and make some replacements because next season there will be three cups and the Premier League and it will be important to be able to make good changes and give some rest to the players,\u201d Leicester\u2019s manager said.</p> <p>The draw for the Champions League group stage takes place on 25 August \u2013 almost eight years to the day since Leicester beat Tranmere Rovers 3-1 at home in League One \u2013 and Ranieri can already sense the mood in Monaco when his club\u2019s name appears on that little slip of paper plucked from among the first seeds. \u201cI believe when they make the draw for the Champions League a lot of teams will want to play against us because we are in [this competition] for the first time and they think we are underdogs,\u201d Ranieri said. \u201cWe are underdogs but we are dangerous.\u201d</p> <p>For all that football never stands still, in some ways to focus on the future seems a little unfair in the immediate aftermath of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/gallery/2016/may/08/leicester-citys-premier-league-title-celebrations-in-pictures\">an occasion as uplifting and emotional as Saturday</a>. So many images are seared into the mind, from the sight of Ranieri proudly standing alongside Andrea Bocelli as the Italian tenor produced such a spine-tingling performance, to that wonderful and surreal moment later in the evening when Wes Morgan and his 64-year-old manager thrust the Premier League trophy into the night sky to a backdrop of fireworks and tears.</p> <p>They were extraordinary scenes to try to take in and digest, for the players as well as the fans. \u201cWe won it on Monday night at Jamie\u2019s house. But to actually see it there, walk up and put the medal round your neck and see your skipper lift it, it hits you,\u201d Danny Simpson said. \u201cThe medal\u2019s not coming off for weeks.\u201d</p> <p>There is no time to rest and let everything soak in. The club\u2019s annual awards dinner is on Tuesday evening, Vardy is in London on Thursday night to collect his Football Writers\u2019 player of the year trophy, Ranieri returns to Stamford Bridge on Sunday in what promises to be another special occasion and the following day <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/06/leicester-premier-league-title-parade-16-may\">the open-top bus winds its way through the streets of Leicester</a> for one more party.</p> <p>English football may never be the same again. \u201cI think we have proved that anything is possible,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cYou can go through the group individually. But it\u2019s a team game and that is what we have proved this season. We are a team. Every single one of us has a little story, for whatever reason at other clubs. We\u2019ve all come to Leicester, a great family club, and we have gelled as a group. Every one of us has excelled.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Andy King (Leicester City)<br /></p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-09T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>This result came as a surprise to everyone except the man it appeared to wound the most. Slaven Bilic had warned West Ham against complacency as they entered the final few matches of the season, to \u201cnot buy the theory that clubs who are safe are going to roll over\u201d, and so little wonder the manager was left \u201cfuming and angry\u201d after those in claret and blue appeared to do just that in what was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/west-ham-swansea-city-premier-league-match-report\">the last weekend fixture to take place at Upton Park</a>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/memories-upton-park-west-ham-boleyn-ground\">Nine decades of memories of Upton Park as West Ham prepare to depart</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The final match to be staged at the stadium comes against Manchester United on Tuesday evening and is sure to be an emotional occasion under the lights as supporters, officials and players past and present say goodbye to the club\u2019s home of the past 112 years. An obvious theory is that it is actually the attention that has been focused on that fixture for weeks now \u2013 east London\u2019s very own long goodbye \u2013 rather than an underestimation of the opposition that led to the hosts\u2019 capitulation against Swansea. But Bilic was quick to insist that was not the case and, if anything, his players should be motivated by being part of Hammers history. \u201cThey were approaching today\u2019s game and on Tuesday as having a privilege to play the last games ever here, so I wouldn\u2019t use that as an excuse,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should be an inspiration.\u201d</p> <p>Whatever the reasons for West Ham\u2019s startlingly sluggish and disjointed display, they need to recover quickly, and not just to ensure the fizz is not taken out of Tuesday\u2019s celebrations, which according to Saturday\u2019s programme will include \u201cspectacular lighting, music and a big screen video to match the scale and emotion of the evening\u201d.</p> <p>Victory would maintain their chances of finishing ahead of United in fifth and therefore matching their best-ever Premier League finish (achieved in the 1998/99 season), as well as bolstering their hopes of qualifying for the Europa League, which is under threat following this defeat and Southampton\u2019s win at Tottenham. Manchester City\u2019s draw with Arsenal on Sunday means West Ham do also retain a slim chance of a top-four finish. \u201cNothing can ruin our good season but we still want to finish as high as possible,\u201d said Bilic. \u201cWe have a great opportunity coming very soon and so we have got to be positive. We know where we failed here. We have to forget that and prepare for Tuesday. But we should not forget that we are not the biggest club in the world and that these players have shown me great quality and character during the whole season. One, two or three games does not change that.\u201d</p> <p>For Swansea the aim going into their final fixture, against Manchester City, is to cement a top-half finish, which would be a remarkable achievement given they appeared destined for relegation at the turn of the year. Under Francesco Guidolin the Welsh club have been transformed, with this their third win in five games.</p> <p>Guidolin made six changes to the side that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/01/swansea-city-liverpool-premier-league-match-report\">beat Liverpool last week</a>, and subsequently secured their top-flight status and it bodes well for Swansea\u2019s long-term future that those who came in for the likes of Ashley Williams and Gylfi Sigurdsson impressed, no one more so than Ki Sung-yueng, who played a role in the visitors\u2019 first goal, scored by Wayne Routledge, scored their third himself and generally impressed with his link-up play from central midfield.</p> <p>Andr\u00e9 Ayew and Baf\u00e9timbi Gomis also struck for Swansea, whose only regret was that they conceded via Stephen Kingsley\u2019s 68th-minute own-goal.</p> <p>\u201cI hope to see my team play this way on Sunday,\u201d said Guidolin, before confirming that he has yet to be told if he will be kept on by Swansea beyond the end of the season.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Ki Sung-yueng (Swansea City)</p>",

      "body": "<p>It is only a short step across the A316 from The Stoop to Twickenham but Exeter are on the verge of the biggest leap in their history. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/07/harlequins-exeter-premiership-match-report\" title=\"\">Keep playing this well</a> and the notion of the Chiefs becoming champions of England a mere six years on from their Championship promotion will not be remotely fanciful.</p> <p>\u201cWe want to go all the way,\u201d their England winger Jack Nowell said. \u201cWe\u2019ve worked hard all season to get into this position. It\u2019s important to us not to let it slip now.\u201d</p> <p>The 10 imperious tries his side put past a sluggish Harlequins on Saturday are just the latest sign that Devon\u2019s finest have the Aviva Premiership final this month firmly in their sights. No team scored more tries or conceded fewer points in the regular season and only one side \u2013 Saracens \u2013 has beaten them at Sandy Park in the past 16 months. Given they defeated their semi\u2011final opponents <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/01/exeter-wasps-premiership-match-report\" title=\"\">Wasps 24-3 a week ago</a>, any sense of West Country inferiority has long since disappeared.</p> <p>Nor is the Chiefs\u2019 sage head coach, Rob Baxter, in the mood to settle for gallant runner-up status, having spent the past month hammering home the message that anything is now attainable. \u201cWe started saying five or six weeks ago that the season\u2019s been so good we didn\u2019t want it to end. That\u2019s the sort of season you want. I genuinely think the whole squad are all enjoying it. It will be a bit disappointing when it all finishes.\u201d</p> <p>Both Baxter and Nowell reckon it now requires an extremely good side to upset them at home and the tempo of their game is blowing away sides displaying even a hint of weariness. Wasps, at least, will be forewarned but, having already lost home and away to the Chiefs in the league, will need their forwards to get an early grip. \u201cApart from the loss to Saracens we haven\u2019t lost at home, including in the Champions Cup,\u201d Baxter said. \u201cI would be disappointed if that home spirit doesn\u2019t continue.\u201d</p> <p>There are faint echoes of Leicester City in the way Exeter have challenged the establishment even if Baxter is not about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/05/claudio-ranieri-leicester-city-premier-league-title\" title=\"\">to compare himself \u2013 \u201cWho\u2019s he?\u201d \u2013 with Claudio Ranieri</a>. In Nowell, however, the Chiefs have their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/leicester-everton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">own Jamie Vardy-esque talisman</a> and the former\u2019s hat-trick again underlined the Cornishman\u2019s maturing talent. His best try owed plenty to a wonderful long pass from the classy Henry Slade but the way in which he created the first of James Short\u2019s two scores, hunting expertly for a mismatch before surging into space, would have impressed the watching Eddie Jones. \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t reinforce his international credentials, nothing will,\u201d Baxter said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/mar/25/luke-cowan-dickie-exeter-chiefs-saracens-rugby-union-premiership\">Exeter Chiefs and the rise from Devon minnows to England\u2019s big fish | Robert Kitson</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Nowell, however, insists the credit is collective and senses a hunger to build on the club\u2019s A-league final victory last Monday. There is also a burning desire to reward those who paved the road to the top, not least the stalwart prop Brett Sturgess, who is leaving the club.</p> <p>\u201cThis is the business end,\u201d Nowell said. \u201cYou know what we\u2019re like at Exeter \u2026 once we\u2019ve got one thing we want the next. At the moment it\u2019s not the end of the journey. It\u2019s important for us to keep going forward and to keep attacking. As Rob says, we\u2019re now two games away from being Premiership champions. When we\u2019ve got the Sandy Park crowd behind us it\u2019s not the nicest place for opposition to come.\u201d</p> <p>This was definitely not the nicest of experiences for Quins, who have never leaked as many league points at The Stoop. Their Challenge Cup final this Friday offers a last shot at elite-level European qualification next season but Conor O\u2019Shea and his senior players all apologised to the club\u2019s fans after this pallid effort. If they can bounce back from this humiliation to defeat Montpellier in Lyon it will say much for the character of all concerned.</p> <p><strong>Harlequins</strong> Brown; Yarde, Stanley, Roberts (Marchant, 68), Chisholm; N Evans (Botica, 51), Care (capt; Dickson, 62); Lambert (O Evans, 62), Ward (Buchanan, 58), Collier (Sinckler, 49), Merrick, Matthews (Twomey, 53), Robshaw, Clifford, Easter (Luamanu, 62).</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Care, Sinckler, Stanley. <strong>Cons</strong> N Evans, Botica 2. <strong>Pen</strong> N Evans.</p> <p><strong>Exeter</strong> Dollman; Nowell (Woodburn, 55), Slade, Hill (Whitten, 52), Short; Steenson, Chudley (Lewis, 72); Hepburn (Moon, 51), Yeandle (capt; Cowan-Dickie, 52), Williams (Rimmer, 55), Lees (Horstmann, 66), Welch (Parling, 53), Ewers, Salvi, Waldrom.</p> <p><strong>Tries</strong> Short 2, Nowell 3, Ewers, Dollman, Chudley, Slade, Salvi. <strong>Cons</strong> Steenson 6.</p> <p><strong>Referee</strong> W Barnes (RFU). <strong>Att</strong> 14,800.</p>",

An absolute gentleman of the game.\u201d</p> <p>It was not an exit that was worthy of Matfield\u2019s distinguished career, a contest to decide where Northampton finished among the also-rans after they had failed to qualify for the play-offs for the first time since 2009. Like other clubs with a significant number of players who were involved in the World Cup, the tournament proved disruptive, but not decisively so according to their director of rugby, Jim Mallinder.</p> <p>\u201cWe lost away to the bottom three sides and if you want to make the top four, you have to win those matches,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to regroup over the summer and freshen things up a bit. We have announced a few signings and there will be a couple more. We need to do things a little bit differently and progress our game. We want to be challenging for silverware every year. That is the pressure we put on ourselves.\u201d</p> <p>Six of Northampton\u2019s back division were full internationals, in contrast to Gloucester who were without 13 players behind the scrum, but it was the exception who stood out. Harry Mallinder created the Saints\u2019 first two tries and if one of the tactical tweaks is to make optimum use of turnover possession, he will have a role to play with his ability to create and exploit space, in his preferred position of centre rather than full-back.</p> <p>Gloucester did not have one first-choice back playing in his preferred position and they were forced to bring on their academy fly-half Lloyd Evans in the first quarter when the full-back Tom Marshall was injured. Evans scored their first try and the home side led 20-8 five minutes before the break, but once the rain started to fall Northampton played for position.</p> <p>\u201cWe will have a stronger squad next season, but it takes time, especially when you are bringing through young players,\u201d David Humphreys, the Gloucester director of rugby, said.</p> <p>\u201cWe need a squad filled with players of quality who will deliver the success we want. It was a disappointing way to finish the season, especially after leading, but it will have done the younger players good. You can make them bigger and stronger, but experience comes from playing.\u201d</p> <p>Matfield has played a bit, retiring four days shy of his 39th birthday 21 years after he was picked in South Africa\u2019s academy. He has made most of his appearances for Northampton off the bench since arriving after the World Cup, as he did on Saturday, coming on for the final 22 minutes to help the Saints maintain control.</p> <p>\u201cI had a chat with Victor at the end,\u201d Mallinder said. \u201cHe has been fantastic for us. He did not come here to play 80 minutes 32 times but be a part of the squad. He has played a massive part for us.\u201d</p> <p>Joining Matfield on his way out of Northampton is the Samoa scrum-half Kahn Fotuali\u2019i, who confirmed that he was joining Bath.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The only Premier League team with a worse record away from home than Newcastle United are Aston Villa, and they were relegated weeks ago. Rafa Ben\u00edtez has made a difference on Tyneside \u2013 in other circumstances, a five-match unbeaten run would be something to celebrate \u2013 but ultimately <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/aston-villa-newcastle-premier-league-report\" title=\"\">Newcastle\u2019s toothlessness in attack cost them dear</a> at a ground where they ought to have been able to pick up three priceless points.</p> <p>As a result the chances are high that these two sides will be meeting in the Championship next season. Ben\u00edtez is unlikely to still be around by then.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/08/jack-colback-investigated-fa-betting-rules-according-to-reports\">Jack Colback investigated for breaking betting rules, according to reports</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This time a year ago he was enjoying a degree of success with Napoli, then he tried his luck on the Real Madrid carousel. The irony of a former Liverpool manager needing a huge favour from Everton to keep his club alive until the last day of the season did not escape anyone at Villa Park, but while he might have been undiplomatic in the past over trans-Stanley Park relations, for now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/feb/05/match.sport13\" title=\"\">\u201cthe small club\u201d</a> represents a straw that can be clutched.</p> <p>\u201cI think Everton are going well away, so we have to believe they can get that result at Sunderland,\u201d Ben\u00edtez said, speaking at roughly the same time as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/leicester-everton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Jamie Vardy and his pals were punching holes</a> in the one positive aspect of Roberto Mart\u00ednez\u2019s season at the King Power stadium.</p> <p>\u201cWe cannot control what they do, we are in a bad position now because we have been a bit unlucky in a few matches but it is too late to change anything. All we can do is be sure that if we get an opportunity to save ourselves in our last match against Tottenham we are ready to take it.\u201d</p> <p>Newcastle\u2019s home form is a lot better than their away record, though Ben\u00edtez is astute enough to know that a side incapable of seizing victory against the worst team in the Premier League this season has no right to hope of a result against one of the best. The same logic suggests that a Sunderland side who can mount a successful comeback against Chelsea might not have too much trouble securing a victory over a listless Everton, so Newcastle might not even get the chance to rescue their season. Would Ben\u00edtez stay on for next season if relegation was to be confirmed on Wednesday? \u201cI still think we have a chance of staying up and for now we will be continuing with this idea,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Could he have made more of a difference had he arrived on Tyneside a little earlier, with a few more games to play? \u201cI don\u2019t think that is a fair question. I accepted the challenge because I had confidence in the potential of the club. It could be different if Jack Colback or Aleksandar Mitrovic had scored. We would have given ourselves a fighting chance.\u201d</p> <p>Well, yes it could. But Ben\u00edtez was talking about Newcastle\u2019s only opportunities of a long afternoon. Colback is a midfielder and Mitrovic came on only in the second half. Newcastle simply do not carry enough of a goal threat, and that has been the story of their season.</p> <p>Villa are no better, they barely even tried to attack Newcastle and failed to register a shot on target, and Ben\u00edtez was not fooling anyone when he suggested that their switch to three at the back has made them tougher to score against. This was a relegation party to compete with the title celebrations taking place along the M69 in Leicester, complete with balloons and inflatable beachballs littering the pitch to such an extent that play was held up in the second half.</p> <p>For a while Ben\u00edtez must have felt as if his Premier League past was coming back to haunt him. Beachballs, Sunderland, Everton. Villa have known their fate for some time and seem prepared to accept it. \u201cWe will never die\u201d scarves were available outside the ground. \u201cWe will bounce straight back\u201d scarves were notable by their absence, though Eric Black, as he must, emphasised the positives.</p> <p>\u201cThis is a phenomenal club that should be in the top six or seven in the country, so there is a fabulous opportunity here,\u201d the caretaker said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying next season is going to be easy, because the Championship is difficult. But if the right people are put in place, I don\u2019t see any reason why the club can\u2019t come back.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Moussa Sissoko (Newcastle United)</p>",

Having <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/01/saracens-newcastle-premiership-match-report\" title=\"\">wrapped up top spot in the Premiership</a> the week before, a lot of sides might not have been too bothered to find themselves 14-7 down after 20 minutes on Saturday, but Saracens\u2019 response was ruthless.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/07/saracens-richard-wigglesworth-england-racing-92\">Saracens\u2019 Richard Wigglesworth motivated by World Cup failure</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By half-time they had scored four tries for the bonus point that would take their total at the top of the table to 80. If the other four points for the win were ever in doubt, they certainly were not once the sixth try had been registered with 15 minutes to go. They enter the climax of their season in formidable shape.</p> <p>Chris Ashton was predatory and finished with a hat-trick. Jamie George made a welcome return after 10 weeks out with injury, as did George Kruis. Alex Goode was untouchable for the 42 minutes he was on the field. Mark McCall, his director of rugby, thinks he is the best full-back in England. It is a position of strength for England, but he continues to do all he can. He slashed through Worcester\u2019s defence time after time, setting up tries one, two and four with his extraordinary footwork and eye for space. Who knows what carnage he may have wrought, had his coaches not decided a mere 90 seconds into the second half that they had seen enough. Goode left the field with a bemused grin on his face, having only just taken to the fray with his mates after half-time.</p> <p>There was plenty of time for smiling, but Saracens know all too painfully that the serious stuff starts here. Two years ago they finished top of the Premiership with even more points than they have this time, and they reached the final of Europe. They came away with nothing, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/may/24/toulon-saracens-heineken-cup-final-match-report\" title=\"\">beaten up by Toulon in the Heineken Cup final</a> and mugged by Northampton\u2019s try in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/may/31/northampton-saints-beat-saracens-premiership-final-match-report\" title=\"\">last minute of extra-time in the Premiership final</a>. According to Goode, they have taken inspiration from NBA\u2019s San Antonio Spurs, bouncing back in similar style <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/may/30/bath-saracens-premiership-match-report\" title=\"\">to win last season\u2019s Premiership</a> after the previous season\u2019s pain.</p> <p>\u201cIt was about us all getting on one page and pounding the rock, as we call it,\u201d Goode said. \u201cWe use the San Antonio Spurs as a great example. They had lost in the NBA finals [in 2013] and gone back to their processes of pounding the rock, pounding the rock \u2013 and they won the NBA championship the next year. We did a similar thing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/07/racing-92-dan-carter-example-saracens-battle\">Racing 92\u2019s Dan Carter sets an example to all before Saracens battle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI think we\u2019ve grown a lot as a team. A lot of those players who played in 2014 are still at the club and have become stronger for that. There\u2019s certainly no belief that it\u2019s our destiny. We\u2019ve got to earn the right to win against an incredibly strong Racing. What happened two years ago is that caution. We certainly won\u2019t be getting ahead of ourselves. We\u2019ll prepare unbelievably well. The guys who didn\u2019t play today have already started preparations.\u201d</p> <p>Dean Ryan, Worcester\u2019s director of rugby, was philosophical about this heavy defeat to round off an encouraging first season back in the Premiership. It served as a reminder of the disparity in squad strength between his club and where they aim to be. But they finish the season with 47 tries, one short of their highest tally in the Premiership, and they install an artificial pitch next season, which should suit the entertaining brand of rugby they are developing.</p> <p>Nearly 10,000 roared them on here in a dead rubber. If many more turn up next season, they will take advantage of planning permission to expand Sixways.</p> <p>\u201cThere\u2019s an upward trajectory,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI think people are excited. It showed in that run of five [wins] out of six. We\u2019ve seen what it can look like. We are growing. And if we grow and the demand grows, I\u2019m sure the relevant people - not me \u2013 will make decisions about whether we can increase. But it\u2019s getting the rugby right first, and that\u2019s my job. I\u2019m genuinely excited, but I haven\u2019t lost sight of the challenge. People want to run to the end very quickly, and the end is the opposition today. It takes a long time to get to that stage.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>The performance demanded the question was asked, and there was no one better than Alan Pardew to answer it. Dwight Gayle burst relatively late into professional football, his reputation forged in non-league as a quick, tricky and prolific striker. He has endured lengthy periods on the fringes at Crystal Palace this season, more latterly through injury, but there is no more instinctive finisher in this club\u2019s ranks. Manchester United await in the FA\u00a0Cup final at Wembley.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/crystal-palace-stoke-premier-league-report\">Dwight Gayle makes Crystal Palace safe with comeback against Stoke</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Palace, and Pardew, have been here before. For Ian Wright in 1990, read Gayle 26 years on. \u201cWell, you said it, and of course there are comparisons to be made,\u201d offered Palace\u2019s current manager, a team\u2011mate of Wright\u2019s when the forward plucked from Greenwich Borough, where he had been earning \u00a330 a week, for the cost of a set of dumbbells, sprung from the bench to score twice in the showpiece against Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s side.</p> <p>\u201cDwight did a great job out there and has given me a question mark about the team. I\u2019m going to play him at Southampton [on Sunday] and, if he gets another couple of goals, I\u2019ll really have a problem.\u201d</p> <p>Gayle has been at Palace for three years and in each campaign, now that Saturday\u2019s pair has swollen his season\u2019s tally to seven, has finished as leading scorer in all competitions despite finding himself largely used as an impact substitute in league games. He is a victim of the team\u2019s preferred structure, a player who might flourish alongside Glenn Murray or Connor Wickham if Palace regularly played two up front. He has pined for game time to the extent that he was open to a transfer last summer, albeit not to Bristol City when a \u00a39m fee was agreed. Norwich City\u2019s interest, on deadline day, surfaced too late.</p> <p>Yet, with a burst of late form, his timing might actually be in before his club\u2019s second FA Cup final, against United once more, later this month. Palace <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/12/dwight-gayle-crystal-palace-contract\" title=\"\">secured him to new terms last month</a>, albeit on the understanding his position will be reviewed if suitors emerge who might offer him more regular football, and, of all Pardew\u2019s team, he was the one who displayed eye-catching urgency throughout against Stoke. His goals duly secured his team\u2019s top-flight status. \u201cIt was important the contract side of his situation was sorted out and [the chairman] Steve Parish managed to do that,\u201d said Pardew. \u201cThat made the job easier for me. I feel a bit for Gayley this year in that he hasn\u2019t had enough game time.</p> <p>\u201cBut we had a great first half of the season and it was difficult for him to get into the side. Then he had injuries and we lost him for a time when we really, really needed him. Now he has come back and, of all my players, he is the one with a freshness about him because he hasn\u2019t had a lot of football. That is a great thing for us as we look to Wembley.\u201d It was his combination with Wickham that really caught the eye, offering the management a potential Plan B for the Cup final. There is certainly a partnership there in the making to which they could turn if chasing the game on 21\u00a0May.</p> <p>While Palace breathed a sigh of relief at survival, Stoke\u2019s campaign continued to fizzle out. A six-match winless run has come as an unpleasant surprise for Mark Hughes and his players, who were briefly bolstered by Charlie Adam\u2019s first league goal in almost a year before fading.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s frustrating,\u201d Peter Crouch said. \u201cWe were asking questions in the dressing room there but we can\u2019t really put our finger on what has happened. Today we were not at it, and the collapse in the second half was not good.\u201d</p> <p>Hughes departed scowling. Palace, in contrast, can focus on a glittering final ahead.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Dwight Gayle (Crystal Palace)</p>",

Once the dust settled, Karanka dismissed suggestions he might resign and his Brighton counterpart\u2019s attentions turned to Friday\u2019s demanding play-off semi-final against Sheffield Wednesday.</p> <p>\u201cThere are just 20 privileged managers who can be in the Premier League and I am going to be one of them,\u201d Karanka said after reiterating that he has three years remaining his contract. \u201cThat\u2019s amazing.\u201d</p> <p>If it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that Steve Gibson, the club\u2019s owner, may still opt to part company with the 42-year-old, sacking the man who previously served as Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s assistant at Real Madrid now would appear harsh. Karanka is fond of reminding everyone he has only two and a half years\u2019 managerial experience and this was something Gibson presumably took into account in deciding against dismissing him two months ago.</p> <p>As befits a Basque, Karanka possesses a stubborn streak and its latest manifestation left the \u00a36m Stewart Downing and the \u00a39m Jordan Rhodes, Boro\u2019s two supposed star signings this season, relegated to the bench. That pair cost a high percentage of the \u00a325m Gibson \u2013 the most generous, and supportive, of owners \u2013 has invested in the squad since last summer but neither, apparently, were Karanka\u2019s first-choice recruits.</p> <p>In their place he selected Cristhian Stuani (a \u00a33.5m buy) and David Nugent (\u00a35m), and this controversial choice was swiftly vindicated when the excellent Gaston Ram\u00edrez floated in a free-kick, Nugent flicked on and Stuani stuck out his left foot and stabbed home from three yards. \u201cI thought to play with Stuani because I knew he wasn\u2019t having a good season but I also know how hungry Uruguayan players are,\u201d Karanka said. \u201cI knew he had something to show.\u201d</p> <p>With Ram\u00edrez \u2013 on loan from Southampton but likely now to formalise his transfer to the Riverside \u2013 shining in the hole and Albert Adomah\u2019s deployment on the left rather than his preferred right helping George Friend subdue Brighton\u2019s dangerous Anthony Knockaert, Boro were in control.</p> <p>Then Beram Kayal began making his presence felt in central midfield. The Israel midfielder was not about to surrender and, responding to his determinedly dynamic cue, the visitors rallied. When Knockaert displayed his class with a high-calibre free-kick, Dale Stephens headed the equaliser.</p> <p>On a day when Teesside temperatures peaked at 10C, locals began interpreting the gathering, unseasonal mist as a bad omen. Maybe Brighton were heading for the win required to clinch promotion?</p> <p>Yet within three minutes Stephens\u2019s late, high, studs-up challenge on Ram\u00edrez earned a straight red card. Though Stephens may have won the ball and Mike Dean may initially have reached for a yellow card, a fellow official\u2019s voice in the referee\u2019s earpiece counselled it had been a reckless tackle and off he went. The Uruguayan required eight minutes of on-pitch treatment to a deep gash high on a shin before eventually departing on a stretcher, an oxygen mask clamped over his face. Happily Karanka later reported a stitched-up Ram\u00edrez would be \u201cfit for celebrating\u201d.</p> <p>After a nervy finale a corner of north-east England devastated by the death of its steel industry last autumn finally had something to shout about. \u201cFor the steelworkers who have had so much hardship, hopefully their lives will be a little brighter after this,\u201d Boro\u2019s manager said. \u201cThis area deserves a Premier League club.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Gaston Ram\u00edrez (Middlesbrough)</p>",

      "body": "<p>At the culmination of their game at Vicarage Road on Sunday, at around the same time as John Terry will probably reprise his role from Munich four years ago by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/apr/26/chelsea-john-terry-champions-trophy\">donning a kit</a> to perform a lap of appreciation while suspended, Sunderland could well be reflecting on a fourth consecutive season where they should have been relegated but somehow were not.</p> <p>Implausibly, given their apparent hopelessness for long spells, they <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/sunderland-chelsea-premier-league-report\">could even extricate themselves</a> with a game to spare. Everton, who visit the Stadium of Light on Wednesday, stand in their way, if that is not being too charitable for a side who have allowed 50 shots on their goal in their past two away games.</p> <p>Norwich City and Newcastle United are not expecting any favours from Roberto Mart\u00ednez\u2019s brittle team as they prepare to fall victim to a club who seem to have escapology running through their DNA.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/22/jermain-defoe-sunderland-chances-goals-bournemouth\">Jermain Defoe:  \u2018I knew, given chances, I would score the goals\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After a relegation battle of so many twists and turns, perhaps it is premature to talk of a midweek denouement. Certainly, Sunderland fans have been put through the wringer enough not to count any chickens and it could well go down to the final game. However, with two left they are in pole position to avoid joining Aston Villa in the Championship. Their fate is in their own hands.</p> <p>If it is enough to provoke tears on the Tyne and in deepest Norfolk, Jermain Defoe has beaten them to it. \u201cDon\u2019t tell anyone,\u201d he said when asked about his moist-eyed exit from the pitch.</p> <p>After a similarly emotional reaction to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/05/sunderland-newcastle-united-premier-league-match-report\">scoring the winner</a> in last season\u2019s Wear-Tyne derby, it is becoming a habit. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to,\u201d Defoe said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with me. As I get older, I\u2019m just getting too emotional. It\u2019s hard to find words to describe what it was like.\u201d</p> <p>Defoe, who controlled the ball with his first touch before sending it into the bottom corner for the fifth and final goal of a breathless contest, has played a significant role in Sunderland\u2019s latest escape bid. He has scored 15 of their 43 league goals, and is responsible for 14 of their 35 points, three short of the safety target set by Sam Allardyce.</p> <p>Chelsea were swept aside at a Stadium of Light passion pit. \u201cThe fans won us the game,\u201d Defoe said, as 47,000 generated the atmosphere of double their number. \u201cEven when you\u2019re tired, and it\u2019s been a long season mentally, when the fans roar like that you find something. The noise was frightening. I got goose bumps.\u201d</p> <p>Keep flirting with relegation long enough and eventually you will drop \u2013 but not so Sunderland, it appears, as they prepare to emerge from their latest scrape. Paolo Di Canio in 2013, Gus Poyet in 2014, Dick Advocaat last year, and now, almost certainly, Allardyce in 2016. Perhaps of more concern to the incumbent of the manager\u2019s office than earning the two points to secure safety is who will be in situ to emulate his feat next year should the pattern continue.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/06/sam-allardyce-transcendental-meditation-relegation-battle\">Sam Allardyce: meditation helps me cope with relegation battle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the space of five minutes, Sunderland went from the high of Wahbi Khazri\u2019s wonderful long-range volley finding the top corner, to the despair of switching off like a pub team as Nemanja Matic restored Chelsea\u2019s lead with an unflustered finish beneath Vito Mannone.</p> <p>There had been an element of misfortune for the hosts about how the ball had found its way to Diego Costa for the Spaniard to open the scoring from a narrow angle inside the opening 20 minutes, but the visitors\u2019 second was simply down to rank bad defending.</p> <p>Mannone stood firm with some wonderful saves before Fabio Borini found the net against his former club with the aid of a deflection off the hapless Terry. Then, 138 seconds later, more questionable Chelsea marking allowed Defoe the kind of space in the box which results in only one outcome. An outpouring of emotion and relief rarely seen in the stadium\u2019s near 20-year history ensued.</p> <p>Seemingly a rational man, Guus Hiddink, Chelsea\u2019s interim manager, forwarded the unfathomable claim that the referee, Mike Jones, had been too close to the incident to make the correct call as Terry scythed down Khazri with a tired challenge in the fifth minute of stoppage time to earn a second yellow in quick succession following a foul on Defoe.</p> <p>With the 35-year-old\u2019s contract not set to be renewed as he considers lucrative offers to move to China and North America, his two-game ban brought an abrupt end to a near two-decade career with the London club.</p> <p>More than 700 appearances, where he has won the Champions League (although he was suspended for the final), Premier League, Europa League and FA Cups among others, constitutes an impressive tally by anyone\u2019s standards, although he has often failed to match his sterling service on the pitch with his conduct off it.</p> <p>Hiddink refused to confirm whether Terry would be seen in Chelsea blue again, other than if he joined in the Stamford Bridge walkabout after the visit of Leicester City on Sunday. Matic\u2019s take had a more final air about it. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good way to finish,\u201d he said. \u201cWe wish him the best for the future, and won\u2019t forget what he\u2019s won and what he\u2019s done.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Vito Mannone (Sunderland)</p>",

      "body": "<p>Those who do not learn from their recent history are doomed to be relegated from the Premier League twice in a row. Two years ago <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/may/08/norwich-city-relegation-chris-hughton\" title=\"\">Norwich went down</a> because of inadequate recruitment and they are close to sinking this season for the same reason. To survive Norwich need other results to go in their favour and to win both of their remaining matches, which does not look likely given that they have failed to score in their last four, including this one against a vulnerable Manchester United.</p> <p>How Norwich must rue their repeated failure to invest properly, especially in forwards. Two years ago, when Chris Hughton was manager, they spent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/mar/23/norwich-city-ricky-van-wolfswinkel\" title=\"\">a club-record fee</a> on the Dutch striker Ricky van Wolfswinkel and also bought Gary Hooper but neither succeeded, especially not the former, and Norwich were demoted as the lowest scorers in the top flight.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/norwich-manchester-united-premier-league-report\">Manchester United\u2019s Juan Mata leaves Norwich City in relegation zone</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This season their impotence up front has again cost them, a fact that Cameron Jerome and Dieumerci Mbokani underlined by fluffing clear chances against United. At least those two were considered worthy of a place on the pitch whereas Steven Naismith, the man <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/19/norwich-complete-signing-steven-naismith-everton\" title=\"\">signed from Everton for \u00a38.5m</a> in January to repair the club\u2019s attacking problems, remained an unused substitute, which spoke volumes about his ineffectiveness. Alex Neil said he omitted Naismith for tactical reasons \u2013 Jerome is faster and Wes Hoolahan works well with him \u2013 but acknowledged that the club would have been in a stronger position if they had recruited more since wining promotion through the Championship play-offs last season.</p> <p>\u201cThere has been a whole host of reasons why that hasn\u2019t been the case,\u201d said the Scot. \u201cWe were last to go up, through the play-offs, and the recruitment team needed to be put together a bit more than what it was, so that wasn\u2019t fully functioning in the way it should\u2019ve been. And there have been players we\u2019ve tried to attract that ultimately we didn\u2019t manage to get. If you combine all those reasons we found ourselves in a situation where we didn\u2019t add as many as we\u2019d have liked.\u201d</p> <p>The forwards\u2019 quality is not high and, what is more, their confidence seems low. Neil seems exasperated. \u201cHow do you give people confidence?\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t put the ball in the net for them.\u201d</p> <p>One area that Norwich have managed to strengthen this season is central defence, where Timm Klose brought solidity after joining in January. But the Swiss has been injured for the last month and Neil has been forced to resort to defenders who were relegated two years ago. It has shown. A misjudgment by S\u00e9bastien Bassong allowed Wayne Rooney to tee up Juan Mata for United\u2019s winning goal.</p> <p>Louis van Gaal\u2019s team thus edged closer to a top-four finish despite being deprived of the pace and thrust of Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial. The former was rested before Tuesday\u2019s visit to West Ham, while Martial suffered a muscular injury in the warm-up and is a doubt for that match. Without those youngsters United produced a plodding performance, although midfielder Ander Herrera said that was partially due to the heat. \u201cIt was similar to southern Spain,\u201d said Herrera. \u201cIt was so tough I couldn\u2019t speak with my team-mates because my mouth was so dry.\u201d</p> <p>In May 2013 Herrera was part of the Athletic Bilbao team that bid farewell to the Sam Mam\u00e9s Stadium, the club\u2019s home for a century. That experience tells him that United should expect an intense occasion on Tuesday, West Ham\u2019s final match at Upton Park. \u201cIt is going to be very special for them and their fans but we have to show we are playing for something very, very important,\u201d said Herrera, whose Bilbao team were beaten 1-0 by Levante on that emotional day two years ago. \u201cHopefully [West Ham] won\u2019t enjoy their last game,\u201d he said.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match </strong>Juan Mata (Man Utd)</p>",

Usually election campaigns run about 33 days, we have 55 days until it is time to mark the ballots. </p> <p>News Corp Australia and Fairfax Media have both published polls that show Labor and the Coalition are neck and neck at the start of the campaign.</p> <p>Newspoll, published <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/federal-election-2016/federal-election-2016-malcolm-turnbull-behind-as-marathon-begins/news-story/d7aae02fb32be4c8f82a0958bfb680f7\">in the Australian</a>, has Labor slightly ahead of the Coalition on a 51%-49% two-party-preferred basis. </p> <p>The poll shows Australians believe last week\u2019s budget will leave them worse off, with women aged aged between 35 and 49 and earning less than $100,000 believing they will be the hardest-hit. Forty per cent of women said they would be worse off compared with just 15% believing they would be better off. Interestingly, men and those earning more than $100,000 were most positive about the budget.</p> <p>The Coalition\u2019s primary vote is sitting on 41% while Labor has recorded its highest since <strong>Malcolm Turnbull</strong> became prime minister at 37%.</p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.afr.com/news/politics/election-2016-eight-weeks-to-go-and-its-too-close-to-call-20160508-gop277\">Australian Financial Review has published its own Fairfax/Ipsos poll </a>showing the Coalition on 51% to Labor\u2019s 49%.

      "body": "<p>Tonight\u2019s episode was called Winner Takes All and it was a hell of an opening. Right off the bat Ralphie was confronted not only with the knowledge of Alice and Aafrin\u2019s deception, but also with the knowledge that Mr Charlie knows too. (That\u2019s a lot of knowledge.) And Mr Charlie knowing anything bad is double dangerous, as anyone with fingers standing near him when he\u2019s in a rage knows only too well. I liked it when Charlie was roaming the countryside trying to find people who would pretend to have seen Aafrin with Bonkers Naresh for cash. And when he said, \u201cI can run things from here.\u201d I wanted to see Mr Charlie running things. In fact, I wished Mr Charlie had been made Viceroy. It would have been extremely entertaining \u2013 and given us somewhere to go.</p> <p>Instead, there were few winners in this outing by the end, least of all the viewer. The superb drama of the opening scenes soon unravelled into a hotchpotch of plots. We were treated to a sort of \u201cGroundhog Day: The Mr Charlie Special\u201d where he reverted to being a secret psychopath after we\u2019d witnessed him so openly out of control last week. True to form, sure, but narratively unsatisfying as we\u2019ve seen so much of him like this. Alice has fought this fight many times. Wasn\u2019t it time for a different ending? I know in real life she would probably have had to capitulate. But we don\u2019t watch Indian Summers to see real life! Ah well, there\u2019s always next series. Oh, wait ...</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ae0955f4b678ac1d2042e8f1de94b6fa774619b6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ae0955f4b678ac1d2042e8f1de94b6fa774619b6/29_0_2658_1595/1000.jpg\" alt=\"What price has Alice paid for Aafrin\u2019s freedom?\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">What price has Alice paid for Aafrin\u2019s freedom?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Alblas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The wife/puppy scene was odd at first, and then it became obvious: Alice was trying to preserve her relationship with her son and save Aafrin\u2019s life. What price has she paid for Aafrin\u2019s freedom? The price of her own happiness, of course, which was always the only thing she had to trade. This was perhaps the most realistic outcome, but the least pleasing for us. I was hoping we would get to see Mr Charlie go nuclear and still somehow be outwitted. It\u2019s worrying that, because we\u2019re not going to get a third series and next week\u2019s episode is the last ever (sob!) of Indian Summers, Mr Charlie may not get his comeuppance. And that is wrong, all wrong.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0c699484075e54400ac24be8577ea323ff3e30c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0c699484075e54400ac24be8577ea323ff3e30c8/89_0_2658_1595/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Poor Aafrin.

Once Mr Charlie\u2019s got you in his sights, nothing is safe \u2026 especially not your fingers.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Alblas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is the problem with these last few hours of viewing. Wonderful performances, as always, despite the uncertain mix of light and shade. But presumably they didn\u2019t know there would be no series three when these episodes were made, so we\u2019re going to be left on an unsolvable cliffhanger whether we like it or not.</p> <p>Meanwhile there are irritating cross-references and attempts to tie up or revive old plots. \u201cHave you ever heard of a man called Ramu Sood? You should always make a note of the innocent men you hang.\u201d I wondered when that exposition was coming. But it was neither dramatic enough to be exciting nor explanatory enough for anyone feeling sketchy on series one. Perhaps worse: \u201cHer name was Jaya Mohan and she bore my child. I\u2019ve lied and I\u2019ve lied and I\u2019ve lied again.\u201d What were we supposed to make of the reaction Ralphie received to this? </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"440ba97351d39e418314ab2aa4b1de9a784ba473\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/440ba97351d39e418314ab2aa4b1de9a784ba473/138_0_2658_1595/1000.jpg\" alt=\"You will find Cynthia in the club \u2014 both still hoping here that Ralphie might be Viceroy\u2026\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">You will find Cynthia in the club \u2014 both still hoping here that Ralphie might be Viceroy \u2026</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Alblas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ralphie\u2019s reaction to the Viceroy announcement was confusing and unconvincing too. You are about to receive news about something you have coveted for many years, making many sacrifices including pimping your wife out to a man in a dodgy earring who has now gone to Baden Baden. So what do you do? Hold a family conference and keep your boss waiting. His actual eventual reaction was priceless, a beautiful piece of acting. Bloody upstart Marquess with his important work on nutrition. (What is this? A Kellogg\u2019s research paper? We demand to know.) </p> <p>So what\u2019s left to come in next week\u2019s finale? Can Alice find a way to escape \u2013 with Percy, we get it, it has to be with Percy \u2013 and foil Mr Charlie at last? How will Mr Ian use the information he has about Adam? Will Lina reappear? Will Sooni and Mr Khan finally be together? And most importantly: will the Maharajah and Phyllis/Sirene make a reappearance fresh from taking the waters in Baden Baden? Surely their casting agents\u2019 fees alone demand it.</p> <h2>Political shenanigans</h2> <p>Despite myriad plots we\u2019ve lost sight of the politics by this point. \u201cThere was a meeting in Whitehall this morning.\u201d So there\u2019s to be a new Viceroy ... \u201cYou had it on merit.\u201d Ah, but what does merit count for? But, of course, it\u2019s thanks to Charlie that everything has eventually been scuppered. Surely Ralphie has to take his revenge? It\u2019s a shame the bigger picture of Indian independence has all but disappeared, especially after Mr Khan taking Sooni to see Mahatma. So many opportunities to make history exciting ... not taken.</p> <h2>Evil Britisher of the week</h2> <p>\u201cAnd Aafrin?\u201d \u201cOh, he\u2019ll hang.\u201d So Mr Charlie wins again. It\u2019s getting boring now; he wins every week. Blake Ritson (Mr Charlie) is utterly fabulous and he has inhabited this character so entirely that I am currently considering wearing iron gloves in bed so Mr Charlie can\u2019t come and get my fingers in the night. But give him some variety, people! Last week was explosively brilliant because we got to see him under severe pressure and unable to control his murderous temper. Yes, that would have been impossible to sustain. But we could have seen something different from him here. I\u2019m hoping this is a slow burn to his eventual unravelling next week.</p> <h2>The Julie Walters fan club</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bfe9733fd2dfb3f6ed5580784613e4ba116017f9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bfe9733fd2dfb3f6ed5580784613e4ba116017f9/110_0_2658_1595/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Poor Cynthia the massive pimp, who has not given much to do at all here.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Poor Cynthia the massive pimp, who was not given much to do at all here.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Joe Alblas</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cIt\u2019s cocktail time!\u201d And the turban\u2019s come out! \u201cI just gave them somewhere private to do their business.\u201d You tell yourself that, Cynthia. You\u2019re no pimp! (Cynthia is a massive pimp and this is why we love her.) This was an interesting episode for Julie Walters in that it pointed up one of the key difficulties of this show: Indian Summers isn\u2019t comfortable with tone. Julie Walters can manage any key change and she just wasn\u2019t given much to do at all. That, my friends in Club Simla, is a warning sign. Cynthia should be used for comedy and light relief, for pathos and unexpected empathy. Here she was just shaking cocktails. Fingers crossed for a blinding finish next week.</p>",

The last time we won a mayoral election was 2004. The last time we won a big election was 2005 ... We don\u2019t win elections by just talking to people who already vote Labour.\u201d<br /></p> <p>The Labour leader\u2019s allies hailed as fantastic the results of Thursday\u2019s elections, in which they also took the Bristol mayoralty, remained the largest party in Wales and held on to key councils in swing constituencies such as Harlow.<br /></p> <p>Corbyn travelled to Bristol to congratulate the new mayor, Marvin Rees, whose unexpected victory, as a black man in a city whose riches were built on the slave trade, is viewed as a significant political milestone.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/08/marvin-rees-bristol-mayor-racist-past\">Marvin Rees\u2019s triumph as mayor defies Bristol\u2019s racist past | Simon Woolley</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The Labour leader said the election results showed his party was holding on, with support for it growing. However, sceptical MPs have said they believe the performance was not enough to build a majority in 2020, which will require what Khan called a \u201cbig tent\u201d strategy, to win over Conservative supporters. There is deep concern about the result in the Scottish parliament, where Labour slipped into third place, behind the Conservative party.</p> <p>Following Khan\u2019s 14 percentage point victory over Zac Goldsmith \u2013 the biggest in a mayoral election since 2000 \u2013 he said it was not for him to advise the party\u2019s leader on how to win seats in other parts of England, Scotland and Wales, but added: \u201cI don\u2019t believe in heroic failure. I believe in winning elections to change people\u2019s lives for the better.\u201d</p> <p>His comments may increase perceptions at Westminster that a new Labour power base is forming in the capital, with ambitions on the national party, but he moved to quell that, saying: \u201cCity Hall is not going to be used as a springboard for a challenge to the leadership or a coup or for me to give running commentary. Jeremy Corbyn has a big job to do as leader of the Labour party. My job is to be mayor of London.\u201d</p> <p>Separately, a report based on interviews with swing voters in the key parliamentary seat of Nuneaton and shared with the Guardian underlined the scale of the challenge facing Labour. In focus groups carried out by Ed Miliband\u2019s former pollster James Morris, a panel of former Labour voters in the Warwickshire town said they viewed Corbyn as \u201cold-fashioned\u201d or \u201cscruffy\u201d.</p> <p>Participants were unenthusiastic about the Conservatives and keen to give Labour a chance, Morris found, but many had a negative view of Corbyn. </p> <p>Corbyn and his team firmly reject the \u201cfocus group politics\u201d of the Tony Blair and Gordon Brown years, which they believe spawned a generation of \u201cplastic politicians\u201d.</p> <p>But Morris and his co-author Ian Warren, another former Labour pollster, say the public\u2019s inability to see Miliband as a potential prime minister was key to Labour\u2019s loss of last year\u2019s general election \u2013 and they warn that voters who are not firm Labour supporters appear to be even more wary of Corbyn.</p> <p>The mood among the leader\u2019s critics was not helped on Sunday when shadow chancellor <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnmcdonnellMP\">John McDonnell</a> sparked a public spat with the Blairite backbench MP Caroline Flint on Twitter, urging her to withdraw comments she had attributed to him about the local elections.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"tweet from John McDonnell\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot; data-lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Caroline Flint, you quoted me saying re recent elections &amp;quot;we are looking to hang on.&amp;quot;I never said this.&lt;br&gt;Could you now publicly correct this&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; John McDonnell MP (@johnmcdonnellMP) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/johnmcdonnellMP/status/729348214177009664&quot;&gt;May 8, 2016&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;script async src=&quot;//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&quot; charset=&quot;utf-8&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>  <p> <br /></p> <p>Khan spoke to the Guardian after his first official engagement, the Yom Hashoah Holocaust memorial service in Barnet, which signalled a clear attempt to distance himself from the Labour leadership\u2019s handling of recent allegations of antisemitism inside the party, which included incidents such as Naz Shah MP suggesting that Israel\u2019s Jews should be sent to live in the US and Ken Livingstone attempted to defend her by claiming Hitler had supported Zionism.</p> <p>Khan said he planned to \u201chit the ground running\u201d, holding meetings on Monday with the commissioner of the Metropolitan police, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, the head of the fire service and with Transport for London.</p> <p>\u201cThe key thing for me is to tackle the housing crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cI am bringing together an alliance of people from local authorities, housing associations, developers, those in finance to make sure we start building the genuine affordable homes we need. I have spent this weekend working on that and a number of other things.\u201d</p> <p>He said the alliance would change London\u2019s overall strategic plan and publish new supplementary planning guidance, both policies that govern the amount of affordable housing that developers are obliged to build when they erect new private homes. He believes his pledge to tackle the housing crisis has allowed him to reach out to voters across the political spectrum.</p> <p> </p> <p>Speaking following the Holocaust memorial service, the mayor said he had lost some Jewish votes \u201cbecause of the antics of members of the party making comments that are clearly unacceptable and disgusting\u201d.</p> <p>Corbyn announced an independent review into antisemitism and other forms of racism in the Labour party, chaired by former Liberty chair Shami Chakrabarti, after suspending both Shah and Livingstone.</p> <p>Khan was greeted warmly by members of the Jewish community when he arrived at a reception before the ceremony. He met the chief rabbi Ephraim Mirvis, Holocaust survivors and leading figures in the Jewish community, including Israel\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Mark Regev, former Labour fundraiser Lord Levy and Eric Pickles, the government\u2019s ambassador on post-Holocaust issues.<br /></p> <p>Henry Grunwald QC, chairman of the National Holocaust Centre, told Khan from the stage: \u201cYou have promised to be a mayor for all Londoners. By your attendance here today we hope that you are beginning to fulfil that pledge.\u201d<br /></p> <p>With all but one of the local council results nationally announced by the end of Sunday, Labour had lost a net 24 seats \u2013 rare for an opposition party, but not as bad as many projections had suggested. The Conservatives lost 46 seats.<br /></p> <p>Corbyn will be able to introduce two new Labour MPs, Gill Furness and Christopher Elmore, after the party won byelections in Sheffield Brightside and Ogmore in Wales, held on the same day as the other polls.</p>",

The 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, worth an estimated $250m, eventually released <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/24/romney-braced-questions-tax-returns\">two years of returns</a>. He has since become one of Trump\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/mar/03/mitt-romney-donald-trump-republican-presidential-race-speech\">most prominent adversaries</a>, suggesting in February that Trump is hiding \u201c<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/02/24/mitt-romney-believes-theres-a-bombshell-in-donald-trumps-taxes/\">a bombshell</a>\u201d in his returns.</p> <p>\u201cEither he\u2019s not anywhere near as wealthy as he says he is or he hasn\u2019t been paying the kind of taxes we would expect him to pay,\u201d Romney said. </p> <p>\u201cOr perhaps he hasn\u2019t been giving money to the vets or to the disabled like he\u2019s been telling us he\u2019s doing.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>Last Tuesday, the world was treated to the improbable spectacle of tastemaking US music website Pitchfork <a href=\"http://pitchfork.com/thepitch/1133-decoding-the-politics-in-radioheads-burn-the-witch-video/\">earnestly trying to explain</a> 1960s and 70s UK kids\u2019 show Trumpton to its American readers. Their London-based contributing editor was drafted in, the better to elucidate the importance of Pugh, Pugh and Barney McGrew, as was the son-in-law of the show\u2019s 96-year-old creator, whose solitary quote \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not aware of anything\u201d \u2013 winningly suggested a man quite keen to get the bloke from Pitchfork off the phone. </p> <p>Elsewhere, parallels were drawn between Trumpton and what might become of America were Donald Trump to become president, which feels like rather a harsh judgment on the seemingly benign regime of the mayor and Mr Troop the town clerk.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/08/what-do-you-think-of-radioheads-new-album-share-your-reviews\">What do you think of Radiohead's new album? Share your reviews</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This all happened because Radiohead had premiered a video based on Trumpton\u2019s stop-frame animation for a compelling mesh of chattering high-maintenance strings and ominous bass and drum thunder called Burn The Witch, the first track to be released from their ninth studio album, A Moon Shaped Pool. </p> <p>You could possibly accuse the Pitchfork piece of over-thinking things a bit \u2013 it may well be that the band and director Chris Hopewell chose to depict Trumpton-ites immolating a bowler-hatted outsider in a wicker man as \u201ca pointed critique of nativism-embracing leaders across the UK and Europe\u201d, but there\u2019s also the chance they just thought it was funny \u2013 but the fact that it exists at all tells you something about the unique position Radiohead continue to hold. </p> <p>Artistically at least, these are supposed to be thin times for rock music, particularly rock of the stadium-filling variety. The really important, epochal, provocative stuff \u2013 the music that, to use a ghastly phrase, carries the conversation \u2013 is clearly happening in hip hop and R&amp;B. With one exception: alone among their commercial peers, Radiohead are held to not just release albums but make grand artistic statements worth dissecting and poring over in the same way as the output of Kendrick Lamar or Beyonce. Certainly, no one\u2019s falling over themselves to decode the politics of Coldplay\u2019s releases.</p> <p>Listening to A Moon Shaped Pool, you can see why. However much their style bears certain hallmarks \u2013 Thom Yorke\u2019s keening vocal shiver and what you might charitably describe as a fairly glum bearing among them \u2013 Radiohead have always sounded like a band in constant motion: every album has seemed like an agitated shift from the last, as if they were too neurotic to rest on their laurels even if they wanted to. </p> <p>Certainly, A Moon Shaped Pool is noticeably different to its predecessor, 2011\u2019s patchy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/feb/24/radiohead-king-limbs-review\">King Of Limbs</a>. You\u2019d hesitate to call it more poppy \u2013 this is still an album on which standard verse-chorus structures are very much subject to subsidence, and on which the instruments buried deep in the mix frequently seem to be playing an entirely different song to those in the foreground \u2013 but it\u2019s certainly sharper and more focused.</p> <p>There\u2019s nothing as slippery and unclear as King Of Limbs\u2019 Bloom or Feral. They seem as fascinated by sonic textures as they do by actual songwriting \u2013 the weirdly uplifting moment towards the end of Ful Stop (sic), when the song\u2019s muffled sound suddenly becomes bright and trebly, as if a DJ has turned the eq knob on his mixer to the right \u2013 but it\u2019s not an album that feels lost in experimentation. The abundance of sonic intrigue is matched by the quantity of beautiful tunes: the fact that True Love Waits, a track that dates back to the less knotty era of their 1995 album The Bends, fits perfectly in the line-up of songs tells you something about their unabashed melodic richness. </p> <p>There\u2019s something pretty dazzling about the way Tinker Tailor Soldier Sailor combines two of what you might call Radiohead\u2019s extracurricular interests, Jonny Greenwood\u2019s soundtrack work and the electronica Thom Yorke plays when DJing \u2013 soft explosions of white noise and a distorted keyboard line are slowly overwhelmed by a luscious string arrangement \u2013 but there\u2019s something equally dazzling about the plaintively lovely tune that floats over folky acoustic guitar picking and a vaguely Latin shuffle beat on Present Tense. </p> <p>The simple prettiness of the piano figure that runs through Daydreaming battles it out with unsettling scrapes of backwards vocal that sometimes sound like oblique harmonies, but more often like someone struggling for breath. Identikit, meanwhile, wrongfoots the listener entirely: it initially sounds like a studio jam session that made it on to the album through some kind of clerical error \u2013 snatches of vocal and scrabbling guitar, drums treated with dub reggae effects \u2013 before suddenly pulling into focus: a hook that immediately brands itself on to your brain, an agitated, thrilling guitar solo.</p> <p>It is tempting to say that all this fidgety invention comes as a welcome distraction from the suffocating gloom of the lyrics, cursed as the latter are with a worldview that frequently sees any kind of personal happiness as merely the result of ignorance, wilful or otherwise: \u201cdreamers they never learn\u201d, \u201cwe are helpless to resist\u201d, \u201cI\u2019ll drown my beliefs to your babies\u201d, \u201cwe are happy just to serve\u201d, \u201cthere\u2019s nothing left inside that we all can love \u2026 I don\u2019t want to know\u201d. </p> <p>That said, you do find yourself wondering if Radiohead\u2019s collective tongue might not occasionally be wedged in their collective cheek, if, as with the video for Burn The Witch, they might not sometimes be parodying their austere image as rock\u2019s premier harbingers of doom. </p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t get heavy, keep it light\u201d, offers Present Tense. The introduction to Glass Eyes is a thing of beauty and unalloyed pleasure, played on a piano treated with digital effects until it sounds like it\u2019s been submerged beneath rippling water, at least until Yorke slopes into view, his face like the proverbial slapped arse. \u201cHey, it\u2019s me,\u201d he mournfully intones and immediately you think: uh-oh, here we go. And so it proves: \u201ca frightening place, faces are concrete grey \u2026 panic is coming on strong\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0918da0f774fe5cd793abd258fbb45484e7e88d5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0918da0f774fe5cd793abd258fbb45484e7e88d5/13_0_935_561/500.jpg\" alt=\"A scene from the Radiohead video Burn the Witch.\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene from the Radiohead video Burn the Witch.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Radiohead/Youtube</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If the thought of Radiohead occasionally playing it for LOLs is too mind-blowing to bear, you\u2019ll have to content yourself with the occasional chinks of light amid the murk. </p> <p>There\u2019s Desert Island Disk with its suggestion that \u201cdifferent types of love are possible\u201d and The Numbers, which is also that rarest of things, a Radiohead track that doesn\u2019t just vaguely resemble another artist\u2019s work (anyone still intent on depicting Radiohead as a latterday Pink Floyd might feel their ears prick up at Decks Dark\u2019s burst of Atom Heart Mother-ish choral vocals) but actually seems to be a direct and obvious homage to something else, or possibly two things: the resemblance of the tumbling piano parts to those on John Martyn\u2019s 1971 instrumental <a href=\"https://www.johnmartyn.info/node/159\">Glistening Glyndebourne</a> might be purely coincidental, but the similarity of the intense orchestration, circling bassline and loose-limbed funk rhythm to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sboZ3AYQs4\">Melody</a>, the opening track of Serge Gainsbourg\u2019s 1970 Historie De Melody Nelson, definitely is not. They\u2019re certainly not the first people to mine that song\u2019s arrangement for inspiration, but it says something about Radiohead\u2019s inventiveness that they can warp music already plundered by everyone from Beck to Belle and Sebastian into something that sounds entirely their own.</p> <p>Moreover, the high-drama swells of strings fit the lyrical message. Radiohead\u2019s previous attempts at creating a rousing call to arms have been hobbled by their innate pessimism, as exemplified by 2001\u2019s You and Whose Army?, on which Thom Yorke somehow contrived to sound utterly deflated while offering Tony Blair out for a punch-up in time-honoured \u201ccome on then\u201d style. Here, however, the stuff about how the future is inside us and people have the power sounds authentically stirring. It also sounds like Radiohead achieving something they\u2019ve never achieved before, a quarter of a century into their career: long may their neuroses keep them in constant motion.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The AFL is designed to maximise the relevance of every club in a given season. Almost half the competing teams reach the finals, more still are in the running in August, the gap between best and worst bridged by equalisation mechanisms. </p> <p>The draft incentivises a cyclical approach to list building, meaning there\u2019s usually something for the stragglers to cling onto as winter bites, be it the carrot of an early pick or the glint of a rough diamond in a development year. Failing that, the draw leans towards historic rivalries guaranteeing pride will often be on the line, even if flag aspirations are not.</p> <p>It\u2019s not a failsafe model and every year a side or two slips through the cracks. Culprits usually suffer by misjudging their premiership window. This season, Collingwood\u2019s has yet to open, while Richmond\u2019s has firmly closed. It was never more than ajar.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/07/carlton-beat-pies-for-third-afl-win-in-a-row-as-geelong-down-eagles-for-top-spot\">Carlton beat Pies for third AFL win in a row as Geelong down Eagles for top spot</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Collingwood\u2019s season of perdition was confirmed following Saturday\u2019s defeat to Carlton. In hindsight it began 10 seconds into the opening round when Lance Franklin separated from his direct opponent. The Magpies travel next to the Gabba, then face premiership aspirants Geelong and Western Bulldogs. 2017\u2019s NAB Challenge can\u2019t come soon enough.</p> <p>The end of Richmond\u2019s relevance to the season can be pinpointed almost to the minute. The Tigers were a puncher\u2019s chance against the undermanned triple-premiers on Friday night and midway through the second quarter landed a combination that pinned Hawthorn against the ropes. </p> <p>Eleven minutes after the first break Hawthorn\u2019s lead was a then game-high 16 points. Jayden Short stopped the rot and four minutes later Ty Vickery belted the first of two in quick succession to edge the Tigers ahead. The TV broadcast faded from the celebrations to a commercial break. When it returned, Vickery was sat alongside a perplexed Brett Deledio on the interchange bench. The football world went into collective apoplexy at the sight of the game\u2019s lightning rod taking a breather while a major storm brewed. Seven minutes passed before Vickery returned to the fray. The Hawks kicked the last three goals of the half and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/06/afl-round-7-saturday-match-report\">eventually ran out convincing winners</a>. </p> <p>Richmond\u2019s rally in the third quarter that saw them jump to a 12-point lead may counter the argument the Tigers lost the match when Vickery was cooling his jets. Nonetheless it only enhances the perception the youthful Hawks were there for the taking and the failure to capitalise on their first-half ascendancy illustrates the muddled thinking and poor communication that has typified Richmond\u2019s season.</p> <p>At 1-6 and 2-5 the campaigns of Richmond and Collingwood are far from mathematically over but the gap in quality between the top eight and the rest would indicate the finals race should not concern them. That means almost four months of football and a further 16 rounds of irrelevance. This is a worry not only for these two traditional powerhouses but also for the AFL. Four remaining Friday night showpiece fixtures involve one of these sides, including round 20, which pits one against the other. After opening the year with back-to-back crowds in excess of 72,000, Richmond drew just 27,000 in defeat to Port Adelaide and failed to top 50,000 on a Friday night against the Hawks, the lowest for this fixture since round three in 2011. </p> <p>The battle Richmond in particular faces is constructing a positive new narrative, and then communicating it clearly to supporters so that they remain engaged. No longer ascending, neither are they descending with conviction. </p> <p>Until a convincing narrative takes hold the vacuum will be filled by negativity and speculation. \u201cDo we give the media the head on a plate they are looking for?\u201d Peggy O\u2019Neal asked rhetorically during a firefighting exercise on ABC Grandstand. \u201cThe answer to that is no.\u201d The problem O\u2019Neal faces is that unless Damien Hardwick is offered a long-term rebuild, like Ross Lyon at Fremantle, questions over whether the incumbent is the right man for the job will persist. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/06/afl-round-7-saturday-match-report\">Undermanned Hawks condemn Tigers to further misery</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Hardwick\u2019s recent extension to the end of 2018 could hardly be more awkward. Two years is not long enough to imply confidence in a rebuild, nor is it short enough to allow his employers to move nimbly. The mooted restructure of the football department may prove sufficient but it may also prove to be window dressing. </p> <p>Carlton experienced a similar situation last season. Football-wise there was obvious merit to retaining Mick Malthouse but changing tack enabled the Blues to alter the story they had to tell. Importantly it also changed the voices telling it. In the short term club legend Stephen Silvagni was mobilised to reassure and speak plainly. Brendan Bolton has the task longer term, and with the enthusiasm of a golden retriever puppy his delivery is a far cry from his irascible predecessor and one more suited to the sales job required of the role. </p> <p>Silvagni and Bolton have succeeded in aligning expectation much closer to reality. Supporter discontent and media scrutiny grows when there is a gap between those two positions. </p> <p>The AFL likes to propagate the fantasy that its equalising measures mean any team can start the season with flag expectations. Supporters inevitably cling to these myths and false hope grows. Hope exploited by clubs in long offseasons. Hope clung to by diehards that glosses over recruitment, coaching and development mistakes until a senior official finally delivers the bad news. AFL clubs are not in the habit of under promising and over delivering. </p> <p>It was only six years ago that Brendon Gale told Richmond the club had to <a href=\"http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/sigh-of-the-tiger-20100505-uamy.html\">take its medicine</a>. Starting from scratch again so soon will be an even more bitter pill to swallow.</p>",

      "body": "<p>If the Liberal-National Coalition loses 13 or more seats <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/australian-election-2016\">at the election</a>, it will lose its majority. If Labor can gain 19 or more seats \u2013 needing a uniform swing of 4% \u2013 it will win a majority. There are more than 20 seats that could be crucial to this election but here are 10 seats that are worth watching \u2013 seats that may become key battlegrounds if the election is close.</p> <h2><strong>Banks, New South Wales</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/nsw/banks.htm\">Banks</a> covers suburbs on the north shore of the Georges river in southern Sydney. Labor\u2019s Daryl Melham held Banks for more than 20 years but lost in 2013 to Liberal candidate David Coleman.</p> <p>Coleman holds Banks by 2.8%, which is well within reach for Labor, but this area is trending towards the Liberal party. The Liberal vote is quite strong along the riverside and both state seats bucked the trend towards Labor at the 2015 state election.</p> <h2><strong>Bass, Tasmania</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/tas/bass.htm\">Bass</a> covers Launceston and the north-eastern corner of Tasmania. It is one of three marginal Liberal seats in central and northern Tasmania. The Liberal MP Andrew Nikolic holds Bass by a 4% margin. No MP has been re-elected in Bass since 2001 and Nikolic will have a fight on his hands to win a second term.</p> <h2><strong>Bonner, Queensland</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce045d5ff80d7faf9a9bef3a4e3cc14f7ead5248\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce045d5ff80d7faf9a9bef3a4e3cc14f7ead5248/161_127_2525_1515/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ross Vasta\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Liberal National MP Ross Vasta won the seat of Bonner when it was created in 2004, lost it in 2007 and won it back in 2010.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Sheargold/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/qld/bonner.htm\">Bonner</a> covers the eastern suburbs of Brisbane, including Manly, Wynnum and Mount Gravatt. The Liberal National MP Ross Vasta holds Bonner by a 3.7% margin. Vasta won the seat when it was created in 2004, lost it in 2007 and won it back in 2010.</p> <h2><strong>Brisbane, Queensland</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/qld/brisbane.htm\">Brisbane</a> covers the central suburbs of Brisbane on the north side of the river, including the Brisbane CBD, Fortitude Valley, Paddington, Clayfield and Kelvin Grove.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/01/australians-need-more-time-to-talk-about-race\">The LNP\u2019s Teresa Gambaro</a> won the seat in 2010 and she\u2019ll be retiring in 2016. Labor\u2019s Pat O\u2019Neil will be facing off against the LNP\u2019s Trevor Evans. Evans will be defending a 4.3% margin.</p> <h2><strong>Corangamite, Victoria</strong><br /></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/vic/corangamite.htm\">Corangamite</a> covers rural areas to the south-west of Geelong, including Colac, Queenscliff, Torquay, Ocean Grove and the southern suburbs of Geelong.</p> <p>The Liberal MP Sarah Henderson won this seat in 2013 with a 3.9% margin. This seat was traditionally safer for the Liberal party but trended towards Labor in the 2000s before Labor won the seat in 2007.</p> <h2><strong>Cowan, Western Australia</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/wa/cowan.htm\">Cowan</a> is a Liberal seat in the northern suburbs of Perth, covering Wanneroo, Ballajura, Girrawheen and Beechboro.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Polls suggest a large swing to Labor in Western Australia, so it would be hoping to win back Cowan</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The Liberal MP Luke Simpkins won Cowan in 2007. Over four elections, Simpkins has increased the Liberal vote in Cowan by 13.4% but a redistribution shifted Cowan into more Labor-friendly areas, cutting his margin to 4.5%.</p> <p>Polls suggest a large swing to Labor in Western Australia, so it would be hoping to win back Cowan.</p> <h2><strong>Deakin, Victoria</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/vic/deakin.htm\">Deakin</a> covers parts of Melbourne\u2019s eastern suburbs, including Nunawading, Ringwood and Croydon.</p> <p>The Liberal MP Michael Sukkar won Deakin in 2013 with a 3.2% margin. Deakin is the most marginal Liberal seat in Melbourne and Labor would be hoping to regain it if it is on track to form government.</p> <h2><strong>Macarthur, NSW</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/nsw/macarthur.htm\">Macarthur</a> covers most of the Campbelltown area in south-western Sydney and is held by the Liberal MP Russell Matheson, who was first elected in 2010.</p> <p>The redistribution removed most of the Liberal-leaning Camden and Wollondilly areas, drawing Macarthur into Labor-friendly Campbelltown. This change cut the Liberal margin from 11.4% to 3.3%.</p> <p>The Liberal party has held Macarthur for 20 years but Labor now has a strong chance of winning it back.</p> <h2><strong>Mayo, South Australia</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/sa/mayo.htm\">Mayo</a> covers the Adelaide Hills, the Fleurieu peninsula and Kangaroo Island. The Liberal MP Jamie Briggs holds Mayo by a 12.5% margin.</p> <p>This seat looks safe on paper but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/05/nick-xenophon-brings-x-factor-to-election-results-in-south-australia\">the Nick Xenophon Team has identified Mayo as a key target</a>. Xenophon polled 28.3% of the Senate vote in Mayo at the 2013 election. Briggs could be in trouble if the NXT candidate can overtake Labor and benefit from Labor and Greens preferences.</p> <h2><strong>New England, NSW</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a9782d734a67cedd28e6123e1899db9852d09c79\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a9782d734a67cedd28e6123e1899db9852d09c79/78_403_4795_2877/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Barnaby Joyce\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Barnaby Joyce speaks to residents during a \u2018Politics in the Pub\u2019 event at Merriwa during a day of campaigning in new parts of his electorate of New England.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.aec.gov.au/profiles/nsw/new-england.htm\">New England</a> is shaping up as a fierce contest between <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/29/vendetta-barnaby-joyce-says-electoral-battle-with-tony-windsor-is-personal\">the sitting Nationals MP and deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, and his predecessor, the independent candidate Tony Windsor</a>.</p> <p>Windsor retired in 2013 and Joyce was easily elected without serious opposition. Windsor had won New England with relative ease against weaker Nationals opponents before 2013.</p> <p> Both candidates have won New England easily in the past but never in a tight contest.</p> <p>Windsor\u2019s popularity was once high but hasn\u2019t been tested in an election since his decision to support the Gillard government in 2010. Joyce will be a much stronger opponent than Windsor has faced in the past.</p> <h2>Map: ten seats to watch</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2016/may/raue-seats/\" data-alt=\"Map: ten seats to watch\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2016/may/raue-seats/\">Map: ten seats to watch</a> </figure>",

Most important of all, though, is that children are happy, as unhappy children cannot learn.</p> <p>We cannot separate the challenges facing our schools from the consequences of living in an ever more divided society where the number of children being brought up in poverty continues to grow. But we could help to mitigate the effects by creating learning communities that genuinely meet the needs of children, starting with a healthy breakfast, providing safe outdoor play spaces and inspiring them through the expressive arts. Literacy and numeracy are just the starting point; we need schools that foster emotional, moral and creative development as well as academic learning. But the narrow view of education peddled by successive Westminster governments has reduced schooling to an endless succession of knowledge bytes and tests.</p> <p>We don\u2019t need a national day of learning for fun as Gaby Hinsliff proposes but an entire education system that promotes the holistic development of children and young people and equips them to play their part in creating a fairer and more sustainable world.</p> <p>Scotland and Wales are completely overhauling their curriculums with such aims in mind and it is high time for England to do this too.<br /><strong>Fiona Carnie</strong><br /><em>Parent Councils UK</em></p> <p>\u2022 Gaby Hinsliff\u2019s echoing of the Let Our Kids Be Kids protests is a reminder that regimented standards-obsessed instruction saps creativity and diminishes the desire to learn. But there is another fundamental reason why education should be enjoyable. Working hard, in order to pass exams, in order to obtain credentials, in order to get a good job, in order to achieve fulfilment, to serve society and be able to afford to live well is, ultimately, about human happiness. But it\u2019s a long \u2013 albeit worthwhile \u2013 journey. A quicker route is to recognise that schooling should be pleasurable \u2013 not just because children learn better when they\u2019re happy but because happiness in the here and now is a worthy aim in\u00a0itself.<br /><strong>Mike Douse</strong> <br /><em>Author of An Enjoyment of Education, Brecon</em></p> <p>\u2022 Gaby Hinsliff is overly pessimistic about modern Lego kits. My grandson collected the Mixels sets avidly and made all the models as instructed. When I saw him last weekend he was making his own weird creatures from all the mixed-up pieces. Creativity will out. But the modern sets do have smaller bits, which are more difficult to spot before you tread on them.<br /><strong>Michael Harrison</strong><br /><em>Oxford</em></p> <p>\u2022 The research on phonics (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/04/the-rights-and-wrongs-of-testing-10-year-olds-on-modal-verbs\" title=\"\">The rights and wrongs of testing 10-year-olds on modal verbs,</a> Letters, 5 May) shows the superiority of systematic phonics teaching over unsystematic or no phonics teaching, but only within a broad and rich language and literacy curriculum, otherwise known as phonics plus whole language. And while this has been known from observation since Jeanne Chall\u2019s 1967 book Learning to Read: The Great Debate, the experimental research to back this up has been rigorously analysed only in the past 16 years.</p> <p>Your correspondent Brian McDevitt should not be surprised that results on the phonics test (let\u2019s call it that, since it is one) have improved each year \u2013 teachers\u2019 and schools\u2019 reputations depend on this and they therefore teach to it. I remain of the view, expressed as soon as this test was mooted, that imposing it on five- and six-year-olds is an abomination.</p> <p>And Alan Woodley should not be surprised that he never heard of modal verbs while doing O-level Latin (which, being a fusional language, has no such verbs) or A-level English (which has always been about literary rather than linguistic analysis).<br /><strong>Greg Brooks</strong><br /><em>Emeritus professor of education, Sheffiel</em>d</p> <p>\u2022 This week, my son will be sitting the new KS2 Sats. Before he and the rest of Year 6 pick up their pens, the outcomes over the next few years are entirely predictable; the methodology of developing and implementing the tests are that\u00a0flawed.</p> <p>These tests are for the end of a four-year curriculum, introduced less than two years before. The framework of the tests was originally intended to separate children into deciles by performance. This changed to a \u201cnational standard\u201d that children would achieve or not. What\u2019s important is that, after that decision, the test structure did not change. This year\u2019s children will be used to \u201cset\u201d the \u201cstandard\u201d: children who have had two years, not four, on the new curriculum, further disadvantaged by the last-minute release of specifications and one sample paper.</p> <p>Will next year\u2019s cohort perform better? Of course, they will. They\u2019ll have had one more year on the curriculum, and there\u2019ll be one more paper, so a bit less mystery. We could plot the curve right now. The irony is that the content and reasonableness of the curriculum and test don\u2019t matter at all. The children don\u2019t matter. The teaching doesn\u2019t matter: the test would never have demonstrated the ability of the teacher, any more than a driving test tells you anything about the instructor.</p> <p>Remember this in 2020, when the education ministers insist that children\u2019s literacy has improved, thanks to their rigorous curriculum and testing regime. Whoever signed this off needs to have a good read of the definition of a fair test: they may find it in their science curriculum for infants. My child is being used in the most careless, empty way possible to generate meaningless numbers: he deserves better. Children, teachers, schools and parents deserve better than a contrived \u201cstandard\u201d, decided after the results are in, which puts their school at risk.<br /><strong>Amanda Harris</strong><br /><em>Shrewsbury</em></p> <p>\u2022 The English obsession with testing is crazy \u2013 and counterproductive. The Scandinavians and Germans don\u2019t teach reading until children are seven. That is, when the majority of children are \u201cready\u201d. Prior to that, the emphasis is on play, art, imagination, exploration of the environment, forest schooling, etc \u2013 essentially socialising the children in the broadest sense. Result: their countries outperformed us in the 2013 OECD study of young adults (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/oct/08/england-young-people-league-table-basic-skills-oecd\" title=\"\">Report</a>, theguardian.com, 8 October 2013). Out of 24 countries studied, Finland, Sweden and Germany were in the top 10 for literacy, England came in at 22. Conclusion: our early test-based education system doesn\u2019t work for a sizeable minority. And it\u2019s not a whole lot of fun for the majority either. Isn\u2019t it time we had a re-think, and a radical change?<br /><strong>Patrick Glass</strong><br /><em>St Leonards-on-Sea, East Sussex</em></p> <p><strong><em>\u2022 Join the debate \u2013 email </em></strong><a href=\"mailto:guardian.letters@theguardian.com\" title=\"\"><strong><em>guardian.letters@theguardian.com</em></strong></a></p>",

Overcrowding exacerbates the problem of self-inflicted deaths but it is not the cause. The shocking statistics to which he refers belie any suggestion that the government is successfully pursuing a reform agenda.</p> <p>They reflect the desperate reality of prison life and the failure to protect those in its care. Prisons are places where the safety and dignity of prisoners is increasingly under threat. Every day <a href=\"http://www.inquest.org.uk/about/home\" title=\"\">INQUEST</a> hears harrowing stories from the families of those who have died. Time and again deaths occur that reveal failures in treatment and care.</p> <p>Until there is a dramatic reduction in the use of prison, a redirection of resources into community alternatives, a willingness to act on the learning from previous deaths and a commitment to hold those involved legally accountable for deaths across all state institutions, then the endemic problem of death and self-harm will continue with devastating consequences for prisoners and their families.<br /><strong>Deborah Coles</strong><br /><em>Director, INQUEST</em><br /><strong>Professor Joe Sim</strong><br /><em>Liverpool John Moore\u2019s University</em></p> <p>\u2022 When are we going to come to our senses over tough talk and action on crime and where it is disastrously leading us? In the early 1990s with the prison population around 46,000, all serious senior prison managers (they used to exchange ideas with us criminal defence practitioners in those days) deemed it already far too many. Those incarcerated were \u2013 and remain \u2013 predominantly the inadequate, vulnerable, drug and drink-addicted jail fodder of largely nuisance value. This is even more so now at 85,000 costing us at least \u00a330,000 per annum apiece. Far cheaper options with proven track records of deflecting from rapid reoffending have been mindlessly eschewed on occasions without number.In the early 90s, the home secretary Douglas Hurd tried hard but then shallow electoral considerations had both Conservative and Labour administrations outbidding each other with more of the same counterproductive and populistic non-sequiturs</p> <p>We still have time to learn from the financial and social mess the US prison estate is now in before it is too late.

      "headline": "Sir Craig Reedie wants drug-cheat sponsorship money for anti-doping fight",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-09T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>The president of the World Anti-Doping Agency, Sir Craig Reedie, has called for sponsorship revenue from cheating athletes to be diverted to the fight against doping and for a levy on TV rights deals as part of a huge increase in the organisation\u2019s resources.</p> <p>Reedie, under close scrutiny since athletics was plunged into crisis by evidence of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/09/london-olympics-russia-doping-report\" title=\"\">systemic Russian doping</a>, has for the first time made specific proposals for vastly increasing Wada\u2019s income outside its current funding model.</p> <p>In an article for <a href=\"http://viewer.gutools.co.uk/preview/sport/2016/may/08/sports-sponsors-must-not-shirk-duty-to-fans-by-ignoring-doping-threat\" title=\"\">theguardian.com</a>, Reedie said that, while Wada could be proud of how far it had come since its formation in 1999, it was time for a step change.</p> <p>He suggested that sponsors should write a clause into the contracts of athletes they back that would divert endorsement fees into the fight against doping if they were found cheating.</p> <p>Reedie, an International Olympic Committee vice-president, also endorsed another idea that has been intermittently proposed by Wada executives but has gained traction in recent months as the scale of the global challenge has again become clear. Noting that the revenue from global broadcasting rights is estimated at $35bn per annum, Reedie suggested a levy on each deal to boost Wada\u2019s existing $30m-a-year budget.</p> <p>\u201cTo impose, for example, a 0.5% tariff on this $35bn annual media rights figure would instantly put $175m more in the anti-doping coffers, increasing Wada\u2019s budget five-fold,\u201d he said. \u201cWith such extra funds we could make a greater impact in protecting the rights of the clean athletes and in turn uphold the integrity of sport.\u201d</p> <p>Reedie said sponsors should take more responsibility for the fight against doping. Huge sportswear companies such as Nike have come under particular scrutiny for continuing to endorse athletes even after they have been banned. \u201cSponsorship is also an enormous contributor to the sport industry. Major sports sponsors should start to look at how they might support clean sport,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cTake pharmaceutical companies, for example, with whom the anti-doping movement has strong relations. While anti-doping has an interest in protecting the rights of the clean athlete, the pharmaceutical industry has a significant stake in ensuring that its products are being used for legitimate medical reasons, not abused by athletes seeking an edge.\u201d</p> <p>There is widespread acceptance that Wada needs more funds if it is to conduct more proactive investigations of the kind led by an independent commission chaired by Dick Pound that uncovered widespread systemic doping in Russia.</p> <p>However, others in the anti-doping world argue that Wada has become too bureaucratic and beholden to its paymasters and must prove first it is capable of spending additional funds wisely.</p> <p>Reedie argued that Wada has been doing its bit to increase funding \u2013 establishing a new $12m fund to research new testing methods and receiving an encouraging response to a recent plea to fund more investigations in the mould of Pound\u2019s \u2013 but that other stakeholders must now do the same. Wada\u2019s current $30m funding is provided equally 50-50 by the IOC and national governments.</p> <p>\u201cWe need to rally all sport\u2019s stakeholders \u2013 including broadcasters and sponsors \u2013 to the clean sport cause,\u201d Reedie said. \u201cPublic opinion is also firmly in favour of a level playing field and so we all have a duty to protect the clean athletes and ensure the fairest, most efficient system possible is in place for athletes across the world. Sport, government, athletes, broadcasters and sponsors alike share this important duty.\u201d</p> <p>The International Association of Athletics Federations and its under-pressure president, Sebastian Coe, will decide on 17 June whether to allow Russia back into the sport before the Rio Olympics, in what will be a pivotal moment.</p> <p>The Norwegian anti-doping expert Rune Andersen has been leading an independent task force to assess whether Russia has complied with a list of requirements set down by Wada.</p> <p>Despite Pound warning last week it would be \u201cvery hard\u201d to trust that Russian athletes competing at the Games were clean, the IOC president Thomas Bach is believed to be lobbying hard for the IAAF to allow them to return.</p> <p>\u201cThere will be a lot pressure to get them back in and from a system point of view, it would be nice to have everybody at the Games,\u201d Pound said. \u201cBut whether that makes sense in terms of the changes they\u2019ve made remains to be seen. I think there\u2019s still some elements of denial [in Russia].\u201d</p>",

This aim should apply to all people, not just Australians, it said.

The campaign will be tough, Credlin said, with 5am starts and a strong focus on staying on message.</p> <p>The softly spoken but resolute Credlin was a highlight of a very long day of talking heads on Sky, notwithstanding the talents of journalists David Speers, Kieran Gilbert and Ashleigh Gillon and commentators Michael Kroger, Peter Beattie and Grahame Morris.<br /></p> <p>But those of us who tuned in to watch the big event play out found themselves agreeing with the Tasmanian senator Jacquie Lambie. \u201cI\u2019m really disappointed.

I\u2019m going to be spending Mother\u2019s Day with my family and what I want to do know is why didn\u2019t the PM call the election today \u2013 being Saturday \u2013 or on Monday? Mother\u2019s Day doesn\u2019t need to be turned into Turnbull\u2019s day.\u201d</p>",

At Hillsborough the poorly led South Yorkshire force first responded to events incompetently and then conspired to cover up its incompetence. At Orgreave the police are suspected of conspiring in advance, and initiating the confrontations. Having planned in advance, as later at Hillsborough, they stood accused of conspiring afterwards to cover up.</p> <p>Initiating a crisis is patently more serious than responding incompetently to a crisis. That this is believed to have been the case at Orgreave raises even more serious questions of complicity at higher levels than South Yorkshire. How did the situation arise that senior officers apparently thought they could behave provocatively and outside the law? Who was giving them nods and winks? Was there government involvement?<br /><strong>Dr John Hull</strong><br /><em>Sheffield</em></p> <p>\u2022 Perhaps the Orgreave inquiry could run in parallel with one into events at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jan/01/past.politics1\" title=\"\">Saltley in 1972</a>. There, intimidating flying pickets closed the coke depot in pursuit of a 43% rise for miners, setting in train the eventual fall of Edward Heath\u2019s government, and the March 1974 capitulation to the NUM by the newly elected (only just) Labour employment secretary Michael Foot with another 35% that helped feed the inflationary spiral of the 70s that in turn led to the trade union self-immolation in the winter of discontent that prefaced the election of Mrs Thatcher.</p> <p>That other inquiry might find that the left had created the perfect storm for the Thatcher government with its 144 majority; only a fool would have taken her on in early 1984 and only a fool would have called out the miners without a vote, and only a fool would have divided the workforce and the families and communities within it. It took politically motivated Arthur Scargill to challenge her and he had much to answer for thereon. However at Ken Capstick\u2019s inquiry, Scargill would have the advantage.

      "body": "<p>Novak Djokovic survived a determined fightback from Andy Murray to claim the Madrid Open title for the second time in his career. The Serb carved out a 6-2, 3-6, 6-3 victory, by turns brilliant and battling, to triumph in two hours and six minutes and move one win ahead of Rafael Nadal as the player with the most Masters Series titles to his name.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2016/may/08/madrid-open-live-andy-murray-novak-djokovic\">Novak Djokovic beats Andy Murray: Madrid Open men's final \u2013 as it happened</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Murray, the defending champion, will slip from second to third in the world rankings after the defeat but can take heart from his superb response to what was an imperious start by Djokovic, who has now won 15 straight matches against top 10 players as well as 10 of the past 14 Masters titles.</p> <p>Congratulating Djokovic on \u201canother fantastic win for him\u201d during the post-match formalities, Murray ruefully reflected on his 23rd defeat by Djokovic in 32 matches: \u201cThere\u2019s been a lot against me, unfortunately, over the past couple of years. I would have loved to have defended the title today but it wasn\u2019t to be.\u201d</p> <p>That may be so but it was a desperately close affair, right the way through to a titanic and seemingly interminable final game in which Djokovic was forced to save seven break points. Indeed, the one-sided nature of the opening set only belied the sense of symmetry otherwise surrounding the contest.</p> <p>It was in Madrid, a decade ago, that the pair first locked horns as professionals, Djokovic coming through the battle of the relatively unheralded teenagers in three close sets. Ten years on, they renewed hostilities as the two best players on the planet, Murray seeking a victory that would prevent Roger Federer from deposing him as world No2, Djokovic intent on laying down a marker for the French Open, the one major that has eluded him.</p> <p>But while the match might have looked finely poised on paper, Djokovic had other ideas. Betraying no hint of the uncharacteristic nerves that, by his own admission, had hampered him towards the end of his semi-final win over Kei Nishikori, the Serb began like a rocket, leading Murray a merry dance with his variety and precision from the back of the court.</p> <p>Djokovic broke in the opening game and quickly raced further ahead, his superiority such that the Scot, recently serving with added speed and bite after making technical adjustments to his delivery, could win only 17% of points on his second serve during a first set that flashed by in half an hour.</p> <p>At that point things looked unrelentingly bleak for Murray. He had never come from a set down to beat Djokovic and, with the world No1 looking unassailable from the baseline, there seemed little hope of him dictating the play as he had done so thrillingly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/07/andy-murray-rafael-nadal-madrid-open-final\">in his last-four victory over Rafael Nadal</a>.</p> <p>From somewhere, though, the man from Dunblane discovered a second wind. A battering-ram of a backhand set the tone for a swashbuckling start to the second set and before long the pressure told. Serving at 1-2, 15-30, Djokovic hooked a forehand wide to concede two break points, the second of which Murray converted through a Djokovic double-fault.</p> <p>That collector\u2019s item gave Murray a momentum that swept him through the second set and by the time the Serb produced another \u2013 also on break point and this time after moving ahead 2-0 in the decisive set \u2013 it felt altogether less surprising. But while Murray\u2019s aggressive positioning on the return reaped dividends at times, Djokovic is nothing if not a fighter and eventually, tenaciously, he served out for the title.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-09T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Google artificial intelligence project <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/health\" title=\"\">DeepMind</a> is building software to trawl through <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/24/smartphone-apps-google-deepmind-nhs-hospitals\" title=\"\">millions of patient records</a> from three NHS hospitals to detect early signs of kidney disease. The project raises deep questions not only about data protection but about the ethics of artificial intelligence. But these are not the obvious questions about the ethics of autonomous, intelligent computers.</p> <p>Computer programs can now do some things that it once seemed only human beings could do, such as playing an excellent <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/mar/12/alphago-beats-lee-sedol-in-third-consecutive-go-game\" title=\"\">game of Go</a>. But even the smartest computer cannot make ethical choices, because it has no purpose of its own in life. The program that plays Go cannot decide that it also wants a driving licence like its cousin, the program that drives Google\u2019s cars.</p> <p>The ethical questions involved in the deal are partly political: they have to do with trusting a private US corporation with a great deal of data from which it hopes in the long term to make a great deal of money. Further questions are raised by the mere existence, or construction, of a giant data store containing unimaginable amounts of detail about patients and their treatments. This might yield useful medical knowledge. It could certainly yield all kinds of damaging personal knowledge. But questions of medical confidentiality, although serious, are not new in principle or in practice and they may not be the most disturbing aspects of the deal.</p> <p>What frightens people is the idea that we are constructing machines that will think for themselves, and will be able to keep secrets from us that they will use to their own advantage rather than to ours. The tendency to invest such powers in lifeless and unintelligent things goes back to the very beginnings of AI research and beyond.</p> <p>In the 1960s, <a href=\"http://www.librarything.com/work/68469/book/28383752\" title=\"\">Joseph Weizenbaum</a>, one of the pioneers of computer science, created <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA\" title=\"\">the chatbot Eliza</a>, which mimicked a non-directional psychoanalyst. It used cues supplied by the users \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m worried about my father\u201d \u2013 to ask open-ended questions: \u201cHow do you feel about your father?\u201d The astonishing thing was that students were happy to answer at length, as if they had been asked by a sympathetic, living listener. Weizenbaum was horrified, especially when his secretary, who knew perfectly well what Eliza was, asked him to leave the room while she \u201ctalked\u201d to it.</p> <p>Eliza\u2019s latest successor, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/28/world/asia/china-robot-monk-temple.html\" title=\"\">Xian\u2019er, the Worthy Stupid Robot Monk</a>, functions in a Buddhist temple in Beijing, where it dispenses wisdom in response to questions asked through a touchpad on his chest. People seem to ask it serious questions such as \u201cWhat is love?\u201d, \u201cHow do I get ahead in life?\u201d; the answers are somewhere between a horoscope and a homily. Since they are not entirely predicable, Xian\u2019er is treated as a primitive kind of AI.</p> <p>Most discussions of AI and most calls for an ethics of AI assume we will have no problem recognising it once it emerges. The examples of Eliza and Xian\u2019er show this is questionable. They get treated as intelligent even though we know they are not. But that is only one error we could make when approaching the problem. We might also fail to recognise intelligence when it does exist, or while it is emerging.</p> <p>The myth of Frankenstein\u2019s monster is misleading. There might be no lightning bolt moment when we realise that it is alive and uncontrollable. Intelligent brains are built from billions of neurones that are not themselves intelligent. If a post-human intelligence arises, it will also be from a system of parts that do not, as individuals, share in the post-human intelligence of the whole. Parts of it would be human. Parts would be computer systems. No part could understand the whole but all would share its interests without completely comprehending them.</p> <p>Such hybrid systems would not be radically different from earlier social inventions made by humans and their tools, but their powers would be unprecedented. Constructing and enforcing an ethical framework for them would be as difficult as it has been to lay down principles of international law. But it may become every bit as urgent.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-09T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Danny Welbeck\u2019s hopes of being selected for England\u2019s Euro 2016 campaign are under threat after he suffered a suspected lateral meniscus injury in his right knee during <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/08/manchester-city-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Arsenal\u2019s 2-2 draw at Manchester City</a> on Sunday.</p> <p>The striker went down in pain after attempting to tackle Bacary Sagna with 21 minutes played. Welbeck tried to carry on but was forced off and while Ars\u00e8ne Wenger was keen to be optimistic, his manager admitted the player was \u201cvery down\u201d afterwards.</p> <p>The forward had returned to action only in February after 10 months out because of a cartilage problem in his left knee. Roy Hodgson, the England manager, selects his European Championship squad on Thursday. Asked about his striker\u2019s availability for the championships in France, Wenger said: \u201cLet\u2019s hope it\u2019s good news. Good news is that he may not be out for the Euros and bad news is that he will be.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t know. I am an optimist. I don\u2019t know if it is the lateral meniscus, let\u2019s wait until we get a really good diagnosis. I hope it is not a meniscus but there is a little sign of that. At half-time I looked at him, he was very down and he had pain. We have to wait for a scan. Danny is a strong boy and we tried to keep him on the pitch but straight away he tried to move and said it was impossible.\u201d</p> <p>The draw means that Arsenal require a point against Aston Villa on Sunday to be sure of a Champions League place. The result, though, was bad for City as their hopes of a top-four finish now depend on other results.</p> <p>Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s team have 65 points, two more than Manchester United but their neighbours have an extra game, the visit to West Ham United on Tuesday.</p> <p>If Louis van Gaal\u2019s side win there and against Bournemouth in their final match at Old Trafford, City will finish fifth even if they beat Swansea City and Arsenal can only draw. Despite this being Pellegrini\u2019s final home match before Pep Guardiola takes over in the summer, fans signalled their disquiet at the result by emptying the stadium at the end. This meant that when the Chilean and his players came out a few minutes later to say thank you to supporters, he gave a goodbye speech to a crowd of around 5,000.</p> <p>Pellegrini said this had not disappointed him. \u201cI was disappointed not to win the game,\u201d he said. \u201cWinning the three points would have been a very good way to say goodbye. I have had three unforgettable years here that I don\u2019t want to analyse in this moment. We can do that next Sunday. We are not finished the season. If you don\u2019t depend just on what you can do it is more difficult but we will see on Tuesday what will happen between Manchester United and West Ham. I think we deserve to be in Champions League because we have had 37 games in [the] position of champions [league qualification].</p> <p>\u201cNo, I don\u2019t think [the players wilted under pressure]. If you think about pressure, maybe we felt it on Wednesday [at Real Madrid]. I cannot regret nothing about the team today, especially in the first 45 minutes. We conceded a very easy goal but we played at high pace, had a lot of attempts.\u201d</p> <p>Pellegrini confirmed Vincent Kompany has had surgery on the thigh muscle he injured during <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/04/real-madrid-manchester-city-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">the 1-0 Champions League semi-final second leg defeat</a> at Real. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long he will be out but it will be a long, long time,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The Belgian national team physiotherapist Lieven Maesschalck was reportedly more specific, adding that Kompany would be out for four months.</p>",

      "headline": "The Guardian view on the housing bill: ideological overreach\r\n",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-09T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>The Conservative government is just one year old and so far it has been forced into nine significant U-turns. Apparently in denial of its tiny working majority, ministers also ignore the extraordinary political environment created by the EU referendum, conditions predecessors would have regarded as a reason for caution and a readiness to compromise. Instead, usually under an ideological banner brandished aloft by the chancellor, this government prefers to charge into controversy, citing the authority of manifesto commitments approved by little more than a third of those who voted, and when forced to backtrack on ill-planned proposals, blames parliament as undemocratic. It is true (and absurd) that the unelected peers have played a major role in overturning some of the government\u2019s most outrageous ideas \u2013 cuts to working tax credits being only the most famous of a series of victories \u2013 but the government\u2019s bullying tactics will mean ill-considered policies are rammed through, at the risk of weakening parliament for ever.</p> <p>The last stand is the housing bill. Ministers say it will tackle the housing crisis, critics say it will intensify it. It introduces starter homes, and gives the right to buy to housing association tenants, to be paid for by the forced sale of high-value council homes. For the first time the Tories\u2019 100-seat majority among English MPs is in play: this is the inaugural test of English votes for English laws. As a result, the only place votes can be won is in the Lords. Led by Lord Bob Kerslake, the former senior civil servant and local government veteran, the Lords has made the bill <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/housing-network/2016/may/05/lord-kerslake-government-social-housing-toxic-planning-bill\" title=\"\">better than it was</a>. For example, where council homes are sold, they must now be replaced with new homes \u2013 two for one in London; terms for homes sold on have been tightened up. But Lord Kerslake\u2019s attempts to ensure the untried starter home does not squeeze out other forms of affordable housing such as shared ownership have been defeated, and the bill still clearly favours those who can save (or borrow from parents) enough for a deposit over those who must rent. Social housing will no longer be a safe and available resource for lower earners. It will be a place of last resort.</p> <p>Financing for the measure is still opaque. In a rare and damning pre-legislative report, MPs on the cross-party public accounts committee <a href=\"http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/public-accounts-committee/news-parliament-2015/right-to-buy-report-published-15-16/\" title=\"\">said last month</a> that not only had the government failed to come up with even back of the envelope calculations, there was no envelope. It is a shaming indication of the lack of attention to detail in government that after Shelter estimated that selling \u201chigh\u201d-value council homes would not produce nearly enough cash to pay for the right to buy discount, the definition was changed to \u201chigher\u201d. In <a href=\"http://blog.shelter.org.uk/2016/05/high-to-higher-forced-sales-mean-23500-council-homes-lost-per-year-and-an-average-annual-26m-bill/\" title=\"\">a report</a>, the charity reckoned that to meet the \u00a34.5bn to be raised nationally would mean the sale of 23,500 council homes a year. An attempt by peers to challenge the way that these critical details are to be dealt with by regulations that, after the revolt on tax credits, they are no longer allowed a say in, was defeated. Constitution-minded critics say that each year 12,000 pages of legislative detail are now introduced in ways that avoid scrutiny by either chamber of parliament.</p> <p>For millions of families, this legislation is likely to turn the housing crisis into a drama. Up against the end-of-session deadline, further concessions seem unlikely. But second thoughts are not necessarily a bad thing. Last Friday, the education secretary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/06/government-backs-down-over-plan-to-make-all-schools-academies\" title=\"\">wisely heeded critic</a>s of her plans to force all schools to become academies. Last Wednesday, the prime minister sensibly <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/04/david-cameron-concessions-syrian-child-refugees\" title=\"\">acknowledged the moral case</a> to help lone child refugees. Common sense has prevailed over trade union legislation, tax credits and disability living allowance.</p> <p>These are wise moves in challenging times. This is not the moment to be steam-rollering divisive and untested ideas through a reluctant parliament, inflicting irreversible collateral damage to democratic scrutiny on the way. George Osborne <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2016/may/08/sadiq-khan-labour-london-mayor-jeremy-corbyn-politics-live-blog?page=with:block-572f1370e4b0af04cb88947a#block-572f1370e4b0af04cb88947a\" title=\"\">told TV interviewers</a> on Sunday morning that he is not in politics to coast along. Right now, that would be a lot wiser than his apparent preference for ideological overreach.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Say what you will about whether qualifying for Europe actually constitutes success. Snicker all you like about the maligned Fourth Place Trophy. As it turns out, the new mood in the Premier League \u2013 with emboldened outsiders hellbent on breaking the status quo \u2013 visibly loaded the pressure on both Manchester City and Arsenal. Missing out is not easily tolerated.</p> <p>When this harum-scarum <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/08/manchester-city-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">duel was poised at 2-2</a> with 10 minutes left to swing it, both Manuel Pellegrini and Ars\u00e8ne Wenger stood upright and anxious at the edge of their technical areas. They crossed and uncrossed their arms, then paced in small circles. It was like a weird form of synchronised managerial stress dancing. Both were swimming in the Champions League qualification deep end and at the end of it all Wenger emerged the stronger.</p> <p>Arsenal will avoid the awkwardness of a qualification match during a truncated tournament summer as long as they avoid defeat when they host Aston Villa next Sunday. That would tie up a top-three position.</p> <p>Of course such are the confounding oddities of this season that Wenger would not take that for granted. He spoke afterwards of the unpredictability of it all. \u201cLook at the results,\u201d he pointed out, eyebrow arched. \u201cWe need to keep the focus.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/29/arsene-wenger-arsenal-failures-down-to-playing-in-difficult-climate\">Ars\u00e8ne Wenger: Arsenal playing in a \u2018very difficult climate\u2019 at Emirates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As for City, matters are more perilous. Manchester United can bypass City at the last hurdle if Louis van Gaal\u2019s team are able to profit in their final two games. That realisation darkened the mood at a sun-drenched Etihad. Some cursory boos at the final whistle were mixed with tepid applause from the City fans as the majority streamed away.</p> <p>It was a downbeat farewell to Pellegrini from the crowd here as they prepare for Pep Guardiola. By the time the team and their soon-to-be-former manager returned to the pitch for an awkward bow and a farewell wave, there were only a few thousand fans left. The fondness for Pellegrini was there \u2013 the message \u201cGracias Manuel\u201d was unfurled on a sizeable pale blue flag \u2013 but it had the feel of a club needing a fresh chapter. The lap of appreciation was like a flat, lukewarm glass of beer that had been forgotten in the sun for too long. Some wag described it perfectly as \u201clapathy\u201d.</p> <p>City did show flashes of the kind of intensity that will be expected next season but nowhere near enough and not of the sufficiently concentrated variety. Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Kevin De\u00a0Bruyne showed the fleet-footedness and drive to slash low strikes beyond the reach of Petr Cech. But Arsenal responded each time. Some of Wenger\u2019s attacking players who have been on the struggling side of erratic over the second half of this season found a moment to lift their team. Olivier Giroud broke his goal drought, Alexis S\u00e1nchez raised his game for one critical attack and briefly summoned his most dynamic style to equalise. Even Theo Walcott came on and looked bright on the right-hand side. Meanwhile Danny Welbeck waits anxiously for news on the state of his knee.</p> <p>The tone of Manchester City is expected to feel distinctly sharpened by the time they return at the start of next season for life under Se\u00f1or Guardiola. But in which European tournament? City sat second in the table when the club made the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/17/guardiola-has-been-a-distraction-for-manchester-city-says-manuel-pellegrini\" title=\"\">announcement in early February</a> that the coveted Catalan would canter into town. Since then they have drifted domestically to the extent they are scrabbling for fourth place, having handed the initiative to the neighbours. To borrow a phrase once made famous down the road, it is squeaky-bum time.</p> <p>Sooner or later the penny has to drop that the general obsession with Champions League qualification as a minimum requirement is not a realistic one for too many clubs to hold dear. Irrespective of financial investment or status of personnel, it is not practical.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/apr/29/arsene-wenger-real-barcelona-manchester-city\">Ars\u00e8ne Wenger reveals he rejected Real, Barcelona and Manchester City</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Given the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/leicester-everton-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">magnificent Leicester example</a>, the statements of intent made by Tottenham under Mauricio Pochettino and more recently Liverpool under J\u00fcrgen Klopp, and the number of clubs who will be expecting a considerable improvement on their Premier League campaigns next season (the managers who will pick up at Chelsea, Manchester City and whoever is in charge at Manchester United know that all too well) it does not require a mathematical genius to work out that there is basically not enough success to go around. Champions League qualification, and titles, cannot possibly be bestowed on everyone who aims for the big prizes.</p> <p>The broader question as to what in English football qualifies as success does seem to be changing by necessity. Pellegrini would not throw in the towel in terms of a top-four finish at this point. He remains proud of taking <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/04/real-madrid-manchester-city-champions-league-match-report\" title=\"\">City to the Champions League semi-finals</a> and regards that as an achievement.</p> <p>Meanwhile, over in Germany, the current Bayern Munich manager won a farewell Bundesliga this weekend (his third in succession) after enduring the apparent ignominy of departing without ever winning the Champions League during his stay in Germany.</p> <p>It seems bizarre to think Wenger\u2019s first qualification for the Champions League with Arsenal, during his first full campaign in England in 1997-98, coincided with Manchester City\u2019s relegation to English football\u2019s third tier. Wenger is closing in on his 19th consecutive ticket to Europe\u2019s elite party. It may not be enough for some of his detractors but maybe it is not to be sniffed at after all.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Hull FC produced an attacking masterclass to set up an intriguing Challenge Cup quarter-final with Catalans Dragons after inflicting a first home defeat in the cup on St Helens for more than two decades.</p> <p>Not since their defeat against Wigan in 1995, in the days before Super League and summer rugby, had the Saints been eliminated from the cup on their own ground but here \u2013 led by the outstanding trio of Marc Sneyd, Danny Houghton and Scott Taylor \u2013 Hull\u2019s attacking flair was too much for a St Helens side who were second best in almost every aspect of the contest.</p> <p>The last time these two teams met in the cup was the 2008 final, when the coaches for this encounter, Lee Radford and Keiron Cunningham, were captaining Hull and St Helens respectively. The Saints won on that occasion but from early on here, a repeat was never on the cards.</p> <p>Mark Percival\u2019s early try had hinted at a promising afternoon for the hosts but, when Hull hit back, they were near enough unstoppable on occasions. Tries from Houghton, Taylor and the Hull captain, Gareth Ellis, put the visitors 18-6 up and in complete control, with Jamie Shaul \u2013 a player who is surely attracting the eye of the England coach, Wayne Bennett \u2013 inflicted more misery on the home side just before the break.</p> <p>The boot of Sneyd was crucial all afternoon, with the half-back\u2019s 15-point tally only half of his all-round contribution. A Luke Walsh try just after half time had given the hosts faint hope, but Hull cut loose again after that, with tries for Curtis Naughton, Kirk Yeaman, a second for Taylor and an incredible finish from the wing, Fetuli Talanoa, sealed Hull\u2019s passage into the last eight with ease.</p> <p>Hull\u2019s quarter-final tie against the Dragons will be played next month, with Super League leaders Warrington hosting Widnes, Castleford travelling to Wigan and an all-West Yorkshire affair between Huddersfield and Wakefield the three other ties. Pity the Dragons though because on this basis, nobody would have fancied drawing Radford\u2019s team.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Only 24 hours after being tipped as a future international by the former England head coach Andy Flower, Tom Abell scored his second first-class century for Somerset before two late Warwickshire wickets completed an absorbing day one at Edgbaston.</p> <p>The opener\u2019s mature and controlled 104, an innings of defiance against a Warwickshire attack brimming with class, belied his 22 years and, along with a typically pugnacious 94 from their No6, Peter Trego, provided the foundations for his side\u2019s 295.</p> <p>The hosts then lost Ian Westwood and the nightwatchman, Boyd Rankin, late on to reach 27 for two at stumps. They will be concerned too by the fitness of Ian Bell after a hamstring niggle forced the home captain to miss an evening session in which his bowlers claimed six wickets to deny the visitors a third batting point.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been struggling a bit lately but when you hear praise from someone like [Flower] it\u2019s incredibly flattering and pretty special,\u201d said Abell, who had not reached 30 in his previous four innings this season.</p> <p>\u201cIt was a very special feeling to get stuck in today and reach that landmark. It\u2019s a relief as I\u2019ve not been pulling my weight so far.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/07/ian-bell-warwickshire-captain-history-england-county-championship-test\">Ian Bell: \u2018I want to help Warwickshire embrace history but I\u2019m not finished with England\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Abell\u2019s talent has been trailed for some time. In 2013 he was Young Wisden Schools Cricketer of the Year after a golden summer for Taunton School the previous year, an award previously won by Jos Buttler, Jonny Bairstow and James Taylor. Last season he was named the Championship\u2019s Breakthrough Player.</p> <p>After completing a degree in French and Sports Science at Exeter last year, Abell had been due to spend time in France to perfect the language only to opt for a winter playing for Fremantle in Western Australia instead, where he scored two hundreds and averaged 47 in the tough finishing school that is grade cricket.</p> <p>A touch of French cricket, trapped lbw to Jonathan Trott after tea, caused his demise but not before he had supported Flower\u2019s appraisal and earned similar praise after stumps by his executioner, with an adhesive century from 175 balls that demonstrated controlled and correct application while senior colleagues were being guillotined at the other end.</p> <p>Keith Barker, Warwickshire\u2019s swing specialist left-armer, provided the sternest test after Somerset won the toss, bowling Marcus Trescothick and snaring Chris Rogers caught behind. A glossy counterattack from James Hildreth in a stand of 56 with Abell ended with the right-hander caught on 38 by Sam Hain; he smashed a ball from Rankin into the short-leg\u2019s chest only to see the rebound snaffled up.</p> <p>After Jim Allenby fenced Barker to Trott at gully after lunch to leave Somerset 117 for four, Abell and Trego held firm for 110 runs in 33 overs. The former, who patiently accumulated behind square and off his legs, brought up three figures with an all-run four swept off Jeetan Patel on the stroke of tea, the 12th of the innings to go with his first senior six.</p> <p>Warwickshire wrested back control of the day in the evening session. Abell\u2019s wicket was the first of six that fell for 68 in 19 overs and Trego was denied his century as one of three victims for Chris Woakes. A sting in the tail would come in a tricky seven-over spell late on, however, with Westwood trapped lbw by Lewis Gregory and Rankin fencing Craig Overton to leg slip.</p> <p>With Bell, amid renewed talk of an England recall, unable to bat because of time off the field, Trott will resume alongside Varun Chopra in the morning.</p>",

She said the man involved also made several telephone calls to her daughter threatening to rape her and inciting her to carry out sexual acts.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/08/they-didnt-know-they-were-victims-revenge-porn-helpline-sees-alarming-rise\">'They didn't know they were victims': revenge porn helpline sees alarming rise</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Sussex police arrested a 36-year-old man from Eastbourne last week after receiving complaints from four women in the town \u2013 including the 15-year-old \u2013 that images had been posted without consent onto the pornography forum. The suspect admitted the offences, which took place over a five-month period. He was cautioned for one offence of revenge porn \u2013 disclosing sexual images of an individual without their permission and with intent to cause harm \u2013 and three offences of causing to be sent by public communication network an offensive, indecent, obscene or menacing message. The cautions related to four victims. Police said they were reviewing allegations made by a fifth victim whose complaint of a similar offence had been recorded as no crime.<br /></p> <p>The director of public prosecutions, Alison Saunders, has issued guidance to police and prosecutors that where there is more than one incident or it is part of a pattern of behaviour towards one individual a charge of harassment should be considered. If the victim is under 18, a charge under the Protection of Children Act 1978 should be considered and in the most serious cases, where images are used to incite sexual activity, a charge under the Sexual Offences Act 2003 should be considered.</p> <p>Saunders also made clear to lawyers and the police that when considering a charge of revenge porn, the issue is whether the message or communication is grossly offensive, indecent, obscene or false \u2013 not whether the image itself is indecent.</p> <p>The mother said her daughter had been targeted since last year by the man and had received several messages on her mobile phone of a sexually suggestive and abusive nature. She found out that he had uploaded a picture from her Facebook page on to the porn site when another victim contacted her.</p> <p>The mother said: \u201cI reported it to the Metropolitan police in London and they said it was looking like grooming and stalking, they said it was a potentially serious offence and told me to contact the police in Eastbourne.</p> <p>\u201cMy daughter reported it to the police and they gave her a crime reference number and interviewed her. Then she told me last week that he had been given a caution and hadn\u2019t been charged with anything. I think it\u2019s absolutely disgusting. There were images of five or six women he put on the website, including my daughter. He also kept ringing her mobile and saying the most disgusting things to her.</p> <p>\u201cWho knows if he is doing this to other girls. It\u2019s terrible he has not gone through the justice system. It caused her real distress.\u201d</p> <p>Figures released last month from 31 police forces after an FOI request by the BBC revealed that most offences of revenge porn do not result in a criminal charge. Revenge porn \u2013 or disclosing private sexual photographs and films without the consent of the individual and with intent to cause distress \u2013 became a criminal offence in England and Wales in April 2015.</p> <p>There were 1,160 reports of revenge porn between April and December 2015, made to 31 police forces in England and Wales. Three victims were 11 years old.</p> <p>In 11% of cases the suspect was charged, 7% received a caution and 5% a community resolution. However, 61% of cases resulted in no action being taken, with lack of evidence or the victim withdrawing support given as the reason.</p> <p>Laura Higgins, founder of the <a href=\"http://www.revengepornhelpline.org.uk/\">Revenge Porn Helpline</a>, criticised the use of a caution for the offences in the Eastbourne case.</p> <p>\u201cFor every one of these individual offences, if they are first-time offences a caution might be suitable, but they have not looked at the bigger picture here. This is a catalogue of offences and a pattern of behaviour involving five victims, which includes possible stalking, grooming and inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, and it happened over a long period of time. This is not a deterrent and it also means he cannot be channelled through any community programmes to address his behaviour,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Sussex police said they were contacted on 8 April by a woman who alleged two sexual photographs of her had been posted on a public website without her permission. Three other victims came forward. The offences took place between 14 September 2015 and 16 February 2016. </p> <p>A spokesman for Sussex police said: \u201cOn 27 April, the suspect was arrested and interviewed regarding the allegations, to which he made full admissions and expressed remorse. A number of devices were seized from his home address and the images were deleted.\u201d</p> <p>Police said the man had been warned that if his behaviour continued he would be charged with further offences. </p> <p>Insp Rachel Barrow of Sussex police defended the decision to caution the suspect: \u201cWe made the decision to caution the suspect, based on appropriateness in relation to the offender, the offence and the likelihood of being effective in preventing reoffending. In this case, the suspect spent some time in police custody.</p> <p>\u201cThis decision fits the national framework for out-of-court disposals, and simple cautions are available for adults for any offence, including some serious offences. We have contacted the website to request the images be removed.\u201d </p> <p>Another victim told her local paper images of herself were uploaded on to the porn forum alongside a series of violent and sexually explicit messages from users of the site. In one of the images her two-year-old child was clearly visible.</p> <p>The images were uploaded with the comment: \u201cDo your absolute worst guys and abuse her as much as you like, all I ask is that you show me it all.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>On a business estate in Devon, Jade sits at a computer screen and hovers her mouse over an innocent selfie of a young woman from Scotland. In a matter of seconds, she is led down the internet\u2019s tunnels and diversions deep into what was once the private world of the 21-year-old.<br /></p> <p>As she follows the digital trail, scores of explicit, intimate pictures of the young woman appear, originally taken for a boyfriend but now traded as porn across the web.</p> <p>Below the images the comment \u201cMy sexy ex\u201d is followed by multiple lurid responses to the pictures.</p> <p>The phone rings beside her. Jade picks up. \u201cHello, Revenge Porn Helpline.\u201d</p> <p>For 14 months, staff on the <a href=\"http://www.revengepornhelpline.org.uk/\">Revenge Porn Helpline</a>,  based in an office outside Exeter, have been listening to victims describe their experiences of a swiftly escalating pattern of online behaviour \u2013 the shaming of individuals by posting explicit and intimate pictures of them, often on multiple platforms.</p> <p>Since 1 April last year, after pressure from campaigners such as Laura Higgins, who created the helpline, it is a criminal offence to disclose private sexual photographs and films without the consent of the individual who appears in them and with intent to cause distress. Known as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jul/15/revenge-porn-cases-increase-police-figures-reveal\">revenge porn</a>, its victims are both female and male, young and middle-aged, from all ethnic backgrounds. </p> <p>Higgins was one of the first to notice the emerging crime, after setting up a professional helpline for teachers and social workers in south-west England five years ago.</p> <p>\u201cWe had a school contact us about one of their teachers, pictures of her had gone viral and the kids were sharing them,\u201d said Higgins. \u201cThe school had suspended her, which we felt was a bit harsh. We asked them to get her to call us \u2026 she was distraught, absolutely in shock. She said she hadn\u2019t been able to bring herself to look. She asked us: \u2018Is it bad? How much is out there?\u2019</p> <p>\u201cThere came a point when we realised that this was a real issue. There were so many victims but they did not know they were victims. They thought they were the only one.\u201d</p> <p>That could not have been further from the truth. Each victim was suffering a form of online abuse which has become a global phenomenon. When Higgins recently spoke about revenge porn at a UN conference, she was overwhelmed by how many countries were facing similar problems. \u201cIn Barbados they have a real problem, in China it is a problem \u2013 this is not just happening in the UK or in Europe, it is a global issue. What is empowering is that we are all now sharing our experiences of how best to tackle this together.\u201d</p> <p>In the UK, more than 3,700 victims have contacted the helpline in the past year, 400 alone between February and April 2016. </p> <p>At least 12 sites actively promote themselves by encouraging men to post images of ex-wives and former girlfriends as porn to be viewed by others. One advertises itself as a forum to post images of \u201ccheating slut wives\u201d.</p> <p>Increasingly, however, revenge porn is being facilitated by a growing number of anonymous image boards with a heavy local focus \u2013 a type of site which began in Japan and was brought to the west by 4Chan. </p> <p>While 4Chan itself does not host revenge porn, several spin-off sites do. Users of one such image board in Northamptonshire share explicit pictures of girls and women they know.</p> <p>\u201cIs there anywhere I can see some of [Girl X]? Been searching for this forever,\u201d a user asked recently. When he was told that the pictures had been removed because the girl was underage, he replied: \u201cShit. There\u2019s nowhere they\u2019re still up?\u201d</p> <p>Users share explicit pictures or details of nearly 40 women from the county. In some cases, semi-naked pictures had been stolen from the victims\u2019 Facebook profiles and posted to the revenge porn forum along with a request for more graphic photographs. \u201cShe used to sit next to me in class and talk all the time about her sex life. 100% there is win,\u201d read one comment, attached to three images of a teenage girl. In the forum\u2019s language, a \u201cwin\u201d is a fully-naked photograph.</p> <p>In another post, an anonymous user uploaded five explicit pictures of a girl claiming to be from her profile on the dating website OkCupid. The caption read: \u201cThese are from her okcupid and from reading that, win 100% exists. Seems like it shouldn\u2019t be too hard to get some either.\u201d</p> <p>Users post pictures of a woman or girl along with her first name and the first initial of her surname, plus sometimes the town she is from and other identifying details. Then that user either requests more images of the same person, or proposes a new target. As explained by one user: \u201cNo requests unless you provide a photo yourself. If you request a person, provide a photo of that person.\u201d It takes only a matter of minutes to link several of the girls to their Facebook profiles.</p> <p>Other identical forums exist around the UK: in Leeds, Sheffield, Bournemouth, Worthing, West Lothian, Swansea, Doncaster, Halifax and Sunderland. Worryingly for the authorities, it is almost impossible to discover who is behind the posts. Their identities are hidden and the forum is registered to an anonymous-looking building in an industrial estate in Toronto, Canada.</p> <p>Amanda Naylor, the senior manager for children and young people at the charity Victim Support, said the women named and pictured on the Northamptonshire message board were particularly at risk.</p> <p>\u201cOne of the things that really worried me about this site is that there were clearly some under-18s on there,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the comments said \u2018And this is her little friend\u2019 and that is a really clear paedophile type of comment we see on other sites. It\u2019s not just adult women this is affecting, it\u2019s vulnerable young women and some who could be under 18, which would be child sexual exploitation.\u201d</p> <p>Naylor said the risk to the women was heightened because the explicit pictures were posted by people known to the victims.</p> <p>Often by the time victims approach the Revenge Porn Helpline they are desperate.</p> <p>\u201cSometimes they have just found out or they have been suffering for months not knowing what to do,\u201d said Jade. \u201cThey might have been let down by the police and been trying to grasp for help for a long, long time. When they talk it comes out in a barrage of information.</p> <p>\u201cI had a lady in her 40s call who asked: \u2018Could you help? I\u2019m in trouble.\u2019 A man she had been having an affair with had posted pictures of her online and shared them on social media with her children, husband and family. The man was threatening to post more images of her. She told me she was sitting in bed with a bottle of vodka wanting to end it all.\u201d</p> <p>Staff encourage victims to report to the police and preserve evidence of what has happened. They also offer pro bono legal advice, but experiences of police responses are very mixed. </p> <p>The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/mar/04/online-abuse-existing-laws-too-fragmented-and-dont-serve-victims-says-police-chief\">law itself is flawed</a>, campaigners believe, because it requires proof of intent to cause distress and does not cover Photoshopped images. The new legislation does not make the images themselves illegal and take-down requests to sites are made on the basis of a breach of copyright.</p> <p>Staff on the hotline help victims make take-down requests but it is slow, painstaking work and relies on the cooperation of whoever is running the site.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s about telling the sites that the individual did not consent to share these images and they need to be taken down,\u201d said Jade.</p> <p>\u201cWe have built up relationships with some sites, and they are fantastic, they respond in 24 hours, others push back and don\u2019t respond. When it comes to image boards, we struggle.\u201d</p> <p>Almost 80% of callers to the hotline are women, and victims will call between one and 10 times for help. The helpline often receives calls from parents of young adults seeking help and describing their sense of powerlessness. </p> <p>One father summed up the fears of many: \u201cMy daughter has been a victim of naked pictures being posted online and although we reported it to the police their attitude has been complacent and unsupportive and indeed caused her more distress. The \u2018nothing we can do, you shouldn\u2019t have taken the pictures in the first place\u2019 comments \u2026 have had a devastating effect on her,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cThe pictures look like they were stolen. My problem is this: how do I help console her, what advice can I give her? My original advice to go the police has massively backfired and made the problem ten times worse.\u201d</p>",

      "headline": "Greece looks to international justice to regain Parthenon marbles from UK",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-09T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Greece has not abandoned the idea of resorting to international justice to repatriate the Parthenon marbles and is investigating new ways in which it might bring a claim against the British Museum.</p> <p>As campaigners prepare to mark the 200th anniversary of the antiquities\u2019 \u201ccaptivity\u201d in London, Athens is working at forging alliances that would further empower its longstanding battle to retrieve the sculptures.</p> <p>\u201cWe are trying to develop alliances which we hope would eventually lead to an international body like the United Nations to come with us against the British Museum,\u201d the country\u2019s culture minister, Aristides Baltas, revealed in an interview. </p> <p>\u201cIf the UN represents all nations of the world and all nations of the world say \u2018the marbles should be returned\u2019 then we\u2019ll go to court because the British Museum would be against humanity,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not regard the Parthenon as exclusively Greek but rather as a heritage of humanity.\u201d </p> <p>But the politician admitted there was always the risk of courts issuing a negative verdict that would wreck Athens\u2019 chances of having the artworks reunited with the magnificent monument they once adorned. </p> <p>\u201cCourts do not by definition regard [any] issue at the level of history or morality or humanity-at-large. They look at the laws,\u201d said Baltas, an academic and philosopher who played a pivotal role in founding Syriza, Greece\u2019s governing leftist party. \u201cAs there are no hard and fast rules regarding the issue of returning treasures taken away from various countries, there is no indisputable legal basis.\u201d</p> <p>The move came to light as the world\u2019s longest-running cultural row looks poised to intensify. Almost 200 years have elapsed since the British parliament voted on 7 June 1816 to purchase the collection from Lord Elgin, the Scotsman who as ambassador to the Ottoman Empire ordered the frieze to be torn from the Parthenon and shipped to England. Activists are counting down to what they call the \u201cblack anniversary\u201d.</p> <p>In London, only metres away from the British Museum, a huge billboard funded by campaigners in Australia this weekend showed six strategically placed words across a statue of classic nudity \u2013 and above a list of the vital contributions Greece has made to modern democratic life. The words read: \u201cPlease give us back our marbles.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cThere is no point any longer in taking the gentle approach because that has failed,\u201d said Alexis Mantheakis, chairman of the New Zealand-based International Parthenon Sculptures Action Committee. \u201cThe British have never given anything back, be it colonies or artefacts, without pressure. To ignore that fact is to undermine the chances of any success in the campaign for the return of the Parthenon sculptures.\u201d </p> <p>Seen as the high point of classical art \u2013 a peerless example of beauty in carving \u2013 the antiquities were acquired for \u00a335,000 on condition they be exhibited in the British Museum. Mortified, steeped in debt and determined to dispel rumours that he had exploited his post as emissary to plunder the Acropolis, Elgin reluctantly accepted. It had, all expenses considered, cost him nearly twice that he claimed. </p> <p>But in a 141-page document of legal advice \u2013 the details of which have been leaked exclusively to the Guardian \u2013 QCs specialised in cultural restitution say Elgin clearly exceeded the authority, or firman, he was given when he ordered the treasures to be \u201cstripped\u201d from the monument. The lawyers, including the human rights expert Amal Clooney, insist that Greece could mount a strong case to win the marbles back.</p> <p>\u201cWe consider that international law has evolved to a position which recognises, as part of the sovereignty of a state, its right to reclaim cultural property of great historical significance which has been wrongly taken in the past \u2013 a rule that would entitle Greece to recover and reunite the Parthenon sculptures.\u201d</p> <p>The advice \u2013 provided at the request of the country\u2019s former centre-right coalition but previously only made public in summation \u2013 amounts to a toolbox of how Athens could pursue its claim to the classical masterpieces. Greece could either bring the UK before the European court of human rights, or the UN cultural body Unesco could apply for an advisory judgment by the international court of justice. Court action could prompt Britain, which has repulsed every entreaty to date, to agree to arbitration or mediation.</p> <p>\u201cThe legal case is strongly arguable, both under international customary law and provisions of the European convention. [Greece] would stand a reasonable prospect of success.\u201d</p> <p>But the lawyers also counsel that Athens should move fast in pursuing litigation. Mired in its longest recession in modern times, many fear the cash-strapped country would not have the means to take such action. </p> <p>The advice, which took almost a year to draft, was reputedly financed by a Greek shipowner sympathetic to the cause.</p> <p>\u201cUnless the claim is brought fairly soon, Greece may be met with the argument that it has \u2018slept on its rights\u2019 too long for them to be enforced,\u201d the lawyers argue, adding that even if initial litigation failed it would not be the end of the fight.</p> <p>\u201cIf Greece does fail, it will very likely be on technical \u2018admissibility\u2019 grounds, which will have nothing to do with the merits of its claim. A case lost on a legal technicality can often be fought again.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-alt=\"The case for the return of the Parthenon sculptures\">  <iframe class=\"fenced\" srcdoc=\"&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;p  style=&quot; margin: 12px auto 6px auto; font-family: Helvetica,Arial,Sans-serif; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 14px; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal; -x-system-font: none; display: block;&quot;&gt;   &lt;a title=&quot;View The Case for the Return of the Parthenon Sculptures on Scribd&quot; href=&quot;https://www.scribd.com/doc/311901732/The-Case-for-the-Return-of-the-Parthenon-Sculptures?secret_password=GZI2oI9UXuoWtuWfrkqd&quot;  style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot; &gt;The Case for the Return of the Parthenon Sculptures&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a title=&quot;View The Guardian's profile on Scribd&quot; href=&quot;https://www.scribd.com/publisher/17081734/The-Guardian&quot;  style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot; &gt;The Guardian&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;iframe class=&quot;scribd_iframe_embed&quot; src=&quot;https://www.scribd.com/embeds/311901732/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;access_key=key-sl69UQ3ba6m0PUASrxoP&amp;show_recommendations=true&quot; data-auto-height=&quot;false&quot; data-aspect-ratio=&quot;0.7068965517241379&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; id=&quot;doc_3620&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;600&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\"></iframe> </figure>",

      "headline": "Channel 4 News: Why we can\u2019t let a sale kill off Jon Snow",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-09T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Channel 4 has always known that its flagship news bulletin has been the one programme guaranteed to have an appreciative audience at the regulator \u2013 first the Independent Television Commission and now Ofcom \u2013 and at Westminster. Even the most sceptical regulator or politician could see (or be persuaded) that C4 News was uniquely vulnerable to any significant change in C4\u2019s ownership or structure. The programme\u2019s audience and revenue has never justified its budget or its slot.</p> <p>C4\u2019s director of programmes, Tim Gardam, wrote in an internal strategy document in 2000 that running nearly an hour of news at 7pm meant the slot lost the channel money; the programme\u2019s revenues covered only half its costs; the news got far fewer viewers than more popular programming would have. However, he continued, changing or cutting it would be a reputational disaster, and not least because Jon Snow was the face of the channel. The sense that, as one senior executive once said to me, with one false move the nice man in the stripy tie would be no more, was a recurring theme in struggles over privatisation.</p> <p>The 1988 White Paper, Broadcasting in the 90s, proposed a number of possible new structures for Channel 4. The first option on the list was privatisation. In the battle with the Thatcher government that followed, Michael Grade, the new Channel 4 chief executive, saw off privatisation with the clear warning: \u2018The choice facing the government was simple. They could have a privatised channel or one with a public service remit, but not both.</p> <p>When privatisation was on the agenda near the end of the John Major government in 1996, Michael Grade had made a similar argument to Treasury financial secretary Michael Jack, saying the easiest way for a privatised C4 to boost profits by \u00a312m was to replace C4 News with American films.</p> <p>Twenty years later another majority Tory government is again considering privatisation and again the role of C4 News is at the centre of the debate.</p> <p>So will the case for the defence work this time as it did so successfully then? C4 News is still a very good programme, but operating in a more crowded market. Many of the techniques it pioneered \u2013 expert analysis, live interviews with correspondents and high production values in graphics and video editing \u2013 have been successfully copied by its competitors. There is also a plethora of British and international news channels providing 24-hour coverage and a wide range of perspectives. Above all, perhaps, the new digital players like BuzzFeed and Vice News and the new platforms \u2013 such as Facebook and Twitter \u2013 are redefining what video news can be and how it is consumed, particularly by younger audiences. In this apparent glut of news, does a single weekday bulletin still really matter? It does, both in terms of what the programme brings to British journalism and its role in the complex and quite fragile network of programmes and relationships which currently make British broadcast news respected worldwide.</p> <p>The programme remains unique \u2013 50 minutes of high-quality news reporting and analysis, with a welcome emphasis on investigations. As recent disasters at Newsnight have shown, doing investigative journalism in the context of a daily programme is very difficult and risky.</p> <p>C4 News has always had the budget and encouragement to do it successfully \u2013 from Bob Parker\u2019s series on Colin Wallace and MI5 in the 1980s to its recent award for an investigation into people smuggling in Macedonia. It is not at all clear whether, if C4 News disappeared in its present form, others would fill the gap \u2013 BBC News was recently criticised for not having an investigations unit despite employing 4,000 journalists.</p> <p>Having 50 minutes of space to fill encourages the programme to widen the news agenda to under-reported but important stories \u2013 from war crimes in Sri Lanka to human rights abuses and oil in Equatorial Guinea.</p> <p>In broadcast news the proliferation of platforms does not necessarily mean a wider agenda \u2013 indeed news increasingly seems to concentrate on fewer stories. News editors keep a very close eye on what their competitors do \u2013 and the existence of a programme which often goes beyond the obvious agenda and comes back with great journalism helps encourage all newsrooms to do the same.</p> <p>If the privatisation goes ahead, the focus will be on whether regulation can preserve all or part of the remit. Grade has argued that any new owner would want to \u201cpreserve the brand and work out what the brand was about \u2026 C4 News is a big piece of what makes C4 different. These things are controlled by licences, you are licensed to broadcast and we have a very strict regulator.\u201d David Elstein takes a similar view, believing that Ofcom could ensure that the current commitment to news and current affairs could be maintained if it adopted a tough and rigorous approach to quality control and measuring the Channel\u2019s output against clear criteria. They are right in theory: good regulation should protect quality journalism.</p> <p>But in practice the track record of the commercial television regulators has been a patchy one. While C4\u2019s remit remains virtually unchanged, there has been a fairly drastic reduction in ITV\u2019s public service obligations in areas such as education, arts and children\u2019s. The regulators may have tried harder to protect ITV\u2019s news heritage but they have not been particularly successful.</p> <p>The C4 licence only commits it to 208 annual peak hours of news: no indicative budget; no statement of resources, bureaux, crews, specialist correspondents; no definition of quality of approach and editorial beyond the channel\u2019s general remit. It would be very easy for a new owner to turn the current programme into a low-cost interview show with just headline news and claim it was still producing analysis.</p> <p>This is not to say that much tighter regulation could not protect the programme, at least in the medium term. It would need a very different approach from Ofcom\u2019s current light touch. But Ofcom is likely to take over the regulation of the BBC in 2017 and that will need an equally radical change of approach on its part.</p> <p>Ofcom could add a much tighter regulation of Channel 4 to its enhanced BBC responsibilities and become much more involved in the quality of the output of both broadcasters. Protecting C4 News would need a very much clearer definition of what the programme was and how it would be delivered in terms of scheduling, resources, budgets and staff, but it could be done and would probably be easier to monitor than many other genres. The key would be to get acceptance from any new owner that it was committed both to the cost of producing the service and to accepting the opportunity costs of a loss-making slot of an hour in peak time. And the regulator would have to hope the new owners do not start complaining about the lack of similar rigour in the regulation of, say, ITV and Channel 5.</p> <p>However well Ofcom policed the arrangements, history suggests privatisation would put the incoming owners, not regulators, in the driving seat. If they like the nice man in the stripy tie and see C4 News as a key part of the brand of their new acquisition, all could be well. If not, it would be the first and most important test of Ofcom\u2019s determination to hold the line and protect the channel\u2019s single most important programme.</p> <p><em>Richard Tait is a former BBC trustee and editor-in-chief of ITN</em></p> <p><em>This is an edited extract from What Price Channel 4? a collection of essays published by Abramis and edited by John Mair, Fiona Chesterton, David Lloyd, Ian Reeves and Richard Tait</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>In the middle of the afternoon session anyone glancing on to the Nursery from the back of the Lord\u2019s media centre would have seen Alex Hales pounding out his fitness training. It was diligent, of course it was, but there was an urge to shout out that there was more fun to be had in the middle.</p> <p>Hales, with excellent timing, had batted well enough in all probability to clinch his place in the first Test. But in pristine batting weather and on one of Mick Hunt\u2019s bespoke batting tracks he left an awful lot of runs out there.</p> <p>He had taken a huge gamble in seeking a break until Nottinghamshire\u2019s match against Yorkshire last week, and his innings here against Middlesex would always be the last chance to make any sort of positive impression to dispel doubts he was the man to open for England with Alastair Cook. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/03/alex-hales-nottinghamshire-yorkshire-county-championship-division-one-match-report\" title=\"\">At Trent Bridge he appeared to be unsure</a> of the course he should take, comparing in the one hand the apple of blazing attack in the first innings against the pear of digging-in defence in the other. It appears he has come to the conclusion that pears wins it.</p> <p>Here he made 73 \u2013 three more than the sum total of his two previous innings, from 124 balls \u2013 with 10 fours and a six swung languidly, using his long levers, over long on. It was a well-crafted innings, in a traditional sense.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/30/alex-hales-england-test-selection-sri-lanka-trent-bridge\">Alex Hales leads the cast of England hopefuls out to impress at Trent Bridge</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Chris Read had asked for and won the toss for Nottinghamshire, and batting first (odd if they had not) they found some testing new-ball bowling from Tim Murtagh and, as first change, Toby Roland-Jones in addition to some lacklustre stuff from Steve Finn that produced a run a ball. Hales looked more comfortable at the crease \u2013 less angular in his movement and more balanced \u2013 than he had at Trent Bridge and he began to drive strongly and clip nicely off his legs.</p> <p>His 50, from 96 balls, did not arrive until after lunch but thereafter, wisely or not, he began to play some shots. So Ollie Rayner\u2019s off-spin was sent sizzling flat from inside out, over extra cover, always a risky shot in red-ball cricket. He was then swept vigorously before he was launched high over long on. Perhaps the adrenaline started to pump too hard, for now he drove airily at Roland-Jones and was bowled. So the good impression went only so far: pretty 70s from the top order tend not to win Test matches.</p> <p>It was good reward, though, for Roland-Jones, the pick of the Middlesex seamers, who impresses with each viewing. He runs a vast distance \u2013 exhausting to watch \u2013 but has good pace and sends down a consistent line from a high action.</p> <p>The wickets he took either side of lunch \u2013 Greg Smith in the morning and Hales and Riki Wessels in the space of six balls in the afternoon \u2013 were well earned and helped put Middlesex in a better position than they might otherwise have achieved given the conditions.</p> <p>By the close Nottinghamshire had made 345 for seven, with runs from Michael Lumb, who made 78 and shared a third-wicket stand of 107 with Hales before being lbw to Rayner, and an excellent unbeaten 86 from Samit Patel. His sixth-wicket stand with Read brought 71.</p> <p>After a generally indifferent day Finn came back strongly in the final session to claim the new-ball wickets of Read and Stuart Broad, both with the aid of excellent close catches from Nick Compton.</p>",

Her initiative suggests Lady Scotland plans to make the Commonwealth a more high-profile and interventionist body than it has been in its recent relatively quiet past.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/05/nigeria-calls-on-anti-corruption-summit-to-back-registers-of-ownership\">Nigeria calls on anti-corruption summit to back registers of ownership</a> </p> </aside>  <p>She is to develop her ideas at a conference to be addressed by Nigerian president <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/mar/31/muhammadu-buhari-military-dictator-nigeria-new-democratic-president\">Muhammadu Buhari</a>, who is in London for David Cameron\u2019s anti-corruption conference on Thursday. Buhari\u2019s office said he would be \u201curging the international community to move faster on the dismantling of safe havens for the proceeds of corruption and the return of stolen funds and assets to their countries of origin\u201d. The president of the Nigerian senate, Bukola Saraki, is due to face trial on corruption charges.</p> <p>Scotland, appointed secretary general last month, is a former Labour attorney general, responsible for introducing the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/law/bribery-act\">UK Bribery Act</a> in 2010. She is making an attack on corruption one of the chief themes of her office.</p> <p>Scotland told the Guardian the proposed Commonwealth standard would identify those bodies, institutions and entities that are adhering to best practice, including transparency, in a bid to avoid corruption. Any agency that did not meet the Commonwealth mark was unlikely to get access to public contracts, aid or loans.</p> <p>She said: \u201cThe idea is to make it positively advantageous to be a compliant, transparent non-corrupt entity in the Commonwealth. At present too many times the advantage lies in not being compliant. The idea is to raise the bar right across the Commonwealth and mark those that are at least trying to be compliant. When people realise \u2018no mark [means] no work\u2019, it will slowly raise the standard. It would mean that when monies are given out for instance by the UN, the Council of Europe or the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/department-for-international-development-dfid\">Department for International Development</a>, they would look to see if the entity has been given the Commonwealth standard indicating you have good systems in place, including meeting the standards of the Bribery Act.</p> <p>\u201cThose that were deemed compliant would go to the top of the queue for money\u201d, she said, adding \u201cthat way you build a positive advantage to being compliant. If we can create this Commonwealth standard, and persuade it is the benchmark for suppliers that get international money then we can create a cadre of good practice\u201d. She said that credit rating agencies might also look to see if the Commonwealth regarded a country as compliant in deciding what credit rating to give a country.</p> <p>Corruption she said was \u201cpoisonous, corrosive, vicious and an enemy of sustainable development\u201d. She promised to be like a magpie stealing good ideas from around the globe to help commonwealth countries fight corruption by a creating a \u201cConspiracy of the Just\u201d.</p> <p>Scotland said: \u201cCorruption destroys people\u2019s confidence in politics. If a system is corrupt and you feel your rights cannot be protected because you are not rich, don\u2019t have the right name and cannot get ahead through your talents, the system defeats you. Take Tunisia: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/jan/20/tunisian-fruit-seller-mohammed-bouazizi\">Mohammed Bouazizi</a> could not get a fruit licence, and he thought \u201cI cannot go to the courts, I cannot go to the police and I cannot feed my family\u201d, and he set himself alight. The Arab spring was all about corruption and failure of the rule of law. The system implodes and eventually leads to civil disobedience because you cannot deprive people of their rights for so long.\u201d </p> <p>She said she believed the Bribery Act, including the requirement for companies to prevent bribery on its behalf, could become a model for Commonwealth countries to adopt. She said the act was trying to attack a culture so that compliant companies would have to show they had done all they could to end corruption. Scotland said: \u201cIt is the best standard internationally. It has extra territorial grip, it has got teeth, and it requires entities to ask themselves questions to ensure they have built a resilient system to fight corruption.\u201d</p> <p>She defended her decision to prioritise the issue, saying: \u201cThe Commonwealth covers a third of the population. We have got a common language, an adherence to the common law and a parliamentary system, so if we can deliver and develop something for 53 countries that delivers real change, we have then got a template to say to countries outside the Commonwealth: here is a model that delivers.\u201d</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-09T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>There is something unseemly about those of us who were at Channel 4 on November 2 1982 going on about the good old days.</p> <p>The world has changed completely since then and the C4 licence has undergone many revisions. But the brilliantly simple, infinitely flexible brief from parliament \u2013 the remit \u2013 has remained essentially the same: be distinctive, innovate, cater for unrepresented tastes and interests, maintain a broad range and include programmes of an educational nature.</p> <p>In this era of relentless focus on the economic value of the creative industries the approach taken by the Conservative government of the 1980s seems visionary. This first new television channel since BBC2 in 1964 was seen as above all a cultural, not a business, one.</p> <p>C4 was not to compete with its peers for resources but for esteem and distinctiveness. It was to follow a remit to be different and given the funding freedom to take the risks that would deliver it.</p> <p>That remit is seen as the channel\u2019s great bulwark but there is a real danger that it could become its greatest weakness in the forthcoming argument over privatisation.</p> <p>That argument is now too simply focused on the issue of the remit as the sacred bellwether of C4\u2019s future security. It is widely believed that the value of any transaction will be directly related to how much of the remit is written into the conditions of sale. The more the remit, the less revenue for the chancellor: the more contribution to the exchequer, the less remit to be distinctive goes the argument. The channel\u2019s defenders are watching every word.</p> <p>But there is a danger in sanctifying the remit in this way. It is only a handful of words. And their meaning is capable of quite elastic interpretation. Back in 1982 some of the ITV companies had fully expected that the injunction to cater for minority interests would mean badminton and macram\u00e9 rather than football and variety shows and were not happy at finding indie movies and Irish politics on their screens.</p> <p>The power of the remit was and is only to enable courage and ambition on the part of those running the channel. It is a necessary \u2013 but by absolutely no means sufficient \u2013 condition of adventurous programming. It is meaningless without two other things: a board and executive with creative courage and a funding context which gives it half a chance of realising its potential.</p> <p>In the 34 years of the channel\u2019s life successive bosses have squeezed and moulded the remit to their own creative ambitions and economic circumstances.</p> <p>Each one in his way (women CEOs still a risk too far) has felt the hand of history on his shoulder and pursued creative innovation and diversity as far as was consistent with generating the resources he needed to make programmes.</p> <p>Privatisation \u2013 even with the remit word for word intact \u2013 would change that single-minded focus completely. It would put an end to the continuing financial protection that C4 enjoys today as a statutory corporation where all profits are returned to the business.</p> <p>Shareholders would rightly demand a return on their investment. Profits would be distributed, not ploughed back, and the pressure to increase them by steering the remit towards the most popular forms of distinctiveness and the cheapest forms of innovation would become irresistible. The remit could appear in letters of gold at the top of the Memorandum and Articles and it would make no difference to a chief executive bound to a different master.</p> <p>Of course there is a perfectly good argument for privatising C4. It is a brand with unrealised value which the market could release. It occupies valuable spectrum which could also yield more. It is a public asset which \u2013 some believe \u2013 could yield more public benefit if run on commercial lines. Furthermore the national debt is a good cause.</p> <p>What it is not possible to believe is that a privatised channel would deliver as wide a range of programming or take as many risks with new talent and new ideas. It is widely assumed by the opponents of privatisation that it would lead to a plunge in programme quality. Possibly but by no means necessarily. The media market can always produce quality. A privatised C4 could certainly pitch upmarket with a high-quality schedule catering \u2013 in faithful service of the remit \u2013 to tastes and interests not catered for elsewhere. What the free market in television always finds more difficult is range in programming \u2013 the very essence of C4 to date.</p> <p>The question is whether this generation of Conservative leaders retain their predecessors\u2019 sense that television is a piece of the fabric of popular culture \u2013 where its ability to prioritise diversity and innovation makes a unique contribution \u2013 or an asset like any other to be grown to full value and then sold for cash.</p> <p>It may seem to some slightly absurd to worry so much about one old terrestrial channel when there are thousands more available at the end of a fibre optic cable or from a satellite dish. And yet the remarkable feature of the current marketplace is that, with all the choice available, viewing of the main broadcast channels remains extraordinarily stable.</p> <p>Digital terrestrial TV remains the most popular way of watching television and the main five public service broadcasting PSB channels accounted for just over half of all viewing in 2014 even with 536 other UK channels to choose from. That share is dropping slowly, as is the number of minutes per day people spend watching live TV, but the British public\u2019s loyalty to its traditional television outlets is remarkable.</p> <p>Television channels are not pork barrel futures or redundant government buildings. They are creators, patrons and purveyors of a highly popular (in both senses) variety of entertainment, information and culture to millions.</p> <p>In the days of spectrum scarcity the British broadcasting landscape was moulded with skill and deliberation to maximise sustainable choice for the viewer with each broadcaster playing a distinctive role.</p> <p>That landscape has adapted to the arrival of the burgeoning digital marketplace and thrives alongside it to the benefit of both. Moving a major chunk of it to be something different and play a different part is a big step.</p> <p>There will always be arguments about the channel\u2019s success in delivering its remit. It no longer shows Sanskrit operas or Berlin Alexanderplatz in peak or any other time. But it remains a distinctive voice, an essential market for a wide range of quality UK production and a channel which dares to do things others can\u2019t or won\u2019t.</p> <p>The abortive attempt to privatise the forests should perhaps have taught the government a more nuanced approach to valuing national assets.</p> <p>The BBC could reasonably claim that moving BBC3 to the web is simply moving the channel to its audience\u2019s natural home and thus serving it better. I have yet to hear anyone argue seriously that privatising C4 would benefit its audience.</p> <p><em>Liz Forgan was a founding commissioning editor and then director of programmes at Channel 4 and now chairs the Scott Trust.</em></p> <p><em>This is an edited extract from What Price Channel 4? a collection of essays published by Abramis and edited by John Mair, Fiona Chesterton, David Lloyd, Ian Reeves and Richard Tait</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>\u201cBreak a leg everyone,\u201d mumbled Robert Peston sotto voce, as the opening credits rolled on his new Sunday morning show on ITV to reveal a set that looked like a Teletubbies kitchen dumped inside a Hoxton warehouse.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/08/peston-on-sunday-review-bleeding-edged-blade-old-school-ties\">Peston on Sunday review: a bleeding-edged blade cuts old-school ties</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite his much hyped Nicky Clarke haircut \u2013 he had been talking about little else on Twitter in the run-up to his debut \u2013 Peston was determined to keep his show as professionally amateur as possible. His was to be a programme where the rough edges were very much kept on view. Worried that not all his audience would have heard his opening supposedly off the cuff remark, Peston looked straight to camera and said: \u201cIn case you\u2019re wondering, I am bleeding nervous.\u201d</p> <p>No one was wondering. Peston has a voice that incites anxiety in his audience, if not himself, at the best of times \u2013 is he actually ever going to get to the end of a sentence? \u2013 and on Sunday morning there was an added breathless quality to his unique vocal mix of strangulation and elongation. It looked like only a matter of time before he started hyper-ventilating on set.</p> <p>\u201cHere\u2019s what we\u2019ve got for you this week,\u201d he continued. \u201cAn interview with George Osborne, an interview with Louis Theroux \u2013 \u2018My son says he looks just like me,\u201d he added narcissistically \u2013 book club with Suzanne O\u2019Sullivan, Alastair Campbell and Esther McVey, our two political therapists \u2013 pushing it a bit as neither is noted for their empathy \u2013 and our political editor Allegra Stratton examining the issues of the day on social media.\u201d Peston just about managed to get all that out in a single agonising breath.</p> <p>The exhaustion and CBeebies atmosphere was contagious. After a brief round up of the news featuring a photo of Nicky Morgan looking like a dead ringer for a Piero della Francesca Madonna, Stratton started drawing random circles on a screen that Peston insisted on calling Screeny while McVey managed to call Zac Goldsmith\u2019s sister Gemma.</p> <p>It all felt a bit amateur hour which suited George Osborne just fine and he began his interview as if he was on a mutant hybrid of the Michael Parkinson show and Blue Peter. \u201cI think it\u2019s all going jolly well so far,\u201d he said kindly, while all around him could only see a car crash, before being allowed free rein to give dire warnings about how leaving the EU was going to be absolutely CATASTROPHIC and result in falling house prices.</p> <p>Then came the first ad break and suddenly the whole show began to \u2013 if not make sense \u2013 at least click into gear. It was Stratton and Screeny that initially came to the rescue with a tweet from the economist Jonathan Portes saying the chancellor was talking nonsense about house prices. Osborne was visibly taken aback by this and began to bluster; Peston went for the jugular.</p> <p>\u201cIsn\u2019t it true you\u2019ve made a bit of a mess with boom and bust economics, your government is now left to do one U-turn after another, the prime minister is more interested in not splitting the Tory party than winning the referendum and you just want his job?\u201d he said, contorting his vowels randomly while forcing the chancellor into bizarre contortions of his own.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve never believed in playing safe,\u201d said Osborne. Hardly the most comforting words a country will ever hear from the man in charge of its finances. George might just have blown his chances of taking over from David Cameron there and then. Sensing his words might come back to bite him, Osborne tried to rescue the situation but could only dig himself in deeper by resorting to platitudes. By the end he couldn\u2019t wait to get out of the Peston\u2019s playpen. Peston &amp; Screeny 1, Osborne O.</p> <p>Everything thereafter was bound to be a disappointment. The Louis Theroux interview went nowhere and the book club felt like it was filling time. \u201cWe will only be doing the book club every week or so,\u201d said Peston, sensing his show had peaked rather too early. The last laugh, though, went to Screeny, who will surely be pushing for the best dressing room next week, as various tweets pointed out Osborne had nicked a gag off Barack Obama.</p> <p>\u201cWe leave you with the result of our online poll. Fifty-five per cent of you seem to think that the government doing a U-turn is a sign of strength,\u201d Peston drawled incredulously as he stared at the results on Screeny. Some people in Tory central office must have been working overtime.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-09T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Amir Khan has nowhere left to travel in boxing but down a lonely avenue of pain that might end in a place called retribution, even if he would be handsomely recompensed to absorb further shocks to his body at the end of a long and tough career.</p> <p>The Bolton boxer has one or maybe a handful of fights left <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/08/amir-khan-saul-canelo-alvarez-middleweight-title-fight-boxing\" title=\"\">after the knockout that Sa\u00fal \u201cCanelo\u201d \u00c1lvarez delivered</a> to him in the sixth round here on Saturday night, more emphatically than he had dispatched any of his previous 48 opponents. And there was one candidate immediately happy to accommodate Khan when he recovers: Sheffield\u2019s Kell Brook.</p> <p>Khan, 29, a former world champion at two weights, said before this fight he would not retire until he wins another title, and the unbeaten Brook brings his IBF belt for what would be a major boxing event in a British football stadium \u2013 perhaps Wembley but just as likely Manchester, nearer to their northern homes. However, they have a deep and long-running animus to settle first. It is a very tough fight to make when it should not be. Fighters who do not like each other are usually desperate to share a ring.</p> <p>Khan in his hotel suite on Sunday was upbeat and defiant, wearing a slight nick under his right eye but probably bearing deeper scars.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019m safe and in good health,\u201d he said. \u201cI was hurt \u2013 that shot would hurt a lot of people. But I can come back for more big fights. I\u2019m still the mandatory challenger for Danny Garc\u00eda\u2019s WBC welterweight title and will move back down. I\u2019d like to fight in the UK next, maybe in December.\u201d</p> <p>He revealed also that \u00c1lvarez outweighed him by 23lbs by the time they got in the ring, having each scaled 155lbs at Friday afternoon\u2019s weigh-in.</p> <p>\u201cI walked into the ring at around 162lb and he was a lot heavier, near to 185. He wasn\u2019t hurt when I hit him. I didn\u2019t expect him to be that big and I\u2019ve never really been hit that hard before. I stepped up too far and took something I shouldn\u2019t have taken, but I\u2019m in the peak of my career.</p> <p>\u201cEverything was going fine until that one big punch. I\u2019ve still got a lot left in me and I\u2019m not going to blame anyone because I took the fight. I knew what I was going into. I\u2019ve been knocked out before and always come back stronger. I\u2019ll do that again.\u201d</p> <p>As for his recollection of the experience, he said: \u201cI remember going back to my corner after I\u2019d stood up and then went to do the interview in the ring. I didn\u2019t see the punch coming \u2013 I would have tried to avoid it if I did! He put everything into the shot and it must have been the hardest punch he\u2019s landed for a long, long time.\u201d</p> <p>It looks increasingly likely Khan\u2019s next opponent will be the undefeated Philadelphian Garc\u00eda, who provides the added lure of revenge, as Khan is the mandatory challenger for the WBC belt he ripped away from him in this town four years ago. That fight would be in Las Vegas, probably in September. Khan says a quick overnight examination in hospital cleared fears of concussion \u2013 which is quite something.</p> <p>But, medical science and his own resilience aside, Khan has cause to wonder how much more his vulnerable chin and outsized heart can take in this sport.</p> <p>As the promoter Oscar De La Hoya said: \u201cAmir Khan is one of the bravest fighters on the planet. He didn\u2019t lose anything today. He will come back.\u201d But only a former fighter now earning his living on the safe side of the ropes could so easily juxtapose concern and business acumen.</p> <p>De La Hoya had rightly identified the quality of Khan\u2019s doomed challenge, coming up from welterweight and now heading straight back there \u2013 even if two of the judges absurdly had \u00c1lvarez ahead going into the sixth round, ignoring the challenger\u2019s superb boxing for most of the early exchanges. Nonetheless \u00c1lvarez was getting to Khan and the one-punch finish almost certainly saved him from an extended and more damaging beating.</p> <p>Meanwhile there is more money for everyone to make in the future and Khan will not blanch at the prospect of adding to the base $2m (\u00a31.4m) purse plus extras he earned this weekend. Nor will those well placed to help him get a little richer but probably not much healthier.</p> <p>Within minutes of Khan\u2019s head thudding with alarming force on to the canvas, his legs twitching in mute acknowledgment of the impact of the brilliant, long right hand that had crashed into his slack jaw, Brook was on Twitter to reissue a challenge for a domestic fight that could rival that between <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/may/31/carl-froch-beats-george-groves-wembley\" title=\"\">Carl Froch and George Groves</a> in front of 80,000 people at Wembley Stadium two years ago.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2016/may/03/amir-khan-floyd-mayweather-bitter-las-vegas-canelo-alvarez\">Amir Khan succeeds 'bitter' Floyd Mayweather as poster boy in Las Vegas | Kevin Mitchell</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Indeed Khan turned down such an offer from Brook\u2019s promoter, Eddie Hearn, preferring to move up from welterweight and take on this monumental challenge for marginally less money. Now the options are shrinking. \u201cI\u2019m here [for] all British showdown\u201d was Brook\u2019s simple message. Garc\u00eda, meanwhile, was as shocked as anyone watching on TV or the 16,000 customers at ringside in the new T-Mobile Arena: \u201cOmg. I feel bad for khan. Wow.\u201d</p> <p>Garc\u00eda will put those concerns for Khan\u2019s health to one side, however, when De La Hoya or Al Haymon, Khan\u2019s influential American adviser, calls him this week to talk numbers. The only hindrance to that long-awaited and mandated rematch is the prospect of a comeback by Floyd Mayweather Jr.</p> <p>As only he has the shameless knack of doing, the supposedly retired king of boxing has been insinuating himself into other people\u2019s narratives for the past couple of weeks, hinting at a return against Garc\u00eda in September. If he did steal that fight from Khan \u2013 having twice reneged on offers to meet him in the past \u2013 it would not surprise. But Khan seems unperturbed. He knows the WBC would then strip Brook of the title and hand him the opportunity to claim or contest it.</p> <p>But what of the winner of Saturday night\u2019s epic? The likelihood of boxing fans finally getting the fight they want more than any other \u2013 \u00c1lvarez against Gennady Golovkin to unify, ludicrously, five strands of the middleweight title \u2013 is turning from shale to concrete, because Mexico would be appalled if their hero found a way to avoid the sport\u2019s most dangerous fighter.</p> <p>Golovkin said last week he would not fight \u00c1lvarez at a catchweight below 160lb, as Khan did on Saturday night, at 155lb, and the Mexican had previously asserted he was reluctant to take on the bigger man at his own best weight. That argument seems to be shifting.</p> <p>\u201cThere are not going to be any weight issues with Golovkin,\u201d \u00c1lvarez said. \u201cI\u2019m going to talk to my team and we will make him an offer. I\u2019ll fight him at 160. I would like to fight in Mexico this year, or some time next year. Now we\u2019re going to sit down and discuss it. If we fight, it\u2019s not just for the fans, or because it is mandated. We\u2019re going to fight because we want to.\u201d</p> <p>De La Hoya was equally adamant that \u00c1lvarez-Golovkin is the only fight he is pursuing. There certainly was no mention of Britain\u2019s Billy Joe Saunders, who holds the WBO title. \u201cI\u2019m not talking to any other fighter \u2013 just Triple G, correct,\u201d he said when asked about alternative opponents. \u201cI have all his representatives on speed dial. If that\u2019s the fight that everyone wants, if that\u2019s the fight Canelo wants, I\u2019ll get some rest and start making some early-morning phone calls.\u201d</p> <p>According to the WBC, he has until 22 May to do a deal. Time and timing are everything in boxing.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/07/amir-khan-not-appreciated-britain\">Why is Amir Khan appreciated more abroad than at home? | Madhvi Pankhania</a> </p> </aside>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-09T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Since an unidentified civil servant was seen walking up Downing Street holding, but not quite concealing, a document that set out options for \u201cextracting greater public value from the Channel 4 Corporation, focusing on privatisation options in particular\u2026\u201d there has been a lot of information exchanged and commentary expended. And yet today we are not much the wiser as to the rationale for a privatisation of C4.</p> <p>It doesn\u2019t appear to be about the relevance or importance of the remit or our creative performance, nor seemingly about the money. If there is any clarity at all, it is about some vague sense of Channel 4 becoming unsustainable amongst the hurly burly of new players about to undermine the existence of every advertiser-funded media business in the UK. Tellingly, those most ardent supporters of privatisation seem to have harboured those views for more years than such apparent threats have existed.</p> <p>The model under which C4 works embodies two virtues. C4 fulfils its public service remit, which features both qualitative purposes and specific quota requirements set out in its Ofcom licence, while remaining self-sufficient in commercial terms. It is a marriage of commerce and public service; the former at the service of the latter. The purpose is to provide content of the highest quality that fulfils a specific, relevant and unique remit, while incurring no cost to the British taxpayer \u2013 by putting profits into programmes. The social enterprise model of Channel 4 means that its surplus is not distributed.</p> <p>The accrued revenue all goes back into programme making and fulfilment of the remit. Some programmes fulfil the public service remit but traditionally run at a loss. The obvious examples are news and current affairs.</p> <p>Others are more overtly and unashamedly commercial, to make money to fund the loss-making, though even these \u2013 for example Come Dine with Me, acquisitions and even Formula 1, are not just cash cows but commissioned or selected to sit within the mix. Because we don\u2019t see public service broadcasting as just a narrow set of boxes to tick, but as a framework to maximise genuine public value through programmes of all sorts of shapes and sizes that resonate and mean something to audiences about the society that is evolving around us. In contrast with some of our early forebears, we do not believe that in the 21st century, public service broadcasting is always about putting on obscure operas and avant-garde art films that might impress our friends. We think it\u2019s also about reflecting the society we are constantly in the process of becoming in ways that are engaging, innovative, popular and therefore financially sustainable.</p> <p>The requirement for Channel 4 to be different is precisely what makes the channel the particular success it is. It is by no means obvious that this range of requirements could be met if Channel 4 answered solely to shareholders on a shorter time horizon, subject to the demand for quarterly earnings reports. Every part of the model is working well. Revenues are at record levels, the audience is telling us we\u2019re performing as strongly to the remit as ever. Programmes are winning audiences and awards. C4 is stimulating public debate, nurturing new talent, giving a voice to the otherwise unheard and taking risks.</p> <p>It continues to make an economic, social and cultural contribution of a kind I simply cannot imagine a company structured to maximise shareholders\u2019 financial returns being able to match. The idea of privatisation really does feel like a solution in search of a problem.</p> <p><em>David Abraham is chief executive of Channel 4 Television and a former chief executive of UKTV</em></p> <p><em>This is an edited extract from What Price Channel 4? a collection of essays published by Abramis and edited by John Mair, Fiona Chesterton, David Lloyd, Ian Reeves and Richard Tait</em></p>",

Instead a single point from 12 turned this into a five-match, three-team sprint for the title.</p> <p>Real, Barcelona and Atl\u00e9tico won three in a row but Atl\u00e9tico fell at the penultimate hurdle with Sunday\u2019s defeat at the bottom club, who have been relegated. Real\u2019s pursuit continues, though, and Barcelona must hold them off for one more week. At least they do not do so against a team fighting for its life.</p> <p>All games kicked off at 5pm and Diego Simeone\u2019s Atl\u00e9tico climbed ahead of them, as it stood, after two minutes when Fernando Torres scored at Levante. But Barcelona went back to the top five minutes later, when Messi lifted a free-kick over the wall and beyond Pau L\u00f3pez.</p> <p>Not until the second half could Barcelona really feel comfortable. Word came through that Real Madrid had taken the lead against Valencia but there was better news for Bar\u00e7a when Atl\u00e9tico conceded an equaliser and Granada were clearly rolling over Sevilla.</p> <p>As long as the lead was a single goal there would still be concerns for the Catalans. No one had forgotten 2007 when, on the penultimate game of the season, Espanyol got an 89th-minute equaliser here to cost their city rivals the title. But this time the margin was not a single goal for long.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/04/real-madrid-manchester-city-champions-league-match-report\">Timid Manchester City suffer as Real Madrid reach final thanks to own goal</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Barcelona got the second early in the second half and added a third soon after. Both came from Su\u00e1rez, his 36th and 37th league goals of the season, slotting past L\u00f3pez at his near post and then heading in Neymar\u2019s corner. L\u00f3pez then made a dreadful mistake to allow Rafinha to score and Su\u00e1rez laid on a cross for Neymar to make it five. A moment later Levante scored a late winner against Atl\u00e9tico.</p> <p>Though the title slipped from Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s reach, it was not yet beyond Real\u2019s and Valencia were unable to get the equaliser that would have made Barcelona champions on Sunday night.

      "body": "<ul> <li>The New Day\u2019s manifesto promised unfailingly \u201cupbeat\u201d journalism, but editor Alison Phillips found herself unable to summon the required sunniness in her valedictory leader on Friday. After the closure announcement, she wrote, there were commentators \u201cshuddering with the thrill of schadenfreude\u201d, or \u201cblah-ing about how ridiculous it was to launch a paper, or criticising what we produced, how we produced it, marketed it and delivered it. And that\u2019s fine\u201d, she oddly continued, as \u201ceveryone should be entitled to an opinion. And euthanasia\u201d.<br /></li> <li>Yet Phillips could swiftly rise again, as she\u2019s well liked by her Trinity Mirror bosses and appears reluctant to return to her weekend editor role there after a taste of the daily action. Might Peter Willis, the current Daily Mirror supremo, be pushed aside to make way for his colleague? If so, she\u2019ll get an early chance (in terms of her farewell quote from Samuel Beckett) to \u201cTry Again. Fail again. Fail better\u201d.<br /></li> <li>By Monkey\u2019s reckoning, the nine-week-wonder New Day could well be the shortest-lived UK newspaper in recent memory, as other contenders - Today, the Sunday Correspondent, the European, the London Paper, London Lite \u2013 have usually at least made it past the year mark, sometimes with ease. And its closest competitors for the title, Robert Maxwell\u2019s London Daily News and the leftist News on Sunday, managed four and seven months respectively, seemingly giving the New Day (50 issues from 29/2 to 6/5) a clear lead. Contacting Guinness about its strong claim to a national record might provide a modicum of compensation. </li> <li>Friday saw Chris Evans on the front of both the leading red-tops, as their row continued about whether \u201cBBC [is] too scared to stop bully Evans\u201d <a href=\"http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/7128604/Chris-Evans-former-sidekick-claims-Top-Gear-host-is-a-bully-who-terrorises-junior-staff-and-the-BBC-turns-a-blind-eye.html\">(Sun</a>) or \u201c\u2019Chris Evans isn\u2019t a bully ... He\u2019s a victim of a vile hate campaign\u201d (<a href=\"http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/chris-evans-victim-witch-hunt-7907601\">Daily Mirror)</a>. Less keen on the story is the Daily Mail, surprisingly given that it joined fully in the fun over the not dissimilar predicament of Jeremy Clarkson and is generally keen on anything offering a chance not only to trash egocentric, out of control celebrities but also to bash the BBC. On the same day, it relegated the hullabaloo about the Radio 2 DJ and Top Gear host (\u201cBBC must act on \u2018vile, bullying\u2019 Chris Evans ... says his old friend\u201d) to <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3574922/It-doesn-t-surprise-Chris-Evans-former-business-partner-radio-sidekick-says-BBC-investigate-claims-bullying-against-new-Gear-host.html\">page 15,</a> making clear it was only reluctantly following up distasteful red-top fodder by coyly crediting \u201cDaily Mail Reporter\u201d. But then the Mail is awkwardly placed, since Evans is the <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/event/article-3563207/Yes-read-style-SUVs-sweeping-nation-comes-ferrying-family-want-MPV.html\">car reviewer</a> of its Sunday sister paper \u2013 indeed it was his Mail on Sunday credentials that put him in pole position to be the new Clarkson.</li> <li>Fancy succeeding Sean O\u2019Connor as editor of The Archers? You\u2019re<a href=\"http://careerssearch.bbc.co.uk/jobs/job/Editor-The-Archers/16021\"> invited to apply </a>before 19 May, though on recent form those without senior stints on TV soaps on their CV may not get an interview. Besides drama credibility, candidates are required to have a mastery of W1A-style jargon (the editor\u2019s role includes being \u201ca (sic) R&amp;M and BBC leader\u201d and translating \u201cwhat the A&amp;M strategy means to their team\u201d), but not necessarily of grammar (\u201csaying sorry when you got it wrong\u201d is the final job spec item); to exhibit \u201cpersonal ownership of change\u201d (Monkey currently has a couple of quid and a few 20ps, but is that enough?), and accept the job entails \u201cbeing a senior editorial leader committed to the BBC\u2019s Birmingham base\u201d \u2013 a piece of waffle presumably meant to ensure that the rural soap\u2019s new boss lives far from the country in Brum and to rule out Salford-style weekly or daily commuting from London.<br /></li> <li>Is Allegra Stratton, the former Guardian journalist and Newsnight political editor who is now ITV News\u2019 national editor, happy with the way her role on Peston on Sunday is being characterised by its star? As Peston \u201cdescribes [her] as his sidekick on the show\u201d (according to Ginny Dougary\u2019s Radio Times profile of him ahead of its debut on Sunday), Monkey is inclined to guess not, though this might result in some very watchable on-set tension. <br /></li> </ul>",

Whatever. It\u2019s a big deal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/06/extend-14-day-limit-embryo-research\">It\u2019s time to extend the 14-day limit for embryo research | John Harris</a> </p> </aside>  <p>That\u2019s partly because this breakthrough moves science to the edge of an internationally agreed ethical boundary, which sets a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2000/aug/20/genetics.theobserver\" title=\"\">14-day limit on human embryo experimentation</a>, established in the UK since the Warnock committee adopted it in 1984. But it\u2019s also because of the content of the research itself, which has confirmed, as the research team <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/ncb/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ncb3347.html\" title=\"\">put it in the journal Nature Cell Biology</a>, \u201cthe remarkable and unanticipated self-organising properties of human embryos\u201d. Basically, even at such an early stage, embryos have autonomy.</p> <p>For those who believe that any intervention at all in the creation of human life is a bit dodgy, this news will be disturbing. Thus far, the 14-day rule has proved consoling to all sorts of people who are uncertain about how much human beings should mess around with human life. It\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.eurostemcell.org/factsheet/embryonic-stem-cell-research-ethical-dilemma\" title=\"\">at 14 days that an embryo can no longer split into twins</a>, confirming individuality; and the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/feb/10/thisweekssciencequestions\" title=\"\">primitive streak</a>\u201d appears, denoting that the basic body has begun to be determined (or as some put it, marking the start of the existence of a \u201cmorally significant being\u201d).</p> <p>So it\u2019s no surprise that some people with an investment in scientific ethics are already feeling a bit antsy. Within days of the research being published, <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/embryology-policy-revisit-the-14-day-rule-1.19838\" title=\"\">a long letter appeared in the journal Nature</a>, suggesting that it was time for the 14-day rule to be reassessed. They\u2019re aware of how it looks: as if science is happy with the position of a set of goalposts, until it\u2019s within striking distance. But it\u2019s not that simple.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If only other disciplines, like technology or economics, could be as carefully considered and well-regulated as science</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>As the letter writers say: \u201cSome might conclude from such developments that policymakers redefine boundaries expediently when the limits become inconvenient for science. If restrictions such as the 14-day rule are viewed as moral truths, such cynicism would be warranted. But when they are understood to be tools designed to strike a balance between enabling research and maintaining public trust, it becomes clear that, as circumstances and attitudes evolve, limits can be legitimately recalibrated.\u201d Which is one way of saying that it all depends on your point of view.</p> <p>Scientists tend to be consequentialist in their view of research. They\u2019ll argue that their research will stretch the bounds of knowledge, and thereby promote the wellbeing of all humans. Already the 13-day research is being hailed as potentially useful in understanding early miscarriage, improving assisted conception and generally increasing insight into things that can go wrong during pregnancy.</p> <p>The implication in this case is that a more generous time limit on research could help with these matters even more. Others will say that such views are speculative, and that there\u2019s simply no guarantee that anything at all can be learned about how an embryo develops in the womb from how it develops on a tightly controlled in-vitro implantation platform. Yet the possibility that great good could emerge from such research remains, and science is fairly well known for its capacity to transform what\u2019s possible.</p> <p>For those who crave moral truths, however, it\u2019s precisely this uncertainty - the fact that no amount of hard study and hard thinking can produce a guaranteed and definite outcome -that promotes a distrust of science. There\u2019s comfort in certainty, in believing that human life is sacrosanct from the moment of primitive streak, or conception, or even from the moment of legover.</p> <p>Why? In part, just because it\u2019s nice to feel certain. In the most egregious cases, it\u2019s because it makes it very easy to set yourself up as judge, jury and executioner, as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/29/planned-parenthood-colorado-springs-shooting-no-more-baby-parts\" title=\"\">fatal violence against believers in abortion choice in the US</a> all too graphically confirms. The US \u201cculture wars\u201d also confirm something that the writers of that letter in Nature are very concerned about: keeping as many people on board as you can, in decisions about medicine, science and ethics, is crucial to the smooth and peaceable functioning of society. Science is good at this; other fields of human endeavour are not.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/29/planned-parenthood-colorado-springs-shooting-no-more-baby-parts\">Violent anti-choice rhetoric must end, or anti-abortion violence never will</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The great thing about the scientific community, on the whole, is that it understands and respects this grave responsibility at a deep and serious level. (We\u2019ll leave Big Pharma out of this vision of Arcadia, because it doesn\u2019t belong in it, for which assertion <a href=\"http://static.latimes.com/oxycontin-part1/\" title=\"\">this week\u2019s LA Times investigation into Oxycontin</a> provides just the latest evidence.) Scientists may complain about the actions of people in militant opposition to what they are doing. But no decent scientist is unwilling to listen to reason, and no decent scientist is unaware that indecent scientists who don\u2019t listen to reason do exist and are dangerous.</p> <p>Science is well used to working under the limitations of philosophical checks and balances, and understands that robust intellectual underpinning promotes public support and trust. In the coming months and years, debate and discussion about the 14-day limit will be engaging and interesting, far beyond the realm of science.</p> <p>My only wish is that other disciplines, including economics and industries on the cutting-edge of intellectual discovery, such as technology, were anything like as carefully and sensitively examined and considered, anything like as well regulated. Everyone knows how much can be learned from science. Maybe it\u2019s time for people to start learning from science about how to maintain international consensus in the face of change, complexity and the perils of self-interest.</p>",

He took an active part in the development of the polytechnic and was an important influence in the art education of a generation of students in the north-east of England.</p> <p>The son of Dorothy (nee Hoy) and Edward, Jack was born in Calcutta (now Kolkata), India, where his father worked as an accountant for an engineering firm which built a bridge over the Hooghly river. The family resettled in south London in 1926 when his father was made redundant.</p> <p>In 1939 Jack\u2019s father, who had also served in the first world war, was called up, and stationed with his regiment in Hayling Island, near Portsmouth. Jack stayed in London with his mother and his brother, Bob, until after he had taken his school certificate the following year. However at that point the whole family relocated to Waterlooville, Hampshire, to be nearer his father. Unable to continue into the sixth form, Jack enrolled at Portsmouth College of Art. From there he went on to the Royal College of Art, from where he was, for a while, evacuated to Ambleside in the Lake District.</p> <p>On graduating in 1947 he married Margaret Cumming, a fellow student, and the couple both moved to jobs at<strong> </strong>Portsmouth College of Art. Margaret taught drawing and Jack taught commercial design.</p> <p>Now with two children, Jack and Margaret moved in 1956 to Newcastle upon Tyne where Jack took up a graphic design teaching post at Newcastle College of Art and Industrial Design, which became part of Newcastle Polytechnic. When he retired in 1983, he was head of department, having gained an MSc in marketing and advertising 10 years earlier, in order to better supervise those undertaking advanced studies.</p> <p>In retirement, both he and Margaret devoted more time to their own art and Jack produced prints, primarily Lino cuts of landscapes and buildings, based on areas he now had time to visit. He also produced logos and designs for the Leaveners (Quaker Youth theatre), the National Trust, and Newcastle Cathedral, where the lantern tower inspired his letterhead design, used for many years.</p> <p>The most recent exhibition of his work was a retrospective of work by both Jack and Margaret, at the <a href=\"https://hattongallery.org.uk/\" title=\"\">Hatton Gallery</a> in Newcastle in 2012.</p> <p>Jack is survived by Margaret, his son, Edward, his daughters, Rachel and me, four grandchildren and two great-granddaughters.</p>",

      "body": "<p>It\u2019s time for the chiffon, the latex and the pyrotechnics, the hair extensions, the semi-clad dancers and the strangely discordant backing vocalists, the terrifying key changes, the neon-white smiles and the political (nul) point-scoring.</p> <p>However, this time the organisers of the Eurovision song contest have conspired to create a much more sombre event. The theme is \u201ccome together\u201d and the show will feature a dance sequence evoking Europe\u2019s refugee crisis, as well as a handful of political entries.<br /></p> <p>Mans Zelmerlow, last year\u2019s winner and this year\u2019s co-presenter, told the Swedish broadcaster SVT: \u201cIt is more necessary than ever before that we unite and join together, and that is literally what we do in Eurovision, where most of the countries in Europe meet together. </p> <p>\u201cWe obviously want to touch upon it: anything else would be to bury your head in the sand. We have shut the borders now, so I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s that much to be proud about.\u201d</p> <p> Sven Stojanovic, content producer of the show, said of the dance routine: \u201cWe want to make people think and be left with something to reflect upon after seeing the performance.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4cfd29fb050597689ab196546753d80c35962e6c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4cfd29fb050597689ab196546753d80c35962e6c/298_559_3860_2316/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Italy\u2019s Francesca Michielin rehearses the song No Degree Of Separation\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Italy\u2019s Francesca Michielin rehearses the song No Degree Of Separation</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonas Ekstromer/TT/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Sweden\u2019s ambassador to the UK, Nicola Clase, has made an entirely serious radio documentary, to be broadcast on Wednesday on the BBC World Service, called <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2016/19/swedish-ambassadors-guide-to-eurovision\">The Swedish Ambassador\u2019s Guide to Eurovision</a>, <a href=\"http:// http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/proginfo/2016/19/swedish-ambassadors-guide-to-eurovision\"> </a>insisting that its history is \u201cas much about politics as pop\u201d.</p> <p>She cites the tension this year on and off stage between Russia and the Ukraine. Eurovision rules bar overtly political songs, but Russia has taken a dim view of the Ukrainian entry, 1944, written by the singer Jamala, which never refers explicitly to the Crimean Tatars or the Soviet leader Joseph Stalin but deals with her great grandmother\u2019s experiences in the year when thousands of the Tatar people were exiled.</p> <p>Sunday saw the suitably surreal launch of the Eurovision week, which will climax on Saturday with the 2016 final watched by an expected 200 million people. Members of the Swedish Life Guards regiment raised the flags of 42 countries as the competing artists paraded along a 95-metre red carpet before being whisked away to the opening reception at Stockholm town hall.<br /></p> <p> In true Eurovision style, the first tears have already been shed. There should have been 43 flags and 43 competitors, but <a href=\"http://www3.ebu.ch/news/2016/04/ebu-withdraws-member-services-fr\">Romania was expelled</a> last month from the European Broadcasting Union for failing to pay an accumulated debt of \u20ac14.5m (\u00a311.4m). With it went the right to seek Eurovision glory.</p> <p>The unfortunate 24-year-old singer who had already been chosen to represent Romania, Ovidiu Anton, said: \u201cDear friends, I have finally received the official communication. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/22/romania-kicked-out-eurovision-debt\">I am trying to smile and not get carried away, but it is unfair</a>.\u201d It was perhaps a fortunate turn of events. If Romania had won this year\u2019s competition, they would be saddled with the additional debt of paying for the whole show in 2017.</p> <p> The sensible Swedes have dramatically slimmed down the cost of staging the event, since the glory days when Azerbaijan is believed to have staged the most expensive contest ever. In 2012, the country allegedly spent at least $108m (\u00a374m) on preparations, including building a new arena \u2013 and renovating an old one in case the Crystal Hall was not ready in time \u2013 in the capital Baku.</p> <p>The drama of the final \u2013 the organisers insist \u2013 has been undergone a <a href=\"http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=biggest_change_to_eurovision_song_contest_voting_since_1975\">major revamp</a>  of the already bewildering voting system, separating the scores of the professional juries and the viewers voting by app or text message, \u201cadding a new level of excitement for hundreds of millions of viewers in Europe and beyond\u201d.</p> <p> Ireland, which has the highest number of wins of any competing country with seven victories, including three consecutive years, has since put forward Dustin the Turkey once, and Jedward twice, to guard against any repeat. This year it\u2019s Nicky Byrne, former Westlife star and co-author of the entry Sunlight, <a href=\"http://nickybyrne.com/nicky-byrne-releases-debut-solo-single-sunlight-today-friday-12th-feb-2016-available-now/\">described on his own website</a> as \u201ca modern, mid-tempo pop track with an ultimately catchy hook\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ce8f94e018234d45d55a5847d9f8179b23f5518e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ce8f94e018234d45d55a5847d9f8179b23f5518e/0_130_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amir Haddad, who represents France, performs the song J\u2019ai cherche during rehearsals\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amir Haddad, who represents France, performs the song J\u2019ai cherche during rehearsals</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jonas Ekstromer/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The United Kingdom has remained quite safe for many years from the threat of having to host: Electro Velvet picked up just five points in 2015 in Vienna. This time it\u2019s Joe and Jake \u2013 who only met last year as contestants on The Voice \u2013 singing You\u2019re Not Alone (chorus \u201cuh oh oh wah oh oh\u201d). After their first rehearsal, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/uk_eurovision/status/728883451064111104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">odds shortened dramatically</a> from 50-1 to 25-1. \u201cThey could now be considered a lively outsider,\u201d a spokesman for William Hill said. </p> <p>They should perhaps consider adding a wolf. Minus One from Cyprus have a wolf in their video and howl like wolves on stage, and it remains to be seen whether Ivan from Belarus achieves his ambition of singing naked on stage flanked by a pair of live wolves \u2013 in rehearsal he was, disappointingly, fully clothed.</p> <p>\u201c[He] will be naked on stage and there will be wolves,\u201d his manager said firmly. There remains the small issue of the rule, so wisely introduced in anticipation that one day wolves would become a Eurovision thing, which states: \u201cNo live animals shall be allowed on stage.\u201d</p> <ul> <li>This article was amended on 9 May to clarify that it wasn\u2019t Swedish life guards, but members of the Swedish Life Guards regiment who raised the flags.<br /></li> </ul>",

Liverpool gave his players a lesson in execution.</p> <p>Joe Allen and the substitute Roberto Firmino punished two defensive lapses to extend Liverpool\u2019s unbeaten run at Anfield to 12 matches in all competitions, the Brazilian becoming the team\u2019s first player to 10 league goals this season in the process.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/08/uefa-liverpool-sevilla-europa-league\">Uefa unbowed by Liverpool and Sevilla\u2019s need for a bigger Europa League boat | Barry Glendenning</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Klopp made eight changes to the side that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/05/liverpool-reach-europa-league-final-villarreal\" title=\"\">swept beyond Villarreal</a> and into the Europa League final and, though a typical end-of-season affair took the place of Thursday\u2019s intensity, the Liverpool manager was left with few complaints from a routine win. There was only one concern \u2013 his advice to those without tickets for the final to travel to Switzerland for the showdown with Sevilla on 18\u00a0May.</p> <p>Unprompted, Klopp opened his post-match press conference by saying: \u201cI just learned this is my 49th game \u2013 you usually need one and a half years for that \u2013 and that\u2019s about 5,000 press conferences. I\u2019ve said lot of things in these press conferences and the last time I spoke, about Basel, I spoke like a supporter. I do that sometimes because I like this game.</p> <p>\u201cI invited all Liverpool fans to Basel and that was not too smart, to be honest. It is a nice city but it\u2019s not ready for us and that was my mistake. So I have to take back my invitation to the fans. Please, only people with tickets should go there, because otherwise everything else will be chaos. If you cannot be there, then stay at home or come to Liverpool and watch the game with your friends and let\u2019s have a party afterwards. It\u2019s really, really important you listen. It\u2019s important we only send the team and the 10,000 fans.\u201d</p> <p>Liverpool\u2019s penultimate Premier League game at Anfield unfolded at a pedestrian pace on a sweltering Merseyside day. Watford were content to sit deep with two banks of four and hit Klopp\u2019s team on the counterattack, an approach that might have paid dividends but for late interventions by Liverpool defenders and hesitancy in front of Simon Mignolet\u2019s goal. Odion Ighalo broke through a makeshift central defensive pairing of Martin Skrtel and Lucas Leiva from the visitors\u2019 first break and was taking aim when Alberto Moreno dived in to Liverpool\u2019s rescue. A misplaced pass from Allen offered Ighalo opportunity to chip Mignolet from over 30 yards, the effort sailing just wide, and Almen Abdi volleyed over from Ikechi Anya\u2019s break down the left.</p> <p>Flores\u2019s side cut through Liverpool\u2019s rearguard too easily in the first half, although the defence received little protection in midfield. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Jurado had time and space to float an inviting ball over Skrtel for Ighalo to break into the area. Once again, just as the striker shaped to connect, a Liverpool defender\u2019s boot intervened. Skrtel nicked the ball from Ighalo and made another block from Abdi\u2019s goalbound drive at the resulting corner.</p> <p>Despite the best endeavours of Sheyi Ojo, Liverpool\u2019s dominance in possession did not yield many clear-cut openings but they were far more clinical with the chances that did arrive. Watford were handed a punishing lesson in the cost of losing concentration in the Premier League.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/liverpool-daniel-sturridge-jurgen-klopp-europa-league-final\">Liverpool\u2019s Daniel Sturridge shows desire to become J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s main man</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Heurelho Gomes in the Watford goal had been troubled only by a shot from Philippe Coutinho that deflected narrowly wide before the home side took the lead under minimal pressure from those in yellow. There was no defender near Christian Benteke when Coutinho\u2019s cross picked out the recalled striker inside the Watford area. Benteke cushioned a header towards the penalty spot where the unmarked Allen steered the ball under the hesitant Gomes. Ighalo thought he had drawn Watford level when Troy Deeney\u2019s touch released him inside the area and, having stepped away from Moreno\u2019s challenge, his shot was destined for the top corner only for Mignolet to produce a superb finger-tip save.</p> <p>Liverpool made the game safe when Anya\u2019s attempted clearance was charged down by Ojo and rebounded to Firmino. The Brazilian was given a free run at goal as Watford\u2019s defenders backed off and his low shot took a slight deflection before sailing through Gomes\u2019s unconvincing guard. \u201cSpeculation in football is normal,\u201d said Flores amid uncertainty over his position at Vicarage Road.</p> <p>\u201cYou need to live with this kind of talk but sometimes life is ridiculous. I\u2019m really proud of the players and how Watford have played during the season. It is important to be realistic and to enjoy the moment we are living with Watford. I can be sad if people around me are not enjoying the experience. I suffer that but not for me.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> Joe Allen (Liverpool)</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-09T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>On his last day in office as chairman of Channel 4, Lord Burns told listeners to BBC Radio 4\u2019s The Media Show that \u201cyou can have the Channel 4 remit, or you can have privatisation, but you cannot have both\u201d. Yet there is abundant evidence that this is not a binary choice between content and paying dividends to shareholders.</p> <p>The kind of situation where new shareholders require large dividends is typically a private equity transaction. If one thing is certain in this whole affair, it is that there will not be a sale to private equity.But a sale only makes sense to an existing media player \u2013 one that can extract synergies and savings from ownership of Channel 4. The scale of savings that might be achieved by a buyer such as Sky, Viacom (owner of Channel 5), Discovery or Liberty Global (owner of Virgin Media) must easily run to \u00a3200m a year.</p> <p>The formula so often used by leaders of Channel 4 \u2013 that we make a valuable contribution to the creative economy \u201cat zero cost to the taxpayer\u201d \u2013 is simply wrong. Allowing that \u00a3200m to go begging every year, when public service broadcasting is in long term decline, cannot be the right answer.</p> <p>The issue with Channel 4 is not privatisation, but how to enhance its central public service broadcasting role. Since 2003, Ofcom has charted a steady decline in the delivery of public service content and of originated programming, without ever suggesting how this depressing trend might be reversed. As far as Channel 4 is concerned the main changes by Ofcom have been to loosen public service obligations, not tighten them.</p> <p>The most recent requirements introduced in 2010 for Channel 4 to make a \u201cstatement of media policy\u201d offer no established measure of success, nor any prescribed penalty for failure. The tests for whether they are being met are devised by Channel 4 itself, and presently show commendable achievement. But if these \u2013 or other \u2013 tests showed lesser success, or even failure, there is no provision for any remedial action. The requirement is to state the aspirations, not fulfil them in an objective fashion.</p> <p>Channel 4\u2019s portfolio of channels are nominally part of the Channel 4 remit, which \u2018applies across all services and genres\u2019. But the fact is that anything recognisably public service about Channel 4\u2019s output is almost exclusively confined to the main channel.</p> <p>If there is to be a sale process, Ofcom \u2013 and especially its content board \u2013 needs to be meaningfully strengthened, so that any new remit can be vigorously enforced.</p> <p>If Channel 4 can survive \u2013 even thrive \u2013 indefinitely in public ownership, thanks to a weak remit, then it is all the harder to justify leaving money, and a stronger remit, \u201con the table\u201d, unrealised.</p> <p><em>David Elstein is chairman of openDemocracy.net, an executive producer at Portobello Films and was the launch chief executive of Channel 5.</em></p> <p><em>This is an edited extract from What Price Channel 4? a collection of essays published by Abramis and edited by John Mair, Fiona Chesterton, David Lloyd, Ian Reeves and Richard Tait</em></p>",

Despite official efforts to bury the bad news under Friday\u2019s election coverage, Morgan\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/06/government-backs-down-over-plan-to-make-all-schools-academies\" title=\"\">climbdown over the forced academisation of schools</a> has been widely publicised, and celebrated across the political spectrum.</p> <p>In the end, the education secretary dared not defy a handful of powerful Tory backbenchers, or shire leaders \u2013 according to one, the government had simply \u2018gone bonkers\u2019 \u2013 implacably opposed to having their local power over education destroyed.</p> <p>But there was another climbdown, just as significant in its way, last Friday: <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/toby-young-admits-running-a-school-was-harder-than-i-thought-as-he-backs-down-as-free-school-ceo-a7017651.html\" title=\"\">Toby Young, stepped down</a> as chief executive of the West London Free School, which he set up in 2011, admitting he now regrets his \u201carrogance\u201d over education, and in particular his criticism of teachers, heads and local authorities. \u201cI hadn\u2019t grasped how difficult it is to do better,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Young, it appears, has finally caught up with some of the more complex social and political reasons why so many local schools can\u2019t keep pace with the rich, socially selective independent sector that he so admires.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>'Most school leaders and teachers are depleted, demoralised by too much change and too many changes of official mind.'</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Let\u2019s not forget the huge role Young, the most public and provocative face of the coalition\u2019s free schools plan, played in undermining public and parental confidence in state education, particularly nonselective schools: all that \u201cwe can do better\u201d hysteria whipped up in the early Michael Gove period led some commentators seriously to suggest that critics of free schools were \u201c<a href=\"http://jamesdelingpole.com/2011/05/free-schools-the-stake-in-the-heart-of-the-progressive-vampire/\" title=\"\">actively evil</a>\u201d.</p> <p>It all feels like another age now. Both Morgan and Young\u2019s retreats signify one more important staging post in the fast diminishing credibility of the school reforms unleashed by the Tories after 2010. If Gove brought an intellectual energy and spurious coherence to a fundamentally flawed project, Morgan brings the rabbit-caught-in-headlights nervousness of someone placed in charge of a convoy of rackety vehicles that now threatens to veer out of control.</p> <p>Huge change has been forced through at all levels, on scant evidence and even less meaningful consultation. There is no proof that academisation is the way to improve school performance, and few would still argue that free schools remain a vehicle for meaningful parental involvement \u2013 Young himself, an exceptionally well-networked figure in Tory circles, was always an outlier. Most new free schools are set up by existing chains or groups.</p> <p>The mantra of choice and competition, kickstarted by the Tories in the late 1980s, rings utterly hollow under a government characterised by a crass, heavy-handed centralism on everything from school structures to the curriculum. But things are not centralised (or merely efficient) enough to avert the crisis in school places, teacher recruitment and workload, or to sort out an increasingly rogue school admissions system.</p> <p>We are left with a supremely English mess. The government is still committed, in theory, to an all-academy system by 2022, and has pledged to force immediate conversion on schools that don\u2019t meet rigidly prescribed benchmarks. Given that it is largely schools in poorer areas, serving poorer children, that fail to make the often unrealistic grade, look out for a return of partisan and now vengeful rhetoric about \u201cunderperforming\u201d Labour local authorities.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/06/government-backs-down-over-plan-to-make-all-schools-academies\">Government drops plan to make all schools in England academies</a> </p> </aside>  <p>English education will continue to be split, run along parallel lines: those still working under the often loose aegis of the local authority (still 74% of all schools); and academies, most of these now in chains or herded into multi-academy trusts, all under the supervision of mysterious and undemocratic regional school commissioners.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Morgan\u2019s disastrous decision <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2015/nov/10/grammar-school-annexe-kent-academies\" title=\"\">to agree an annexe to a Kent grammar</a> (Gove had turned the proposal down) has, as predicted, let loose a flood of applications for expansion of grammars into previously nonselective areas, causing an outcry within many communities wanting improvement in their local schools \u2013 rather than a new, hugely divisive tier of provision. Morgan\u2019s retreat on academies will not, on the face of it, halt other proposed reforms.</p> <p>All this poses a challenge to Labour. There is widespread hunger for an alternative vision within a well resourced, well supported system, with light touch democratic accountability. But most school leaders and teachers are depleted, demoralised by too much change and too many changes of official mind.</p> <p>With four years still to go, Labour would be wise to start widespread consultation on everything from reform of the curriculum, genuinely fair admissions and high quality teacher training. After all, if politicians had heeded educational professionals more and listened less to provocative, self-promoting figures such as Toby Young, we might not have got into such a mess.</p>",

      "body": "<p>My friend Betty \u201cJohnnie\u201d Adshead, who has died aged 95, was a tireless campaigner in the fight to have mental health better understood. In 1998 she was voted Stockport woman of the year principally in recognition of her work for the local charity <a href=\"http://www.stockportmind.org.uk/\">Stockport Mind</a>.</p> <p>Betty was born in Stockport, the second daughter of Frank Johnson, a printer, and his wife, Edith (nee Rhodes). When the second world war broke out, she joined the Ministry of Health\u2019s emergency department in Sunlight House, Manchester, providing health care for casualties of war and the air raids. Social life, she recalled, was concentrated around nocturnal fire watching in the city centre.</p> <p>After the war, as plans got underway for the setting up of the National Health Service, Betty was seconded to Whitehall for six months. Aneurin Bevan, architect of the NHS, became a familiar face and she remembers him calling her \u201ccomrade\u201d. Back in the north, she was appointed personal assistant to John Gibbon, secretary of the Manchester Regional Hospital Board.</p> <p>Then marriage to Kenneth Adshead took her for a few years to Australia, where their daughter, Julie, was born. On their return to Britain, Betty trained as a social worker and specialised in mental health, studying at both Keele and Liverpool universities.</p> <p>She helped to establish the ESMI (Elderly Severely Mentally Infirm) Unit at Stepping Hill hospital, Stockport, and to found a charity supporting people with mental health problems that was to become affiliated to the national mental health charity <a href=\"http://www.mind.org.uk/\">Mind</a>.</p> <p>She was the chair of Stockport Mind for 14 years and remained its honorary president until her death. She was also key in the setting up of two offshoots that are still active \u2013 a day centre now called SPARC (Stockport Progress and Recovery Centre) and a project to involve people with mental health problems in creative activities, ARC (Arts for Recovery in the Community).</p> <p>Her concern for others was always evident. She supported individuals and campaigned across a wide range of health and social care matters, including serving as vice-chairman of the Stockport community health council. She was always a ready spokesperson on local radio when mental health issues were in the news.</p> <p>Betty was a lifelong member of the <a href=\"http://sigbi.org/stockport/\">Soroptimist Club of Stockport</a> and its president in 1984.</p> <p>Ken died in 1977. Betty is survived by Julie and by two grandchildren, Matthew and Eleanor.</p>",

      "body": "<p>This riveting draw takes Manchester City\u2019s bid to qualify for the Champions League out of their hands and gives that advantage to Manchester United.</p> <p>The numbing disappointment of this was evident at the end as the home support rapidly left and Khaldoon al\u2011Mubarak, the chairman, and chief executive, Ferran Soriano, stood stony faced.</p> <p>It also meant that when Manuel Pellegrini and his players re-emerged 15 minutes later the Chilean endured the embarrassment of giving a farewell speech to a near-empty Etihad Stadium.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/08/arsene-wenger-value-champions-league-manchester-city\">Ars\u00e8ne Wenger knows true value of reaching Champions League again</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Pellegrini\u2019s final home match as manager, City knew that beating Arsenal would pile maximum pressure on United who would have to win at West Ham United on Tuesday or see their own top\u2011four challenge ended.</p> <p>Instead, a breathless end-to-end affair closed with the Sky Blues on 65 points and Arsenal 68 with next Sunday\u2019s final games to go. If West Ham are beaten, United will lift themselves to 66 points and become favourites to edge out their cross-town rivals for fourth place.</p> <p>Towards the end, the usually lethal Sergio Ag\u00fcero steered a left-foot volley wide and later Pellegrini threw on Yaya Tour\u00e9 and Wilfried Bony \u2013 who hit the bar three minutes from the close \u2013 but it was to no avail.</p> <p>City had required only eight minutes to take the lead and two to let it slip. They pressed the visitors back as Kevin De\u00a0Bruyne took an opening corner from the left, then the first free-kick from the same channel.</p> <p>Each of these yielded nothing but when play switched to the right this changed. Jes\u00fas Navas was one of four players in City\u2019s XI who survived from Pellegrini\u2019s opening home game in August 2013 \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/aug/19/manchester-city-newcastle-premier-league\" title=\"\">a 4-0 defeat of Newcastle United</a> \u2013 along with Joe Hart, Fernandinho and Ag\u00fcero. The Spaniard is maligned for lacking devilry but the scooped ball to Fernandinho to turn Arsenal\u2019s defence belied this. From here the Brazilian headed down and back towards Ag\u00fcero. The Argentinian made a mug of Mohamed Elneny with a touch that created the chance and his left foot did the rest, beating Petr Cech for a 24th Premier League strike this season.</p> <p>It was precisely the start City wanted. Yet within seconds they ceded the advantage and could only blame themselves. The corner from which Olivier Giroud would beat Hart was a gift, after Clichy decided to head a cross back to the goalkeeper only to wrong-foot him and come close to registering an own goal, the ball going wide to the right.</p> <p>From the ensuing kick City compounded this sloppiness by failing to mark Giroud. The Frenchman\u2019s header past Hart was convincing but the nearest to City player to him, Fernando, only reacted afterwards: in anger, perhaps at himself.</p> <p>After the game it was confirmed that Vincent Kompany\u2019s thigh problem will ensure he misses Belgium\u2019s 2016 European Championship campaign and the start of the Pep Guardiola era.</p> <p>Twenty-one minutes in Danny Welbeck suffered his own injury. The striker went down after trying to tackle Bacary Sagna, and having sustained a suspected lateral meniscus problem of his right knee his availability for England at Euro 2016 is now under threat, too. What the No23 left behind was an entertaining if uneven match as each side struggled to establish any rhythm.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/may/08/manchester-city-v-arsenal-premier-league-live\">Manchester City v Arsenal: Premier League \u2013 as it happened | Jacob Steinberg</a> </p> </aside>  <p>An illustration of the helter-skelter fare came when Fernando claimed the ball near the centre spot and sent it skimming towards Ag\u00fcero, who burned off Laurent Koscielny. Cech came hurtling out but his challenge left him on the floor and, with Ag\u00fcero still in possession, Arsenal were fortunate the score remained even.</p> <p>The second half began as a listless affair until De Bruyne took charge. H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn will not wish to see video analysis of how he allowed the Belgian to outmuscle him near halfway. From here De Bruyne still had work to do, and he did it \u2013 leaving Beller\u00edn trailing as he drove at a back-pedalling Arsenal, cut inside and banged a right-foot finish past Cech, inside the right post.</p> <p>This had Pellegrini and the Sky Blue faithful roaring. It stunned the visitors and wrestled the initiative City\u2019s way. However, Arsenal came back to enjoy a period of dominance and they came close to equalising via Theo Walcott.</p> <p>A 59th-minute replacement for Alex Iwobi, the England player got in behind but a clumsy touch meant the ball ran away from him. Then, Arsenal did score. Nacho Monreal was involved along the left before Alexis S\u00e1nchez took over. He fashioned a slick one-two with Giroud and let fly a shot that beat Hart for his 13th league goal this season.</p> <p>Beforehand Pellegrini was thanked by the owner, Sheikh Mansour. Writing in the programme, Al-Mubarak said: \u201cManuel has [won] two domestic trophies, a memorable Premier League title, and our best finish to date in Europe\u2019s premier competition. Significantly, he has ensured these achievements have been reached by attacking, entertaining football. Our club will always be grateful.\u201d</p> <p>The emotion may seriously dampen if City finish only in fifth. This would also mean Guardiola managing a club in the Europa League for the first time in his glittering career.</p>",

It must be opposed | Phil Harding</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The white paper is expected to demand that the pay of BBC talent \u2013 including news presenters such as John Humphrys and Huw Edwards \u2013 be disclosed in a bid to increase transparency and accountability at the state-owned broadcaster.</p> <p>The proposals for a new BBC board as well as greater oversight by the National Audit Office are likely to be opposed by the corporation as something one supporter described as \u201can attack on independence through the back door\u201d. In particular, it is believed that hit shows such as Strictly Come Dancing and The Night Manager could be trawled over in \u201cvalue for money\u201d audits, causing unnecessary headaches for producers who are able to go elsewhere.</p> <p>BBC director general, Tony Hall, and key lieutenants at the corporation are preparing a last-minute bid against what they consider a rearguard action by the culture secretary, John Whittingdale. They are expected to hold a series of meetings with national newspaper editors and other key influencers over the coming days to highlight the dangers in the government\u2019s proposals. </p> <p>These include:</p> <ul> <li>Plans for the government to exert greater influence over the BBC board by appointing the chair and vice-chair who would then be expected to appoint the majority of other members. The BBC itself is expected to account for just three board members directly appointed.</li> <li>Plans to allow the NAO to investigate any areas of the BBC without first reaching agreement with the board. Currently, the powers of the NAO to investigate BBC spending are limited and must be agreed upon by the soon-to-be disbanded BBC Trust.</li> <li>Plans to publish details of the pay for household names directly paid by the BBC if they earn more than \u00a3150,000.</li> </ul> <p>The changes will declare a bid to improve accountability and transparency at the BBC, which collects about \u00a33.7bn from the licence fee each year. But BBC insiders believe they could lead to a situation where contentious programmes such as Panorama would be subject to invasive checks.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/08/bbc-deserves-better-than-chumps-charter-whittingdale\">The BBC deserves better than a chump\u2019s charter</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Publishing details of the pay packets for major news presenters could also leave them open to unnecessary charges when they try to question government ministers over spending cuts, for example. \u201cImagine a government-appointed body being able to go through all the documents for a programme which was highly critical of the BBC. Or for a government minister to interrupt an interview by saying: \u2018Well, as you earn x, what would you know about it?\u2019\u201d said one opponent of the proposals.</p> <p>Historic changes to BBC governance that will see media regulator Ofcom take over the regulation of the corporation and the formation of a new board have provoked surprisingly little hostility, partly because of the unloved nature of the current BBC Trust. However, the BBC now fears the government will try to stuff the proposed board with executives from the commercial sector. Archie Norman, the outgoing chair of BBC rival ITV, is among those named as being interested in the job.</p> <p>Current chair of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/bbc-trust\">BBC Trust</a>, Rona Fairhead, is said to have tried to convince the government that she should be allowed to continue to head the new board following the trust\u2019s dissolution at the end of this year. However, a bid for her to be appointed as the new chair until her current contract runs out in 2018 was blocked in favour of an \u201copen process\u201d. Sources close to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport said the new board would be a \u201cBBC-led process\u201d but refused to deny that the chair and vice-chair would be appointed by the government.</p> <p>Although Whittingdale has led the white paper process, the prime minister, David Cameron, and the chancellor,George Osborne, are understood to have played a key part in the decision-making process.</p> <p>Ministers are likely to head off a BBC rebellion over top-slicing tens of millions of pounds for content by suggesting that it comes from underspend on previous charter negotiations such as on the broadband rollout. As much as \u00a350m could be earmarked for external programme providers.<br /></p> <p>Any attempt to take funds from the settlement agreed with Osborne last July will be seen as reopening the deal by the BBC, which would then, for example, no longer be committed to paying for free licence fees for the over-75s.<br /></p> <p>One source close to Whittingdale said overspending on previous initiatives such as the digital media initiative meant that greater oversight was necessary. \u201cThe idea that the NAO will go into Panorama is ludicrous,\u201d they said.<br /></p> <p>Labour MP David Lammy said: \u201cThe bad blood we are seeing between Whittingdale and the BBC is unprecedented. The pre-briefing we\u2019re seeing, tinkering with schedules, now going on about pay, it\u2019s very, very threatening to an institution that\u2019s loved, [even one] that needs to reform.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/may/17/jeremy-hunt-bbc-impartiality\">Jeremy Hunt</a> was the last culture minister to try to increase NAO oversight at the BBC, in 2010. However, with nothing to stop the government-appointed auditors doing what they like, the BBC fears such a situation could lead to future conflict.</p> <p>The BBC argued then, as it does now, that publishing details of its contacts and deals would be commercially sensitive and bad for the licence fee payer. <br /></p> <p>The current charter is expected to run for 11 years with a break clause of five years.</p>",

      "body": "<p> \u201cI\u2019d heard about his reputation, everyone in our world knew about it. People said he wasn\u2019t very responsible, that he ran away. So at first I thought I would never dance with him.\u201d As <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/natalia-osipova\">Natalia Osipova</a> glances at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergei_Polunin\">Sergei Polunin</a>, sitting protectively beside her, the ballerina\u2019s pale, guarded face brightens with sudden laughter \u2013 the dancer, with whom she swore never to share a stage is now the man with whom she\u2019s currently sharing her life.</p> <p>It\u2019s a romance few could have predicted \u2013 not only because the dancers were individually too famous to make a plausible couple, but also because their careers were heading in such dramatically divergent directions. Osipova, having left a stellar career at the Bolshoi with her former partner <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Vasiliev\">Ivan Vasiliev</a>, arrived in London in 2013 to join the Royal Ballet. Polunin, 18 months earlier had left the same company and, amid stories of cocaine abuse and deep professional unhappiness, had gone to Russia to piece together an increasingly precarious looking CV as dancer, fashion model and would-be film actor. <br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"31d7d3f1b0341526effd1b6f8c7eda29c59262da\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/31d7d3f1b0341526effd1b6f8c7eda29c59262da/0_378_3919_2352/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I watch how Natalia makes it her own\u2019 ... rehearsing Arthur Pita\u2019s new work.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I watch how Natalia makes it her own\u2019 ... rehearsing Arthur Pita\u2019s new work.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Yet just under a year ago Osipova was scheduled to dance <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giselle\">Giselle</a> in Milan and for various reasons had found herself without a suitable partner. Her mother suggested she contact Polunin who, despite his erratic form, remained a prodigious natural talent with a pure classical line and soaring jump that would make a superb foil to Osipova\u2019s own blazing intensity. Warily, the ballerina sent Polunin an email. And when, to her surprise, he agreed to partner her, she found he was nothing like the enfant terrible she\u2019d imagined. \u201cHe seemed very genuine, I could feel that he was a kind person, someone I could trust.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>When I walked out, I was trying to make the worst thing happen to me. The thing I was most scared of</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It was rehearsing Giselle \u2013 the most romantic ballet in the classical repertory \u2013 that the couple fell in love. For Polunin, the experience of dancing Albrecht to Osipova\u2019s Giselle was more than a romantic epiphany. He\u2019d become so dissatisfied with ballet that he was thinking of abandoning it altogether yet, he says, \u201cWhen I danced with Natalia it was wonderful. I was a hundred percent there, it was real for me and now I would love to dance with her all the time.\u201d </p> <p>He is now based back in London and although the professional logistics of their lives are complicated, they are formulating plans that will allow them to work together as often and as closely as possible. Polunin is keen to return to the Royal Ballet as a guest artist (\u201cthat is a conversation I would really like to have\u201d) but the couple also want to collaborate on other, independent, projects. Osipova says quietly: \u201cThis is the nature of our jobs. To see each other, to be able to come back home to each other, we have to find a way of working with each other.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/03/natalia-osipova-ivan-vasiliev-interview\">All change for Osipova and Vasiliev</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Their first joint venture is performing a new duet by <a href=\"http://www.russellmaliphant.com/people/russell-maliphant\">Russell Maliphant</a> which forms part of a <a href=\"http://www.sadlerswells.com/whats-on/2016/natalia-osipova\">summer programme of contemporary dance that Osipova has personally commissioned</a>. For her, it is a continuation of a project that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/aug/03/natalia-osipova-ivan-vasiliev-interview\">began with Solo for Two</a>, an evening of contemporary dance that she toured with Vasiliev in 2014. That was an experiment that both excited and frustrated her because it happened within such a rushed time scale. For the new programme, which features works by Arthur Pita and Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui as well as the Maliphant duet, she\u2019s determined to give herself all the preparation she needs to adapt her classically trained body to their different styles. \u201cI want to be able to master the language of these choreographers. I want to speak each one very well, without an accent.\u201d</p> <p>Polunin is dancing in the works by Pita and Maliphant. \u201cIt always felt as though there was a wall between me and contemporary dance,\u201d he says. \u201cI didn\u2019t know how to get into it. And I am finding it quite hard, especially when it goes down on to the floor. But I watch how Natalia makes it her own and I realise I can do it my way.\u201d<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"60977a8055411c77e02aecb4d4229631d1b2a818\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/60977a8055411c77e02aecb4d4229631d1b2a818/869_216_2608_3259/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018To be able to come home to each other, we have to find a way of working together\u2019\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018To be able to come home to each other, we have to find a way of working together\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Doing it his own way is a new experience for Polunin. In recent interviews he\u2019s spoken with angry, chaotic resentment about how he always felt forced into ballet, how hard it was for him to leave his native Ukraine at 13 and, without a word of English, adapt himself to an entirely foreign culture. Now, since meeting Osipova, he feels better able to deal with his past. </p> <p>Speaking slowly and carefully with a hint of his Ukraine accent still, he says: \u201cThe Royal Ballet School looked after me very well, they were like my family, and the company gave me everything. But I was unhappy and I didn\u2019t know how to express it. At home if you were angry you had a fight with someone, but at the school no one ever fought, you would have been thrown out. In the company I began to feel lost, I wanted to do other things, like a musical or a movie, but I was afraid of messing up. I had lived in London for 13 years, it was my home but I wasn\u2019t a citizen. If the director was angry with me and threw me out, where would I go? When I walked out, I think I was trying to make the worst thing happen to me, the thing I was most scared of, so that I wouldn\u2019t be frightened any more.\u201d</p> <p>Now that Polunin is spending so much time with Osipova he\u2019s around the Royal Ballet a lot \u201cI think and talk about ballet much more than I ever did before, I\u2019m a changed man.\u201d But while he wants to retain the classical core of his dancing, his passion is to perform and produce a far wider range of projects. A recent dance video he made with director David LaChapelle, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/dance-blog/2015/feb/12/sergei-polunin-hozier-take-me-to-church-david-lachapelle\">Take Me to Church</a> has had almost 15m views on YouTube and he says that\u2019s the young, non-specialist audience he would like to reach. \u201cI would like to do more projects involving artists from film, fashion and music. That\u2019s the spark for me\u201d.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b6fdbadf8f97df817aa86c5a0fed51823fe5a35b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b6fdbadf8f97df817aa86c5a0fed51823fe5a35b/286_478_3784_2271/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Osipova and Polunin.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I would love to dance with her all the time\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Osipova listens intently. \u201cSergei\u2019s ideas are wonderful and I believe it\u2019s very important to make them happen.\u201d She herself is very happy to remain as a permanent ballerina with the Royal, finding its repertory an ideal mix of new and classic works. \u201cNow that I am a mature dancer I really want to concentrate deeply on some of the classics like Swan Lake and Sleeping Beauty.\u201d But she still believes that her talent has yet to find its perfect outlet. \u201cI think there is a choreographer who will help me dance the best I can. I just need to discover them.\u201d<br /></p> <p>It will be a delicate balancing act, combining these personal and professional ambitions. Yet the blithe silliness with which the dancers giggle together and the absolute seriousness with which they listen to each other, demonstrate how closely attuned they are. Osipova smiles tenderly as she recalls their very first performance, when she stood waiting in the wings for Albrecht to knock at Giselle\u2019s door. \u201cIt was a very emotional moment for me, very lyrical, very symbolic. I had the feeling I\u2019d been waiting for that knock all my life.\u201d<br /></p> <ul> <li>Natalia Osipova and Guests opens at Sadler\u2019s Wells on 29 June, tours to Edinburgh\u2019s Festival theatre, 12-14 August, and returns to Sadler\u2019s Wells, 27 September-1 October<br /></li> </ul>",

So did his 10-year-old brother, Rashawn, who had to start middle school not far from where Akeal was killed. The brothers\u2019 grades dropped. Their mother said she could not find resources to support families dealing with the aftermath of gun violence.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/apr/07/mothers-children-gun-violence-victims-ali-smith-photography\">\u2018I lost part of my soul\u2019: the mothers who lost their children to gun violence</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Four years later, Christopher has become a regular speaker at gun control marches and other such events. He has been honored for his advocacy. Not yet 10 years old, he has an emphatic message: kids\u2019 voices matter. </p> <p>\u201cI speak out for Akeal and for everyone who has experienced gun violence, including the siblings who lose their brothers and sisters and other children whose voices aren\u2019t always heard,\u201d the fourth-grader said on Saturday, at <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/07/gun-control-march-new-york-julianne-moore\">an annual Brooklyn march</a> sponsored by <a href=\"http://momsdemandaction.org/\">Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America</a>. </p> <p>\u201cI have to use my voice to honor them, to fight for them. I may be just nine years old, but when I open my mouth, the voice that comes out is strong and can make a difference.\u201d</p> <p>The crowd cheered.</p> <p>More than 11,000 Americans are murdered with guns each year. About half are black men and boys. In recent years, according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an average of two black boys between the ages of 15 and 19 have been victims of a gun homicide each day. </p> <p>That toll does not take into account the estimated 60,000 Americans each year who are shot in violent incidents and survive, or growing research into <a href=\"http://www.essence.com/2014/09/05/propublica-post-traumatic-stress-disorder\">post-traumatic stress in children and adults</a> exposed to violence.</p> <p>On Saturday morning, Christopher took the subway from Queens to Cadman Park, Brooklyn, where advocates gathered to march across the Brooklyn Bridge. He rode with his mother, Natasha Christopher, and his brother Rashawn, now 15. On the subway, the two brothers leaned against the wall and talked quietly.</p> <p>Rashawn, a high school freshman, helped Christopher write his speech. They had practiced his delivery the day before. </p> <p>\u201cHe\u2019s so strong,\u201d Rashawn said. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a kid that has been able to withstand what he had to and still come up with this great attitude.\u201d </p> <p>His mother said Christopher made his first speech at a Mother\u2019s Day event for survivors of gun violence in 2013, when he was six. Since then, he has spoken at three Moms Demand Action marches, as well as at other events. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"4e6228cd8c3b28441519b129d1f887750b149360\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4e6228cd8c3b28441519b129d1f887750b149360/0_0_720_960/375.jpg\" alt=\"Christopher Underwood\" width=\"375\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Christopher speaks in 2015.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Natasha Christopher</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Natasha Christopher, who volunteers for Moms Demand Action and <a href=\"http://everytown.org/\">Everytown for Gun Safety</a>, a Michael Bloomberg-backed gun control group, has become a prominent voice in New York City. She spoke at a recent Hillary Clinton campaign event in Long Island. Clinton\u2019s advocacy on the issue had won her vote, she said. </p> <p>At Brooklyn\u2019s High Street station, Christopher dashed up the escalator. Across the street, gun safety advocates were assembling. It was a colorful crowd: some adults wore capes or sparkly cowboy hats. At least one came in full superhero costume. Children even younger than Christopher held signs protesting school shootings and the toll of guns. </p> <p> As the crowd grew to several hundred people, Christopher ran around the grassy park with a friend, an older boy in a red cape. </p> <p>A few minutes before 1pm, when the rally was supposed to start, Christopher formed a line with other advocates and survivors, many holding framed portraits of lost loved ones. Two Hollywood stars, Julianne Moore and Melissa Joan Hart, joined the group. Christopher\u2019s face was somber, and he rocked a little on his feet. He was wearing a whistle around his neck and a small token that said \u201cJustice\u201d. His black sneakers were muddy. </p> <p>His mother wiped his nose. She held a portrait of Akeal, his face young and shining. </p> <p>Moms Demand Action volunteer June Rubin welcomed the crowd state by state. Some had come from as far as Texas and California. There were families from Newtown, Connecticut, the location of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/14/newtown-shooting-gunman-kills-20-children\">2012 school shooting</a> that galvanized suburban mothers across the country; the parents of a 24-year-old Virginia journalist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/virginia-tv-news-shooting\">shot dead on live television in 2015</a>; and others whose loved ones died but only made the local news. </p> <p>Christopher spoke second. The microphone stand towered far above his head, so someone plucked the microphone out and put it in his hand. He kept his eyes mostly on his printed speech but he spoke in clear and measured tones and had to pause several times for cheering and applause. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/07/gun-control-march-new-york-julianne-moore\">'Did a bunch of little kids get shot today?'

Natasha said she was frustrated when Akeal\u2019s death was called a gang shooting. Akeal was not a gang member, she said, and no one had been charged in his murder. What she knows is that her son was \u201cexecuted\u201d by an \u201cunknown assailant\u201d.</p> <p>Natasha\u2019s grief was combined with fear for her struggling younger sons. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy as a mother to see your children just failing,\u201d she said, \u201cand not know who to turn to or what to do.\u201d<br /></p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I can\u2019t bring Akeal back \u2026 but I can help change the future to prevent more violence</p> <footer> <cite>Christopher Underwood</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>When she went looking for support, she found many resources for families dealing with domestic violence, even the chance to get help relocating. But there was almost nothing for families struggling with gun violence, she said. She was able to find therapy for her sons, but that wasn\u2019t enough. </p> <p>She kept reminding them that Akeal would have wanted them to succeed. It took about two years, she said, to get them back on track. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>She said she was proud of her sons for thriving despite what she sees as a broken system for helping families affected by shootings, on top of the broader lack of activities and programs for young people in neighborhoods with fewer financial resources. </p> <p>Gesturing toward Brooklyn Heights, an expanse of historic brownstones favored by celebrities, she said: \u201cIn this neighborhood, you don\u2019t see a liquor store on every corner.\u201d </p> <p>Some of the resources that were available to her family felt out of reach.

Providing phone records has been one of Rome\u2019s key requests and the Italian investigators were expected to ask for further such records during their Cairo meetings.</p> <p>Italian investigators were not immediately able to comment on the outcome of Sunday\u2019s meeting, although the country\u2019s foreign minister, Paolo Gentiloni, has been sceptical that Egypt would cooperate fully with the Italian delegation.</p> <p>\u201cThe killing of Giulio was so horrible and we cannot accept an Italian citizen to be tortured and killed in this way.</p> <p>\u201cI have to say that until now the cooperation was not satisfactory \u2026 I hope that in the next days things will change, but frankly speaking I want to see results before being optimistic on this,\u201d the minister told CNN last week.</p> <p>Gentiloni\u2019s decision last month to recall Italy\u2019s ambassador to Cairo, Maurizio Massari, followed a meeting between investigators in Rome and marked a significant worsening of diplomatic ties between the two countries.</p> <p>The most recent bilateral talks came hours after a Cairo court ordered the further detention of Ahmad Abdullah, an activist who had been providing legal assistance to the Regeni family.</p> <p>Abdullah was seized at his home on 25 April, a day of planned protests against the transfer of two islands to Saudi Arabia, and faces charges including belonging to a banned group and attempting to overthrow the state.</p> <p>In chaotic scenes at the court on Saturday, a scuffle broke out between bailiffs and lawyers as activists tried to photograph Abdullah as he held a sign reading \u201cTruth for Regeni\u201d. Police confiscated phones and swiftly deleted the images, as the court ordered Abdullah\u2019s pre-trial detention to be extended for 15 days, Associated Press reported.</p> <p>While the charges faced do not relate specifically to the Regeni case, the Italian\u2019s family have been quick to denounce his arrest.</p> <p>Mohammed Lotfy, from the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms, of whose board of trustees Abdullah is the head, cast doubt on the motives for the arrest. \u201cOf course the declared reason [for his arrest and trial] concerns the 25 April, but you don\u2019t know what is in the mind of the national security officer who added his name to the list of people to be arrested,\u201d said Lotfy.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The easy assumption about politics in Northern Ireland is that it is a contest between two ideas of sovereignty. Unionists see the place as British; nationalists see it as Irish. And the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/1998/apr/12/northernireland1\" title=\"\">Good Friday Agreement</a>, in effect the constitution \u2013 according, as it does, sovereignty rights to each \u2013 is the best interim solution to the old quarrel.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This election has signalled a change in the old model of two mirror-image communities at odds with each other</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But one of these two blocks is not sticking to the old template. Nationalism \u2013 if we can even call it that any more \u2013 is diversifying. And the strongest evidence of that is the fact that in the assembly elections Sinn F\u00e9in has taken its first reversal in its traditional heartlands of Derry and West Belfast. The party was outflanked on the left by People Before Profit, an anti-austerity party that has also put economic policy before ending partition.</p> <p>Elections in Northern Ireland are usually seen as effective plebiscites on the border. This is certainly how the largest unionist party, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/07/arlene-foster-northern-ireland-assembly-election-dup-stormont\" title=\"\">the DUP</a>, still sees them. And it consolidated its vote last week by holding up the threat of the further ascendancy of Sinn F\u00e9in, to the point at which the republicans might appoint the first minister.</p> <p>But it wasn\u2019t the DUP that held Sinn F\u00e9in back; it was thousands of people in its own communities \u2013 areas which are too lightly labelled nationalist and Catholic.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/belief/2016/apr/28/despite-the-murals-belfast-is-not-bethlehem-with-rain\">Despite the murals, Belfast is not Bethlehem with rain | Giles Fraser: Loose canon</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And Sinn F\u00e9in wasn\u2019t the only nationalist party to suffer. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/03/sdlp-fights-survival-sinn-fein-onslaught-northern-ireland\" title=\"\">SDLP lost seats</a> in both cities, too \u2013 and one of those, held by Fearghal McKinney, was fought over the question of whether abortion should be legalised. McKinney had allowed himself to be photographed beside strident anti-abortion campaigners \u2013 and paid for it.</p> <p>The issue had risen to unexpected relevance with the prosecution of a young woman who had self-administered abortion pills. Both Sinn F\u00e9in and the SDLP are now caught in a dilemma over this issue and stand to lose voters whichever way they move. They can placate the conservative Catholics by holding fast to \u201cpro-life\u201d positions and lose the newly secular liberals; or they can go with them, as the Green party did to its advantage, and lose the religious.</p> <p>Yet even among conservative Catholics who do want a united Ireland, some have put their moral causes before the constitutional question. In East Derry last week, a group of conservative Catholics campaigned for the DUP as the party most likely to resist abortion reform and the legalisation of same-sex marriage. Last year the Catholic church also supported DUP efforts to introduce a conscience clause allowing <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/20/gay-cake-ruling-equality-northern-ireland\" title=\"\">tradespeople to discriminate</a> against gay people.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/18/northern-ireland-gay-community-democratic-unionst-party-marriage-equality-tactical-voting\">Northern Ireland gay community mobilises against DUP candidates</a> </p> </aside>  <p>This election has signalled a change in the old model of two mirror-image communities at odds with each other, equally committed to their separate sovereignty claims. In short, for many nationalists, there are some things more important to them than getting rid of the border. Yet it can probably be said with confidence that there are fewer in the unionist/Protestant community who are as blase about the Union.</p> <p>Nationalism was already ahead of unionism in divesting itself of the religious input into its politics. Thirty years ago, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/gallery/2015/mar/04/belfast-murals-in-pictures\" title=\"\">murals </a>in nationalist areas showed hunger strikers praying in their cells with the Virgin Mary watching over them. Today that would be unthinkable.</p> <p>If the trend continues, of one community being far more concerned about the union than the other is about a united Ireland, a possible consequence will be that the solid phalanx of Protestant unionism will dominate the political scene while the more liberal, social and moral issues will divide the former Catholic/nationalists.</p> <p>And when the symmetry has gone, another big question arises. What of the Good Friday Agreement, framed to manage that symmetry? Will it still then be a viable constitution for Northern Ireland even as, within it, the region drifts back towards majority unionist rule?</p>",

      "body": "<p>Like a long-missed sun breaking through clouds after weeks of rain Jim Bolger has arrived with a serious Derby contender to clarify what had become a muddy Classic picture. Moonlight Magic was an emphatic winner of the Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial here on Sunday, giving his Godolphin owners a huge chance of a first success in the Epsom race.</p> <p>The pre-trial chatter at Leopardstown centred on Aidan O\u2019Brien and his four runners, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/05/derby-favourite-us-army-ranger-beats-stablemate-chester-vase\" title=\"\">O\u2019Brien having failed to produce a convincing Derby contender.</a> His Idaho was sent off favourite while Shogun, Ryan Moore\u2019s mount, also had his supporters.</p> <p>Moonlight Magic was allowed to start at 6-1 after a dismal 14-length defeat last month and there was widespread concern about the general health of the Bolger stable. While several of the trainer\u2019s horses had run with credit, he had been on a losing streak of 27 before bagging a Wexford maiden on Saturday.</p> <p>When the 74-year-old trainer won a Group Three early on this card it suggested the corner had been turned. An hour later his two runners took on O\u2019Brien\u2019s four in the trial and won the tactical battle hands down, Saafarr setting the pace with Moonlight Magic lying third until sweeping to the front in the home straight.</p> <p>Shogun and Idaho finished strongly to take the places, never getting closer than at the line, where the winner had only a length and a quarter in hand. But Moonlight Magic had this prize in his pocket some way from home and he is as likely as those behind to benefit from another quarter-mile at Epsom.</p> <p>So will he go? Kevin Manning, the winning jockey, indicated the colt might be \u201cmore of an Irish Derby type\u201d but that might have been the conservative response of a man who knows such decisions are not his to make.</p> <p>Bolger was initially playful, as is his wont, but eventually worked his way around to frank enthusiasm. \u201cI\u2019d have to discuss it with the Godolphin people and arrive at a consensus. But, if it were left to me, I\u2019d be very keen to go.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed Bolger said Moonlight Magic was \u201cvery classy\u201d and \u201ccertainly as good today as St Jovite was when he won the Derrinstown\u201d. St Jovite was only second at Epsom, in 1992, but hacked up in both the Irish Derby and Ascot\u2019s King George.</p> <p>Asked to explain Moonlight Magic\u2019s reappearance flop, Bolger said: \u201cHe didn\u2019t seem to fire and he was very quiet after it, so he just mightn\u2019t have been right. He wasn\u2019t at the top of his game and I hadn\u2019t caught it. I can be slow at times.\u201d</p> <p>Mischievous reporters invited Bolger to speak slightingly of this year\u2019s other Derby contenders but he has been to the circus before and dodged this custard pie. \u201cThey\u2019re good, they\u2019re good,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re always good for Epsom. Whatever wins it will be a good horse as usual. Don\u2019t you call it the best race in the world?</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re a pretty even bunch so far. I have to hold fire now until I see the Dante [at York on Thursday]. I wish I had a horse for it but I don\u2019t.\u201d</p> <p>Given that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/dec/22/godolphin-merges-racing-breeding-john-ferguson\" title=\"\">Godolphin have not exactly been regular winners of Derby trials,</a> it seems likely that Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s organisation will smile on the idea of a tilt at Epsom. But they may have a choice to make, or two runners to saddle, as their colours were also carried to victory in a French trial at Saint-Cloud by the Andre Fabr\u00e9-trained Cloth Of Stars, who would have to be supplemented for Epsom.</p> <p>Whether or not that one comes over, surely Moonlight Magic will turn up in a month\u2019s time. He is on offer at 16-1 but could reasonably be half those odds after such a convincing performance in an open year.</p> <p>The question now is what O\u2019Brien will send. Now that Godolphin, the longstanding rivals of his Coolmore employers, have a live runner, it must be more likely that he will consider running his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/01/minding-1000-guineas-derby-aidan-obrien-ryan-moore-newmarket-horse-racing\" title=\"\">star filly Minding</a> in an attempt to deny them a big moment of glory.</p> <p>Also in search of Classic glory, remarkably, is Kieren Fallon. The 51-year-old jockey scored here on Now Or Never and will be aboard the filly again in a fortnight\u2019s time when the pair try to land the Irish 1,000 Guineas, for which the bookies rate them 9-2 chances.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/22/midterm-passes-his-derby-trial-examination-at-sandown\">Midterm passes his Derby Trial examination at Sandown</a> </p> </aside>",

      "body": "<p>Pressure is mounting on the Scottish Labour leader, Kezia Dugdale, to push for Scotland to gain even more independence within the UK after the party\u2019s humiliating defeat in the Holyrood elections.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/06/how-bad-were-the-elections-from-a-labour-perspective\">What do Labour voters think of the party's election performance?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Anas Sarwar, Scottish Labour\u2019s former deputy leader, said their heavy defeat, coming third behind the Tories, was chiefly because the party failed to represent the hundreds of thousands of former Labour voters who were still focused on the country\u2019s future in the UK. </p> <p>Sarwar, who is expected to take a senior frontbench role after winning a Holyrood seat on Thursday, said finding a middle way between nationalism and unionism was the \u201cfundamental challenge\u201d still facing the party. </p> <p>He added: \u201cWe tried perhaps too early to move past the referendum. [I] don\u2019t think the electorate is there yet. People are still thinking about the yes or no question.\u201d</p> <p>Ruth Davidson, now the darling of the Tories for overseeing a Scottish Conservative renaissance after nearly two decades as a marginal force in Scottish politics, hinted on Sunday that she would consider joining a future Tory cabinet in London or even bidding to be prime minister.</p> <p>She told Andrew Neil on the BBC Sunday Politics programme it was still appropriate for a Scottish Tory MP to take a senior role in a UK cabinet despite the substantial devolution to Scotland of tax and law-making powers and new Westminster rules restricting votes on English-only legislation.</p> <p>Davidson said it was conceivable that an MP from a Scottish constituency could be prime minister. Labour had Scottish MPs as chancellor, UK transport secretary, home secretary and health secretary after Holyrood was set up.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/audio/2016/may/06/snp-win-historic-third-term-politics-weekly-podcast\">SNP win historic third term - Politics Weekly podcast</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Doing little to dampen speculation from many senior Tories, including David Cameron, the prime minister, that she is a future Tory MP, Davidson said: \u201cIn terms of all the big jobs, I think you will see another Scottish prime minister, or from Wales or from Northern Ireland. Talent will out.\u201d</p> <p>She claimed the Tories had deprived the SNP of a majority and had now killed off any realistic chance of a second referendum in the near future. </p> <p>\u201cThey have slipped back,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cPeak \u2018Nat\u2019 has now passed and [now] they don\u2019t have this clear majority, that takes the idea of a second referendum off the table for five years and gives Scotland the stability it requires.\u201d </p> <p>Nicola Sturgeon, who won 63 seats on Thursday, two short of the number needed for a majority, confirmed on Sunday she would press on with plans for a summer initiative by the SNP to reinvigorate the case for independence. </p> <p>But she said her priority was to govern \u201cin an inclusive way\u201d by finding agreements with other parties. Sturgeon will now focus on striking deals with the two minority parties, the Scottish Greens and Scottish Liberal Democrats, to push through her manifesto pledges and her budget.</p> <p>\u201cWhat I\u2019m not prepared to do, given the scale of the SNP\u2019s mandate in the election, is to allow opposition parties to undermine our ability to implement that manifesto,\u201d she said. </p> <p>Sarwar\u2019s intervention adds to growing pressure on Dugdale to agree that Scottish Labour should investigate home rule, a form of federal arrangement in which Holyrood has more control over taxation, welfare services and law-making. </p> <p>Under that model, Westminster would chiefly control foreign policy, defence and perhaps some major spending areas such as pensions.</p> <p>In an implied criticism of Dugdale\u2019s strategy of sidelining the constitutional question by putting a 50p tax rate for the rich at the centre of Labour\u2019s manifesto, Sarwar told BBC Sunday Politics his party had failed to find a clear cause on the constitution.</p> <p>The SNP had independence and the Scottish Tories, now Holyrood\u2019s second-largest party with 31 seats, had made hardline unionism its cause. But voters were not \u201cready and willing to listen to us\u201d because it had no clear cause of its own on Scotland\u2019s future in the UK. </p> <p>\u201cUp against the binary situation where we have unionism versus nationalism, that\u2019s a really difficult question for the Labour party,\u201d he said. \u201cThe reality is we are not comfortable nationalists and we are not comfortable unionists.\u201d</p> <p>Alex Rowley, the Scottish Labour deputy leader, openly called for the party to reexamine the case for home rule the day after the election; it is an idea broadly accepted by the UK Labour deputy leader, Tom Watson, and one backed by senior trade unionists in Scotland.</p> <p>Home rule is already Liberal Democrat policy, but Davidson has promised to strengthen the Tories\u2019 unionist credentials by starting a party summer campaign to defend the union.</p> <p>In further developments, several Labour MSPs are emerging as frontrunners to become Holyrood\u2019s presiding officer, the equivalent to the role of Speaker in the Commons. Despite establishing the devolved parliament, Labour has not yet had a presiding officer.</p> <p>The former leadership contender Ken Macintosh is expected to confirm his candidacy, with the former Scottish leader Johann Lamont also named as a likely contender. The Scottish Tories are likely to offer John Scott, a recent deputy presiding officer and close ally of Davidson, as their lead candidate.</p>",

He also worked freelance for the BBC World Service, reporting on earthquakes and revolutions all over Africa.</p> <p>On his return to Britain, he spent many years producing and presenting programmes for what is now BBC Radio 3, the most successful of which was <a href=\"http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/b79f9bcaddb140c4bd89ff75249d9b52\" title=\"\">Personality and Power</a>, in which Graham gathered high profile figures such as the historian <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/mar/15/lord-briggs-of-lewes-asa-briggs-obituary\" title=\"Asa Briggs obituary\">Asa Briggs</a>, the psychiatrist <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/mar/20/guardianobituaries.highereducation\" title=\"Anthony Storr obituary\">Anthony Storr</a>, the British fascist leader <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2009/apr/23/oswald-moseley-1934-archive\" title=\"Sir Oswald Mosley\">Sir Oswald Mosley</a> and the Conservative historian<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2003/sep/23/guardianobituaries.books\" title=\"Lord Blake of Braydeston obituary\"> Lord Blake</a> to discuss the processes by which politicians achieve power.</p> <p>Graham\u2019s infectious love of music and his unflagging energy meant that he was a force behind a significant amount of London jazz in the 1970s and 80s. One of his main contributions was to run for many years a well-known pub jazz session at the <a href=\"http://www.sandybrownjazz.co.uk/forumnewmerlinscave.html\" title=\"\">New Merlin\u2019s Cave</a> in Islington, north London, where the resident band led by well-known musicians such as Bruce Turner, Wally Fawkes and John Barnes drew big crowds.</p> <p>The Crouch End All Stars also had a following. <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-john-wain-1438370.html\" title=\"John Wain obituary\">John Wain</a>, the poet, critic and jazz lover, commented: \u201cAs the evening goes on \u2026 either individual soloists or the whole group suddenly take off into that timeless dimension of excitement and invention that is jazz.\u201d</p> <p>Graham wrote poetry all his life and published a volume, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/jun/17/1\" title=\"Guardian review of Not Too Late for Loving: A Lifetime of Occasional Verse (2000)\">Not Too Late for Loving: A Lifetime of Occasional Verse (2000)</a>, which he would try to sell to every unsuspecting person he met. His poetry was described by the Guardian as \u201cpersonal lyrics that remind one of Hardy and Housman \u2026 his work is effective, often moving\u201d.</p> <p>He is survived by his wife, Catherine; by his children Penny, Imogen and me from two previous marriages; by his five grandchildren, Laura, Jethro, Atticus, Pearl and Erik; and by his brother, Clifford.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-09T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Fifteen years ago I took an idea for a new documentary series to Channel 4 hoping they would give me a chance. I\u2019d had some early success with three series of Naked Chef on the BBC but I felt it was time for a new challenge. I wanted to push myself and I needed a broadcaster that would challenge me. That\u2019s where C4 came in. I went to them asking whether they would take a punt on a documentary series where there was only a small chance of a successful result. To be honest, they pushed me more than I was expecting because they wanted authentic, warts-and-all television and not just \u201cthe Naked Chef opens a restaurant\u201d.</p> <p>They were absolutely right to do that, and I truly don\u2019t think I would be the man I am now had it not been for that key decision. And that, to me, is the C4 way: brave, risk-taking, demanding \u2013 but also nurturing, dynamic and caring.</p> <p>It\u2019s been 15 years since we started filming Jamie\u2019s Kitchen, which led to the Fifteen restaurant in London and we\u2019re all still here \u2013 me, C4 and Fifteen \u2013 all doing well, all still shaking things up, all taking risks and reaping the rewards. C4 is now almost 35 years old, but to me it still maintains that edginess it had on day one.</p> <p>And, of course, we\u2019ve made series and specials that have launched campaigns and changed government policy. Together, Channel 4 and I have created real change. </p> <p>Channel 4 is a terrific platform for reaching millions of smart, well-informed and vocal viewers. Its people are not afraid to take risks and as a result they get a lot of flak \u2013 and so do I \u2013 for some of the programmes we make together. But they keep the faith in me and I keep the faith in them, whether it\u2019s for a series on endangered fish species or the crazy thing we make with Jimmy Doherty on the end of Southend Pier, Friday Night Feasts. Channel 4 is as comfortable being playful as it is being provocative. </p> <p>Most importantly, I guess that for the past 15 years it\u2019s felt like home. The people at Channel 4 have been nurturing, encouraging, caring, and when I say \u201cpeople\u201d, I mean everyone from the top down.

      "body": "<p><strong>Name:</strong> Brooklyn Beckham.</p> <p><strong>Age:</strong> 17.</p> <p><strong>Appearance:</strong> Backwards-hatted Uber XL driver.</p> <p><strong>Brooklyn Beckham can drive?</strong> Well, he has a car anyway.</p> <p><strong>Some old banger to practise in before his test, I guess. </strong>Sort of. He has been spotted behind the wheel of a brand-new Mercedes C-Class (which cost upwards of \u00a329,000), with what appears to be a driving instructor in the passenger seat.</p> <p><strong>Do his parents know that most instructors come with their own cars? </strong>Probably, but they have their brand to think of: Brand Beckham.</p> <p><strong>Shiny, sleek, unbesmirched by BSM\u2019s intrusive logo? </strong>Nor, it would seem, by L-plates. The Merc had a <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-3574751/Brooklyn-Beckham-puts-L-plates-plush-37k-car-illegally-displaying-just-one.html\">discreet L on the back</a>, but not on the front.</p> <p><strong>Of course not. A Mercedes C-Class with an L-plate slapped on the bonnet? How uncool would that look? </strong>Way uncool, but without it one faces a \u00a360 penalty.</p> <p><strong>\u00a329,000 for the car, plus \u00a360 for the fine \u2013 it all adds up. </strong>Yes, it does. According to <a href=\"http://www.gocompare.com/\">GoCompare</a>, insuring a car that expensive for a kid that young would cost \u00a35,326 a year.</p> <p><strong>Being spoiled, turning a steering wheel \u2013 is there no end to young Brooklyn\u2019s talents? </strong>He\u2019s also a professional fashion photographer.</p> <p><strong>Is he now?</strong> Technically, yes. He was selected to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/jan/30/sheer-nepotism-brooklyn-beckham-burberry-shoot-angers-photographers\">shoot Burberry\u2019s most recent fragrance campaign earlier this year</a>.</p> <p><strong>Why would a top fashion house hire an inexperienced 17-year-old boy to photograph one of its major campaigns? </strong>Maybe he owns a really posh camera. Or it could be because he\u2019s celebrity royalty and has <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/brooklynbeckham/?hl=en\">6.8 million Instagram followers</a>.</p> <p><strong>Wow. I\u2019ll bet that\u2019s more than the number of people who watched the Queen\u2019s Christmas speech. </strong>An odd comparison, but let me just check that for you \u2026 No, you\u2019re wrong there \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/12069640/Downton-Abbey-tops-Christmas-Day-TV-ratings.html\">7.5 million people watched the Queen\u2019s speech</a> last Christmas.</p> <p><strong>But they would probably be all old, and not very interested in Burberry\u2019s hip new fragrances. Not that Burberry could advertise on the BBC anyway. </strong>As I said, an odd comparison.</p> <p><strong>I suppose the Queen could have a bottle of perfume on her desk, but she doesn\u2019t seem like the type to go in for product placement. </strong>No. Hiring the children of famous people as fashion photographers is almost certainly the future of advertising.</p> <p><strong>Do say:</strong> \u201cMirror, signal, manoeuvre.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Don\u2019t say:</strong> \u201cMirror, pout, click, post.\u201d</p>",

The figures, which came from compiling and cross-checking data from global institutions including the International Monetary Fund and the United Nations, follow the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/series/panama-papers\">Panama Papers</a> revelations of global, systemic tax avoidance.</p> <p>Chinese citizens have $1.2tn stashed away in tax havens, once estimates for Hong Kong and Macau are included. Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia \u2013 all of which have seen high-profile corruption scandals in recent years \u2013 also come high on the list of the worst-affected countries.</p> <p>Henry, a former chief economist at consultancy McKinsey, told the Guardian his research underlined the fact that tax-dodging was not the only motivation for using tax havens \u2013 criminals and kleptocrats also made prolific use of their services to keep their wealth secret and their money safe. </p> <p>He said the list of users of offshore jurisdictions was like the cantina scene in Star Wars, where a motley group of unsavoury intergalactic characters is assembled. Henry said: \u201cIt\u2019s like the Star Wars scene: you have the tax dodgers in one corner, the arms dealers in another, the kleptocrats over here. There\u2019s also those using tax havens for money laundering, or fraud.\u201d</p> <p>Oil-rich countries including Nigeria and Angola feature as key sources of offshore funds, the research finds, as do Brazil and Argentina. Henry said the owners of this hidden capital were often so keen to secure secrecy and avoid their wealth being appropriated back home, that they were willing to accept paltry financial returns rather than investing it in ways that might promote economic development. Charging just 1% tax on this mountain of offshore wealth would yield more than $120bn a year, almost equivalent to the entire $131bn global aid budget.</p> <p>The TJN is urging Cameron to push for agreement on a series of issues at anti-corruption summit on Thursday, including a tougher crackdown on the banks, lawyers and other professionals who facilitate financial secrecy and an obligation on all politicians to make their personal financial situation transparent.</p> <p>The project is an update, for developing countries, on 2012 research which showed that, worldwide, more than $20tn was stashed away offshore. Henry said the number of tax havens had continued to increase over the period he studied, despite growing public pressure for action. On average, he said, the offshore capital belonging to developing countries had increased at 8% a year since 2010; 9% a year for China and Russia, perhaps because of fears of economic and political instability. \u201cPeople are voting with their feet,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The prime minister <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/10/david-cameron-tax-affairs-what-figures-show\">published a summary of his tax affairs</a> last month, after the Panama Papers leaks revealed that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/2016/apr/04/panama-papers-david-cameron-father-tax-bahamas\">his father had set up an investment fund, Blairmore</a>, based in the offshore jurisdiction of Panama.</p> <p>Henry argued that when senior figures in authoritarian states such as China use tax havens to guard their money safely, they were effectively free-riding on the legal and financial systems of other countries. \u201cAll of these felons and kleptocrats are, in a way, essentially dependent on the rule of law when it comes to protecting their money,\u201d he said.</p> <p>He said it was not just exotic locations such as the Cayman Islands where money could effectively be hidden, but also some US states, such as Delaware, where it is possible for foreign investors to start up and run a company without making clear its ultimate ownership \u2013 something all UK firms will have to do from later this year.</p>",

It is hard to see how EDF can sign off any final investment decision whilst the government has yet to resolve this important issue.\u201d</p> <p>But the Department of Energy and Climate Change said it was convinced that the government had done all it had to do.</p> <p>\u201cCompliance with international obligations is something we take very seriously,\u201d said a spokesman. </p> <p>\u201cWe are confident that we have met the relevant international requirements in relation to Hinkley Point C. We have world-leading nuclear safety regulations in the UK, which Hinkley Point C would have to comply with.\u201d</p> <p> The British courts have in the past ruled against <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/19/irish-charity-legal-challenge-hinkley-nuclear-plant\">An Taisce (the Irish National Trust) which tried to block Hinkley on the grounds of insufficient consultation</a> over the same safety issues. Dorfman said he expected a new legal challenge using the UN ruling.</p> <p>The British government has been arguing for some years with continental countries inside the committee, saying in the past that it did not have to consult them because there was little or no likelihood of \u201csignificant transboundary environmental impacts\u201d.<br /></p> <p>But Austria in particular has said that there should have been consultation because of the possibility of a severe accident that could lead to radioactive materials being spread by wind across Europe.</p> <p>The Netherlands, Norway and Ireland have also argued they should have been consulted about Hinkley; the committee has finally agreed with them. </p> <p>It recommends the UK \u201center into discussions with possibly affected parties, including parties that cannot exclude a significant adverse transboundary impact from the activity at HPC, in order to agree on whether notification is useful at the current stage.\u201d</p> <p>Nuclear safety has been back in the public eye with the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/26/chernobyl-nuclear-disaster-ukraine-marks-30th-anniversary\">30th anniversary of the Chernobyl </a>accident last month and the recent <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/11/japan-fifth-anniversary-tsunami-nuclear-disaster\">fifth anniversary of the Fukushima crisis</a> in March remembered. </p> <p>Hinkley is the first new atomic plant planned in the UK for two decades and is a flagship project promoted at the very highest level of government. But confidence has been undermined by a range of problems.</p> <p>Last week former EDF finance director Thomas Piquemal <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-edf-nuclear-britain-idUKKCN0XV0UX\">told a French parliamentary hearing that he had resigned in March because he believed Hinkley threatened the financial health of the energy company. </a></p> <p>\u201cWho would bet 60 to 70% of his equity on a (European pressurised reactor) technology that has not yet proven that it can work and which takes 10 years to build,\u201d he said.</p> <p>\u201cIn January 2015, I proposed to negotiate a three-year delay with our client because we reasoned that it would weigh too heavily on EDF\u2019s balance sheet,\u201d Piquemal said. </p> <p>Since Piquemal\u2019s resignation, EDF has announced a \u20ac4bn (\u00a33.2bn) capital increase and the government has agreed to forego cash dividends for two years, generating an estimated \u20ac7bn in extra capital.</p> <p>But while EDF has been coming up with plans to strengthen its capital, its even more financially troubled engineering partner, Areva, has run into deeper problems and its share price is now nearly 50% below where it was 12 months ago.</p> <p>The French nuclear regulator, ASN, said it had been informed by Areva that its investigation had found evidence of irregularities in about <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/areva-nuclear-creusot-idUSL5N1805WY\">400 components produced since 1965, of which some 50 are believed to be in use in French nuclear plants.</a> </p> <p>Areva, which is in the middle of a merger with EDF, has already found faults at a new reactor it is constructing at Flamanville in Normandy. That scheme, like another at Olkiluoto in Finland, is using an EPR like the one planned for Hinkley and is both massively delayed and over budget.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Not for the first time in recent weeks, Mauricio Pochettino was left to bemoan Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s inability to close the door on their opponents. The consequence is that they have left it open for their rivals, Arsenal, to give this crazy season yet another twist.</p> <p>Two weeks ago, Tottenham were in a two-horse race with Leicester City to finish on top of the Premier League but after this defeat by a Steven Davis-inspired Southampton, which followed draws with West Bromwich Albion and Chelsea, they could yet finish in third.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/08/manchester-city-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\">S\u00e1nchez goal for Arsenal takes Manchester City\u2019s fate out of their hands</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It would be a ridiculous finale to what has been a season of high achievement at White Hart Lane but that is what will happen if and when Arsenal beat Aston Villa at home and Tottenham were to lose at Newcastle United in the final round of fixtures next Sunday.</p> <p>There is not, in general terms, a massive amount of difference between coming in second rather than third. Both places come with the guarantee of qualification to the Champions League group stage. But this is Tottenham and Arsenal. And Tottenham have not finished above their rivals since 1994-95.</p> <p>For the third game in succession, Tottenham squandered the lead and the manner of both concessions to Davis were alarming from their point of view. Pochettino described them as \u201cvery soft\u201d and there could be questions asked of Hugo Lloris, the Tottenham goalkeeper.</p> <p>On the first, the Frenchman was slow to react when Davis diverted Dusan Tadic\u2019s cross goalwards \u2013 the ball squirming home \u2013 and for the winner, he could not get across to keep out the Southampton midfielder\u2019s low shot through a crowd. Lloris might have seen that one late. Davis had arrived with two goals all season for Southampton but, having doubled his tally, he kept his club on course for the Europa League qualification that they desire.</p> <p>Pochettino said that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/tottenham-arsenal-mauricio-pochettino-premier-league\" title=\"\">he did not care about Arsenal</a> and his focus was purely on his team. If they took care of their side, he added, they could aspire to finishing above everyone, and not just Arsenal. The preoccupation with their neighbours was a waste of energy. But, with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/08/manchester-city-arsenal-premier-league-match-report\" title=\"\">Arsenal having drawn at Manchester City</a> later in the day, it is a fair bet that there will be Tottenham nerves at Newcastle.</p> <p>Tottenham were fast and aggressive in the first half, and they might have been in front at the interval. Their goal came when Son Heung-min ran around Fraser Forster before jinking inside two challenges and tapping home. Forster had hesitated when Erik Lamela played the ball into the area because Harry Kane had been in an offside position. It went down as Lamela\u2019s ninth assist of the league season and Son\u2019s fourth goal. The \u00a322m signing from Bayer Leverkusen has eight in all competitions.</p> <p>Tottenham had a number of first\u2011half chances, with Kane being denied by Forster at close quarters with the best of them, having robbed Jos\u00e9 Fonte. Forster also saved smartly from Christian Eriksen early on. But Southampton, who have now won six in eight matches, had theirs, too.</p> <p>They might have taken the lead only for Tadic to blast low beyond the far post, with Davis unmarked in the middle and the equaliser followed trademark slick approach work. Taking Cuco Marina\u2019s floated ball, Tadic slipped a low cross over for Davis and his first-time finish deceived Lloris. Tottenham were unhappy that the play was not stopped for an injury to Kyle Walker.</p> <p>Southampton looked dangerous on the counter-attack, with the pace of Sadio Man\u00e9 and Shane Long, and the composure and drive of Davis. Even when Man\u00e9 went off in the 65th minute \u2013 he had taken a heavy knock from Lamela towards the end of the first half \u2013 his replacement, Graziano Pell\u00e8, posed a physical and aerial threat.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/tottenham-arsenal-mauricio-pochettino-premier-league\">Tottenham not interested in topping Arsenal, says Mauricio Pochettino</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The second half was less frenetic, with the space much tighter and the chances fewer. Perhaps the heat was a factor \u2013 there needed to be a drinks break in the 68th minute. Southampton clicked in a defensive sense and they came to call the tune. Long headed off target when well placed from Tadic\u2019s cross on 54 minutes and Davis\u2019s second came when he swapped passes with Tadic and moved inside from the left of the area.</p> <p>Confronted by Eric Dier, he continued to skate to the right before he unloaded a shot for the far, bottom corner. It seemed to take an age to get there, through the crowd of bodies but when it did, he and Southampton could celebrate.</p> <p>Koeman had a compliment for Tottenham. \u201cFootball-wise and in terms of ball possession, they are the best team in the Premier League,\u201d he said. But they failed to turn up in the second-half, which was curious after their positive first-half showing.</p> <p>There was no spark or incision to their play and, when Forster blocked from the substitute, Nacer Chadli, in stoppage time, Southampton knew it would be their day. \u201cWe spoke about it being a special season last season,\u201d Koeman said. \u201cBut this one could be even more special.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Man of the match</strong> S Davis (Southampton)</p>",

But in his speech after the Kabul attack, he called parts of the Taliban \u201cthe enemy\u201d, a sharp change in rhetoric, and said not all Taliban factions were welcome in negotiations.</p> <p>Ghani\u2019s deputy spokesman, Dawa Khan Menapal, denied that the peace process had been a factor in deciding Sunday\u2019s executions. \u201cIf they want to talk with us, we are ready. If they want to continue the war, we are ready to fight,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Thomas Ruttig, co-director of the Afghanistan Analysts Network, said the executions helped perpetuate \u201ca cycle of revenge\u201d, making peace talks difficult. \u201cThis tit-for-tat is absolutely unhelpful,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Though capital punishment is inscribed in Afghan law, executions are rare. Sunday\u2019s executions were the first since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/08/afghanistan-executes-five-men-gang-rape\">five alleged gang rapists were hanged in October 2014</a> after a controversially swift trial and public pressure on Ghani to stay the executions.</p>",

Securing two concerts from <a href=\"https://www.ensemble-modern.com/en\">Ensemble Modern</a> was a major coup for <a href=\"http://katemolleson.com/preview-plug-2016/\">Plug, a student festival</a> whose usual raison d\u2019etre is to test out trials and errors of trainee composers at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. The festival turned 10 this year and invited <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/18/ensemble-modern-review-jorge-rotter-brahms-wigmore-hall-london\">Frankfurt\u2019s contemporary music specialists</a> for some celebratory clout.

So far, so good.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/mar/18/ensemble-modern-review-jorge-rotter-brahms-wigmore-hall-london\">Ensemble Modern review \u2013 string theory and Brahms reconstructed</a> </p> </aside>  <p> But this closing concert was a billing called Ensemble Modern Does Ensemble Modern \u2013 which translated to nothing very substantial. Why didn\u2019t they dazzle us with a contemporary masterpiece? Something bold and mind-expanding to leave the students (and the rest of us) awed and inspired and chomping at the compositional bit? Instead, we got obscure snippets of repertoire from the past century in various configurations of wind, brass, piano and percussion \u2013 presumably the musicians available for the Scotland trip, given that another portion of the ensemble was simultaneously playing opera in Germany. At least it was a lesson in pragmatic programming.</p> <p> It would be churlish to complain too much, given the superb musicianship of Ensemble Modern\u2019s players. What was inspiring was their absolute commitment to every score, their energy and agility and efficiency. Even the body language said it: they opened each piece with the alertness of athletes in starting blocks. A composer in the audience noted afterwards that it was like listening to period performance, because this group will find the precise attack and colour for any niche corner of the contemporary music repertoire.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"20144ab8c9ae898d9890f4fbd1d4b1fd7cd5136d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20144ab8c9ae898d9890f4fbd1d4b1fd7cd5136d/0_274_4131_2478/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Heinz Holliger\u2019s Quintet for Piano featured furious winds and fistfuls of chords.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Heinz Holliger\u2019s Quintet for Piano featured furious winds and fistfuls of chords.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Priska Ketterer Luzern</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>So in two jaggedy works by the Greek composer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/sep/19/classicalmusicandopera3\">Nikos Skalkottas</a> (his first and second quartets, both from the early 1940s), we got a deliciously thick oboe sound, a poised bassoon, a flighty trumpet \u2013 imagine Poulenc with snarlier chords or Hindemith with weirder logic.

Our modern notions of Love are inextricably linked to a notion of Romanticism. We are addicted to the process of falling in Love and fail to pay attention to the Act of being in Love. Thank God you\u2019ve got me to point it out.</em></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/apr/28/the-course-of-love-alain-de-botton-review\">The Course of Love by Alain de Botton review \u2013 affairs, childcare and Ikea glassware</a> </p> </aside>  <p>After dating one another for six months, Rabih unexpectedly finds himself proposing to Kirsten. After just a moment\u2019s deliberation, Kirsten accepts and so they get married. Were they to have been gifted with the insight of an emotionally complete colossus they might have realised that we are frequently attracted to each other for complex reasons. Rabih was looking for the mother who died when he was 10; Kirsten was looking for the father who walked out on his family when she was 10. But as they didn\u2019t realise this, they started to quarrel and blame each other for things that weren\u2019t the other\u2019s fault.</p> <p><em>Love</em> <em>requires people to be both good listeners and good communicators. While we might hope that Love could be effortlessly explained in the poetry of the Romantics, the reality is that it is more easily expressed through a nice chat and a cup of tea. If that doesn\u2019t work, a night in a Premier Inn, where a \u2018Good Night\u2019s Sleep is Guaranteed\u2019 should do the trick. Whatever you do, try not to sulk like Rabih and Kirsten.</em></p> <p>As Rabih and Kirsten get closer to each other, they start to share their sexual fantasies. Kirsten tells Rabih she likes to have her hair pulled when they make love and he finds this difficult as he does not want to hurt her. Encouraged by the level of trust developing between them, Rabih says he would quite like them to have a threesome with the waitress from the cafe who has indicated to him she would be well up for it. Rabih cannot understand why this goes down like a cup of cold sick with Kirsten.</p> <p><em>Only in Romantic love does the girl automatically agree to a threesome. In True de Bottonian Love, some fantasies are best kept to yourself.</em></p> <p>Rabih and Kirsten continue to experience difficulties as they fail to deal with their transference issues. Both blame the other for not nurturing their child within and as a result they act out their insecurities. Some marriages collapse at this point, but Rabih and Kirsten are subconsciously aware that part of being in Real, rather than Romantic Love, is that it is OK to be together because they are frightened of being apart. They decide to have two children, Esther and William. They are both desperate for their children not to suffer the emotional damage that they suffered as children, but as they are not even aware of how much damage there is, some of it gets passed on anyway. They both get tired, believe the other to be doing less to help and start using the children as weapons against the other.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/live/2016/apr/25/alain-de-botton-webchat-the-course-of-love\">Alain de Botton \u2013 your questions answered, on art, God and ugliness</a> </p> </aside>  <p><em>Triangulation is a very dangerous process. It leads people to say indirectly those things that should be directly expressed. In some cases this can lead to one partner having an affair</em>.</p> <p>Rabih is no longer sure if he is a walking cliche as he has come to believe that Kirsten does not understand him. He has a one night stand with an American woman who appears to understand him extremely well but in the morning he does feel guilty. He can\u2019t believe he has fallen prey to narcissistic Romanticism and wonders if he should tell Kirsten. On balance, he decides against it.</p> <p><em>An affair can be an expression of how much one loves one\u2019s partner and not merely a sign that a relationship is on the rocks. What Rabih needs to do is to find a way to reconnect with Kirsten without acting out self-destructively.</em></p> <p>Rabih and Kirsten decide they need help and choose Alain de Botton as their therapist. Alain is able to show them how to relate to one another and find the Path of Love. Rabih and Kirsten are both overjoyed that they have learned how to deal with their issues and live happily enough ever after.</p> <p><strong>Digested read, digested:</strong> The Consolations of Therapy<br /></p>",

Because these tops still have cachet. We\u2019ve got over calling them <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/may/27/how-to-wear-the-bardot-the-summers-most-unexpectedly-flattering-trend\">Bardot tops</a> now (bit of a stretch, wasn\u2019t it?), but their usefulness has given them longevity. Bare shoulders say summer and don\u2019t make grownups panic about their upper arms. Ditto the so-called cold-shoulder tops that are also everywhere. If naked shoulders feels too louche for an air-conditioned office, note that slinging a cashmere sweater over your shoulders like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/24/jeremy-irons-have-natural-tendency-benign-dictator-batman-v-superman\">Jeremy Irons</a> is totally acceptable.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f53f33ab196a0cf5ec55c9beeb85ff781eb4dfb3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f53f33ab196a0cf5ec55c9beeb85ff781eb4dfb3/0_0_3280_4875/673.jpg\" alt=\"Keep cool with Chlo\u00e9 \u2026 off the shoulder for SS16\" width=\"673\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Keep cool with Chlo\u00e9 \u2026 off the shoulder for SS16.<br></span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>2<br />Roll up your sleeves<br /></h2> <p>It\u2019s quite Jackie O on the Cape, isn\u2019t it? If you get it right, it can be. Most women can\u2019t pull off a kaftan top outside of a brochure featuring sand dunes, beach huts and blond children. But most women have a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2015/aug/18/summer-blouses-10-best-in-pictures\">relaxed shirt</a> that they can summer up. Denim is good; pale blue is good; white works. Unbutton it down to the breastbone, wear jewellery and get the rolling right. Below or on the elbow is a little beta, above the elbow and you\u2019re comfortably in Jackie O territory.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2014/dec/10/how-to-wear-black-and-not-look-boring\">How to wear black and not look boring</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>3<br />Try <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/fashion-blog/2014/dec/10/how-to-wear-black-and-not-look-boring\">not to wear black</a><br /></h2> <p>It rarely looks like a sun-ready look. But if you do, go for it and wear a big and upbeat earring. No apologies for the fashion singular, a lot of the hack is in the way you sell it to yourself.</p> <h2>4<br />Work the margins<br /></h2> <p>Make everything about your outfit incrementally more summery. Wear your hair loose, wear sunglasses, turn up a trouser hem and, most importantly, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jun/16/should-i-go-without-socks\">ditch the socks</a>. Even wearing white tennis trainers or Vans without socks is a move towards summer.</p> <h2>5<br />Take a hard look at last summer\u2019s shoes<br /></h2> <p>Do you have a pair of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/gallery/2014/apr/11/fifty-best-flat-sandals-in-pictures\">leather gladiator sandals</a>? They\u2019ll work for another summer, won\u2019t they? Sorry, no. Absolutely not. Ditto the flip-flops that you think are so functional and anodyne they couldn\u2019t possibly offend. Hate to be the wardrobe Cassandra here, but flip-flops are style suicide. The good news is that sliders are hot, and available on every high street and corrugated retail park in the land. Wear with breezy jogging bottoms, cropped trousers or a long skirt.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"964ad6388c440768f33dd8b991423e0c384243c0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/964ad6388c440768f33dd8b991423e0c384243c0/0_0_915_914/500.jpg\" alt=\"Fenty x Puma with Rihanna\" width=\"500\" height=\"499\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Out with flip-flops, in with sliders \u2026 Fenty x Puma with Rihanna.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Instagram</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>6<br />Log on to &amp; Other Stories<br /></h2> <p>And buy a below-the-knee skirt. The website has the best selection of midi skirts in the land \u2013 printed, pleated, plain or structured. Not too many to confuse, but enough for everyone to find something they like.</p> <h2>7<br />Mess about with camisoles and slip dresses<br /></h2> <p>They are summery and light and semaphore that you got the sunshine memo. You probably have something like this in your wardrobe. Wear a T-shirt under a slip dress \u2013 looks right and swerves the whole <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2015/dec/18/peekaboo-how-underwear-as-outerwear-went-haute\">bra-on-display issue</a>. Or for those brave enough to stand up to this summer ambush and laugh in its meteorological face: wear a camisole over a shirt.

The Swedes have got nice neighbours\u201d); and the Portuguese, who mock Spanish arrogance (\u201cIn a recent survey, 11 out of 10 Spaniards said they felt superior to the others\u201d).</p> <p>There are the Irish, who joke about buttoned-up Brits (\u201cWhat\u2019s the English definition of a thrill? Having an After Eight at 7.30\u201d); and the Poles, who have a go at the Germans for pretty much anything (\u201cGerman footballers are like German food: if they\u2019re not imported from Poland they\u2019re no good\u201d).</p> <p>Making fun of our best enemies, said Romain Seignovert, who has just published a book on the jokes Europeans tell about their neighbours, is a great European tradition. \u201cWe are a big, diverse community with a centuries-long common history of highs and lows, and our humour reflects that,\u201d he says.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"aea3e955358cb5b9d6942100294e94005c5ff5ae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aea3e955358cb5b9d6942100294e94005c5ff5ae/0_138_5079_3047/1000.jpg\" alt=\"After Eight mints\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">After Eight mints: be a devil, have one before supper!</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>De Qui Se Moque-t-On (Who do we make fun of?) features 345 jokes, many contributed by readers of Seignovert\u2019s blog, <a href=\"https://europeisnotdead.com/\">Europeisnotdead</a>. A 29-year-old Frenchman who studied in Spain and Germany and now lives in Brussels, Seignovert said the jokes underlined the adage that \u201cteasing is a sign of affection. Some of them are pretty crude and unsubtle, but they\u2019re rarely downright nasty\u201d.</p> <p>Thus the Estonians laugh at the hopelessly shy Finns (\u201cHow do you tell an extrovert Finn? It\u2019s your shoes he\u2019s looking at, not his\u201d). The Macedonians giggle at the (lack of) machismo of Greek men: \u201cIf you knew how to cook and clean,\u201d says a Greek husband to his wife, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t need a maid.\u201d \u201cIf you knew how to make love,\u201d replies the wife, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t need a Macedonian lover.\u201d</p> <p>The only exception are the Italians, who rather endearingly make jokes mainly about themselves: \u201cYour wife cracked such a good joke the other day, I almost fell out of bed.\u201d \u201cNotice on an Italian bus: don\u2019t talk to the driver, he needs his hands.\u201d</p> <p>Otherwise, though, the Belgians love nothing better than teasing the penny-pinching Dutch: (\u201cHow do all Dutch recipes begin? Borrow six eggs, 200g of flour, half a litre of milk \u2026\u201d or \u201cWhy do the Dutch make so many jokes about the Belgians? Because they\u2019re cheap\u201d) </p> <p>And pretty much all their neighbours finds the Belgians a tiny bit slow: \u201cWhy do Belgians have <em>pommes frites</em>, while the Arab world has oil? Because the Belgians got to choose first.\u201d And \u201cWhat do Belgian mothers do when the baby\u2019s bathwater is too hot? Put on a pair of gloves.\u201d</p> <p>There is a deeper point. Ultimately, Seignovert said, laughing at our neighbours is \u201crecognising, even celebrating, our particularities. It shows we\u2019re not indifferent. Europe isn\u2019t just political and economic, it\u2019s also cultural \u2013 about all these nations, living together. The EU hasn\u2019t made enough of that.\u201d</p> <p>That may be true. But Seignovert, remember, is French, so what he says should clearly not be taken too seriously. In the words of one particularly fine Belgian quip: \u201cHow does a Frenchman commit suicide? By shooting 15cm above his head, right in the middle of his superiority complex.\u201d</p> <h2>Them and us: more cross-border barbs from Seignovert</h2> <h2><strong><br /></strong></h2> <p><strong>Other Brits on the (tight-fisted) Scots:</strong></p> <p>An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman are planning a party. \u201cI\u2019ll bring six pints of bitter,\u201d says the Englishman. \u201cI\u2019ll bring six pints of Guinness,\u201d says the Irishman. \u201cI\u2019ll bring six friends,\u201d says the Scot.<br /></p> <p><strong>The Belgians on the (parsimonious) Dutch:</strong></p> <p>Dutch husband to Dutch wife: \u201cPut your coat on, dear.\u201d \u201cWhy, darling, are we going out?\u201d \u201cNo, I am. So I\u2019ll just turn the heating off.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The Portuguese on the (supercilious) Spanish:</strong></p> <p>\u201cDad,\u201d says a Spanish boy to his father, \u201cwhen I\u2019m grown up I want to be just like you.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s nice, son. Why?\u201d \u201cSo I can have a son like me!\u201d</p> <p><strong>The Italians on themselves:</strong></p> <p>Three reasons Jesus is an Italian: only an Italian son would live with his mama till he was 30. Only an Italian son could think his mama was still a virgin. Only an Italian mama could think her son was God.</p> <p><strong>The Belgians on the (arrogant) French:</strong></p> <p>Why did the French choose the cockerel as their national symbol? Because it\u2019s the only animal that sings when it\u2019s knee-deep in shit.</p> <p><strong>The Swedes on the (dim-witted) Norwegians:</strong></p> <p>Why do Norwegians have such greasy hair? They\u2019ve let their oil go to their heads.</p> <p><strong>The Danes on the (overbearing) Swedes:</strong></p> <p>What\u2019s the best ever thing to have come to us from Sweden? An empty ferry.</p> <p><strong>The Estonians on the (hard-drinking) Finns:</strong></p> <p>Two Finns meet up for the first time in years. \u201cSo how are you?\u201d asks Pekka. Ahti grunts and orders a beer. \u201cAnd how\u2019s the family?\u201d asks Pekka. Ahti grunts and orders another beer. \u201cAnd how\u2019s work?\u201d asks Pekka, three pints later. \u201cLook,\u201d says Ahti, \u201cdid we come here to drink, or to talk?\u201d</p> <p><strong>The Germans on the (thieving) Poles:</strong></p> <p>When is it Christmas in Poland? Two days after Christmas in Germany.</p> <p><strong>The Swiss on the (not very bright) Austrians:</strong></p> <p>Why is the Austrian flag red-white-red? So they don\u2019t get too confused when they hoist it.</p> <p><strong>The Austrians on the (boring) Germans:</strong> </p> <p>The main difference between Austrians and the Germans is that Germans would like to understand Austrians but can\u2019t, and Austrians understand Germans but would rather not.</p> <p><strong>The Slovaks on the (despised) Czechs:</strong> </p> <p>What does a Czech need to be happy? Not much, as long as everyone else has got less.</p> <p><strong>The Romanians on the (mean-spirited) Hungarians:</strong></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve had all the tests, and the doctor tells me there\u2019s no question, I\u2019m xenophobic. That\u2019s another bloody illness the Hungarians have given me.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The Ukrainians on the (filthy rich but stupid) Russians:</strong></p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve just bought a tie for $3,000.\u201d \u201cIdiot! You could have bought the same one just down the street for $5,000.\u201d</p> <p><strong>The Macedonians on the (corrupt) Greeks:</strong></p> <p>A Greek motorist parks his car outside the parliament in Athens. \u201cYou can\u2019t park here,\u201d says the cop. \u201cThis is where our politicians work.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s OK,\u201d says the motorist. \u201cIt\u2019s fitted with an alarm.\u201d</p>",

Without it, he \u2013 like tens of thousands of other Britons \u2013 would be unaware of new rules blocking tourists without a biometric passport from visiting the US. </p> <p>A friend of Darch, who is a digital marketing manager at upmarket paint company Farrow &amp; Ball, asked on Thursday night if he had an e-passport after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/05/britons-flying-to-us-without-biometric-passports-could-be-turned-away\">reading stories about the changes</a>. Upon checking, he realised he still had one of the old-style documents that lack an electronic chip \u2013 prompting a panicked dash across the country to the nearest passport office. The trip is likely to be mimicked by thousands more as the summer holiday season approaches. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/may/05/britons-flying-to-us-without-biometric-passports-could-be-turned-away\">Britons flying to US without biometric passports could be turned away</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Late last year the US quietly announced new rules requiring any travellers taking advantage of its ESTA visa waiver scheme to hold a biometric passport. The new rule came into effect on 1 April, but a lack of publicity about the change meant that many travellers only became aware of the issue when trying to check in for their flights. To further complicate matters, it was possible to obtain ESTA clearance even with an old-style passport.</p> <p>Darch, who lives in Bournemouth, was able to secure an appointment at the Passport Office in London on Friday to get a new document. Had he not been able to do so a trip to Peterborough would have been necessary. The one-day premium service costs \u00a3128 \u2013 \u00a325 more than the one-week \u201cfast track\u201d service.</p> <p>After waiting four hours, Darch had a shiny new biometric passport and was set for his business trip to the US. </p> <p>\u201cI\u2019ve been quite fortunate \u2013 lots of other people will have had no idea until getting to the airport,\u201d he said. \u201cIf it had been a holiday I would have been pretty upset \u2013 it\u2019s not cheap to fly to the States.\u201d</p> <p>Others were not so fortunate. Kevin Nash went to Stansted aiport early last month to fly to Florida with his partner Hannah Elphick and their two-year-old daughter, Kloe. However, he was not permitted to board and was forced to stay behind in London while his partner and child went ahead. </p> <p>\u201cIt was awful \u2013 we were all pretty upset,\u201d Elphick told BBC Radio 5 live. It cost Nash more than \u00a3700 to get a new passport and book another flight, finally arriving in Florida two days later. </p> <p>Darch does not believe there was enough publicity about the change. Even if airlines and travel operators could not easily determine which passengers did not hold biometric passports, a blanket email to all travellers clearly stating the new requirements would have helped many, he said.<br /></p> <p>Asked whether there had been enough publicity about the changes, the Home Office said it was a matter for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.</p> <p>Even after getting to Heathrow airport on Saturday afternoon to check in for his British Airways flight, the hassle was not completely over. Because Darch was now travelling on a new passport, Darch\u2019s existing ESTA approval was now invalid and he had to go online to reapply.</p>",

So his gentle oath may have been a celebration of greater editorial freedom, as perhaps was his appearance without a tie, his preference for a bare neck having also reputedly been a source of tension at the corporation.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/03/robert-peston-criticises-vicious-approach-to-interviewing-politicians\">Robert Peston criticises \u2018vicious\u2019 approach to interviewing politicians</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In the hour before the debut of Peston on Sunday, Andrew Marr, in a tie, had talked to an equally buttoned-up Michael Gove and a polo-shirted Prince Harry in the latest edition of the 11-year-old BBC1 series which ITV has decided to follow, at 10am, rather than challenge directly.</p> <p>Differences were immediately clear. Whereas Marr had expressed fogeyish surprise at a guest\u2019s use of an iPad during the prolonged newspaper review that starts his show, Peston threw straight to Stratton \u2013 a colleague from ITV\u2019s News At Ten, where she is national editor and he political editor - at an interactive widescreen.</p> <p>Extending the meme that led the public to attempt to name a polar vessel Boaty McBoatface, viewers had voted pre-transmission for the show\u2019s window on the digital world to be baptised Screeny McScreenface. Screeny is intended to display tweets, some of which were actively solicited. \u201cI know you\u2019re watching,\u201d Stratton directly addressed the Scottish Tory leader, Ruth Davidson, \u201cso send us a tweet!\u201d</p> <p>\u201cYes, do, Ruth, I\u2019m feeling a bit lonely here!,\u201d added Peston, again seeming winningly jittery as he introduced \u201cmy very first big Sunday interview, George Osborne\u201d. Attuning to the show\u2019s aim to loosen the mood of sabbath television, the chancellor had turned up tieless, although had stopped short of changing his name to Votey McVoteface.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/may/08/tom-hanks-speaks-of-lonely-childhood-in-emotional-desert-island-discs\">Tom Hanks speaks of lonely childhood in emotional Desert Island Discs</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In a development likely to induce terror among the union of TV critics, it soon became clear that Peston on Sunday is constructed as a self-reviewing show. After talking to Osborne for a while, Peston handed over to Stratton, who provided immediate personal feedback (\u201cHouse prices will fall if we leave the EU \u2013 that\u2019s the main line out of your interview\u201d) before revealing what viewers had tweeted to Screeny. Even the chancellor was freelancing as a reviewer: \u201cIt\u2019s early minutes but the show\u2019s looking good.\u201d</p> <p>While the preceding Marr show had less arts content than usual, Peston introduced a regular \u201cbook club\u201d and, breaking the usual broadcasting rule about not promoting rivals, interviewed Louis Theroux about his new BBC2 documentaries. Relatively new to live presenting, Peston needs to learn to trust pauses. More than once, he jumped in with a new question just as Theroux seemed about to answer thoughtfully the previous one.</p> <p>After promising Jeremy Corbyn next week, the host\u2019s sign-off again played the nervous newbie card: \u201cI hope I haven\u2019t made too much of a fool of myself.\u201d He certainly had not, and he has the makings of an intelligent and engaging double act with Stratton.</p> <p>But, although Peston and Marr are not going head-to-head, there must still be a question over whether Sunday morning can sustain two news overviews. As Peston and Stratton have already discovered with the sparkily revamped News at Ten, the audience seems to have an inbuilt preference for BBC journalism.</p> <p>Despite showing promising signs, amid inevitable first-morning nerves, of being lively and likable, Peston on Sunday risks winning the energy medal but losing the ratings war to the tie-knotted, old technology Marr.</p>",

After senior figures across the party expressed their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/06/jeb-bush-donald-trump-support\">unease and distaste regarding a Trump candidacy</a>, the two men arranged a meeting this week.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s time for a change,\u201d Palin wrote on a Facebook post on Sunday. \u201c Paul Ryan abandoned the district he was to represent as special interests dictated his legislative priorities. Without ever having a real job outside of politics, it seems he disconnected himself from the people, thus easily disrespected the will of the people.\u201d</p> <p>She then promised her support to \u201cthe independent conservative businessman, Paul Nehlen\u201d, whom she called \u201cthe worthy challenger\u201d to Ryan.</p> <p>Palin was also interviewed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/may/08/sarah-palin-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-election\">on CNN\u2019s State of the Union</a>, where she said she would support Ryan\u2019s primary opponent.</p> <p>\u201cI think Paul Ryan is soon to be \u2018Cantored\u2019, as in Eric Cantor,\u201d she said, alluding to the former Republican House leader who was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/11/us-house-majority-leader-eric-cantor-loses-primary-virginia\">knocked out of his seat in 2014</a> by a more conservative candidate.</p> <p>\u201cHis political career is over but for a miracle because he has so disrespected the will of the people,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd yeah, as the leader of the GOP, the convention, certainly he is to remain neutral.

After word came through at half-time that Fleetwood were 2-0 up Blackpool surrendered shamefully.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone told us [about Fleetwood] and the second-half performance was a result of that,\u201d Neil McDonald, the manager, said. \u201cThat just shows mentally we\u2019re very, very fragile.\u201d McDonald will meet the chairman on Monday to determine his future but the noncommittal answers to questions about whether he would walk away suggested little likelihood of him continuing.</p> <p>Blackpool actually started the game reasonably well and at least looked as if they might go down with a modicum of fight. They took the lead in the 18th minute, as Jacob Blyth headed home a Luke Higham cross, and they held on to the lead until the break. However, then came the news of their fate being decided elsewhere and after half-time they conceded five goals, three of them to the Peterborough substitute Jon Taylor.</p> <p>Marcus Maddison equalised from the penalty spot just after the break, then with around 15 minutes remaining Taylor scored his first, barely breaking stride after coming off the bench. Shaquile Coulthirst added another before Taylor scored two more in rapid succession: a 12-minute hat-trick is nothing to be sniffed at but at that stage he may as well have been running round tangerine training cones.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019ve embarrassed themselves with their second-half performance; they\u2019ve embarrassed me and the football club,\u201d McDonald said, going on to agree with his predecessor Lee Clark\u2019s assertion that Blackpool was an \u201cimpossible job\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t think the club has been shown in a good light by anybody \u2013 and I mean anybody,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s to blame, especially me and the players.\u201d</p> <p>Sadly the Oystons appear not to be going anywhere, meaning the possibility of whoever is in charge next season overseeing yet another demotion is very real. \u201cYou\u2019re going down,\u201d sang a group of unsympathetic home fans and indeed they were. Last season they were relegated from the Championship by 20 points. This season they dropped by four. In Blackpool\u2019s world that almost counts as progress.</p> <p><strong>Man of the match </strong>Jon Taylor (Peterborough United)</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-09T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Tourism chiefs in the Balearic Islands could ban cars from the smaller islands during the summer months as the region braces for a record number of visitors.</p> <p>The islands of Mallorca, Menorca, Ibiza and Formentera, which have a population of 1.1 million, are expecting 13.5 million visitors this year. </p> <p>Officials in Ibiza and Formentera say they may have to stop tourists arriving in cars to avoid gridlock, following the example of the Italian resort island of Capri. In peak season there are as many as 20,000 cars on Formentera, which is 19km long.</p> <p>Last year 65 million people visited Spain, 20 million more than the number of inhabitants. Numbers are already up on 2015 as terrorist attacks in Tunisia and Egypt have driven tourists back to European destinations.</p> <p>Traffic jams are not the only problem. Local officials and environmentalists say the islands are close to the point where they will have neither the water nor the energy resources to meet demand.</p> <p>Menorca, for example, was declared a biosphere reserve in 1993 and environmentalists say it cannot sustain more than 200,000 visitors on any one day, in addition to its 86,000 permanent residents. However, it exceeded that number on more than one occasion last year.</p> <p>Cruise ships are adding to the pressure. On a single day last week, 22,000 passengers disembarked from cruise ships in Palma, the Mallorcan capital.</p> <p>Over 500 cruises are expected to dock in Palma this year, carrying 1.5 million passengers.</p> <p>Biel Barcel\u00f3, vice-president of the Balearics tourism ministry, said: \u201cWe are encouraging cruise operators to take passengers on excursions to other parts of the island to avoid overcrowding the old town of Palma.\u201d</p> <p>Mallorca airport is also struggling to cope. Designed to deal with a maximum of 66 flights an hour, officials say in the high season this may rise to as many as 100.</p> <p>Joan Gual de Torrella, president of the Balearic port authority, agreed that pressure needed to be taken off Palma, but added: \u201cIt would be a mistake to think that we would benefit from limiting the number of tourists.\u201d</p> <p>Tourism is by far the biggest industry in the Balearics, accounting for nine out of every \u20ac10 of GDP, and any attempt to curb it comes into conflict with powerful forces in the hotel and travel industry, as the Barcelona mayor, Ada Colau, discovered when she attempted to impose a moratorium on new hotels in the city. Schemes for new hotels were pushed though and contracts signed before her election.</p> <p>With 9 million tourists last year, Barcelona is also reaching saturation point, especially as tourism is concentrated in only a small part of the city. Its airport is also the point of entry for the 18 million visitors who are expected in Catalonia this year.</p> <p>Barcel\u00f3 said that taking in more and more tourists doesn\u2019t necessarily bring economic benefits. \u201cIn the 1980s, when the Balearics had 6 million visitors, it was the region with the highest per capita income in Spain. Now, with 13 million, it has dropped to seventh place,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Spain continues to lead the world as a seaside resort destination, with 586 beaches awarded blue flag status, nine more than last year.</p>",

The interior ministry said in a Saturday statement that it regularly rotated prisoners around the country as part of a policy introduced last September while Guzm\u00e1n was on the lam. <br /></p> <p>Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s lawyers have applied for injunctions against his extradition, though the process is proceeding slowly. The interior ministry said it had advised the judges weighing the injunctions that Guzm\u00e1n had been sent to Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, just across the border from El Paso, Texas.</p> <p>One of Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s lawyers, Jos\u00e9 Refugio Rodr\u00edguez, told the Guardian he was advised of his client\u2019s transfer at 2am on Saturday.

He is said to have wheeled out of a Guadalajara-area prison in a laundry cart in 2001 \u2013 though there have long been allegations that he walked out with corrupt officials \u2013 and in 2015 escaped from Altiplano by slipping through a shaft connecting a shower to a nearly mile-long tunnel. He was <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/09/el-chapo-capture-mexico-drug-lords-desire-to-make-biopic-helped-agents-find-him\">recaptured in his home state of Sinaloa</a> in early January and sent back to Altiplano, where he was kept under constant guard in a cell with reinforced concrete. <br /></p> <p>Guzm\u00e1n\u2019s beauty queen wife, Emma Coronel, and his legal team launched a public relations offensive earlier this year, saying \u201cEl Chapo\u201d was suffering ill health and was unable to sleep due to security staff constantly waking him.<br /></p> <p>Federal officials showed little sympathy. National security commissioner Renato Sales told reporters at the time: \u201cHe\u2019s sleeping perfectly.\u201d<br /></p>",

Former Mercury contenders <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/oct/20/mercury-nominees-2014-gogo-penguin\">GoGo Penguin</a> pushed it to two chords and a few more at Koko, but their looping hooks, steady bass drones and percussion throb nonetheless proved Reed\u2019s implication, that you can\u2019t put too many bends in a musical narrative without confusing an audience that wants to shake its booty. Their mix of big rock-oriented crescendos, with Chris Illingworth\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/jun/17/jazz.obituaries\">Esbj\u00f6rn Svensson-influenced piano</a> and Nick Blacka\u2019s jazz-bass sound has lately led this <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/11/gogo-penguin-man-made-object-review-blue-note\">original Manchester trio</a> to shift tickets way off the usual jazz circuit at a dizzying rate.</p> <p>After evocatively autobiographical singer/songwriter Daudi Matsiko\u2019s opener, the trio emerged silhouetted against white light, punching a piano hook against Blacka\u2019s bowed-bass drone and drummer Rob Turner\u2019s driving pulse. They swelled it to a roar and then a dead halt \u2013 met by cheers, the pattern of the night. A more rhapsodic theme built to an ascent like the late Svensson\u2019s trio at its most compelling \u2013 lightning flashes punctuating the accents \u2013 before a bluesy bass vamp and a gentle piano jangle pulled closer to jazz. Then a steady bass hum against racing drum-grooves moved away, and a trancelike interlude of treble trills and soft hi-hat sounds preceded the tenacious groove-power and arrhythmic accents of <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMN8dTmDIls\">One Percent</a>, from their v2.0 album. Too few bends in the road here for jazzers, maybe, but it\u2019s an intelligently original twist in the story of dance-music.</p> <p>\u2022 At <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.lovesupremefestival.com/lineup/stages\">Love Supreme</a>, Glynde Place, East Sussex, 3 July, and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://citadelfestival.com/portfolio/gogo-penguin/\">Citadel</a> festival, Victoria Park, London, 17 July.

      "body": "<p>If your bank hits you with what you consider to be unfair overdraft fees, or fails to notify you in a timely manner of new, higher fees \u2013 thus making it impossible for you to avoid them \u2013 you may end up losing enough money for it to be painful. But getting it back may be even more costly, too costly to make it worthwhile.<br /></p> <p>That\u2019s because the small print covering your bank account, credit card and most other financial institution agreements requires you to submit to binding arbitration to resolve any disputes with your bank. Only 34% did not require binding arbitration, the Pew Charitable Trusts <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/05/consumer-lawsuits-banks-credit-card-companies-proposal\">found in a survey last year</a>, down from 38% in 2013.</p> <p>In plain English, that means you\u2019re losing your right to join together with other bank customers who have been hit by the same kind of fees and push back against the policy in a class-action lawsuit. A lawyer isn\u2019t likely to represent just you \u2013 unless you\u2019re really wealthy, in which case, the bank probably would be waiving all those fees anyway, right? </p> <p>Instead, you\u2019re required to submit to a different kind of process, known as arbitration. The banks \u2013 and the many other businesses that increasingly have chosen to insist that their consumers or employees submit to arbitration and explicitly relinquish any right to sue them \u2013 argue that the process, which is binding on both sides, is more efficient. </p> <p>So score one for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/05/consumer-lawsuits-banks-credit-card-companies-proposal\">proposed a new rule</a> that \u2013 if it overcomes what is likely to be fierce objection from the big banks and credit card companies \u2013 would return to us the right to bring class-action lawsuits against those institutions. </p> <p>The American Chamber of Commerce hovered on the edge of apoplexy in its response to the CFPB\u2019s announcement of the proposed new rule. The agency \u201cis proposing to give the biggest gift to plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers in a half century \u2013 at the expense of the consumers the agency is charged with protecting,\u201d the business group said <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/05/consumer-lawsuits-banks-credit-card-companies-proposal\">in a statement</a>.<br /></p> <p>Arbitration may be efficient, but it\u2019s costly for consumers \u2013 especially for those concerned about precisely the kind of small fees that <a href=\"http://www.military.com/money/personal-finance/banking-and-savings/millions-may-join-unbanked-over-fees.html\">can put immense pressure</a> on already struggling families. </p> <p>It also can be a process that, while efficient, is far from equitable or just. A 2011 <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-lazarus-20151218-column.html\">supreme court ruling</a> opened the way for many companies to insist that their consumers or employees sign away their right to sue in favor of arbitration clauses. People who might have banded together as plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit \u2013 sharing the costs of fighting a large corporation or finding a lawyer willing to shoulder those costs in hopes of a share of a payout on behalf of thousands of plaintiffs, not just a single individual \u2013 must act individually in arbitration. </p> <p>A team of New York Times reporters last year pointed out the abuses inherent in this system, which they described as amounting to a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/02/business/dealbook/in-arbitration-a-privatization-of-the-justice-system.html?login=email&amp;mtrref=www.nytimes.com&amp;assetType=nyt_now\">privatization of the justice system</a>\u201d, in a series of articles that were finalists for this year\u2019s Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting. Among the cases they documented were a woman working aboard a cruise ship, who, after alleging that two fellow employees had drugged her, raped her and left her unconscious in her cabin, discovered that she couldn\u2019t sue her employer for permitting an unsafe workplace to occur. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If you have shopped online, rented a car, you\u2019ve agreed to arbitration. Banks are the tip of the proverbial iceberg</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are myriad ways in which arbitration doesn\u2019t measure up to the kind of recourse that you can seek in a court, if you feel that your bank or credit card company has taken advantage of you, sought to mis-sell you a product from a mutual fund to a mortgage, that isn\u2019t in your interests, or simply overcharged you. First of all, any lawyer could hear your case (not necessarily a judge), and that lawyer could have done work (or still be working) for JP Morgan Chase or American Express while deciding your case. There\u2019s no way to appeal the outcome \u2013 remember, this is binding arbitration. The bank that you\u2019re up against gets to pay witnesses to testify on their behalf and can order its own employees to do the same. Little or none of that would be acceptable in a court of law. </p> <p>And it isn\u2019t just banks that do this. If you have a mobile phone contract, you\u2019ve agreed to arbitration. If you\u2019ve signed an employment agreement, ditto. Have you shopped online? Rented a car? Signed up for cable internet? Yup, you\u2019ve signed that small print. The banks are the tip of the proverbial iceberg.</p> <p>The banking industry, if anything, has become worse in the way it has treated those customers least able to push back: ordinary checking account customers. The Pew Charitable Trusts\u2019 study found that \u201cthe prevalence of harmful overdraft fees and account terms showed little change or\u201d had grown worse since its prior study a few years earlier. Only 16% of banks automatically decline charges that would result in a bank customer overdrawing an account \u2013 even though most bank customers don\u2019t recall opting into overdraft service, a lucrative source of bank fees. Of the largest banks, more than a third still don\u2019t have a complete disclosure of all banking terms and fees. </p> <p>Against that backdrop, there is plenty of room for problems to emerge, and forcing bank clients into arbitration just ensures that the banks will win, by default, if only because <a href=\"http://www.bankrate.com/finance/banking/bank-mandatory-arbitration-1.aspx\">so few consumers will ever file a case</a>. It\u2019s a few hundred dollars to do so, but if you lose, you may have to pay the bank\u2019s costs.</p> <p>Look for a lot of <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/banks-warn-limits-on-arbitration-agreements-would-hurt-consumers-1462481219\">infuriated rhetoric and saber-rattling</a> from the banks during the 90-day comment period, and before the new CFPB rule takes effect next year. Because this is the biggest constraint on their ability to make money from consumer banking in decades, and the biggest restriction imposed on their overall business since the passage of Dodd-Frank Act and the Volcker Rule, which required them to strip themselves of some of their riskier (and more profitable) businesses. Now, lumbered with the need to keep more capital on their balance sheets as a result of those post-crisis regulations, the banks already have turned to consumer banking fees as one lucrative source of income. </p> <p>The disconcerting element of this reaction is the threat of punishment to be directed at precisely those small consumers, already struggling with higher banking fees. It echoes, eerily, what we\u2019ve already heard from the financial industry in the wake of the Labor Department\u2019s announcement of tougher new rules (the new \u201cfiduciary\u201d standard) requiring that financial advisers be more prudent and vigilant when it comes to managing our retirement assets. The industry has said that\u2019s going to cost them so much more in time and money that <a href=\"http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2016/03/14/rias-reps-plan-to-drop-small-clients-under-dol-fid\">they\u2019ll simply stop working with a lot of clients altogether</a> \u2013 of course, the smaller, less affluent clients. </p> <p>Now, the infuriated bankers are warning of something similar: that consumers will find loans more costly or harder to get, because the higher costs of all the class-action lawsuits that banks expect to be hit with will have to be passed along to someone.</p> <p>Here\u2019s a thought. Maybe they could just stop doing stuff that leaves them liable to either class-action lawsuits or arbitration complaints? Then everyone would be happy. I know \u2013 this is planet Earth we\u2019re living on, but it\u2019s worth throwing out for discussion, before all the shouting starts.</p>",

      "body": "<h2>Oscar Lanham, 8, student, Leicester<br /></h2> <p>I like watching all of his wildlife and nature documentaries. He is my favourite guy. I like that he gets to see lots of rare animals. He saw a bird that could make a noise like a chainsaw. My favourite moment is when he went to Argentina to see the giant dinosaur, the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/jan/17/dinosaur-titanosaur-largest-animal-ever-walk-earth-argentina\">titanosaur</a>.</p> <p>I want to be a wildlife explorer and learn more about the natural world as I grow up. My favourite animal is a hammerhead shark. People think they are mean but sharks kill hardly any people \u2013 but people kill 100,000,000 people a year. Some animals could be extinct in years, like the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/23/snow-leopards-at-risk-himalayas-face-climate-change-crisis\">snow leopard</a>. Hopefully David Cameron can stop all these people. </p> <p>I\u2019d really like to visit New Guinea or Costa Rica. I\u2019d also like to visit Argentina to see titanosaur bones. I\u2019d like to dig up some more. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/04/sir-david-attenborough-askin-starstruck-meet-heroes\">Sir David Attenborough, you askin\u2019? I\u2019m starstruck | Peter Bradshaw</a> </p> </aside>  <h2>Charlotte Macdonald, director of life sciences, Edinburgh</h2> <p>I\u2019m currently on a plane about to take off to go to Cameroon to work at an ape sanctuary that Twycross zoo supports. I can\u2019t help but feel this amazing career that I have in my 40s is partly down to the passion and enthusiasm I learned from Sir David\u2019s work.<br /></p> <p>I had a Saturday job as a teenager at Dublin Zoo and I was really obsessed with Sir David\u2019s programmes and books. I read The Zoo Quest Expeditions when I was about 16 and I just thought this man is amazing! He certainly had a very positive impact on my love for endangered species and my career in conservation. </p> <p>I\u2019ve spent 26 years working in zoos and as a teenager I was very influenced by Sir David. I met him when I was a zoo keeper at Edinburgh Zoo around six years ago. I showed him around our new chimp house and introduce him to some of our chimps. He was really interested in them and asked lots of questions about them as individuals.</p> <h2>Anonymous, London</h2> <p>After I left school aged 19 years old, I went to live in the south of France on my own, where I fell in love with \u201cMr Wrong\u201d. I ended up in a French hospital all on my own having given birth by a difficult cesarean to my son. It was just me and him, and due to complications I was in a lot of pain, frightened and alone.</p> <p>My hospital room had a little portable television where I found a channel that did English language programmes for an hour in the morning. I became glued to old repeats of Wildlife on One. As David Attenborough had been around as long as I can remember, it was so familiar, like getting daily visits from a dear great uncle.</p> <p>I\u2019ve been so grateful to him for keeping a young girl company ever since.<br /></p> <h2>Stephy, Belgium<br /></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"76f2d4e8bdbee9db415daff77fd885b65374ed73\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/76f2d4e8bdbee9db415daff77fd885b65374ed73/0_169_720_673/500.jpg\" alt=\"Stephy from Belgium\" width=\"500\" height=\"467\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stephy: \u2018His enthusiasm for wildlife in all its forms is very contagious.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stephy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>His enthusiasm for wildlife in all its forms is very contagious: whether the organism is small or big, attractive or just very strange it doesn\u2019t matter, he can tell you an intriguing story about it. I have picked up this enthusiasm and, every day, I\u2019m amazed by the natural world. <br /></p> <p>My favourite Attenborough moments are always the scenes when you first hear his voice saying \u201cthis extraordinary and rare creature\u201d and see the animal or plant and then the camera zooms out to show that actually he is sitting right next to it.</p> <p>I think watching his documentaries is one of the reasons why I started studying biodiversity and ecological restoration. </p> <h2>Emma Montlake, environment charity law, East Sussex</h2> <p>He has been my lifetime inspiration and he brought my already forging love of the natural world to be my overriding passion. So much that I know about wildlife is down to a fascination that he engendered. And now I am passing it on to my twin five-year-old boys who watch David\u2019s wonderful programmes avidly. At their school they are studying Darwin and Attenborough. It doesn\u2019t get better than that!</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"94655e330102b180318468582ecc73b87f804d6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94655e330102b180318468582ecc73b87f804d6b/341_0_803_950/423.jpg\" alt=\"Emma Montlake\" width=\"423\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Emma Montlake</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Emma Montlake</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I love his humanity and his ability to be realistic about the threats facing the natural world without being judgmental. He remains positive and sometimes it does feel difficult to remain hopeful for the future health of the planet and its wonderful abundance of life. But if ever there is one person who will fight to protect what they love, there is hope. That\u2019s something he has taught me. But curiosity is his greatest lesson. I went to Thailand many years ago and on a river bank I watched a titanic battle between a huge spider and a spider-hunting wasp. It was just like a David Attenborough programme! </p> <p>I have had the great privilege to hear him talk a couple of times. Once, introducing the Life of Birds to a transfixed audience. It will always remain with me, as he described his first sightings of his beloved birds of paradise and how his heart beat so loudly the sound engineer had to tell him to move his microphone. Beautiful story.<br /></p> <p>I am lucky enough to work for an environmental legal organisation and volunteer for a conservation charity, <a href=\"http://elflaw.org/\">ELF</a>. My job is wonderful. We assist communities facing local environmental challenges to access free environmental legal advice through a network of lawyers, barristers and environmental technicians. I often quote David Attenborough: \u201cNo one will protect what they don\u2019t care about; and no one will care about what they have never experienced\u201d. It\u2019s a call to arms for local environmental protection and a salutary reminder of how frightening the disconnection between nature and children.<br /></p> <h2>Paul Bamford, Chile</h2> <p> David Attenborough has had such a profound impact on my life. My earliest memory is seeing a giant anteater walk across the Venezuelan savanna on Living Planet. I was immediately fascinated. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9c802820dd1984ed62527688aa4b3b12428544a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9c802820dd1984ed62527688aa4b3b12428544a1/0_0_440_630/349.jpg\" alt=\"Paul Bamford\" width=\"349\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Paul Bamford: \u2018Attenborough has fed a lifelong love of wandering and exploring the world.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Bamford</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>As far as I can remember, that was the first step on a path that has led me to work in environmental education and the human dimensions of conservation \u2013 from zoos in the UK to field conservation projects in Brazil, Cameroon, Chile, Ecuador and Zambia. I now work for the national science engagement initiative in Chile. <br /></p> <p>David Attenborough not only sparked my fascination for nature, wildlife and the beauty of our planet\u2019s many landscapes, but he also inspired my approach to communicating and connecting others with the wonders of the universe they live in. You know he\u2019s thrilled to be out there. The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2016/may/04/attenborough-90-wildlife-legend-top-10-tv-moments\">blue whale moment</a> on Planet Earth and meeting the mountain gorillas in Life on Earth are the two most quintessential Attenborough moments on camera. You can feel his emotional reaction to what he is experiencing, and you can relate to it. <br /></p> <p>Having great subject matter and amazing technology with which to capture your subjects is one thing, but that moment when he connects with them directly and personally is what takes it to another level: the barrier of the TV screen shutters and allows you to become a part of the moment. </p> <p>More than influencing a specific trip, Attenborough has fed a lifelong love of wandering and exploring the world. Curiosity drives the feet as much as it does the mind, and seeing where other curious people have been before me always fuels the urge to get out there. <br /></p> <h2>Annelies Andringa, science officer and marine biologist, Philippines</h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"cd9bb3792118c51f039b8647be15d5432daacff4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/cd9bb3792118c51f039b8647be15d5432daacff4/35_132_505_648/390.jpg\" alt=\"Annelies Andringa (centre)\" width=\"390\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Annelies Andringa (centre)</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Annelies Andringa</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I have always been interested in nature conservation. Watching his documentaries and listening to equally inspiring people like <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/03/jane-goodall-climate-change-apes-fear\">Jane Goodall</a>, it made me realise that spreading the message of nature conservation is very important. I work with the local community and volunteers who come from all over the world to learn how to dive and help out with conservation. It\u2019s very nice to be able to spread a message and teach people more about the importance of the coral reef and how we can protect it.<br /></p> <p>Partly because of watching his amazing nature documentaries I studied biology. In my jobs as biology teacher, environmental education specialist and science officer, I always try to show his documentaries and it is always rewarding to see how both pupils and adults get very enthusiastic.<br /></p> <p>I would still like to visit the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/26/monarch-butterflies-migration-mexico-declines\">monarch butterflies in Mexico</a>, after seeing an episode of one David Attenborough\u2019s documentaries, and see how they did the filming.</p> <h2>Liaan Lanegan, nature tour guide, South Africa</h2> <p>I ended up studying nature conservation because of him, and now I\u2019m a tour guide working for a small company based in South Africa, specialising in small family groups and explaining the different natural beauty South Africa has to offer.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f710f071f7b8b8c664ec152801258d1ecc024979\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f710f071f7b8b8c664ec152801258d1ecc024979/32_0_542_720/376.jpg\" alt=\"Liaan Lanegan\" width=\"376\" height=\"500\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Liaan Lanegan: \u2018David Attenborough was, is, and will always be an inspiration and a role model to me.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Liaan Lanegan</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Every time I meet new tourists and see that they are disconnected from nature, I try my utmost to get them excited about the small things, just like I got excited when I saw David Attenborough as a child on a television. </p> <p>He was, is and will always be an inspiration and a role model to me. Sir David has played a vital role in my life. His passion for nature and the enthusiasm he has when he describes different species to you is just so contagious. </p> <p>When I finished studying, I went to the Kalahari and the with two friends. Just before the trip I saw the clip where Sir David was sitting with a group of meerkats, and I knew I had to see them for myself. The trip was amazing, and we ended up working in the Okavango delta as joint relieve managers for almost three months. We still get together now and again and talk about that trip.</p> <p>I will always have a deep passion for our natural environment and I hope I will be able to keep sharing it, just like David has been. </p> <p>My lifelong dream has been to meet him, but hopefully he will be able to just read these few words. <br /></p>",

      "headline": "Bank of England meeting could discuss cutting interest rates",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-09T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>The Bank of England\u2019s interest rate setters meet against a gloomy economic backdrop this week that could prompt at least one policymaker to push for a cut in borrowing costs to shore up stalling growth.<br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>The nine-strong monetary policy committee (MPC) is not expected to make any changes to the record low base rate of 0.5% on Thursday. But investors will be scouring minutes of the latest meeting and the Bank\u2019s new forecasts for the economy released at the same time for clues as to whether the next move will be up or down.</p> <p>\u201cA run of weak activity surveys for April suggest that the economy may see growth in the second quarter slow compared to the first quarter\u2019s already insipid performance,\u201d said Martin Beck at the consultancy Oxford Economics.</p> <p>\u201cUncertainty caused by June\u2019s EU referendum has been widely blamed. But with the economy slackening well before the referendum date was announced, it is difficult to believe that this is the only story. One thing that is clear is that the possibility of a cut in interest rates is looking ever less outlandish.\u201d</p> <p>Markets are not pricing in any policy move this year and the Bank\u2019s policymakers have also signalled that rates are going nowhere for now, given the upcoming referendum on EU membership is clouding the economic outlook. At the same time, there has been a clear message from governor Mark Carney that when there is a change in borrowing costs it is more likely to be up than down.</p> <p>However, a recent run of bad news on the economy may have chipped away at Carney and other policymakers\u2019 certainty on the path for interest rates, say experts. The committee could discuss cuts at this meeting even if most members are not close to voting for such a move. </p> <p>Both the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/18/interest-rates-rise-bank-of-england-chief-economist-andy-haldane\">Bank\u2019s chief economist, Andy Haldane</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/22/interest-rates-could-go-negative-bank-of-england-vlieghe-says\">external MPC member Jan Vlieghe have discussed the possibility of cutting rates in the past</a>. As such, they are seen as the most likely to push for lower borrowing costs after business surveys last week added to signs that the UK economy is losing momentum.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/05/services-sector-slump-fans-fears-of-uk-economic-slowdown\">Last week\u2019s PMI reports on the main sectors of Britain\u2019s economy</a> showed growth had dropped to the weakest pace in three years for construction firms, manufacturers and Britain\u2019s vast banks-to-bars services industry. The surveys\u2019 compilers, Markit, said that pointed to GDP growth of just 0.1% in April, down from 0.4% in the first quarter of the year.<br /></p> <p>On the high street, the demise of BHS and Austin Reed has fanned fears that the consumer engine driving Britain\u2019s economy is stalling. </p> <p>The signs from the global economy have also been worrying investors, including news on Friday that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/06/april-jobs-report-us-economy-unemployment-rate\">the US added far fewer jobs than expected last month</a>. </p> <p>Another issue that will be troubling UK policymakers is the EU referendum on 23 June. The Bank has already warned that businesses will likely defer spending decisions until after the vote, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/14/bank-of-england-warns-brexit-could-do-serious-harm-to-uk-economy\">knocking overall economic growth in the second quarter of the year</a>. But presenting the Bank\u2019s latest \u201cinflation report\u201d forecasts on Thursday at a news conference, Carney may be careful not to venture further into the Brexit debate.</p> <p>Chris Hare, an economist at the bank Investec, commented: \u201cFrom a communications perspective, this inflation report will be extremely awkward for the MPC.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cIssues relating to the vote are clearly affecting the MPC\u2019s read of the economy and its monetary policy outlook. But, at the same time, the committee might naturally shy away from wading further into a highly charged political debate.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cAll told, we expect this Super Thursday to see the MPC very much in \u2018wait and see\u2019 mode as it rides out the communications challenges of the EU referendum.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/\">According to the Sunday Times</a>, the Bank has held \u2018informal discussions\u2019 with UK banks over whether their balance sheets could handle a rate cut.</p> <p>New economic indicators published today will do little to assuage fears the economic is losing steam.</p> <p> Business activity and employment lost momentum across England and Wales in April, according to the latest Lloyds Bank regional purchasing managers\u2019 index. </p> <p>The survey\u2019s measure of business activity across England\u2019s private sector was the lowest for more than three years. Wales\u2019s business activity index registered its second-lowest reading since February 2013. But it still showed a faster rate of growth than the average across England for the third month in a row.</p> <p>Companies said last month\u2019s introduction of the \u2018national living wage\u2019 was weighing on hiring.</p> <p>\u201cThe majority of regions have started the second quarter on a weaker footing, with business activity no longer showing the robust growth that we have seen over the past two to three years,\u201d said Tim Hinton, managing director for mid-markets and SME banking at Lloyds Banking Group.</p> <p>\u201cA knock-on effect of stronger cost pressures from the \u2018national living wage\u2019 and higher fuel prices has seen a slowing in the rate of job creation, which was at a 32-month low in April.\u201d</p> <p>A separate report from accountants BDO suggested that UK firms\u2019 hiring intentions had fallen sharply to levels last seen in 2014. But its Business Trends Report suggested firms remained upbeat about growth in the coming six months.</p>",

      "body": "<p>What better way to be reminded that the race is not always to the swiftest, than with a bruising battle across one of the greatest circuits in the world, where the big boys in the prototypes swung and missed, punched and counter-punched until, finally, after a real old-school battle of attrition, the Six Hours of Spa had its last man standing on Saturday. </p> <p>In a race in which all three major manufacturers \u2013 Audi, Porsche and Toyota \u2013 had led at some point, it was the Audi No8 crew of Lucas di Grassi, Lo\u00efc Duval and Oliver Jarvis that brought their R18 over the finishing line, two laps ahead of the Porsche No2 of Romain Dumas, Neel Jani and Marc Lieb, who had pedalled their car to a highly unlikely podium place, given that they had suffered from a lack of power because of a hybrid problem throughout the day.<br /></p> <p>A very healthy crowd of 56,000 witnessed Britain\u2019s Jarvis score his first victory in the FIA World Endurance Championship, but few could have called the result, even going into the final hour.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/14/porsche-win-le-mans-24-hours-race-nico-hulkenberg\">Porsche win Le Mans 24 Hours race for the 17th time</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The pole-sitting No1 Porsche of last year\u2019s world champions Timo Bernhard, Brendon Hartley and Mark Webber had the early pace, with Hartley setting the fastest lap of the race but they were passed through the first round of stops when S\u00e9bastien Buemi and Toyota in the No5 car opted to double stint their tyres.<br /></p> <p>Unlike Porsche and Audi, who were running a low-downforce spec here in preparation for the Le Mans 24 Hours, Toyota had opted to run a high-downforce set-up that was particularly helpful through the twisty bits in sector two. However, their TS050, a new car for this year, has also clearly moved on since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/apr/18/porsche-inherit-audi-silverstone-win-fia-world-endurance-championship-disqualified\">the last round at Silverstone</a> and although caught by Bernhard on new rubber after 12 laps, it was showing good competitive pace.<br /></p> <p>That was as close as the Porsche would come to the lead again, however. Bernhard suffered a front left puncture and had to pit, eight laps later Webber experienced exactly the same and ultimately damage to the front gearbox ensued from returning to the pits with the unevenly loaded car. The team lost one hour 40 minutes replacing it. Fifth in class and 27<sup>th</sup> overall was their reward for getting the 919 back on track.<br /></p> <p>By the midway point the No5 Toyota, under Buemi\u2019s team-mates Anthony Davidson and Kazuki Nakajima, had established a 75-second lead over the chasing No8 Audi and by lap 101 they were a full circuit ahead, looking on course to score their first win since November 2014, the year <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/16/anthony-davidson-wins-drivers-fia-world-endurance-championship\">Davidson and Buemi won the world championship</a>. But, reminiscent of that year\u2019s Le Mans when both their cars went out with mechanical failures, they were again to be denied.<br /></p> <p>The sister No6 car had already retired with an electronic failure when, with 1 hour and 54 minutes to go, the No5, which had led since lap 24 and was 2 minutes clear at the front, began emitting smoke and suffered an engine failure. By Lap 113 the No8, with Jarvis at the wheel, had taken the lead.<br /></p> <p>With the sister Audi some way back after having to have a damaged underfloor replaced and with a drive-through penalty, the No8 was the final manufacturer prototype running without a problem and set for the win but there was to be a final twist. Under the safety car, deployed due to huge accident at the top of Eau Rouge for Stefan Mucke in the Ford GT from which the driver emerged unhurt, the Audi pitted and went into the garage with 45 minutes to go. The crowd held its breath as for moments it seemed their bid too had failed. Fortunately the change of rear bodywork was a precautionary measure only and the team took the flag after 160 laps.<br /></p> <p>After such attrition the Rebellion of Alexandre Imperatori, Dominik Kraihamer and Matheo Tuscher, run in the LMP1 class for privateers, took third place. An impressive result, and achieving their aim of being there to take advantage when the manufacturers encounter problems.<br /></p> <p>With Le Mans set for June, reliability issues, especially for Porsche who are using a developed version of last year\u2019s car which was bulletproof for most of the season, as opposed to Audi and Toyota\u2019s new models, will be of concern. As the precursor to the 24, Spa is usually a race for tinkering rather than a major test of machinery. All three teams will be sitting down for an intensive debriefing in the wake of these performances.<br /></p> <p>In terms of pace it is still advantage Porsche, with their opponents still developing new cars the 919 has the speed to take to the front when they look to defend <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jun/14/porsche-win-le-mans-24-hours-race-nico-hulkenberg\">last year\u2019s 24 hours win</a>. Toyota have moved forward and Audi are still expecting to exploit more from their hybrid power, which has shifted from a flywheel to battery-system this year. La Sarthe will offer a far more comprehensive test than Spa however and may yet be another brutal encounter.<br /></p> <p>It has also been announced that the former driver and commentator Martin Brundle, who won at Le Mans in 1990, will compete in a one-hour LMP3 support race for United Autosports on the Saturday before the 24 hours begins. <br /></p>",

Diana of Dobson\u2019s, which appeared in 1908, is one of the best.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Novels in which the action takes place within a single day are a well-tested literary phenomenon. From Joyce\u2019s <em>Ulysses</em> and Woolf\u2019s <em>Mrs Dalloway</em> to Ian McEwan\u2019s <em>Saturday</em> and Graham Swift\u2019s <em>Mothering Sunday</em>, the single-day conceit has been used to great effect. The latest author to employ it is AL Kennedy with her eighth novel, <em>Serious Sweet</em>.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2007/mar/25/fiction.alkennedy\">Interview: AL Kennedy</a> </p> </aside>  <p><em>Serious Sweet</em> interweaves the stories of two deeply troubled protagonists. Fifty-nine-year-old senior civil servant Jon Sigurdsson is isolated both personally and professionally: at home he\u2019s emotionally reeling from his divorce, while at work he\u2019s on the brink of detonating his career with a breach of government secrets. To counteract his loneliness, he offers a letter-writing service to single women, which brings him into the orbit of Meg Williams, a 45-year-old recovering alcoholic and bankrupt accountant who now works in an animal sanctuary. Both Jon and Meg are social outliers, and the prospect of their meeting is the novel\u2019s key narrative driver.</p> <p>One of the advantages of the single-day conceit is that it lends the novel a sense of urgency: we know that the dilemmas and obstacles the characters face will have been resolved one way or another by the end of the day. In <em>Serious Sweet</em>, the clock ticks loudly in the reader\u2019s ear as we wait to find out whether Jon will overcome his relationship angst sufficiently to keep his date with Meg, and whether Meg will make it through the anniversary of her first year of sobriety without falling off the wagon.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There is an honesty and authenticity to the bleakness and sadness experienced by both Jon and Meg</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But there are constraints to the single-day conceit too, not least a reliance on backstory to flesh out the characters\u2019 lives. Thus, in <em>Serious Sweet</em>, we have Jon\u2019s extensive recollections of a depressing encounter the previous evening with a friend, remembrances of scenes from his now defunct marriage, and details of his endeavours to divulge government secrets. Similarly, Meg informs us about a prior abusive relationship, about her gruesomely medieval treatment for cervical cancer, about her experiences in AA meetings. The potential danger of so much backstory is that it undercuts the very urgency that the single-day conceit facilitates, and there are times in <em>Serious Sweet</em> when the transitions between present day and flashback narratives feel jarring and uneven.</p> <p>However, for most of the novel we are immersed in Jon and Meg\u2019s internal worlds, an immersion that is at times deeply affecting. When Jon confesses \u201cI\u2019ve missed my life, I think. I think that might be true\u201d, it is difficult not to feel profound sympathy for him. And much of Meg\u2019s narration exudes vulnerability and raw pain: \u201cyou know that your crying means they can see how you are, who you are. No one says anything and you don\u2019t say anything and still it\u2019s plain that you\u2019ve been damaged and are still damaged and cannot be fixed.\u201d Kennedy strips her characters emotionally bare to reveal them in all their neurotic, fearful, envious, anxious and troubled truths. There is an honesty and authenticity to the bleakness and sadness experienced by both Jon and Meg. But it is perhaps a consequence of this authenticity that their respective streams of consciousness feel at times to be exhausting and repetitive. At one point, Meg acknowledges: \u201cPeople get bored with other people who are harming themselves and unable to stop and who want to go on about it at three in the morning over the phone\u201d, and indeed there are times when one feels less like the reader of a novel and more like a very patient therapist.</p> <p><em>Serious Sweet</em> portrays intense lives of quiet desperation: it is a novel about hope and muted courage and, at the end of the day, a very tentatively experienced optimism.</p> <p><em>Serious Sweet is published by Jonathan Cape (\u00a317.99). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/385181/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\"><em>Click here</em></a><em> to buy it for \u00a314.39</em></p>",

So much more.</p> <p>I met Augusta on 10 September 2003 at the city pound in Harlem. I ended up there after searching for a dog at the Humane Society and the ASPCA, which are all more pleasant. I wanted to love and be loved, so I was looking for any great dog whatever the age. I was thinking some variation on a labrador retriever, because I was told they were sweet. But really, I supposed I would figure it out.</p> <p>I knew nothing about breeds. I knew nothing about dogs. I was guided by love. Love is my compass.</p> <p>I fell for many dogs and puppies I met along the way, but for one reason or another, none of them worked out. Some were already adopted, and just waiting to be spayed. They would not let me take a too-strong Akita mix as my first dog because he would end up dragging me down the street by his tether. They wouldn\u2019t allow me have a dalmatian with a chronic intestine condition that would be too much for someone with no experience.</p> <p>I walked by many desperate cages; it was frustrating and upsetting. We put people behind bars for murder and mayhem. We do this to dogs for no reason at all.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"85691d21787f2b3ee47c1b9f24635292ff3182a1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/85691d21787f2b3ee47c1b9f24635292ff3182a1/0_80_1600_960/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Augusta at one year old.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Augusta at one year old.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Lipsky</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If you want a dog, you have to go through this. Of course, now you can do it all online. But you have to rescue, even if you want a pure-breed puppy. Only bad people buy dogs.</p> <p>Because I could not find my dog at any of the no-kill shelters, I ended up at the pound. It offers a vast choice, because so many wonderful dogs are abandoned for whatever reason. But it is not for the faint of heart.</p> <p>Big dogs in small cages. Pit bulls that are going to be put down. Pure-breed cocker spaniels and basset hounds whose owners lost interest. Victims of evictions and foreclosures. There is a whole section of nothing but toy dogs \u2013 yorkies, teacup poodles, pomeranians \u2013 that were unwanted gifts. And then there are all the inexplicable strays, dogs of every breed and mix, found on the shoulder of the highway because someone decided: I don\u2019t want you any more.</p> <p>It is the museum of human error. The dogs are excellent; it is the people who have failed.</p> <p>As I was walking through, I saw Augusta out of the corner of my left eye. She pulled my eyeball her way, up to her top-row cage. She looked at me, chin down, eyes up, lids fluttering: she was flirting with me. Her eyes were huge almonds against her black plush fur. She was lovely. She looked like Audrey Hepburn.</p> <p>I heard her say: this is a terrible mistake. I don\u2019t belong here. Take me home.</p> <p>I could tell that she knew I have a dark heart. I am not for everybody. But Augusta got me. She understood about sorrow, and all the things no one can explain. It was magic. There is no substitute for magic.</p> <p>She was mine.</p> <p>I was hers.</p> <p>I took her out of the cage, and she rolled over for a tummy rub.</p> <p>Hers. Mine. Ours.</p> <p>She had already been spayed, and the attendant thought that it might mean that someone else had adopted her and was coming to get her. I sought out the nearest exit while he went to check.</p> <p>She was my dog. I was her person. If need be, I would make a run for it.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"94a96e33706de164cf9b4954c755862192492003\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94a96e33706de164cf9b4954c755862192492003/0_68_1351_1602/843.jpg\" alt=\"Augusta lying on her stoop in Greenwich village.\" width=\"843\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Augusta lying on her stoop in Greenwich Village.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Elizabeth Wurtzel</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>It turned out, no one else had adopted Augusta. Of course not: she was waiting for me. She was two months old when I brought her home, and she needed me the way blood needs veins. She was wild. She was impossible.</p> <p>I am impossible. Augusta rescued me.</p> <p>Before I met her, I did not know I could love that much. I did not know I could love at all.</p> <p>I was 36 and a diurnal wanderer. As a professional writer, I mostly had nothing to do but avoid what I was supposed to be doing. Writers are like everyone else: we work with our hands. By putting fingers to keyboard, we create, with or without inspiration, because those of us who are any good know it is a job.</p> <p>But it is hard and daunting, and so I was peripatetic within a diameter of a few miles. I loved walking downtown Manhattan and stopping for coffee and buying ridiculous things I did not need or even want. If it is possible to spend $200 on a tin of tea, I am sure I did it. I was in a trance.</p> <p>I lived alone in Greenwich Village and had many friends, but was a million light years away from marriage and whatever happens next. I thought about these things all the time, because of course I wondered what was wrong with me that I was not close to being serious about relationships. If you aren\u2019t wondering these things in a world obsessed with love and marriage, that is the only thing that is wrong with you. The rest you will work out when you are ready.</p> <p>And maybe you will meet Augusta.</p> <p>She was consuming. She wanted to do everything. I was afraid she was going to want a subscription to the ballet at Lincoln Center. She was busy. She wanted to walk all the time, and once we started, she did not want to stop.</p> <p>She made me cry. Early one morning, I broke down. Work with me, Augusta, I pleaded. She did not care. She wanted to walk more.</p> <p>I discovered dogwalkers and dog daycare. I made friends with other dog owners. We worked it out. I cannot believe we worked it out. It is because I love her so much.</p> <p>It is lucky puppies are cute, because they are awful. They eat shoes. They eat Prada shoes. You cannot get angry at them for doing that: it is your fault for not putting your shoes in the closet.</p> <p>And puppies decorate with toilet paper.</p> <p>And they need to go out every couple of hours.</p> <p>So much for sleep.</p> <p>So much for being a thirtysomething teenager.</p> <p>I changed my life.</p> <p>There are things that you can only explain by love. If it does not make you a better person, it is not love. And so we grew up together. She became a lady. My best friend. I took her everywhere. If I could not take her, I did not go.</p> <p>In the time Augusta was alive the world changed. Everybody came to believe that their dog was a member of the family. People became better pet owners. But I was still the only one bringing Augusta to dinner parties and to tea at Yale. I know everyone thinks that of course animals are the greatest thing ever, but they also believe that you have to work it out with people.</p> <p>I am not like that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b33871c30a12279f337e300eccf205faf7ae75fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b33871c30a12279f337e300eccf205faf7ae75fd/0_0_1323_1323/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018I was afraid Augusta was going to want a subscription to the ballet at Lincoln Center\u2019.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I was afraid Augusta was going to want a subscription to the ballet at Lincoln Center.\u2019</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lynne Winters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What is so great about people anyway? We mostly forget to say please and thank you, and that is the easiest part of being decent. We lose track of friends we love, friends we completely adore, because they move and not far away, but to the next borough, and we are creatures of convenience aren\u2019t we?</p> <p>Oh yes we are.</p> <p>With all the technological means to communicate in so many ways, we settle for whoever is nearby. But we still mostly email with the people we work with, because even walking down the hall to see them in person is too much. And then we complain about social media, which was only invented because we suck.</p> <p>Yes, people are lousy. I learned a lot about human nature, because I had breast cancer in 2015. I was frail, I was withdrawn, and I lost people. People forgot about me. People forgot to ask. At first everyone sends bouquets, but flowers die. Cancer is not contagious but all disease feels catchy, the atmosphere is pungent with sickness and it might just mug you. I had a friend I saw almost every day, but after I was diagnosed with breast cancer, I never saw her. Where did she go? Where did everybody go? My world got so small.</p> <p>Dogs do not give up \u2013 even on the owners who treat them badly. What a gorgeous persistence.</p> <p>Augusta looked me directly in the eye with the intensity of the wolf she descended from. Human beings don\u2019t do that. Human beings have too much to be ashamed of.</p> <p>Augusta walked with me without a leash. In Greenwich Village, people loved seeing the black dog being followed around by her blonde owner.</p> <p>Augusta would not go out with anyone else without me. She could not be separated from me. She was a herding dog and her job was to mind me. She made circles around me.</p> <p>She surrounds me.</p> <p>She is still with me.</p> <p>She is the best thing that ever happened to me.</p> <p>She is the love of my life. I am so sorry for the rare times we were apart, because I could never have had enough time with her. I will never love anyone the way I love Augusta. It was about a time and place and situation that only could have happened with Augusta, who I love so much and too much.</p> <p><em>Next week: author Julia Pierpoint on her therapist</em></p>",

Strategists on both sides, though, say that wins in such states would be the \u201cicing on the cake\u201d.</p> <p>\u201cNone of these states will be critical in getting to 270,\u201d said <a href=\"https://www.270strategies.com/our-team/mitch-stewart/\">Mitch Stewart</a>, Obama\u2019s 2012 battleground states director who now runs the firm 270 Strategies, in reference to the number of electoral votes needed to win the presidency.</p> <p>Florida, which offers the most votes of any traditional battleground state, will be a priority for Clinton. A win there would likely hand her the presidency, Stewart said. </p> <p>The Obama 2012 campaign, Stewart said, gamed out 42 possible paths to victory. </p> <p>\u201cClinton probably has a lot more pathways to 270 with Trump on the ticket,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are also probably new pathways there on the Republican side as well.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018We\u2019re constantly assessing and reassessing the race\u2019</h2> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/07/donald-trump-hillary-clinton-general-election-fundraising\">Party of one?

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-09T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>For all the criticism it has shipped for that decision to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/06/liverpool-fans-allocated-europa-league-final\" title=\"\">stage this year\u2019s Europa League final in a ground so small</a> it barely makes the list of Europe\u2019s 100 largest football stadiums, we can see how Uefa might have arrived at the conclusion that it was a fiendishly clever plan. Or at least pretended it was a fiendishly clever plan. For all the indignant observations from disgruntled fans that they were <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I91DJZKRxs\" title=\"\">\u201cgonna need a bigger boat\u201d</a>, the panjandrums concerned could argue that the denouement of Jaws, the film from which this famous line hails, proves it ain\u2019t necessarily so.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/07/liverpool-daniel-sturridge-jurgen-klopp-europa-league-final\">Liverpool\u2019s Daniel Sturridge shows desire to become J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s main man</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Yes, we know Quint met a grisly end. And yes, that part of the Orca wasn\u2019t chewed to kindling sank, leaving Hooper and Brody to kick their way back to shore clinging to a piece of wreckage. But for all those minor inconveniences, the fact of the matter is they got the job done. So, while far from ideally sized, their boat <em>was</em> big enough. Crucially, it was also small enough to contribute massively to the tension of the occasion. That said, we can only speculate that Quint\u2019s famous Indianapolis speech might have lost a little something in the telling had it been delivered from the comparative safety of the mess room of \u2013 well, a suitably armoured vessel the size of the Indianapolis.</p> <p>Similarly, a bigger stadium would be ideal for the Europa League final, but for those lucky enough to get a ticket to the match the intimate setting of Basel\u2019s St Jakob-Park for a major European final should make for a splendidly memorable and tense occasion. Given the choice, where would you rather have seen Prince play? As a small speck giving it big licks on the stage of some soulless enorm-o-dome or as a slightly bigger speck wigging out a couple of feet in front of you at one of those fabled gigs in what was ostensibly his own Paisley Park front parlour?</p> <p>This intimacy is about the only positive that can be drawn from what appears to have been another completely ludicrous decision made by one of many football governing bodies whose interest in the needs of fans has long been an afterthought. Having seen their team contest 14 different Europa League matches this season in locations as exotic and diverse as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/nov/05/liverpool-rubin-kazan-europa-league-match-report\" title=\"\">the Republics of Tatarstan</a> and Mancunia, many Liverpool fans will be left with their noses pressed forlornly up against the glass for the all-important decider against Sevilla.</p> <p>Thousands of ticketless fans will ignore the advice of both Uefa and their club overlords to stay away, choosing instead to answer <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/may/06/jurgen-klopp-liverpool-tickets-europa-league-final\" title=\"\">J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s exhortation</a> for them to pay a visit to lovely Basel even if they can\u2019t attend the game. Once there, they will be herded to an officially designated fan zone, which they will hastily depart for an alternative unapproved local fun zone upon discovering there\u2019s no beer on sale.</p> <p>Having paid \u00a3900 for flights to a city where many hotels are charging \u00a3800 or more for a minimum three-night stay, those supporters with and without tickets will be able to enjoy <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/jan/27/switzerland.europe\" title=\"\">the myriad delights on offer</a> to the discerning football fan in Basel: a stroll along the banks of the Rhine and on through the beautiful Old Town, the highest concentration of museums in Switzerland and Big Mac meals that cost \u00a310.34 in a city where the cost of living is almost 40% higher than that of London.</p> <p>Intriguingly, when Uefa revealed its new Europa League brand identity last August it portentously announced \u201cthe importance of togetherness is expressed in a circular \u2018energy wave\u2019 that radiates from the trophy forming the new logo of the tournament\u201d. Admittedly, this dedication to unity came some time after the selection of a 35,000-capacity ground for this year\u2019s final but the meagre allocation of tickets on offer to Liverpool season ticket holders \u2013 at least one in three will be disappointed \u2013 suggests Uefa\u2019s dedication to togetherness is questionable.</p> <p>Indeed, the more one looks at it, the more that \u201ccircular energy wave\u201d seems to represent the ring of \u201cvery tight\u201d security it has promised to install around St Jakob-Park in an attempt to make sure ticketless supporters don\u2019t get anywhere near the place.</p> <p>We have been here before. When explaining the revamp of European football\u2019s second-tier competition from the Uefa Cup into the unwieldy, bloated and often unloved behemoth it is today, the since disgraced Uefa president Michel Platini said: \u201cThese changes will improve this historic competition which is very important for Uefa and for European football, as it gives more fans, players and clubs the thrill of European club football.\u201d</p> <p>One of many inconveniences old Michel could not have foreseen back then was a time when tens of thousands of angry Liverpool fans were harrumphing about not being able to see their team contest the final of this year\u2019s competition due to his organisation\u2019s silliness.</p> <p>\u201cThe number of supporters requesting final tickets varies from club to club and, of course, it is impossible to predict in advance which clubs will reach the final,\u201d a Uefa spokesman explained last week, pointing out the obvious to simpletons foolish enough to think tournament football might be as predictable as the election processes of those who run it.</p> <p>Quite apart from the fact that Sevilla\u2019s third consecutive final appearance means it isn\u2019t <em>that</em> difficult to foresee who\u2019ll be in the shake-up, an average attendance of 45,000 in six finals since Uefa\u2019s overhaul might have provided a clue. Many are called, but few are chosen.</p>",

Its co-chair Alex Chalmers resigned, claiming that a large proportion of members \u201chave some kind of problem with Jews\u201d.<br /></p> <p>Last month, the <a href=\"http://www.nus.org.uk/\">National Union of Students</a> elected Malia Bouattia as its first Muslim president. She immediately <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/21/nus-president-malia-bouattia-must-redress-concerns-over-antisemitism-say-jewish-students\">came under fire</a> for earlier comments in which she described Birmingham university as \u201csomething of a Zionist outpost\u201d and references to \u201cZionist-led media outlets\u201d.<br /></p> <p>Bouattia responded to criticism by saying: \u201cFor me to take issue with Zionist politics is not me taking issue with being Jewish \u2026 it is a political argument, not one of faith.\u201d<br /></p> <p>Mirvis, who is chief rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations, the main Orthodox Jewish community in the UK, has said that opposition to Zionism was often thinly-veiled antisemitism. He warned students against backing \u201cthe anti-Zionist clarion call\u201d.<br /></p> <p>Jewish leaders across the religious and political spectrum have said opposition to the policies of the Israeli government risks sliding into antisemitism, and that the word Zionist is used by some people as a term of abuse. Mirvis also told the Sunday Times that he was \u201ctotally amazed and frankly horrified\u201d by former London mayor Ken Livingstone\u2019s comments that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/29/ken-livingstone-marxist-book-lenni-brenner-defence-israel-comments\">Adolf Hitler supported Zionism in the 1930s</a>. \u201cWhen asked for a response to a blatantly antisemitic communication that was sent out, [Livingstone] failed to condemn it, tried to explain it away and then, just unbelievably, brought Hitler into the picture in such an insensitive way, aggravating the situation,\u201d said Mirvis.</p> <p>Labour <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/28/ken-livingstone-suspended-from-labour-after-hitler-remarks\">suspended Livingstone\u2019s membership</a> for \u201cbringing the party into disrepute\u201d. Corbyn said: \u201cWe are not tolerating antisemitism in any form whatsoever in our party.\u201d</p> <p>Sadiq Khan, who was elected as mayor of London on Thursday, called for his predecessor to be expelled from the party.</p> <p>In his first public engagement as London mayor, Khan is due to attend a service in north London on Sunday to commemorate the millions of Jews killed in the Holocaust. Mirvis will also attend the Yom HaShoah (Holocaust remembrance day) event.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The patron saint of quality television is 90 years old today. When his <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/08/great-barrier-reef-could-be-david-attenboroughs-last-proper-documentary\" title=\"\">Great Barrier Reef series</a> was broadcast at the start of the year, it was reported that this was likely to be his last series, or at least his last made on location. But it\u2019s difficult to believe David Attenborough won\u2019t always be around. For most people who grew up in 20th-century Britain, he is not just a national treasure but a permanent fixture. But then, that\u2019s what we thought about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/great-barrier-reef\" title=\"\">the Great Barrier Reef</a>.</p> <p>Just before the reef series was broadcast, Attenborough told a journalist that his first dive on the reef is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/dec/21/david-attenborough-great-barrier-reef-australia\" title=\"\">the moment in his career he remembers most vividly</a>: \u201cSuddenly, this amazing world with a thousand things you didn\u2019t know existed is revealed right in front of you, all wonderful colours and shapes. On land, the rainforest is comparable \u2013 but the difference is, you can walk for a day and see absolutely nothing. \u2018Where are all these bloody monkeys they are always on about?\u2019 But on a reef you see everything immediately.\u201d</p> <p>Greenpeace is campaigning to protect the Great Barrier Reef from new coalmines \u2013 huge mines that would threaten the reef directly through dredging and dumping, and indirectly by adding significantly to dangerous climate change. The more coal that is burned, the warmer and more acidic the oceans become. Warming ocean temperatures are the main cause of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/17/great-barrier-reef-worst-destruction\" title=\"\">recent bleaching of the reef</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c44c2af289bdc5728568fc0fb11a21e896c26723\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c44c2af289bdc5728568fc0fb11a21e896c26723/0_41_2908_1745/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Shot from the Great Barrier Reef television series shows David Attenborough with Mark Taylor\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Attenborough\u2019s point about the high visibility of the reef\u2019s biodiversity is of key significance.\u2019 David Attenborough with Mark Taylor during the filming of the Great Barrier Reef series</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC/Atlantic Productions</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite the much-publicised collapse of the coal industry, coal-fired power stations are still the world\u2019s biggest source of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, and bear an even greater share of historical emissions. That gives the industry primary responsibility for the climactic changes we are experiencing now, including the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef.</p> <p>The reef has undergone three mass bleaching events that we know of, all during the last 20 years. The first two affected about 60% of the reef; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/19/great-barrier-reef-93-of-reefs-hit-by-coral-bleaching\" title=\"\">this year\u2019s has affected 93%</a>, and about half of the bleached coral is expected to die. New technologies, coupled with new commitment from the world\u2019s governments, might save the reef. But if we continue to burn fossil fuels, it has little chance of survival.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"726e37ad0222150d3a368eef21bab46860a6ea63\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/726e37ad0222150d3a368eef21bab46860a6ea63/0_0_1457_2200/662.jpg\" alt=\"A colourful scene on the Great Barrier Reef\" width=\"662\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018As we delay phasing out coal and other fossil fuels, we condemn natural wonders such as the reef to extinction.\u2019 The Great Barrier Reef in 2003</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: STR/AFP/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Attenborough\u2019s point about the high visibility of the reef\u2019s biodiversity \u2013 the fact that you can see hundreds of the reef\u2019s many thousands of species on a single dive \u2013 is of key significance. One of Greenpeace\u2019s original goals was to provide people with a clear view of what industries tried to hide \u2013 environmental destruction carried out away from prying eyes, normally at sea. But the reef is one of the world\u2019s most dived areas. Amazingly, despite this, the Australian government is ignoring this environmental catastrophe and refusing to recognise the damage caused by coal.</p> <p>Climate campaigners are used to trying to motivate people around a disaster that unfolds silently over decades, but this is different. You are living through the destruction of the Great Barrier Reef. Half of it is dead or dying now, because of our addiction to fossil fuels.</p> <p>James Delingpole, chief climate change denier on the far-right website Breitbart, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamesDelingpole/status/722716826300522496\" title=\"\">tweeted</a>: \u201cI\u2019ve seen it already so I don\u2019t care. In fact I\u2019m glad because it makes my experience rarer and more special.\u201d</p> <p>As we delay phasing out coal and other fossil fuels, we condemn natural wonders such as the reef to extinction. But we can still learn from the huge bleached skeleton sunk off Australia\u2019s coast. There is no slack left in the system.</p> <p>We cannot keep heading in the same direction and then perform some miraculous handbrake turn just before we reach \u201ccatastrophic climate change\u201d. Climate change is already catastrophic, and it\u2019s going to get more catastrophic. The faster we get our act together the more we will save, but every delay in cleaning up our act, every new coalmine and every new airport, is a death sentence for something or someone.</p> <p>The signing of the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/apr/30/paris-agreement-is-a-strong-signal-that-we-will-solve-climate-crisis-al-gore-says\" title=\"\">Paris agreement</a> a fortnight ago is a real cause for optimism in the fight against climate change. With 175 signatories \u2013 the most countries ever to sign any international agreement at the same time \u2013 it felt like the start of a new era. With the Great Barrier Reef dying before our eyes, it couldn\u2019t have come at a better time. Happy birthday, David Attenborough.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Not long after my mother died in 2014, less than eight months after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, my dad and I performed a ritual familiar to anyone who has lost someone they love: we went through her closet to decide what to hold on to. We kept her favorite pieces, like the cozy purple cardigan in which her scent still lingered, a few items of jewelry and her scarves.</p> <p>A few months later, my father gave me her laptop. I needed a new computer and was grateful to have it. But its contents \u2013 photos from trips, a draft of her thesis from divinity school, Van Morrison albums in her iTunes \u2013 kept pulling me down rabbit holes. Whenever I sat down to do some work, I\u2019d find myself lost in her files, searching for ways to feel close to her again. </p> <p>Her computer activity was like a breadcrumb trail through her inner life: her interests, her hopes and her plans for the future, even those that would never come true.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/may/08/erma-bombeck-writer-motherhood-columns-books\">Why Erma Bombeck is still the patron saint of motherhood comedy</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The bookmarks in her Safari browser served as a compass on a journey into my mother\u2019s mind. She used them like sticky notes, saving articles to return to, museum exhibitions to attend and beautiful hotels to visit. She bookmarked things like EssentialVermeer.com, a Wikipedia entry for theological aesthetics, how to dress like a Parisian, and endless recommended reading lists.</p> <p>As I scrolled through them, I wondered about these clues: were they hints for how I should live my life? Suggestions for places I should go? Ideas to discover? The very first bookmark was \u201cresources for a spiritual journey\u201d. Was that a little nudge from her? I explored each site methodically, not wanting to miss a word or a photograph, just in case I overlooked something from my mom: here\u2019s what you need to know, here\u2019s what I really loved, here\u2019s how much I loved you.</p> <p>Of course, not all bookmarks were treasure troves \u2013 her health insurance company\u2019s site, for example. And some links no longer worked. One took me to the old site of the Opera National de Paris. \u201cYou are looking for something?\u201d the 404 error message read in broken English. \u201cYeah, my mom,\u201d I thought. \u201cYou seen her?\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>That was my mom, the William Wallace of chemo: our fearless chief, bravely leading us into a gruesome battle.</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Each bookmark corresponded to a time in her life. I pinpointed when she moved to London (places to stay in Cornwall and upcoming shows at the Tate) and when I got married (my wedding website). And there, toward the end of the list, a YouTube video of Kenneth Branagh delivering the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-yZNMWFqvM\">St Crispin\u2019s Day speech</a> from Henry V marked when cancer entered her life: my little brother sent it to the family when her chemo began, preparing us for the battle ahead.</p> <p>A month later, she sent us Mel Gibson\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEOOZDbMrgE\">\u201cFreedom\u201d speech</a> from Braveheart. I clicked on the bookmark and rewatched Gibson in his blue face paint, yelling: \u201cThey may take our lives, but they may never take our freedom!\u201d That was my mom, the William Wallace of chemo: our fearless chief, bravely leading us into a gruesome battle.</p> <p>But walking in mom\u2019s online footsteps was also like crossing a field riddled with land mines. Without warning, something would trigger my grief and my heart was ripped open again. The most painful were those that came just before the cancer battle speeches, before she knew she was sick. There, plain as day, were her plans and hopes for a future she thought stretched out before her.</p> <p>\u201c15 ideas for a children\u2019s discovery garden\u201d, read one bookmark from not long ago. This was my mom looking for ways to make her house magical for her grandchildren. At the time she had just one, my one-year-old daughter Maeve, and I could see that being a grandmother was going to be the defining role of the rest of her life. </p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>But walking in mom\u2019s online footsteps was also like crossing a field riddled with land mines</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Recently, I stumbled upon her bookmark of a CS Lewis quote: \u201cWe do not want merely to see beauty, though, God knows, even that is bounty enough. We want something else which can hardly be put into words \u2013 to be united with the beauty we see, to pass into it, to receive it into ourselves, to bathe in it, to become part of it.\u201d</p> <p>This is what my mom sought throughout her life, and she was more successful than most at finding it. For me, the quote also evokes the day she died and how I\u2019ve come to understand her death. She died on 15 December 2014, eight months after she was diagnosed.</p> <p>The days and weeks in late November and early December that preceded my mother\u2019s death had been dark, overcast and cold. The grim scenery seemed to reflect the sorrow and fear that had overtaken my family. I kept taking photos at twilight of the dark silhouettes of tree branches set against the purple sky.</p> <p>But the day my mom died was different. I came downstairs early that morning to relieve my older brother who had kept vigil by her bed all night. I sat alone with her as sunlight flooded in through the windows, filtering through the pink orchids that lined the windowsill. </p> <p>As I sat there, I remembered what my mom had told me about the day I was born. The hospital had been busy that August morning but soon after she gave birth to me, my mom and I were left in a room alone. When she told the story, she always emphasized how wonderful it was to be on our own, just the two of us, how peacefully we slept. That\u2019s how I started my life.</p> <p>And that\u2019s how the last day of my mom\u2019s life began: just the two of us. I held her hand and watched her labored breathing. Looking at her, I thought about how I must have slept on her chest as a baby, taking in her warmth and feeling so safe in her arms.</p> <p>That afternoon, my mother took her final breath. My two brothers and I left my father sobbing next to her hospital bed, which had been set up in the living room, and sat next to each other on a bench outside, watching the day\u2019s final rays of sunlight bathe the front yard. After days and weeks of grim winter darkness, the scenery was radiant.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2016/may/08/mothers-day-photos-before-they-were-mom\">My mother before Mother's Day: readers' pictures and stories</a> </p> </aside>  <p>I couldn\u2019t help but think my mom had become part of the beauty around us. The light seemed more intense, the beauty more vibrant because she was there in it. I was surprised that such peace could be felt in the midst of that horrifying loss. I still cling to it and try to revive it in my memory.</p> <p>My mom\u2019s very last bookmark is for the Phillips House at Massachusetts general hospital, a place where she could get medical care and maybe spend her final days. The bookmark signifies to me that it was an idea she wanted to return to \u2013 an option to consider.</p> <p>But her decline accelerated so fast. She died in hospice care at her home on Martha\u2019s Vineyard.</p> <p>The next bookmark is mine. I created it eight months after she died. It just says \u201cLife begins\u201d, and it\u2019s for the program for expectant mothers at New York Methodist Hospital in Brooklyn, where my son was born 14 months after my mom died.</p> <p>When I first noticed these bookmarks back-to-back, it took my breath away, as if I\u2019d stumbled on an essential clue to some mystery. Sitting right there was my mom\u2019s disappearance from the world and then my son\u2019s miraculous entry.</p> <p>I\u2019ve kept adding my own bookmarks to my mother\u2019s list: 99 \u201cessential\u201d restaurants in Brooklyn, 25 weekend getaways from New York City, places where Maeve could take dance lessons. Now my daydreams and thoughts for the future are piled on to my mom\u2019s. From my mom\u2019s happy life to its tragic ending to me trying to figure out how to be a person in the world without her, it\u2019s all there.</p>",

      "body": "<p>A man comes into the emergency room in Jackson, Mississippi. Six-foot-four, 240lbs. \u201cSolid, brick muscle\u201d, recalls Dr Robert Galli, a professor of emergency medicine and toxicology at the University of Mississippi medical center (UMMC) in Jackson. </p> <p>\u201cThis big guy was fumbling around in the street, he was rolling around in the grass, he had no shirt on, his pants and underwear were down to his shoes, and he\u2019s flopping around in the rain with about 15 people taking videos of him.\u201d</p> <p>Someone called 911. First the fire department arrived, followed by police, then paramedics, who ascertained from the surrounding crowd that the man smoked \u201cSpice\u201d.</p> <p>Spice is known as fake weed or synthetic marijuana because it grabs hold of the same receptors in the brain. But the lab-made powder bears little resemblance to the plant Americans increasingly see as benign.</p> <p><br /></p> <p>And because synthetic marijuana is ever evolving, standard urine drug screenings don\u2019t detect it. Most confirmed poisonings are ferreted out by epidemiologists, after the bizarre symptoms land users in the hospital.</p> <p>\u201cSure enough, this guy was using Spice regularly if he wanted to get high, and now he got a hold of the bad stuff,\u201d Galli said.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/may/01/drug-overdose-epidemic-organ-donors-data\">Drug overdose epidemic has driven increase in organ donors, data shows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In several states across the US, the class of drugs known as Spice is causing a rash of poisonings that doctors say are fuelled by residents\u2019 desire to get high without failing drug tests, as the continually changing class of drugs has eluded authorities. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>\u201cRogue chemists\u201d avoid illegality, and help their customers avoid drug screenings, by delivering constantly changing, untested formulations to the American public. And the tactic appears to have proved successful, daring drug war era legislation to keep up. </p> <p>\u201cThe experimentation on this is with the American public,\u201d said<strong> </strong>Galli. \u201cIt\u2019s not like these are given to animals to see how they respond. These are given to human animals, and they get it on the street.\u201d </p> <p>Mississippians make up an outsized chunk of those reported poisoned by synthetic marijuana each year. The state was almost solely responsible for a massive spike in poisonings the weekend of Easter 2015. </p> <p>In 2015, Mississippians reported 1,362 poisonings from synthetic cannabinoids, with17 deaths suspected to be related to the drugs. The tiny state is just 367 poisonings shy of the number of poisonings reported New York state, where 16m more people live, and where the cheap drug has reportedly ravaged homeless communities in New York City and working class towns such as <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/12/magazine/spike-nation.html?_r=0\">Syracuse</a>. </p> <p>Synthetic marijuana poisoning symptoms usually include violent outbursts and paranoia; more serious symptoms, such as kidney failure, stroke, and fast and irregular heartbeat, have all been documented in medical literature.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d8f7a97e3518cd977d28b316d77aac1e1e72790e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d8f7a97e3518cd977d28b316d77aac1e1e72790e/0_76_2586_1552/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Synthetic marijuana\u2019 is also known as Spice.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Synthetic marijuana\u2019 is also known as Spice.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By contrast, many researchers consider <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=xpZhjBuDkuwC&amp;pg=PR3&amp;source=gbs_selected_pages&amp;cad=3#v=onepage&amp;q=marijuana&amp;f=false\">marijuana less addictive and toxic than caffeine</a>, despite its mind-altering properties. Death by marijuana is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marijuana-deaths-2014_us_56816417e4b06fa68880a217\">almost unheard of</a>. Recently, however, some researchers have concluded that regular marijuana use can be harmful for teens\u2019 brain development, affecting problem solving and memory, and there is <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://learnaboutmarijuanawa.org/consumers.htm\">some evidence that marijuana may amplify the risk of psychosis</a> or serious mental health issues for those already at risk. </p> <p>A group of high-profile doctors recently came out in favor of legalization in part because the group believes marijuana prohibition causes \u201cthe proliferation of dangerous synthetic cannabinoids\u201d. <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://dfcr.org/\">Doctors for Cannabis Regulation</a>, which counts a former surgeon general among its membership, list this in its \u201cdeclaration of principles\u201d against prohibition. </p> <p>A <a href=\"http://www.medscape.com/features/slideshow/lifestyle/2015/public/overview#18\">2014 Medscape poll</a> of physicians found that doctors broadly supported regulation of marijuana. Seventy-nine per cent of physicians supported some form of legalization, either for medical purposes or full legal regulation. </p> <p>Together, Mississippi and New York make up almost 40% of the synthetic marijuana poisonings reported in 2015, of the nearly 8,000 nationwide. If the sparse data on poisonings and emergency department visits is to be believed, 2015 was one of the drug\u2019s most damaging years since its introduction to the United States almost a decade ago. </p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Spice is commonly sold at gas stations or corner stores in colorful foil packaging, advertising flavors such as strawberry. Chemicals included in the packets can range from relatively benign compounds developed by university chemists, such as JWH-018, to those doctors believe are dangerous, such as AB-Chminaca. </p> <p>Synthetics first hit the market around 2006, popping up in smoke shops, unregulated and labeled \u201cnot for human consumption\u201d. Despite the substances being manufactured in illicit (<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/may/01/chinese-labs-legal-highs-west-drugs\">and sometimes filthy</a>) Chinese laboratories, doctors now believe that the synthetics that hit the market 10 years ago were chemicals hijacked from pharmacologists\u2019 published research. </p> <p>Some scientists now believe that drug dealers read their research, sent the formulas to China for manufacturing, then shipped them into the US for sale. Once the materials were in the states, traffickers dissolved the powdered chemicals with acetone-like thinners, mixed that liquid with snow cone flavorings, and sprayed it onto tea leaves packaged in colorful foils.</p> <p>One such example is a <a href=\"http://www.clemson.edu/ces/departments/chemistry/people/faculty/huffman.html\">molecule</a> developed by John W Huffman, JWH-018, who, as an organic chemistry professor from Clemson University, developed the molecule hoping it could provide nausea relief and appetite stimulation to patients without the euphoria of marijuana.</p> <p>Around 2007, Huffman began receiving calls from \u201c<a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3567606/\">law enforcement agencies, the military, and panicked parents</a>\u201d who discovered JWH-018 in Spice users who had reacted badly.</p> <p>In 2011, as the popularity of the drugs peaked among teenagers, the Drug Enforcement Agency took a swing at the problem with its biggest hammer: a Schedule I drug classification that outlawed molecules such as JWH-018, and allowed new ones to be emergency-classified as illegal. </p> <p>Whether that reduced demand is unclear. The emergency scheduling did, however, appear to trigger a chemical arms race as \u201crogue\u201d chemists produced ever more mangled cannabinoids to avoid illegality. </p> <p>The most disturbing recent additions to the chemical spectrum that makes up Spice, according to toxicologists and clinicians at UMMC, are AB-Chminaca and MAB-Chminaca. Unlike marijuana, which only binds partially to cannabis receptors in the brain, these new synthetic cannabinoids grab ferociously on to neural receptors.

The chemicals were only identified in Mississippi after doctors at the medical center analyzed drug samples using a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometer, an hourlong process performed by a machine generally available only at research institutions.</p> <p>According to two agents of the Mississippi bureau of narcotics as well as Galli, the first death was of a man who took one puff of a \u201cSpice\u201d joint in a Jackson city club in March, collapsed, and never regained consciousness before dying the same night. </p> <p>By November, the supply of AB- and MAB-Chminaca still hadn\u2019t dried up in Mississippi. Another seven patients were reportedly hospitalized at UMMC over Thanksgiving weekend, this time vomiting. For emergency department staff, this only complicated matters: Spice patients are generally sedated until the drug wears off, but these patients ran the risk of choking on their own vomit. </p> <p>Until recently, Spice was associated with the poor and the young. In 2011, it was the second-most used drug behind marijuana among students in the 8th, 10th and 12th grades, according to the national Monitoring the Future survey. More than one in 10 had tried Spice.</p> <p>Mississippi bureau of narcotics agents said the backgrounds of users, ranging from ages 12 to 64 and from nearly every class of society, were so diverse as to make detecting a pattern impossible. Some of the only survey information on who uses synthetic marijuana shows that nearly a quarter (24%) of <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4048873/\">regular marijuana smokers</a> currently use the drug, but little more is clear. </p> <p>But as Monitoring the Future shows use declining among teenagers, anecdotal reports suggest that authorities\u2019 inability to detect Spice has made it appealing to those most frequently drug tested. </p> <p>A handful of adverse reactions were reported among football players, athletes who are still sanctioned for smoking marijuana. Robert Nkemdiche, a high-profile player at the University of Mississippi expected to be an NFL draft pick in 2016, fell out of a hotel window after allegedly smoking synthetic marijuana, <a href=\"http://www.foxsports.com/college-football/outkick-the-coverage/ole-miss-s-robert-nkemdiche-s-use-of-synthetic-marijuana-led-to-hotel-fall-121415\">Fox Sports</a> reported. His brother Denzel, also an Ole Miss player, was allegedly hospitalized after standing on the roof of a building, paranoid and wrapped in a blanket. </p> <p>The New England Patriots defensive end <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jan/21/chandler-jones-patriots-synthetic-marijuana-nfl\">Chandler Jones</a> smoked synthetic marijuana before he showed up at a Massachusetts police station, half-naked and disoriented, in January. </p> <p>Truck drivers, <a href=\"http://www.hood.army.mil/leaders/policies/corps/DHR-02.pdf\">soldiers</a>,<a href=\"http://trib.com/news/state-and-regional/roughnecks-wanted-good-pay-hard-work-drug-tests-required/article_63081f01-754b-5ddc-b129-d272ba5dd5fb.html\"> oil rig workers</a>, hospital staff, and even <a href=\"http://www.walmartapplication.info/walmart-interview/\">Walmart</a> employees are regularly drug tested in the US.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-09T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>At first appearances, Dan Vo\u2019s new range of wool jackets for men appear to be pieces of well-made clothing with the price tag to match. Behind that appearance however is a precise method of design, where every part of the jacket has been cut exactly from a piece of fabric in a jigsaw pattern to ensure there is no waste of material in making it.</p> <p>Vo, a Scotland-based fashion designer, has designed a coat in which the uncut arms, collar, front, back, pockets and other sections all fit together perfectly on the piece of fabric. When they are cut out to make the jacket, she can then avoid wasting material, as is typically the case when conventional coats are made.</p> <p>\u201cIf you had a normal pattern, you would have every single individual piece lying next to each other but it would not be so close to be attached so you have gaps in between. They cut around it so you have pieces there that you cannot use. And the way that I try to construct it is that every single thing matches,\u201d she said.</p> <p>Originally from Germany of Vietnamese descent, Vo is a proponent of the \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/sustainable-fashion-blog/2015/jan/14/10-things-learned-zero-waste-fashion-industry\">Zero Waste</a>\u201d movement within the fashion industry, which aims to create little or no waste from producing clothes. In many cases, when a piece of clothing is being cut at present, she said, between 15% and 30% of a piece of fabric can be wasted as the designer cuts.</p> <p>To eliminate waste, Vo takes a 200cm by 145cm piece of fabric and fits the various pieces of arms and pockets in a jigsaw around the front and the back of the coat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"e033c5b47ca77c421b6a53c8c552b35ae5a88f65\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e033c5b47ca77c421b6a53c8c552b35ae5a88f65/1179_2491_1731_2163/800.jpg\" alt=\"Dan Vo.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dan Vo.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Similar methods of exacting measurements to cut down on waste <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/aug/23/digital-fabrication-housebuilding-headaches-facit-homes\">have also been used in house construction</a> in recent years.</p> <p>Positioning the patterns in this way eliminates wastage, but takes more time, Vo says.</p> <p>\u201cWhen you create a garment in the normal way you can be very creative; you can displace the patterns everywhere and it is easier to get the fit right. But when you work with zero waste patterns, you have to work with the rectangular shape that fits on the fabric so in that sense you are a bit limited but you can work around it,\u201d she said.</p> <p>\u201cThe point is that I am making something which is very wearable. People look at it and they would not have a clue that I am working in this way. I chose it because I think it is important to reduce the impact that we have on the environment. I think if you master this technique you can transfer it into so many different garments.\u201d</p> <p>Several campaign groups are pushing the fashion industry to reduce the levels of waste generated by clothes production.</p> <p><a href=\"http://fashionrevolution.org/\">Fashion Revolution</a>, a UK-based not-for-profit group which pushes for greater transparency and to tackle to environmental side effects of garment production, <a href=\"http://fashionrevolution.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/FashRev_Whitepaper_Dec2015_screen.pdf\">says just 20% of textiles are recycled each year</a>. In the UK, 2m tonnes of clothing and textiles are thrown away every year, according to a report from the group.</p> <p>\u201cWorking in the industry, just seeing how much we actually produce \u2013 besides everything else because it is quite polluting starting off with the raw material \u2013 it is already not very sustainable. But then when it comes to the process of making garments, most of the time it is done really quickly and there are lots of offcuts which are not recycled. Maybe a part of it is recycled but most of the time, the manufacturers just chuck it and it just goes to landfill,\u201d said Vo.</p> <p>In some cases, pieces of fabric may be thrown away due to secrecy amongdesigners who do not want others to be able to replicate their pieces, she said. </p> <p>Achieving the master design of Vo\u2019s jackets involved a lot of trial and error. When one piece is changed, the rest of the pieces must be moved around the master shape. Where a typical design could take a few days, the jacket took months. \u201cEvery time you figure out something is too short you have to move everything around again. It is like a puzzle almost,\u201d says Vo, who got faster once she worked out the first pattern.</p> <p>But Vo\u2019s method can be challenged by patterns such as a check or a herringbone, which must be cut a certain way. \u201cI can\u2019t just make anything I want. It always just has to fit within the space again. On the other hand you can just work your way around it, you just have to experiment.\u201d</p> <p>Vo is about to go into production with her first range of the jackets, which will be produced in Scotland. They will go on sale in October aimed at 25- to 45-year-old men. Priced at between \u00a3450 and \u00a3500, they are firmly in the higher end of the market although she says that collaboration with a high street brand could mean they are available for a wider audience in the future. </p> <p>\u201cI am a supporter of slow fashion. I believe in buying a garment that you wear for longer, not buying a lot of cheaper clothes. What disturbs me is not just that we have pre-consumer waste, essentially the offcuts that we produce and we chuck them, but also waste after the clothes are bought.</p> <p>\u201cWe are producing so many garments and the turnaround is so quick so the lifecycle of clothes is so short.\u201d<br /></p> <ul> <li>You can read our archive of The innovators columns <a href=\"http://www.biginnovationcentre.com/the-innovators-column\">on the Big Innovation Centre website</a> where you will find more information on how the Big Innovation Centre supports innovative enterprise in Britain and globally.<br /></li> </ul>",

I have to speak to chief executives, people who voted Conservative last time, Ukip or stayed at home.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0ae6c774b72d538a845d5ecacaa754fbaa8dadbc\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0ae6c774b72d538a845d5ecacaa754fbaa8dadbc/0_276_4500_2700/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jeremy Corbyn stands in front of a Labour campaign poster before the local elections last Thursday.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jeremy Corbyn stands in front of a Labour campaign poster before the local elections last Thursday.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Matt Dunham/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Khan\u2019s intervention will reignite the battle within the Labour party over whether Corbyn\u2019s decision to move his party to the left is the correct strategy to chart a course to a 2020 general election victory.</p> <p>Diane Abbott, a key Corbyn ally, said as the polls closed on Thursday night that if Khan won in London, it would be \u201call about Jeremy\u201d; but Khan suggested he had taken an inclusive approach, spending as much time in the traditionally Tory London boroughs such as Kensington and Chelsea as he did in Hackney or Camden.</p> <p>Khan has repeatedly sought to distance himself from Corbyn, holding few joint campaign appearances and leaving him off his publicity material. He also urged his leader to \u201cget a grip\u201d on accusations of antisemitism in the party.</p> <p>With almost all the local election votes counted, Labour had lost a net 24 council seats in England, but narrowed the gap with the Conservatives in its national vote share.</p> <p>The results were better for Labour than many experts had predicted. Corbyn\u2019s election strategist, Jon Trickett, described them as \u201cfantastic\u201d \u2013 but Corbyn\u2019s critics say they show the party is far from on track to achieve a general election victory in four years\u2019 time.</p> <p>The election expert Prof John Curtice told the Sunday Telegraph: \u201cOppositions that are clearly on the road back to power give their opponents a drubbing, not just a mild poke in the ribs.\u201d</p>",

They may have been too young to have taken part in the 1969 uprising that began when lesbian and gay patrons fought back during a police raid, but they were acutely aware of the place in history that the bar enjoys.</p> <p>So is Barack Obama. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/white-house-poised-to-create-first-monument-to-gay-rights/2016/05/03/0811810e-1154-11e6-93ae-50921721165d_story.html\">According</a> to <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/04/us/politics/obama-may-create-monument-to-gay-rights-movement.html?_r=0\">reports</a>, the president is poised to declare the tiny, railed garden opposite the inn and some surrounding streets a <a href=\"http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/blm_special_areas/NLCS/monuments.html\">national monument</a>, in tribute to the struggle for gay equality that began there, then turned into a worldwide movement.</p> <p>On Monday, the interior secretary, Sally Jewell, will hold meetings with veterans of the riots and local officials. An announcement could come as early as June, to coincide with the annual gay pride march that commemorates the Stonewall riots.</p> <p>\u201cIf they build an actual monument, I hope it\u2019s made out of the bricks that were thrown at the police,\u201d said Lady Bunny, a drag queen, DJ, promoter, TV star and founder of the now-defunct <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2015/may/15/wig-out-new-yorks-hair-raising-90s-drag-queen-scene-in-pictures\">Wigstock</a> drag parades in the East Village who is almost never known by her legal name, Jon Ingle. </p> <p>\u201cAnd wigs, and psychedelic fabric, and syringes and Judy Garland album covers: it needs to evoke that raucous night when the freaks fought back. It was led by the hustlers and crazies, outsiders even amongst gays, who had nothing to lose.\u201d</p> <p>In fact, national monument status gives protection from destruction and development to \u201c<a href=\"http://www.blm.gov/wo/st/en/prog/blm_special_areas/NLCS/monuments.html\">objects of historic or scientific interest</a>\u201d.

Within days, the uprising changed from localized civil disobedience to a riot. Then came a spontaneous protest march, from Greenwich Village to Central Park.</p> <p>Those who walked were called every slur under the sun, but they kept on, setting an example not just for those who take part in the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2014/may/05/worlds-largest-gay-pride-parade-sao-paulo-video\">pride</a> marches and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/live/2016/mar/05/building-a-rainbow-nation-78ers-at-the-sydney-gay-and-lesbian-mardi-gras-2016-live\">parades</a> of today, but for thousands of demonstrations and tiny acts of defiance that often meet with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2007/may/28/russia.gayrights\">violent consequences</a>.</p> <p>The Stonewall\u2019s barman identifies himself as <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFQqyZYje14\">Fredd E Tree</a> \u2013 though he is universally known just as Tree, for his towering stature. Now 77, he was there that night in 1969, he said in a phone call, \u201cdancing the lindy hop with my queer friends\u201d.<br /></p> <p>On Monday, Tree will meet Secretary Jewell. Of the push to declare the area a national monument, he said: \u201cI think it\u2019s a marvellous idea. I hope people can get to vote on what kind of monument or or marker they would like to see here.\u201d</p> <p>At the time of the riot, Tree lived in Bushwick. He was known as a tough gang member who was nonetheless devoted to making frequent visits to his grandmother. In fact, he wasn\u2019t visiting granny. He was sneaking into Manhattan, to go to the Stonewall and other gay venues.</p> <p>Then, the main barroom adjoined the building next door, where there is now a nail salon. The current bar space led off that room, via an arch. That was where Tree was dancing in the early hours of 28 June 1969, when he heard and saw a commotion through the archway. It was a police raid.</p> <p>\u201cI saw them push this guy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know it was actually a woman, Storm\u00e9, and she turned around and hit the cop.\u201d </p> <p>Reports of details and even some names vary, but the room quickly descended into a chaos of pushing and punching. The Stonewall uprising was led by drag queens but the first punch was thrown by a butch lesbian.</p> <p>Storm\u00e9 DeLaverie <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2014/06/03/mourning-storme-delarverie-a-mother-of-the-stonewall-riots/\">died</a> in 2014, at the age of 93. She was a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/nov/30/new-york-chelsea-hotel\">fixture</a> on the scene for decades and in 1969 often performed as a male impersonator or drag king \u2013 an illegal act at the time.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My friends and I ran out when the fighting started and then we picked up rocks and started hurling them at the bar</p> <footer> <cite>Fredd E Tree, bartender</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The mafia, Tree said, ran New York\u2019s gay bars. On the night in question, the police did not raid the Stonewall to arrest homosexuals. The vice squad was after mafia bosses for laundering money and dodging licensing regulations. Raids were not uncommon, but they usually consisted of a shakedown and a few arrests by cops from the local precinct.</p> <p>\u201cThey would say, \u2018Come on, girls, wind it up,\u2019\u201d Tree said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t usually too violent, but we were still all sick of it.</p> <p>That night, when the vice squad came in with night sticks, yelling and shoving, the \u201cgirls\u201d snapped and just \u201cwent nuts\u201d, he said.</p> <p>\u201cMy friends and I ran out of a side door when the fighting started and then we picked up rocks from the park opposite and started hurling them at the bar.\u201d</p> <p>Some guys pulled up a parking meter and threw that. People came from other local venues and apartments and the uprising swelled. People began jumping on police patrol cars and breaking windows. By this time, the cops were barricaded inside the bar.</p> <p>\u201cWhen we ran out of ammunition, we started setting trash cans alight and throwing those,\u201d Tree said. \u201cThat\u2019s when the police riot squad arrived, because of course you cannot set fire to a bar with cops in it.\u201d</p> <p>He recalled injured protestors being treated in nearby Washington Square Park and Quakers from the local church coming to help.</p> <p>\u201cThat\u2019s why the Quakers still march at Pride every year and get a huge cheer,\u201d he said.</p> <p>There were several more nights of rioting. The following weekend culminated in a spontaneous protest march.</p> <p>\u201cI went down to the Stonewall with some friends and someone said, \u2018We\u2019re going to walk to Central Park,\u2019\u201d Tree said. \u201cI said, \u2018For what?\u2019 But I started walking with everyone anyway. </p> <p>\u201cWell, as we walked, people came out on to the sidewalks and yelled at us, \u2018Queer, fag, dyke, lezzie\u2019.

But it has been on the National Register of Historic Places since 1999 and a National Historic Landmark since 2000, thus escaping the fate of the legendary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/gallery/2015/nov/01/faces-from-the-heyday-of-punk-venue-cbgb-in-pictures\">CBGB</a> on the Bowery, the \u201ccradle of punk\u201d, which closed in 2006, to be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2012/feb/15/dying-days-cbgbs\">turned</a> into an expensive boutique.

He made a conscious decision \u2013 until last month \u2013 to not write about his support for Clinton.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re a Hillary supporter, you\u2019re kind of in this happy medium. Or really an unhappy medium,\u201d Koppelman said, \u201cwhere, by voicing support for Hillary Clinton, you\u2019re at once alienating college Republicans \u2013 who still view her basically as the antichrist \u2013 and you\u2019re alienating Bernie supporters who view her as this remnant of a time when Washington was extremely corrupt.\u201d</p> <p>Koppelman, who grew up in New York City, has spent his time at Harvard engaging in leftwing activism. He is involved in the Black Lives Matter movement and started a group called \u201cHarvard can\u2019t breathe\u201d, after Eric Garner died while being arrested in Staten Island, New York City. Garner\u2019s death was ruled a homicide by the medical examiner, but <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/dec/03/eric-garner-grand-jury-declines-indict-nypd-chokehold-death\">a grand jury decided</a> not to indict the officer who arrested him.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/may/07/harvard-fraternity-sorority-leadership-ban-drew-faust\">Harvard to ban members of single-sex clubs from student leadership roles</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Koppelman is still involved with those groups but said he had been conscious not to announce his support for Clinton to his fellow activists.</p> <p>\u201cIf you\u2019re engaged in activism and you\u2019re a part of the campus left, and then you choose to support Clinton\u2019s campaign \u2026 that\u2019s almost a traitorous act,\u201d Koppelman said.</p> <p>Not all Harvard\u2019s students are as reluctant to admit their support for Clinton. As a member of the Harvard for Hillary group, Janet Ho canvassed for Clinton during the New Hampshire primary. Ho, a 19-year-old freshman, is an open advocate for the former secretary of state, but admitted that being a Clinton supporter can be difficult.</p> <p>\u201cDo I feel more challenged by Bernie supporters? Yeah. Do I feel more challenged in general? Yes, I do,\u201d she said. Ho said she felt she had to \u201cjustify\u201d her backing for Clinton to Sanders fans.</p> <p>\u201cThey see the Hillary supporter as someone who doesn\u2019t really want as much equality as they do. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e6a7bb0a2ed4190687b13d43620e3fbc57d9043a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e6a7bb0a2ed4190687b13d43620e3fbc57d9043a/0_0_4896_2938/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Janet Ho speaks on her support of Hillary Clinton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Janet Ho speaks on her support for Hillary Clinton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Lorenz for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cLike: \u2018What do you mean why don\u2019t you want free tuition for everyone?

Sanders\u2019 support among young, passionate voters has seen <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/minutes/128747/sanders-campaign-knows-bernie-bros-problem\">reporting</a> on the \u201cBernie Bros\u201d phenomenon \u2013 the notion that some Sanders supporters use social media to attack Clinton and her supporters. </p> <p>Columnists in favour of Clinton have drawn special ire \u2013 sometimes in an aggressive way, sometimes in a sexist way, <a href=\"http://theslot.jezebel.com/bernie-sanders-campaign-is-concerned-about-the-berniebr-1755911898\">sometimes both</a>.</p> <p>In January, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/cascamike/status/691844891652001792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">it prompted</a> Sanders\u2019 \u201crapid response director\u201d, Mike Casca, to call for supporters to respect others in the race.

He wanted to address what he sees as a double standard among some Sanders supporters \u2013 that to support Clinton is to fail to support the fight for equality.</p> <p>\u201cAround the country, low income people, low income minorities are voting for Hillary in vast majorities,\u201d Koppelman said. </p> <p>\u201cAnd this attitude on college campuses that \u2018if you\u2019re an advocate for social justice issues, you need to be a Bernie supporter\u2019 is really dismissive of those people across the country who are voting for Hillary.</p> <p>\u201cIt\u2019s a \u2018we know better attitude\u2019 that is so emblematic of the very things Bernie Sanders is campaigning against.\u201d </p> <p>Sanders won the Indiana primary on Tuesday, but remains well behind Clinton in terms of delegates. It seems likely that Sanders supporters may soon have a decision to make on whether to commit to Clinton, following a primary campaign that has gone on longer and at times been sourer than most would have predicted. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/04/bernie-sanders-democratic-nomination-primary-us-election-hillary-clinton\">What is Sanders\u2019 route to the Democratic nomination?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI think Bernie Sanders supporters need to understand that Hillary is not the enemy here,\u201d Ho said.</p> <p>\u201cBut I don\u2019t feel bad or sad when she\u2019s challenged.

      "body": "<p>The pigeon is tender and rich, and everyone eats it with their hands, the better to pull the bones apart. Everyone, that is, save for Lucy Pendleton, who disapproves of what she regards as yet another sign of her companions\u2019 sybaritic decadence. She hates the way her friends eat and drink, their lack of moderation, their pretension. Why, she wonders, can\u2019t they feast on good American food, on roast beef with potatoes and gravy? Getting up from the table, she goes into the kitchen, bearing her grudge, if not an empty plate. And then it happens. Something inside gives way: \u201cThere was a bowl of mayonnaise with a glass plate set over it. She tiptoed to the bread box, took out a handful of rather leathery toast sticks, and carried them to the cupboard where she stood ravenously dipping them into the thick, rich, yellow sauce and eating them in big untidy bites.\u201d</p> <p>When I read this scene, which comes from <em>The Theoretical Foot</em>, a \u201clost\u201d novel by the food writer, <a href=\"http://mfkfisher.com/\" title=\"\">MFK Fisher</a>, I couldn\u2019t help but grin. I thought straight away of the bit in <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1582435812/mfkfishceleherli\" title=\"\"><em>With Bold Knife and Fork</em></a> in which she describes her devout love of mayonnaise, a devotion born of childhood deprivation: \u201cMy maternal grandmother, whose Victorian neuroses dictated our family table tastes until I was about 12, found salads generally suspect but would tolerate the occasional serving of some watery lettuce in a dish beside each plate. On it would be a dab or lump or blob, depending on the current cook, of what was quietly referred to as Boiled Dressing.\u201d What did this dressing, a concoction of cider vinegar, flour and salt, taste like? One of the great joys of Fisher\u2019s writing is her flamboyant way with disgust. \u201cIt seemed dreadful stuff,\u201d\u00a0she goes on. \u201cEnough to harm one\u2019s soul.\u201d</p> <p>In <em>The Theoretical Foot</em>, no one\u2019s soul \u2013 not even the censorious Lucy\u2019s \u2013 is in any real danger of harm. A group of young, wasp-y Americans are simply enjoying a holiday at the Swiss house to which their glamorous hosts, Sara Porter and Tim Garton, removed themselves some while ago to avoid the\u00a0disapproval of home (they are lovers, but not married). Sara is an excellent cook, and from dawn to dusk they are fed delicious food. Nevertheless, there is darkness at the novel\u2019s edges. Not only are complex desires at play (here is jealousy, lust and even a hint of incest); the year is 1938, and across Europe, refugees are on the move. More vividly, the narrative is punctuated by a sequence of seeming hallucinations in which, over the course of several days, a man falls ill and has a limb amputated. It\u2019s these things that lend the holiday, all splashing\u00a0fountains and \u201cflickering petunias\u201d, the hazy quality of a dream. Here, we understand, is the quiet before the storm.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Intimate and moral, funny and wise, there is something incantatory about her style</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><em>The Theoretical Foot</em> is not a brilliant novel. Its plot is threadbare, its characterisation broad. Even so, its appearance almost a quarter of a century after Fisher\u2019s death is welcome. While its best passages \u2013 Lucy\u2019s mayonnaise guzzling among them \u2013 go down as easily as one of Fisher\u2019s beloved martinis (\u201cI do mean dry: not sweetish or weak or drowning over ice cubes\u201d), even its worst ones are shot through with a terrible poignancy, given the extent to which it draws on real and painful events. And perhaps this is one reason why it has taken so long to resurface; maybe its burial and Fisher\u2019s sanity were related. Having read the manuscript in 1940, her sister-in-law told her it was too hurtful to others to publish: \u201cI feel as though I had overheard confidences not meant for me.\u201d Fisher dutifully put it away. After this, though, something odd happened. She did not suppress the manuscript. Needing cash, she offered it to an editor only a year later (it was rejected). But in the decades that followed, it was, as novelist and memoirist Jane Vandenburgh suggests\u00a0in her afterword, as if she\u2019d forgotten all about it. \u201cI\u2019m not a novelist,\u201d she once said. \u201cI\u2019ve been reading novels all my life, and I don\u2019t want to write one.\u201d</p> <p>Fisher was born in 1908, and grew up in California, in a small town where her father owned the local newspaper; by the time she was a teenager, she was holiday cover for his columnists. She wasn\u2019t, though, a great student, and it was to escape college that she married an academic called Alfred Fisher. The union was not a success, but it was with him that she first travelled to France, a country for which she fell, hard, sommeliers, snails and all. In turn, this released something in her, for soon afterwards she fell ravenously in love with a painter, Dillwyn Parrish, and together they went to Switzerland, where they lived on an estate not dissimilar to the one in <em>The Theoretical Foot</em>. Their happiness, though, was short-lived. Parrish fell ill with Buerger\u2019s disease, an agonising condition that causes blood clots and gangrene. Like the nameless man in her novel, within two weeks of his first attack, he lost his left leg above the knee, only for the pain there to continue even after it was gone (hence <em>The Theoretical Foot</em>). Three years later, in 1941, Parrish killed himself, unable to go on.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/26/best-cookbooks-all-time-chosen-by-experts\">The best cookbooks of all time, as chosen by the experts</a> </p> </aside>  <p>By this point, Fisher\u2019s novel was finished, and safely under her bed, or wherever. Yet still she continued to write, publishing nine books between 1937 and 1949, among them the celebrated <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11267376\" title=\"\"><em>Consider the Oyster</em></a><em> and How to Cook a Wolf</em>. What makes this all the more remarkable is that life had got no easier. A year after Parrish\u2019s suicide, Fisher\u2019s brother killed himself.\u00a0The next year, she gave birth to a daughter, the name of whose\u00a0father\u00a0she never revealed. Two years later, in New York, she hastily became the sixth wife of an editor, Donald Friede. They had a daughter, but he had a breakdown, and they divorced in 1951. It was only when she returned home to\u00a0look after her widowed father that she finally came to a halt. In a depression, she wrote nothing until 1961 when, having moved\u00a0to the Napa Valley, she finally found a measure of happiness among the vineyards.</p> <p>For all its faults, I sank into <em>The Theoretical Foot</em> like a fat strawberry into whipped cream. Some of the writing is lovely. But if you haven\u2019t read Fisher before, it isn\u2019t the place to start. You need to read her on food first, at which point you\u2019ll discover why <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/johnupdike\" title=\"\">John Updike</a> called her \u201ca poet of the appetites\u201d (this is nothing: Auden said he knew of no one in America who wrote better prose). Intimate and moral, funny and wise, there is something incantatory about her style,\u00a0though no sooner has she hypnotised you than she\u2019ll bring you sharply back to your senses. (\u201cDown with it!\u201d is all she has to say on swede.)\u00a0She is not, you see, just a great\u00a0food writer. She is a great writer, full stop. For her, food cannot be separated from the rest of life. A hunger for mayonnaise\u00a0comes from the same place as a hunger for love. It\u2019s just good deal easier to satisfy.</p> <p><em>The Theoretical Foot is published by </em><a href=\"http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/search?q=the+theoretical+foot&amp;Gid=1\" title=\"\"><em>Bloomsbury</em></a><em> (\u00a316.99)</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>In Target a couple of weeks ago, I stood in front of the long aisle of Mother\u2019s Day cards and picked my way through each subsection: grandmas and great-grandmas, sisters, aunts, special someones, and on and on. As in the rest of my life, the cards I gravitate toward are somewhat humorous and somewhat loving, and it\u2019s hard to exclude anyone from that joint embrace.</p> <p>It quickly threatens to become an expensive outing, though, so I cut myself off at eight: my mom and grandma, my two sisters, my foster son\u2019s birth mother and grandmother and two surrogate grandmas. But the angst at this cutoff is real.</p> <p>A substantial part of why I became a foster mother last year was because of how strongly I believe it \u201ctakes a village\u201d. Even down to the minutiae of the songs, books and television shows I love, the common theme is how we\u2019re all in this life together. It\u2019s not by accident that Gilmore Girls reruns \u2013 a show about a single mother and her child and the town that\u2019s raising them both \u2013 play in the background of our evenings.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/06/bipolar-disorder-genetic-risks-parenting-fears\">Facing my fear: my ex is bipolar. I was scared our daughter would be, too | Elizabeth Hamilton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>For the past year and some change, when Wee Dude, as I call him publicly, and I meet a new therapist or social worker, one of the first questions they ask is what our average day looks like. At the outset, this question left me self-conscious. Our days are regimented and slow, and they don\u2019t mirror the flurry of exploration, curiosity and playdates that fill the hours of a neurotypical toddler. </p> <p>WD is two, and he\u2019s neither mobile nor verbal. He is tube-fed. Getting ready for daycare and work (\u201cschool and work and work and school for babies and mamas and mamas and babies,\u201d I sing-song each morning as we amble down the stairs to the front door) sometimes feels like a herculean task \u2013 though, full-disclosure, it sometimes felt that way before WD\u2019s arrival, too. So we wake up, we take baby steps, and we pretend I won\u2019t be late for work if I see what the internet is up to before I take a shower. </p> <p>At home in the afternoons, there is sometimes therapy, sometimes a doctor\u2019s appointment, sometimes lying on the floor and staring at the ceiling fan. Tiny tastes of purees and fine-motor-skill activities during his late-afternoon feed. Mardi Gras beads or blocks on a lightbox, post-digestion tummy time, splashy baths and books and saying night-night to God. As I close his door on the day, he babbles at Bear and his final feed runs. By the time I return an hour later to end his feed with his meds, he is either asleep or waiting for me with a dimple I can hear in the dark. I kiss his forehead once more and tell him I love him.<br /></p> <p>In light of a world seemingly full of normalcy, it\u2019s easy to find our lives lacking. Or less than. Or whatever. But in those regimented and slow days are an endless barrage of women \u2013 of mothers. </p> <p>There are the teachers and nurses at daycare whom WD loves. There are the doctors who try to keep him steady and sturdy. There are the therapists and caseworkers at home who are very polite about how I haven\u2019t vacuumed recently. There are the friends who send validating messages to the group texts. There are the women at church who cuddle and engage him.</p> <p>As WD grows, I want for him the eyes and the heart to see that mothering is not just my hands dressing him for the day, turning the pages of a bedtime story or caressing his cheek after he comes out of a seizure. Rather, mothers include all the hands who guide him through this great big world, and all the hands that make that world possible.</p> <p>I\u2019m grateful that, too, in ways that are not directly about him, WD is witness to the myriad opportunities of how to mother a village. As we go about our days, I take every opportunity to show him awesome women doing awesome things: we see the women who grow gardens and the women who paint pictures of them, the women who build roads and the women who direct traffic on them, the women who cook meals and the women who bring them to friends in need, the women who write stories and the women who read them aloud, the women who rally for justice and the women who see that justice through.</p> <p>I want for him to know these daily moments of gratitude both large and small that surge through my body \u2013 these moments of simple delight both deep and fleeting that tilt my head back in laughter. I want him to know that if I won the lottery, I\u2019d use the money to buy Mother\u2019s Day cards by the armful for everyone we\u2019ve won in this lottery of the heart.</p>",

And on Monday we were reminded of the great rapper\u2019s absence once again when his mother Afeni Shakur, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/03/afeni-shakur-dead-tupac-california\">died in her northern California home </a> aged 69.</p> <p>Though it feels as though, with her death, our last notable connection to the rap great has been severed, Afeni wasn\u2019t simply a mother to Tupac and his sister Sekyiwa. She was a former member of the Black Panther Party, an activist and philanthropist. She was also a savvy businesswoman, establishing a trust to ensure that Tupac\u2019s work will always be protected. <br /></p> <p>Partly due to this attention to his legacy, Tupac\u2019s fans embraced Afeni. She already had a public profile thanks to Tupac\u2019s 1995 single Dear Mama, the nearest thing hip-hop has to a Mother\u2019s Day anthem. The track was a poignant peek into a complicated, but loving and relatable bond with his mother: </p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>When I was young me and my mama had beef / 17 years old kicked out on the streets / Though back at the time I never thought I\u2019d see her face / Ain\u2019t a woman alive that could take my mama\u2019s place.</p> </blockquote>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb1ZvUDvLDY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mb1ZvUDvLDY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Afeni\u2019s fostering and nurturing of her son\u2019s talent set the foundation for his<strong> </strong>impact in music. She wasn\u2019t always physically by his side, but she was his support system playing co-pilot as he navigated his way through fame. Though Tupac was shot dead aged just 25, Afeni reminded us that a mother\u2019s love is eternal. She kept the rapper\u2019s memory alive carefully, curating the releases of a massive selection of writings, recordings and memorabilia. In 1997, she launched the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TASF.ORG/\">Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation</a> aimed at encouraging and empowering young people aspiring to work in the arts.</p> <p>Afeni Shakur is a prime example of the role some mothers have played in hip-hop culture. Her work in maintaining her son\u2019s legacy is not uncommon, especially when some of hip-hop\u2019s most pioneering figures have tended to die young. Maureen Yancey, affectionately known as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://twitter.com/officialmadukes\">Ma Dukes</a>, is the mother of producer <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/59704/hip-hop-artist-j-dilla-dies\">J Dilla who died of a blood disease in 2006</a>. In the years following his untimely death, Ma Dukes has coordinated the annual <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/432847546866237/\">Dilla Day Weekend</a> celebration in his honor. </p> <p>Voletta Wallace, mother of the Notorious BIG, launched the <a href=\"http://cwmf97.blogspot.com/2011/03/our-mission.html\">Christopher Wallace Memorial Foundation</a> after he was shot dead in 1997. The organization provides scholarships and grants for students, and supplies schools and community centers with necessary teaching materials.</p> <p>Wallace also attempted a wrongful death lawsuit against the LAPD in hopes of seeking answers and accountability for her son\u2019s still unsolved murder. The lawsuit was <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2010/apr/19/notorious-big-lawsuit-los-angeles\">dismissed</a>.</p> <p>And it\u2019s not just the deceased whose mothers become known in hip-hop. Drake\u2019s relationship with his mom Sandi Graham has been the forefront of many of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_X5_qJ4S-U\">his most emotional songs</a>. Deb Antney, mother of Waka Flocka Flame, is also his manager. Big Sean credits his mother, Myra Anderson, with giving him the courage to <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/microphonecheck/2015/03/02/390165830/big-sean-i-stuck-with-my-gut\">trust his instincts</a>, while Diddy routinely thanks his mother, Janice Combs, who raised him on her own after his father was murdered. </p> <p>Ludacris\u2019s mother, Roberta Shields, runs his <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/LudaKids/info/\">charity</a> organization devoted to \u201chelping youth help themselves\u201d. The same goes for Jay Z\u2019s mother, Gloria Carter, who in 2003 co-founded the <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.shawncartersf.com/\">Sean Carter Foundation</a>, an organization that provides scholarships, college tours, counseling and other programs to empower youth on the quest for higher education.</p> <p>Then there are the mothers who didn\u2019t live to see the full extent of their children\u2019s success. Donda West, mother to Kanye, died in 2007 after undergoing cosmetic surgery. West was hands-on in her son\u2019s career, working as his manager. At the launch of his The Life of Pablo album, <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/feb/14/kanye-west-the-life-of-pablo-review-you-can-see-why-his-immodesty-rubs-people-up-the-wrong-way\">Kanye previewed a computer game which showed her entering the gates of heaven</a>, which if nothing else once again revealed his deep feelings of loss. </p> <p>Were it not for their mothers, our favorite hip-hop artists literally wouldn\u2019t exist. Sometimes their toughest critics and strongest defenders, fans are grateful for mothers like Afeni Shakur and what she meant to the genre. </p>",

He and the other members of the royal family, he said, were \u201ccompletely aware\u201d of it.</p> <p>\u201cI will spend the rest of my life earning that privilege and trying to bring a spotlight on to things and causes that really matter to me, and hopefully matter to other people as well.</p> <p>\u201cEveryone has a right to their privacy, and a lot of the members of the public get it, but sadly in some areas there is this incessant need to find out every little bit of detail about what goes on behind the scenes. It\u2019s unnecessary.\u201d</p> <p>He added: \u201cThe private life has to be private and I hope people respect that.\u201d </p> <p>The prince had already complained, in a Sunday Times interview, that he had \u201cmassive paranoia\u201d about women, because of the media intrusion. \u201cEven if I talk to a girl, that person is then suddenly my wife, and people go knocking on her door.\u201d</p> <p>The opening ceremony of the Invictus Games in Orlando, Florida, will be attended by the US first lady , Michelle Obama, and celebrities including the film star Morgan Freeman and the singer James Blunt. The five-day games will be contested by more than 500 athletes from 15 countries.</p> <p>Addressing accusations of being workshy that have dogged him and his brother, the Duke of Cambridge, this year, Harry said that he did not get satisfaction from doing nothing. </p> <p>\u201cI don\u2019t get any satisfaction from sitting at home on my arse,\u201d he said. </p> <p>The royal said he wanted a job after <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/17/prince-harry-to-leave-armed-forces-june\">leaving the army</a> but could not find one with which he could combine his royal duties. </p> <p>After leaving the military, he found most jobs he looked at \u201cwere not going to work\u201d combined with royal duties and some jobs were \u201cnot even on the table\u201d. </p> <p>Harry has been outspoken in his support of veterans, saying he thought the government could do more to help them, and wants to continue to champion sport despite his body being \u201cruined\u201d after 10 years of service.</p>",

      "body": "<p>As the quietly subversive series The Good Wife wraps up in the US this weekend, so does a seven-year exploration of a central question: what does it mean to be a good wife? What is the role one is expected to play?<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/05/the-good-wife-final-season-julianna-margulies-cbs\">How The Good Wife transformed TV</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Alicia Florrick (Julianna Margulies) was always an exceptional woman; junior associates do not usually end up winning the case. She ticked every box of Strong Female Lead so comprehensively it seems possible she inspired the Netflix category. Alicia navigated launching an impressive career, being a supportive mother, and standing by her man through less than ideal circumstances.</p> <p>None of this appeared effortless, but Florrick never cracked: conspicuously absent were discussions about women having it all, or scenes of Alicia eating ice-cream in her pyjamas on the couch. She was the woman who had it all \u2013 and increasingly, she wasn\u2019t sure she wanted it. </p> <p>So steely was her demeanor that by the fourth season she was being compared to another character famous for his gradual transformation \u2013 in the words of one blogger, she <a href=\"about:blank\">broke bad</a>.</p> <p>So the good wife wasn\u2019t quite \u2018good\u2019 anymore. But Alicia wasn\u2019t the only one defying what the characters in the CBS show \u2013 and the audience \u2013 expected from her.</p> <p>Kalinda Sharma (Archie Panjabi) was an investigator who, despite being the picture of a badass sex bomb, never seduced informants so much as streamrolled them.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-embed\" data-canonical-url=\"https://vimeo.com/26004234\" data-alt=\"Kalinda Sharma\">  <iframe src=\"https://player.vimeo.com/video/26004234\" width=\"640\" height=\"361\" frameborder=\"0\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>  <p>Christine Baranski\u2019s Diane Lockhart was a realization of the 80s feminist icon of the Career Woman, running a prestigious law firm without much regard for a private life. Never did we see Diane bemoan not having had children, or needing the support of a good man.</p> <p>The creators used the procedural format to bring in an impressive array of female lawyers, who all played \u2013 and played into \u2013 an expression of femininity. Patti Nyholm (Martha Plimpton) was an Earth Mother, shamelessly exploiting the sympathy extended to pregnant women and mothers of young children. Patti waddles, winces in pain, then winks: the women in the show know they\u2019re being played, but the male characters swallow it whole.<br /></p> <p>Equally manipulative was Nancy Crozier (Mamie Gummer, otherwise known as Meryl Streep Jr), whose note-perfect impression of an inexperienced, guileless innocent charmed many a witness to follow her into a trap she then snapped shut.</p> <p>Carrie Preston played Elsbeth Tascioni, whose charmingly over-the-top take on a manic ditz hid a whip-smart, precise and creative brain; Elsbeth might have spoken in disrupted speech patterns, but there was nothing chaotic about the way she worked.</p> <p>And then there was Melissa George\u2019s Marilyn Garbanza, hired in Peter Florrick\u2019s office. Blonde-haired, blue-eyed and smoky voiced, she was the living incarnation of an office temptress trope, which \u2013 considering Peter\u2019s adulterous behaviour \u2013 was a not an implausible threat. (Side note: <a href=\"http://elizs.tumblr.com/post/68783191707/jessicaandtv-when-an-episode-of-the-good-wife]\">Alan Cumming\u2019s reaction</a> after asking Marilyn what she plans to name her unborn child is one of the most magnificent spit-takes of screen history.)</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2016/feb/06/crush-eli-gold-good-wife-alan-cumming\">Why I love... The Good Wife\u2019s Eli Gold</a> </p> </aside>  <p>So there we have it: a career woman, a sex bomb, a mother, a ditz, an ingenue, a temptress and, of course, a good wife. Despite the trappings of a procedural courtroom drama, The Good Wife\u2019s closest resonances are with another genre of TV altogether.<br /></p> <p>Not since Sex and The City\u2019s infamous foursome \u2013 the slut, the cynic, the princess and the romantic \u2013 has a show so fully mapped out the disparate roles that women are pressured to take on. </p> <p>A critical difference though: Carrie, Miranda, Charlotte and Samantha, while aware of how they were perceived and the consequent limitations of that, weren\u2019t acting. They <em>did</em> embody those characteristics; sometimes uncomfortably, but always unwaveringly. As Emily Nussbaum astutely <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/07/29/difficult-women\">pointed out</a>, these personalities weren\u2019t assumed for the benefit of men; indeed, most men in the audience didn\u2019t seem to like them much at all, finding them \u201cjagged, aggressive, and sometimes frightening figures.\u201d</p> <p>In contrast, The Good Wife\u2019s characters had learned a few things, and played the game accordingly. Patti and Nancy in particular knew exactly what people thought of them, and leaned right into it, expertly manoeuvring and manipulating to win their cases and prove the substance underneath the stereotype. It was Judith Butler\u2019s seminal theory of gender as performance, fully realised.</p> <p>A critique often levelled at Sex and the City was that despite the show beginning with the declaration that women could have sex \u2018like men\u2019 (without commitment or emotion), at the end of the six seasons they all ended up in happily monogamous, heteronormative relationships. (We shall pretend here that the movies do not exist, as do all sane-minded fans.) Two were married, two had children; all were settled in homes and jobs and lives.</p> <p>And yet as The Good Wife ends, it\u2019s wrapping up its story with a divorce \u2013 a radical move within television\u2019s traditional resolutions and happily-ever-afters. This does actually represent a happy ending for Alicia, after a lifetime of standing by a partner through scandal, infidelity and imprisonment. She\u2019s spent seven years slowly stretching the role of the good wife. It\u2019s time for her cast off the costume and step off the stage.</p> <ul> <li><em>The series finale of The Good Wife airs at 9pm on Sunday 8 May on CBS; and at 9.30pm on Wednesday 11 May on Channel 10 in Australia. UK viewers are only up to episode 16 of the final series, which airs at 9pm on Thursday 12 May on More4.</em></li> <li><em>A paragraph was accidentally deleted from this piece when published, and has since been added back in.</em></li> </ul>",

He was attempting the biggest upset by a British boxer fighting abroad since John H Stracey beat the great Jose Napoles in Mexico City in 1975; Lloyd Honeyghan\u2019s inspired victory in six rounds over a weight-drained but still estimable Don Curry in Atlantic City 30 years ago is in that mix; before that, we have to dip into ancient history. This was some wall to climb, too tall as it happened.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e94c25074e2c957031061881392f484e46230cd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e94c25074e2c957031061881392f484e46230cd9/0_366_4684_2810/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amir Khan contemplates defeat\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Amir Khan contemplates defeat.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And speaking of walls, every Las Vegas cleaner, janitor, construction worker and cab driver with roots south of the border were pulling for their cinnamon-topped hero, and would mightily have loved it had their b\u00eate noir, Donald Trump, been dumb enough to accept an invitation to sit somewhere in the cheaper seats. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2016/may/08/canelo-alvarez-v-amir-khan-wbc-middleweight-title-in-pictures\">Canelo \u00c1lvarez v Amir Khan: WBC middleweight title \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Khan\u2019s small but vociferous army, who have been by his side here since he began his grand American adventure nine fights and nearly six years ago in Madison Square Garden, were vastly outnumbered, of course. And there weren\u2019t many neutrals among the 16,540 squeezed into the new arena. The mood of high drama and respectful conflict could not have been more intense.</p> <p>This, though, was Canelo\u2019s town for the weekend, Cinco de Mayo, co-opted since the days of Julio Cesar Chavez we were told, even if, contrary to the salesmanship of the event\u2019s golden-tongued promoter, Oscar De La Hoya, only a handful of his fights in this city coincided with Mexico\u2019s most cherished national holiday. Still, this is boxing; on a night when the great Panamanian Roberto Dur\u00e1n was introduced at ringside as Mexican, we were reminded that myth and hokum are perennial ingredients of the pie.</p> <p>There was nothing counterfeit about the fight, however. It was as honest as a desert sunset. The most common larceny in this town and this business is of the spirit and the pocket, but nobody could complain they were shortchanged while it lasted.</p> <p>From round one, Khan\u2019s reflexes and concentration were on fire. If those faculties let him down in previous disasters \u2013 against Breidis Prescott eight years and in 2012 against Garcia \u2013 here he was, \u201cen fuego\u201d, as they say.</p> <p>Khan stole the first round with stealth and that snaking jab, as expected, sniping from distance and circling his prey. Khan said beforehand he expected to be hit and hurt, but he was doing his damnedest to make a liar of himself as he made the early running \u2013 literally \u2013 and a rare left hook rattled his teeth without obvious discomfort.</p> <p>Canelo found his range a couple of times in the third, but Khan continued to shift left, right and every which way to stay out of trouble, picking on the move like a bird in the park.</p> <p>\u201cCanelo never backs down\u201d said the message on the T-shirts of his compadres, but Khan was taking that out of the equation by not asking him to, as he continued to box at range, scoring with intermittent flurries. It was nearly 12 minutes before they clinched, so clean was the action.</p> <p>There was a case for giving the champion the fifth, as he landed a couple of solid head shots, but Khan remained cool under fire. And there was some way to go. Could Khan contain his natural thirst for a fight and hold his concentration?</p> <p>As they got to half way, Canelo, more relaxed, began to let his hands go and, for the first time, looked the more dominant fighter. And that is when the crunching conclusion arrived \u2013 a long right hand from out of the blue that landed with such precision the British challenger was unconscious before he hit the canvas.</p> <p>Boxing always craves fresh talent and on the undercard the virtuoso boxing of the promoter\u2019s baby-faced cousin, Diego De La Hoya, caught the eye of knowledgeable fans who turned up before the pay-per-view broadcast began.</p> <p>The smooth-moving super-bantamweight toyed with the unbeaten and game Californian, Rocco Santomauro, in nearly every exchange before an audacious uppercut on-the-walk in the seventh coincided with the merciful intervention of his opponent\u2019s trainer, Shane Mosley. We will be hearing a lot of 21-year-old De La Hoya, who has stopped nine of his 15 opponents, and embarrassed all of them.</p> <p>All in all, not a bad night for Mexico.</p>",

It\u2019s unnecessary.\u201d </p> </blockquote> <p>Prince Harry went on to say that he and other members of the royal family were \u201ccompletely aware that we are in a very privileged position\u201d, adding:<br /></p> <blockquote> <p>\u201cI will spend the rest of my life earning that privilege and trying to bring a spotlight on to things and causes that really matter to me, and hopefully matter to a lot of other people as well.\u201d</p> </blockquote> <p>One of those causes, the Invictus Games, was the reason for his appearance on Marr\u2019s BBC1 programme on Sunday morning. He was speaking from Florida where the tournament for injured service personnel and veterans is being held.</p> <p>He conceived of the idea of the games after he was refused permission to serve in Iraq and accompanying three severely wounded soldiers on a plane trip.</p> <p>It was, he told Marr, \u201ca turning point\u201d in his life and prompted him to note his split roles as an army officer and a member of the monarchy: he was Captain Wales and also Prince Harry.<br /></p> <p>The prince, again subtly encouraged by Marr, made a brief reference to his mother, Princess Diana. The games were not \u201ca sensitive subject\u201d, he said, unlike his mother\u2019s support for the campaign against land mines. </p> <p>He was responsible for launching the Invictus Games two years ago and is patron of the foundation that organises the event. <br /></p> <p>The five-day paralympic-style tournament involves more than 500 athletes from 15 countries who are competing in a range of sports.</p>",

      "headline": "Donald Trump given a fighting chance by ailing US economy",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-09T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>The experts said it could never happen. There was no way in which Donald Trump could win the Republican nomination for the US presidency. Could a billionaire who had never held office, was distrusted by the party hierarchy, lacked a political machine and seemed to take delight in upsetting large chunks of the electorate really survive the primaries and have a shot at the White House? Well, really.</p> <p>The smart money now says that Trump has no chance in a head-to-head presidential race with Hillary Clinton, who looks nailed-on as the candidate for the Democrats. Opinion polls suggest that Clinton would beat Trump by a margin of 10 percentage points were the election to be held now.</p> <p>But Americans are not going to pick the next resident of the White House for another six months. That is an awfully long time in politics and 10-point deficits have been overturned in the past. It is by no means inconceivable that Trump will succeed Barack Obama. Indeed, the state of the US economy suggests that he has a fighting chance.</p> <p>The first point to recognise is that the economy is struggling. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/28/sluggish-us-growth-global-economy\">Growth slowed to an annualised 0.5% in the first three months of 2016</a>, which means that it was barely expanding at all. Unlike in previous years, this could not be blamed on inclement weather.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/usemployment\">Jobs are still being created but at a slower pace.</a> Last week\u2019s figures for non-farm payrolls \u2013 the benchmark for the state of the labour market \u2013 showed an increase of 160,000 in employment last month, well below the 200,000 Wall Street had been expecting.</p> <p>Disappointing economic data has become rather too common in recent months. Investment activity has been weak, with companies taking advantage of low interest rates to buy back their own shares rather than investing in new plant and machinery. That has helped keep share prices high but at a cost. Productivity growth, as in the UK, has been poor.</p> <p>The result has been only a modest growth in wages, which are still only growing at 2.5% a year despite the recovery from the Great Recession of 2008-09 now into its eighth year. But the pick-up in pay has been enough to squeeze corporate profits, which makes share prices look overvalued.</p> <p>At best, the US looks set for growth of about 2% this year, but it would not take much \u2013 a sharp plunge on Wall Street, for example \u2013 for the economy to turn sour in the run-up to polling day in early November.</p> <p>The second point to recognise is that millions of Americans think they have been left behind. This has certainly not been a period where a rising tide lifts all boats; the gains from what has been a strikingly undynamic recovery by US standards have gone to the few, not the many. Trump, despite being a billionaire, has managed to tap into a seething well of discontent. So has Bernie Sanders.</p> <p>This has created a political dynamic in which it is possible for Trump to portray himself as the anti-establishment figure who voices the concerns of the little guy in the states the elite fly over as they travel from coast to coast. His platform is unashamedly populist: he wants interest rates to stay low and the minimum wage and spending on the military to go up. He is in favour of a big expansion of infrastructure spending, higher benefits for armed forces veterans, 40% tariff barriers on imported goods, an end to free trade deals, and curbs on immigration including the building of a wall along the border with Mexico.</p> <p>Some of Trump\u2019s shoot-from-the-hip comments are economically illiterate. He says he would take advantage of the fact that the US government can borrow money at very attractive rates to finance his public investment plans. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. Many Democrats think that would be a good idea. But Trump has also said that if he spent a bit too much on rebuilding roads and bridges he would consider <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-default-national-debt_us_572d08e3e4b096e9f0917fac\">defaulting on the US national debt</a>.</p> <p>This, of course, sends out a clear message to the investors who would be lending the US government the money to pay for these schemes. If there is a chance that Washington would renege on its debts, interest rates on the loans will be higher to take account of the extra risk.</p> <p>The same applies to the plan to <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-says-he-would-replace-janet-yellen-supports-low-interest-rates-1462465158\">oust Janet Yellen </a>as chair of the Federal Reserve Board. Trump does not object to the way in which the US central bank has tried to keep interest rates as low as possible, merely the fact that Yellen is a Democrat not a Republican. The threat that Trump would replace Yellen with a Republican at the first opportunity makes the future conduct of US monetary policy look less certain and, again, long-term interest rates may rise as a result.</p> <p>Slowing US growth has already given Yellen and her Fed colleagues a good reason to delay the increase in US interest rates that some on Wall Street are expecting next month. Trump has just provided the most powerful central banker in the world with another. On the one hand, she knows that if she keeps the economy out of recession she improves Clinton\u2019s chances of winning. On the other, she could be out of a job if the economy stagnates, because in those circumstances the odds on Trump will shorten.</p> <p>Who knows, there may be a method to Trump\u2019s madness. By coming out with inflammatory statements he makes it more likely that there will be a tightening of financial market conditions over the summer, leading to weaker economic activity and the real possibility of a stock market crash.</p> <p>Clinton would no doubt try to blame any problems on her opponent and say that he has demonstrated how unfit he is for the highest office in the land. But she knows from the experience of 1992, when her husband Bill was running for the White House, how important the economy is in deciding the race. As far as Clinton is concerned, the longer Yellen refrains from raising interest rates the better.</p> <p>Imagine there is a Wall Street crash over the summer and the economy tanks. Would America opt for experience or the self-styled outsider? Trump does not have a coherent programme and it may well collapse under the intense scrutiny of the next few months. But he is gambling that what he says will have an appeal at a gut level and will contrast with the dry arguments presented by his opponent. Clinton is going to find herself attacked from the left on some issues and from the right on others. She is going to have to be quick on her feet because one thing the Republican primaries have shown is that Trump is one heck of a salesman.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Some science facilities are just too big to have one each, even if you are quite a rich country. And there are many different types of big science facility, for many different kinds of science, technology and medicine. Lasers, particle beams, big computers, telescopes, aeroplanes, submarines, satellites - all are important for something somewhere. <br /></p> <p>So if there are other interested countries nearby, it makes sense to plan together and share costs and usage where appropriate. The European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures \u2013 ESFRI \u2013 is part of the way Europe does this, and it has just produced a new \u2018<a href=\"http://www.esfri.eu/roadmap-2016\">roadmap</a>\u2019.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Being in Europe doesn\u2019t mean not being part of the wider world</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I think the term \u2018roadmap\u2019 is used because it is more definite than a vision \u2013 there are a lot of specifics in there \u2013 but less definite than a plan. <em><a href=\"http://physicsworld.com/cws/archive/news/20/5\">Physics World</a></em> calls is a \u2018Euro wishlist\u2019. A lot of it is aspirational, in that the funding isn\u2019t in place for it all and politicians and funders can essentially choose a number of different routes through the map.</p> <p>The previous roadmap was published in 2006 and was very influential. Funding agencies of many countries consider the recommendations from ESFRI when making investment decisions with their own national research budgets; and the roadmap is actually addressed at the Commission of the European Union, and so informs many of the decisions about EU investment in science and infrastructure. <br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/apr/20/brexit-could-cost-uk-science-millions-in-lost-research-funding-peers-warn\">Brexit could cost UK science millions in lost research funding, peers warn</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The current chair of ESFRI is John Womersley, a particle physicist by training and currently CEO of the UK\u2019s Science and Technology Research Council (STFC). He talked to <em>Physics World</em> about the need for pooling of resources between nations:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>This has long been the case in domains like particle physics, but we are seeing the approach become necessary much more widely, in areas as diverse as atmospheric physics, computing, and materials science.<br /></p> </blockquote> <p>He was talking about physics in that context (to <em>Physics World</em>, of course) otherwise he could also have mentioned medicine and the life sciences, archaelogy, marine and environmental science and more. <br /></p> <p>One important change this time is the CERN (which is not an EU organisation) was an integral part of the process, and features strongly, with the High Luminosity upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider appearing as a major landmark. This is good news for particle physics \u2013 not being directly involved was definitely a disadvantage last time for particle physicists in some countries \u2013 and good news for Europe as CERN is clearly a jewel in the European crown as far as international scientific facilties go, with an impact that goes well beyond Europe.<br /></p> <p>Although ESFRI was set up by the EU and reports to it\u00b9, Brexiteers will be quick to note that non-EU members also participate as associated countires. So it is certainly true that we in the UK could still participate if we left the EU, though to access any of the investment we\u2019d likely have to pay in at least as much money as we already do, and to continue to allow EU citizens to settle and work in the UK, all whilst losing some of our influence on the decision-making process.<br /></p> <p>I was an observer in the physical sciences group\u00b2, and I even contributed a few words which I think made it into the report. Given that, I can vouch for the fact that the influence any country has on the priorities depends on many things, including the size and resource of a country, the individuals round the table, and the strength of the national scientific communities. The UK does well in general, and being a member state definitely helps.</p> <p> Considerations of the impact on scientific research probably won\u2019t determine most people\u2019s vote in the upcoming EU referendum in the UK, but it\u2019s a strong and clear argument and the <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/scientists-say-no-to-uk-exit-from-europe-in-nature-poll-1.19636\">small minority</a> of scientists saying otherwise are either mistaken or deliberately trying to mislead.<br /></p> <p>In that context, one important thing to note about the ESFRI report is the global outlook. Being in Europe doesn\u2019t mean not being part of the wider world, and the science doesn\u2019t stop at the borders. To take two examples close to my own area, current and future particle physics faciltities in America and Asia are discussed in the report, and the \u2018<a href=\"https://www.skatelescope.org/\">Square Kilometre Array</a>\u2019, a future radio telescope which is one of the key projects for ESFRI, has its headquarters in Manchester, but the actual telescope will be sited in Africa and Australia.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2016/mar/12/why-the-eu-matters-for-universities\">Why the EU matters for universities</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Decisions need to be made on many different scales ranging from very local to very global. Full involvement in a European level of coordination is a vital part of that mix for science. As far as I can see the same is also true for many other areas of endeavour.</p> <p>That\u2019s probably enough of that for now. If you are interested in the future possibilties for science, the technologies that will make a big difference, and what the multiple acronyms stand for, the <a href=\"http://www.esfri.eu/roadmap-2016\">ESFRI roadmap</a> is a great resource and I commend it to you.<em><br /></em></p> <p><em>\u00b9 Added 10/5/16: Specifically, the Council of Ministers</em><br /></p> <p><em>\u00b2See page 202 of the report for my 5mins of fame.

Next came a bowl of <em>liangpi</em>, a Shaanxi staple: thick ribbons of rice noodle tossed with sesame paste, chilli oil and shreds of cucumber. Another stall had them in cold satay sauce.

      "body": "<p><em>Island Home</em> is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/tim-winton\" title=\"\">Tim Winton</a>\u2019s insightful and vibrant testament to what it is to be a non-indigenous Australian living in the late 20th and early 21st\u00a0centuries. Less than 3% of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news\" title=\"\">Australia</a>\u2019s population can trace their ancestry in the country to a time that predates photography. Despite up to 60,000 years of continuous human habitation, it is still the landscape that leaves the strongest impression. Australia is \u201ca place where there is more landscape than culture\u2026 Everything we do... is still overborne and underwritten by the seething tumult of nature\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jun/28/saturdayreviewsfeatres.guardianreview9\">Interview: Tim Winton</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The book is in part a love song to Australia and also an attempt to trace how this love affair began, as well as where it might go next. The structure is episodic and non-linear with some chapters only a page or two in length, and yet each one works as a stand-alone piece. I was reminded of handling a deck of cards, the apparently random juxtaposition of memories \u2013 in terms of time \u2013 as seemingly arbitrarily arranged as a shuffled pack. The book progresses thematically, not sequentially. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2016/jan/29/edmund-white-i-try-to-be-honest-if-i-lose-someones-friendship-so-what-\" title=\"\">Edmund White</a> said \u201cyou have to tell the truth when you\u2019re\u00a0writing what purports to be a memoir\u201d, and Winton conveys a searing sense of honesty.</p> <p>His story begins halfway around the world, in 1988, in Ireland, as he runs with his young son through freezing, slanting hail. Later, warmed by hot chocolate, his son looks at photographs of \u201cthe sun-creased faces of friends and family. Daggy hats and bare chests. Dogs in utes\u201d, and asks: \u201cIs it real?\u201d Thus Winton begins the extrication of his family from Europe, from the travel that Australians are so very good at, in search of home.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I was formed by gaps, nurtured in the pauses between people. And over it all an impossibly open sky, dwarfing everything</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Few people come to Australia looking for \u201cthe built glories of our culture\u201d, he observes. \u201cSpace was my primary inheritance. I was formed by gaps, nurtured in the long pauses between people\u2026 For each mechanical noise, five natural sounds; for every built structure a landform twice as large and 20 times as complex. And over it all, an impossibly open sky, dwarfing everything.\u201d And yet Australia is vulnerable, despite its size, and Winton\u2019s central message is tub-thumpingly political.</p> <p>When Winton grew up in the 1970s, \u201cAustralians were devoted uncritically to the conquest and mastery of nature\u201d. He traces this legacy from the attitudes of the earliest settlers who left their \u201crevulsion and dismay\u201d preserved in place names (Useless Loop, Lake Disappointment) through to the fortunes quickly made through gold, wool, wheat and iron ore. By the 1940s non-indigenous Australians were impassioned enough to go off to war and fight for their home. But the plundering of natural resources was having a discernible effect on the land. Winton recalls swimming as a boy in \u201ca shoal of salmon beneath a halo of diving birds\u201d, noting that it was \u201chard for even the most dull-witted boy to ignore the inkling that you\u2019re a small part of a larger process\u201d. But by the 1990s, \u201cwherever I swam in a mask and snorkel, I was seeing more and more of less and less\u201d.</p> <p>Recognition that the natural world has intrinsic value was learned in part from indigenous Australians, \u201cwhose pride in the wisdom of their own cultures and whose reverence for the country endured\u201d, and in part from the \u201cpoets, songsters and nature mystics, bushwalkers, birdwatchers and enlightened farmers\u201d for whom the land is primarily a source of wonder. Winton attributes his own awakening to the writer and documentary-maker <a href=\"http://www.smh.com.au/news/environment/green-before-it-was-fashionable/2007/09/11/1189276771674.html\" title=\"\">Vincent Serventy</a>. Today, it is Winton himself who is one of Australia\u2019s strongest advocates for the environment.</p> <p><em>Island Home</em> is a delight to read and a reminder that Australia and the UK are separated by distance and seasons \u2013 not to mention our common language: Winton\u2019s words chink like loose change, a foreign currency, mysterious. But more than anything, the book is a call to arms, a manifesto. It beseeches us to revere the land that sustains us, crying out to us for help.</p> <p><em>Katharine Norbury\u2019s </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/363830/s/the-fish-ladder/\" title=\"\"><em>The Fish Ladder</em></a><em> has been longlisted for the Wainwright prize.

      "body": "<p>In 1991 I\u2019d been asked to produce a debate for the BBC with Jonathan Dimbleby on the consequences of the impending war in Yugoslavia. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/dec/12/enoch-powell-hanif-kureishi\">Enoch Powell</a> was to be a chief protagonist. After a conversation on the phone where he pressed me on my academic credentials \u2013 a recent PhD from LSE \u2013 we arranged to meet outside his favourite lunch haunt in Kensington. When he arrived I said simply: \u201cNice to meet you Mr Powell, I\u2019m from the BBC.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cWhere is Dr Barling?\u201d he asked.</p> <p>\u201cThat would be me!\u201d I replied.</p> <p>He was startled, but I was used to fluster \u2013 I was often mistaken for a cab driver at the BBC. The noisy banter stopped as we went in. Some people were choking on their soup.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He was startled \u2013 I was often mistaken for a cab driver at the BBC. People were choking on their soup</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>We were there to work, but for me there was also unfinished business. After Powell\u2019s 1968 \u201crivers of blood\u201d speech, I\u2019d been spat at in the playground at school. I remember wiping phlegm off my face.</p> <p>But I bided my time. Powell bemoaned the European desire to resurrect the \u201cImperium of the Holy Roman Empire\u201d; it would unleash the pent-up antipathies of European history, he said. Eventually, during dessert, I asked if he felt Britain had turned out the way he expected. I put it to him that people like me were proof his prediction was way off the mark. \u201cAh yes,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I was not thinking about people like you. I was more concerned about those people with whom our culture and values would continue to clash.\u201d</p> <p>I countered that he couldn\u2019t really know who people like me were just because of my position and education. He looked at me wearily and said: \u201cI\u2019m not convinced there isn\u2019t still time for trouble if we do not find a common path forward.\u201d</p> <p>My activist grandfather would have been proud of my next question. I asked Powell if he was a racist. His reply: \u201cIt depends what you mean by that. I don\u2019t believe a man is a lesser man because he is coloured, but it doesn\u2019t mean I might choose to live with him if he is different from me.\u201d</p> <p>I still firmly believe Powell was wrong. Back then as a politician he saw his main chance and tried to seize it. Powell died in 1998. Since then the question of how we live with our differences in the face of political extremism has clearly not gone away.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--thumbnail\" data-media-id=\"6baf93d3753896fe50c6e2425844dd9c691ddc55\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6baf93d3753896fe50c6e2425844dd9c691ddc55/124_262_1293_1210/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kurt Barling\" width=\"1000\" height=\"936\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p><em>Professor Kurt Barling, Middlesex University London, is the author of </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/348012/\">Racism: The \u2018R\u2019 Word</a><em> (\u00a39.99, Biteback).

      "body": "<p>Two years ago, exhausted by the frantic pressures of commercial portraiture, photographer <a href=\"http://www.levonbiss.com/\" title=\"\">Levon Biss</a> was searching for a way to relax. His son Sebastian, then six, found the answer in their back garden. \u201cMy boy likes insects,\u201d says Biss. \u201cHe\u2019s always in the garden trying to find them and play with them. I started shooting insects he\u2019d caught, so that he could see them clearly and be proud of finding them.\u201d Making detailed portraits of insect specimens proved to be the perfect antidote to the trigger-happy, \u201cdisposable\u201d photography that Biss feels is the current fashion. \u201cI wanted a project that made me think, that was a challenge,\u201d he says, and he gradually developed a technique so specialised and laborious, only a photographer of extreme patience and dedication could sustain it.</p> <p>First, the pinned insect is mounted on an adapted microscope-stand in front of a camera with a macro lens. Biss then divides the insect into 30 sections, to be photographed separately at close range. \u201cWhen you get to this magnification,\u201d he explains, \u201cthe depth of field is so shallow, there\u2019s only a minute plane of focus.\u201d To render, for instance, a whole wing-casing in focus, it must be photographed around 750 times, with each photo taken 10 microns apart. Those 750 images are then painstakingly compiled into a composite, using a variety of sophisticated software.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6d3f1372a8524765403697996abd56b3a2925e86\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6d3f1372a8524765403697996abd56b3a2925e86/0_182_4435_5542/800.jpg\" alt=\"A Splendid-Necked Dung Beetle\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Splendid-Necked Dung Beetle</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Levon Biss</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Finally, the 30 sections must be combined, which poses its own problems. \u201cBecause of the contours of an eye,\u201d says Biss, \u201cit has to be lit completely differently to a hairy leg or an antenna\u201d, which means the sections have to be carefully sewn together, allowing for divergences in colour and perspective. \u201cThe process for me is as much a part of it as the final image,\u201d says Biss. It is fortunate that he feels this way: each minutely detailed final portrait is the product of 8,000 individual photographs and at least three weeks\u2019 work.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2014/sep/17/50-years-of-wildlife-photographer-of-the-year-in-pictures\">50 Years of Wildlife Photographer of the Year \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When the garden failed to yield sufficient new subjects, Biss sent a speculative email to the <a href=\"http://www.oum.ox.ac.uk/\" title=\"\">Oxford University Museum of Natural History</a>, asking for help. \u201cI was immediately sold,\u201d says Dr James Hogan, an entomologist at the museum. \u201cHe had the pictures on his laptop and he just kept zooming in and zooming in.\u201d Hogan was astounded not only by the level of detail but also the creative way the insects had been exposed: \u201cScientific specimens tend to be very plainly lit, whereas Levon has really brought them alive, and created insect portraits.\u201d Hogan delved into the museum\u2019s 5m-strong collection of pinned insects, sending Biss home with creatures such as the <a href=\"http://microsculpture.net/splendid-necked-dung-beetle.html\" title=\"\">splendid-necked dung beetle</a> and the <a href=\"http://microsculpture.net/branch-backed-treehopper.html\" title=\"\">branch-backed treehopper</a>; specimens the public rarely gets to see. Biss has now completed more than 20 insect portraits, huge three-metre prints of which will be exhibited at the museum from 27 May.</p> <p>Aside from the photographs\u2019 unearthly beauty, they also have legitimate scientific merits. Since many of the insects are barely more than a centimetre in length, the finer details of their textured surfaces could never be visible to the naked eye. The entomological term for this texture is \u201cmicrosculpture\u201d \u2013 also the name Biss has given <a href=\"http://microsculpture.net/\" title=\"\">the project</a> \u2013 and the most arresting aspect of the series is the tactile landscape of the insects\u2019 bodies when seen at close range.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bf1b5e566b9d8f6f4001de964f3a24e148fa7f94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bf1b5e566b9d8f6f4001de964f3a24e148fa7f94/439_515_4028_4000/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Branch-Backed Treehopper\" width=\"1000\" height=\"993\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Branch-Backed Treehopper</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Levon Biss</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cUntil you see them up close \u2013 I mean really up close,\u201d says Biss, \u201cyou\u2019ve got no idea that each of the <a href=\"http://microsculpture.net/blow-fly.html\" title=\"\">fine hairs on a blowfly\u2019s wings</a> is a different shape, or that the common ground beetle has perfectly geometric hexagonal dimples all over it.\u201d Biss was particularly enthralled to learn that the vivid colours of the insects are not due to a pigment, which could fade, but the refraction of light off their delicately textured surfaces. \u201cI like that cross-over \u2013 the microsculpture and the colour are linked,\u201d he says. \u201cI was working on a tri-coloured jewel beetle the other day that was collected by AR Wallace \u2013 a contemporary of Darwin\u2019s. This insect is 160 years old, and it\u2019s full of colour.\u201d</p> <p>Photographer and entomologist have different preferences among the photographs. Biss favours the <a href=\"http://microsculpture.net/orchid-bee-side.html\" title=\"\">orchid cuckoo bee</a>, for the visual impact of its vivid greens, while Hogan has a soft spot for the <a href=\"http://microsculpture.net/marion-flightless-moth.html\" title=\"\">Marion flightless moth</a> \u2013 an extremely esoteric creature from the subantarctic Indian ocean that lives on the detritus that accumulates in albatross nests. The project isn\u2019t over, however: \u201cI haven\u2019t shot an insect for a month or so, and James said, \u2018Are you ready to go again?\u2019 I said, \u2018Yeah, let\u2019s go for it.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>First, though, Biss will see his private project exhibited on a very public scale, an experience that Sebastian, now eight, is relishing. \u201cHe\u2019s proud, because he thinks it\u2019s him that started this whole thing up \u2013 which it was,\u201d says Biss. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to taking him to the exhibition; that\u2019ll be quite a sweet moment, I think.\u201d</p> <p><em>Microsculpture will be exhibited at the </em><a href=\"http://www.oum.ox.ac.uk/visiting/whatson.htm\" title=\"\"><em>Oxford University Museum of Natural History</em></a><em> from 27 May to 30 October, with a photography workshop from Levon Biss on 9 July</em></p>",

The BMA will call for any contract offer, whether it is agreed or not, to be voted on by junior doctors. </p> <p>The health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said on Thursday that he wanted written agreement from the junior doctors committee that discussions over the contentious issue of unsocial hours and Saturday pay would be held in good faith. </p> <p>He added: \u201cI hope the BMA will take up the offer to talk constructively and we\u2019re seeking assurances by close of the day on Saturday that the BMA will negotiate constructively on the outstanding issues.\u201d</p> <p>The BMA had agreed to temporarily suspend further planned industrial action in an attempt to reach a compromise with ministers. It follows a series of strikes by junior doctors which saw thousands of operations cancelled after negotiations collapsed.</p> <p>Malawana said: \u201cThe BMA has agreed to re-enter talks with the government on outstanding issues in this dispute, which include, but are not limited to, unsocial hours. </p> <p>\u201cJunior doctors\u2019 concerns extend far beyond pay, and our principle in talks will be to deliver a fair contract that does not discriminate against women or any other group, one which addresses the recruitment and retention crisis in the NHS and which provides the basis for delivering a world-class health service. </p> <p>\u201cThe BMA will also call for any contract offer \u2013 agreed or not \u2013 to be put to a referendum of junior doctors, as is usual following a contract negotiation. We hope that with both parties back around the negotiating table, real progress can now be made to ending this dispute through talks.\u201d</p> <p>The new offer of talks follows a proposal put forward by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges calling for a five-day pause in the imposition of the new contract in England. </p> <p>In a letter to the academy\u2019s chairwoman, Prof Dame Sue Bailey, Hunt said the discussions should focus on outstanding concerns, not the 90% of issues already agreed. </p> <p>Junior doctors stopped providing emergency care for the first time in NHS history during action on April 26 and 27. More than 125,000 appointments and operations were cancelled, on top of almost 25,000 procedures cancelled during previous action.</p> <p>The dispute began when the government took steps to introduce its manifesto commitment of a seven-day NHS. Hunt wants to change what constitutes unsocial hours for which junior doctors can claim extra pay, turning 7am to 5pm on Saturday into a normal working day. Currently, 7pm to 7am Monday to Friday and the whole of Saturday and Sunday attract a premium rate of pay for junior doctors. </p> <p>Despite the government offsetting this change with a rise in basic pay of 13.5%, it has proved to be a sticking point with the BMA.

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/alain-de-botton\">Alain de Botton</a>\u2019s first novel in 23 years \u2013 his quirky, autobiographical debut, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/essays-in-love.html\"><em>Essays in Love</em></a>, was written when he was just 23 \u2013 again takes love as its theme. Like its predecessor, it explores the myths and minutiae of courtship and relationships. It charts a couple\u2019s marriage from the first flowering of attraction and the glow of the proposal to the everyday business of life as husband and wife. It maps the small shifts in their sex life and explores the way in which habits and behaviour which once endeared them to one another become sources of irritation and frustration.</p> <p>Rabih and Kirsten\u2019s story is an intentionally ordinary one. They meet, they fall in love, they marry, they encounter small obstacles in their personal and professional lives, they have children. One of them is unfaithful. The marriage strains but does not crack.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The Course of Love is at its strongest when De Botton steps back and allows the couple to breathe</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>While the book is being promoted as a novel rather than a work of philosophy, De Botton\u2019s interests as an essayist, in work, sex, happiness, in how we live and what we live for, are still very much to the fore. The narrative is intercut with a series of italicised interjections, unpicking the couple\u2019s motivations and impulses, dissecting their decisions. For example: \u201cNature imbeds in us insistent dreams of success\u201d; and \u201cThe accusations we direct at our lovers make no particular sense. We would utter such unfair things to no one else on earth.\u201d</p> <p>The contrast between these passages and the world of the characters makes for some appealing juxtapositions. Sometimes the observations are acute and telling \u2013 De Botton is good on the politics of laundry, the compromise of domesticity \u2013 but there\u2019s an insistence on universality that borders on the smug.</p> <p>He lays out his thesis, that society builds in us the expectation that our stories will play out in certain ways, that it\u2019s healthy and necessary to document disappointment and disillusionment, that so much of the tension in a marriage is self-generated, a product of the gulf between the life people feel they should be living and the life they are living.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/live/2016/apr/25/alain-de-botton-webchat-the-course-of-love\">Alain de Botton \u2013 your questions answered, on art, God and ugliness</a> </p> </aside>  <p><em>The Course of Love </em>is at its strongest when De Botton steps back and allows the couple to breathe. There\u2019s a lot of truth and humour in his account of the earliest days of their marriage as he highlights the intricate web of pressures, both self-imposed and external, that lead them to make certain choices. Rabih loves Kirsten, but he\u2019s also tired of a life alone. They marry, in part, because they feel it is time to marry, that they are in the marrying stage of their lives, and in the beginning, for both of them, marriage is a kind of performance: they are both playing roles, the choices they make shaped as much by their own emotions as by their family histories, their upbringings, the city in which they live, and the paths their peers are going down.</p> <p>While Rabih and Kirsten\u2019s story is always engaging and there\u2019s an ease and believability to them as a couple, the outside voice comes to feel grating and intrusive after a while, in its pronouncements and the narrowness of its outlook, in its continual desire to pin down the mess and complexity of the human experience, to bind it and box it.</p> <p><em>The Course of Love is published by Hamish Hamilton (\u00a314.99).</em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/385670/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\"><em> Click here to buy it for \u00a311.99</em></a></p>",

It sits on two slender cables that stretch across the torrent 10 metres below.</p> <p>\u201cThis cableway was the traditional route across the river, part of life in the highlands,\u201d says Denni, who runs horse riding tours of East Iceland from the farmhouse where he now lives with wife Arna Bjarnad\u00f3ttur. \u201cThe last man who farmed here once fell out of it in the middle. He was hauled out unconscious somewhere downstream, but was back at work three days later.\u201d</p> <p>We are in Flj\u00f3tsdalur, an upland valley made famous in the 1930s by novelist Gunnar Gunnarsson, who lived up here. His tales of stoical people battling the elements of ice, water and fire (of the volcanic sort) still ring true today.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/travel_iceland_web/giv-12515CS4M3XGC6bX0/\" data-alt=\"Iceland map\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/travel_iceland_web/giv-12515CS4M3XGC6bX0/\">Iceland map</a> <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Denni tells me that one of his own horses was lost on the high plateau that borders the great ice cap of Vatnajokull for a whole year, and has just been found.</p> <p>I get in the crate and haul myself over the river \u2013 without mishap \u2013 to an abandoned house. I peer in at the old bedstead and table: life was abominably hard here, and people were often forced to leave when their luck turned. An hour later, back at Denni\u2019s home, Arna shows me the Bible they found when they took over the dwelling, which had also been abandoned. \u201cIt\u2019s dated 1728, and we think it was left behind when the volcano, Askja, erupted in 1875. The family emigrated to America.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"de11ca7e9c1b2f6a53be4cd6493ffc4fcb414cd5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/de11ca7e9c1b2f6a53be4cd6493ffc4fcb414cd5/0_73_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Denni and Arna in the traditional longhouse at Fljo\u0301tsdalur, East Iceland\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Denni and Arna in the traditional longhouse at Fljo\u0301tsdalur</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Despite all the departures, however, East Iceland is now experiencing a small but significant return, with people coming back, often to family roots, and finding new ways to make a living, often through tourism. Film-maker Denni was born in East Iceland, but has lived in Rejkjavik and the US. He and Arna are now based here and have built a traditional <em>ba\u0111stofa</em> or longhouse for guests. Their fascinating collection of artefacts and antiques from Flj\u00f3tsdalur history are dotted around. Like many others they believe in slow food and slow tourism: \u201cWe encourage guests to go walking, chat in the kitchen, or just play with the dog.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a philosophy I find all over the area. Many farms use volunteering websites such as <a href=\"http://www.helpx.net/\">helpx.net</a> or <a href=\"http://www.workaway.info/\">workaway.info</a> to bring in visitors who want to stay longer and earn their keep. At one farm they sang the praises of a British student who had just spent a fortnight painting the barn, between making excellent pancakes and doing hill walks.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"92e0d1ad04914ae1ff442fabbfd38c6f3a7bd4d1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92e0d1ad04914ae1ff442fabbfd38c6f3a7bd4d1/0_79_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Fa\u0301skru\u0301\u00f0sfjo\u0308r\u00f0ur waterfall on the road to Egilssta\u00f0ir\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Fa\u0301skru\u0301\u00f0sfjo\u0308r\u00f0ur waterfall on the road to Egilssta\u00f0ir</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The main town in East Iceland is Egilssta\u00f0ir, which made headlines in 2012 when the local council voted to accept the <a href=\"http://www.seeker.com/lake-monster-exists-concludes-icelandic-commission-1769066020.html\">video evidence for a giant Nessie-style monster</a> in their lake. In the <a href=\"http://www.saltbistro.is/\">Salt Bistro</a>, I chat to Stef\u00e1n Bogi Sveinsson who was president of the council at that time. \u201cI was called on to adjudicate on whether a medieval monster existed,\u201d he says, with a twinkle in his eye. \u201cPeople here are really not far from the old mythology. I voted in favour.\u201d</p> <p>I ask if the renaissance is real, too.</p> <p>\u201cYes, I think it is,\u201d he says. \u201cI moved back here from Reykjavik myself and there are plenty of others. We\u2019ve got this new flight coming in from Gatwick and people are investing in small businesses \u2013 like this bistro.\u201d</p> <p>A spectacular drive over mountains takes me to some of these new, tourism-driven businesses. At Karlssta\u00f0ir, on the shores of Berufj\u00f6r\u0111ur, I find Svavar Eysteinsson and Berglind H\u00e4sler, who manage to be farmers, vegan sausage-makers, guesthouse-owners and Icelandic pop stars. In 2014 their band, Prins P\u00f3l\u00f3, scored a massive hit on the island with the theme tune for the film Paris of the North. Now Svavar is out rounding up sheep for his uncle and Berglind is setting up the ovens for their latest venture: a crowd-funded cottage industry making turnip crisps.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"e2fe5677bbf97b9d81ffe39d5fafde75986115b8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e2fe5677bbf97b9d81ffe39d5fafde75986115b8/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sey\u00f0isfjo\u0308r\u00f0ur, a beautiful small town of clapboard houses\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sey\u00f0isfjo\u0308r\u00f0ur, a beautiful small town of clapboard houses in Norwegian style</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cI was worried we would be bored,\u201d says Berglind, \u201cbut in fact we get loads of people dropping in. I don\u2019t think I could ever go back to Reykjavik.\u201d</p> <p>The drive around these fjords is breathtaking. Waterfalls plunge over cliffs into the ocean and crags tickle the clouds. Amid it all there is a winding road and a smattering of red-roofed farms. East of Egilssta\u00f0ir I eventually reach Sey\u00f0isfj\u00f6r\u00f0ur, a thriving port that is home to just 650 people and yet manages to support an art school, a cinema, a theatre, restaurants, and bars. It also has several beautifully restored wooden houses, some of which have been converted into the Hotel Aldan. I stay at what was the bank, and eat in a bistro, watching a strange assortment of art students, fishermen and farmers come and go. You could spend a few days here very easily, maybe taking a trip down to Sk\u00e1lanes at the fjord\u2019s mouth, where a field centre-cum-guesthouse lies next to an eider duck colony.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86dad58e2d9c84935da2d6e624160bd62c6369fd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86dad58e2d9c84935da2d6e624160bd62c6369fd/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sk\u00fali J\u00fal\u00edusson on Sn\u00e6fell\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sk\u00fali J\u00fal\u00edusson on Sn\u00e6fell</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Time is limited, however, and next morning I have to meet Sk\u00fali J\u00fal\u00edusson who is going to take me up Sn\u00e6fell \u2013one of several Icelandic mountains that go by this name. It\u2019s the highest peak in the area, and permanently covered in ice. We drive to its base and then set off across a rising slope of volcanic gravel and rock which gets steeper and becomes ice. We attach crampons. The views are increasingly spectacular: delicate veins of shining silver water, marble lava fields patched with golden lichen and emerald green moss. Everything is stark and treeless. At the summit we get a panorama that includes active B\u00e1r\u00f0arbunga volcano.</p> <p>We return by the same route to the car. The walk has not been long, but I am a bit cold and agree to Sk\u00fali\u2019s suggestion of a hot shower. So why are we heading into the wilderness? Sk\u00fali chuckles. \u201cYou\u2019ll see.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"94cd858ec8b1ee12740fcb40e7e767ee888a09af\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/94cd858ec8b1ee12740fcb40e7e767ee888a09af/0_0_4739_2843/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A welcome shower in a hot waterfall\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A welcome shower in a hot waterfall after the climb.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At the end of a gravel track we get out and walk. There is grass here and I can see a line of steam rising from the ground. After a few minutes the mystery is revealed: a waterfall in the wilderness that spouts continuously at 38C. It\u2019s miraculous. The nearest thing to it would be to turn on your shower at home, very hot, then leave it running, forever. We soak for an hour in the pool under the falls, until sunset reminds us to leave. I experience a strange sensation: I\u2019m in cornucopia-denial.

      "body": "<p>In 1997 I looked into the pre-atomic age eyes of Harriet, the then 166-year-old Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise, in an Australian zoo, and saw myself reflected back, a traveller in time. And earlier this year, I looked into the pre-digital-age eyes of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/shortcuts/2016/may/04/attenborough-90-wildlife-legend-top-10-tv-moments\">David Attenborough</a>, on the platform of Oxford station, and saw myself reflected back, a traveller on the 11.59 to Paddington.</p> <p>Suddenly, with his archaic belief in both the value of public broadcasting and the inherent worth of the un-monetisable natural world, the venerable polymath himself is as rare a creature as the Gal\u00e1pagos tortoise, whose environment he strove to save, and one equally doomed to extinction.</p> <p>I thought about tortoises. Do these hard-shelled heroes, some of whom may have been gazed upon by Darwin himself, now gaze in turn upon Attenborough with sympathy, knowing that the landscape the ancient BBC apologist once thrived in is soon to be entirely stripped away by the doctrine of the free market?</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Whittingdale, a thought-hating Teflon armadillo, appears to be armour-plated</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>David Attenborough is 90 today. But, sadly, it would be better that he die soon, without having seen what the culture secretary <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/apr/24/john-whittingdale-dominatrix-leveson\">John Whittingdale</a> will do to his legacy, and how those charged with defending it will let it slip away, unmourned. If Whittingdale had any honour, any mercy, and any basic human decency, he would murder David Attenborough himself today, in his bed, to spare him any further suffering.</p> <p>But do it pat, John Whittingdale, quickly and cleanly, with one swift slash of the butcher\u2019s knife across that old, wise throat, not slowly and painfully, hung up on a hook and whipped, like all those women, in those films you like.</p> <p>As I climbed down from the train, Attenborough, alone, caught my eye. \u201cYou,\u201d he said, \u201cI know you from the Baftas. You represent exactly the kind of distinctive voice public broadcasting ought to be encouraging. Meet me at the new Woodberry Wetlands centre on the first weekend of May. I have something for you.\u201d I accepted my mission. Who wouldn\u2019t? It was David Attenborough.</p> <p>In a related development, a recent edition of the <em>Daily Telegraph</em>, Britain\u2019s most unpleasant broadsheet newspaper, was a veritable four-poster bed full of carefully placed severed horses\u2019 heads, laid out to intimidate all who might dare to defy the post-Leveson press John Whittingdale is charged with regulating. Cryptic references; articles with no proper nouns; covert ideological justifications for dustbin dirt-harvesting buried in distant sections.</p> <p>On balance, I think that the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> is a sewer. Although perhaps to say the <em>Daily Telegraph</em> is a sewer is to dignify it. The <em>Daily Telegraph</em> is, instead, an aqueduct full of the discarded contents of Charles Moore\u2019s chemical toilet, constructed conveniently at head height, so that its readers can lap the fruits of his micturition directly from it until they are sated, as it flows gradually downhill from his home in Tunbridge Wells.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"51cf263d79a0c3fc953a7e5243ead03cfb970d89\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/51cf263d79a0c3fc953a7e5243ead03cfb970d89/0_0_2075_3100/669.jpg\" alt=\"Illustration by David Foldvari.\" width=\"669\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Illustration by David Foldvari.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>How odd that while the evil Jedi Knights controlling the press rattle their lightsabers about not being able to dish the dirt on actors and TV presenters, they said nothing for years of John Whittingdale\u2019s unknowing indiscretions. And yet we are supposed to continue to believe that this had nothing to do with his role in future press regulation. Yeah? Monkeys might fly out of Lord Downton\u2019s butt!</p> <p>Audaciously, they even invite us to imagine that Whittingdale\u2019s private life\u2019s absence from the headlines was in fact evidence that regulation was working. A man who went out, without knowing, with a lady who whipped people, and who went on business to a place where some other ladies will dance their bum on your winky if it is under some trousers, is helping the papers to be able to carry on making money by saying that someone else had a thing put up their bum or another person kissed two people at once. In the words of the <em>Daily Mail</em> columnist Richard Littlejohn: \u201cYou couldn\u2019t make it up! Kill prostitutes!! Kill them now!!!\u2019</p> <p>But Whittingdale, a thought-hating Teflon armadillo, appears to be armour-plated. Consider. Over the five years I have filled in here, during the increasingly suspicious absences of your regular columnist, David Mitchell, I have noticed repetitive patterns emerging in my work, not all of them intentional.</p> <p>Ludicrous and dubious figures, given to reliably ludicrous and dubious pronouncements, emerge periodically from the political mist \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/mar/22/grant-shapps-tory-green-aliens-stewart-lee\">Grant Shapps</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/aug/23/iain-duncan-smith-political-fiction-stewart-lee\">Iain Duncan Smith</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/feb/08/secondary-ticketing-legal-but-not-morally-right-sajid-javid\">Sajid Javid</a> \u2013 and columns featuring them begin to write themselves. Typically, these larger-than-life loons become funny characters in their own right, before inconveniently disappearing from public life, or making sideways moves to less high-profile positions, just as I was really hitting my stride at ventriloquising versions of them.</p> <p>People so easy to ridicule, so inherently ridiculous, are inevitably heading for a fall, or at least a change of job. But Whittingdale has been unashamedly ridiculous since at least last summer, and yet, like that old condom stuck to the roof of the bus shelter by the mosque and visible only from the top deck of the 141, he shows no signs of being removed by higher powers any time soon, perhaps because they are scared of his knowledge of torture techniques.</p> <p>In choosing Whittingdale to destroy the BBC the secret chiefs chose well. He does not believe anything has any value other than its fiscal one, so he cannot be convinced that culture, documentaries, drama, comedy and music are of any worth in and of themselves.</p> <p>He sees the back catalogue of Attenborough, for example, which no other broadcaster could or would have created, as an unacceptable \u201cmarket intervention\u201d. And he has no shame, so he cannot be shamed. John Whittingdale could stand before a select committee naked, covered in photos of himself naked, and he would maintain the same shark-eyed steeliness.</p> <p>I met Attenborough last weekend, as arranged, in a secluded patch of earth behind some reeds at the new wetlands centre he himself had ceremonially opened. \u201cTake this,\u201d he said, reaching into a pouch in his belly, marsupial style, to pluck out a tiny egg, crisscrossed with magical markings, \u201cand keep it safe and warm, but not too warm, during these troubled times. One day, maybe,\u201d said Attenborough, holding my hand, \u201cthe world will be well once more and it will be time to let it hatch.\u201d</p> <p><em>Stewart Lee\u2019s Content Provider (work in progress) is playing in Edinburgh and London.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Akram Khan was born in Wimbledon, south-west London. His family comes from Dhaka, Bangladesh. At the age of seven he trained in Kathak, one of the eight forms of classical Indian dance, before making his professional debut at the age of 13 in Peter Brook\u2019s legendary production of the <em>Mahabharata</em>. His style is an authoritative hybrid of ancient and modern and the <em>Mahabharata, </em>with which he toured the world for two years<em>,</em> has proved a lasting influence. His latest show, <a href=\"http://www.akramkhancompany.net/productions/until-the-lions/\"><em>Until the Lions</em></a>, is based on the epic Hindu poem and will be at the <a href=\"http://www.akramkhancompany.net/whats-on/until-the-lions-brighton/\">Brighton Festival 26-27 May</a>, and at the Curve in Leicester 3-5 November.</p> <h2>1 | Poetry</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2012/sep/10/brand-new-ancients-review\"><strong>Brand New Ancients</strong></a><strong> by Kate Tempest</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"6b4f9208e68114a8d1c6390a61150130dd0e3bb5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/6b4f9208e68114a8d1c6390a61150130dd0e3bb5/223_531_4690_2814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Poet Kate Tempest.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There is something universal about her\u2019: Kate Tempest.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karen Robinson for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I heard her voice first and then saw her on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLWlB3ib7ZM\">YouTube</a>. I was looking for a poet. I had been working with a wonderful poet called Polarbear and Kate Tempest is a friend of his. He said: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have a look at her?\u201d There is something powerful and \u2013 a rare thing \u2013 universal about her. There are two kinds of knowledge: information, which is what most of us have, from technology and books, and then there is lived knowledge \u2013 real knowledge. When Kate Tempest speaks her poetry, there is deep, inhabited knowledge. It took no more than that little YouTube advert to make me see she was special. I became a fan.</p> <h2>2 | Film</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FquLnfzLjs\"><strong>Talvar (Guilty)</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"788ced49aad33c618fc64f1ada536b0f46540ad4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/788ced49aad33c618fc64f1ada536b0f46540ad4/0_0_1500_900/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Talvar ( Guilty) film still\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Emotionally challenging\u2019: Talvar ( Guilty)</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This 2015 Bollywood drama is an emotionally challenging film and a true story. If you have children \u2013 I have two \u2013 it is especially poignant. I was in India touring. I joked to my producer: \u201cWe are in Bombay, Bollywood Town.\u201d I\u2019d been working intensely, India is never easy with a technical tour, though it is rewarding. \u201cWe should see a Bollywood film.\u201d He said: \u201cBrace yourself.\u201d The film he took me to was about a murdered daughter, and how the court incorrectly convicted the girl\u2019s parents of the crime. The real killer is still out there, the lovely parents in prison for a crime they did not commit. It is horrific and it is happening right now. It hit me in a way other films have not.</p> <h2>3 | Theatre</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/23/the-encounter-simon-mcburney-edinburgh-review-observer\"><strong>The Encounter</strong></a><strong> by Simon McBurney</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"aa7db8dd675f334f161dcf86757c733b7ae55bae\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/aa7db8dd675f334f161dcf86757c733b7ae55bae/187_510_4139_2483/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simon McBurney in The Encounter\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Ingenious\u2019: Simon McBurney in The Encounter</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Simon McBurney is a friend and we have been wanting to do something together for so long. Whenever we meet, we say: \u201cWhen will we do this duet?\u201d I am not the only one with an impossibly busy schedule. I am looking forward to seeing his new show in Amsterdam at a festival in which we are both performing. He has created <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LW01mBruivo\">a sound world within an Amazon forest</a>. He ingeniously takes away familiar theatrical vocabulary and rephrases it. McBurney and his work can be summed up in this line from Sri Sri Ravi Shankar: \u201cSound when stretched is music, movement when stretched is dance, mind when stretched is meditation and life when stretched is celebration.\u201d</p> <h2>4 | Children\u2019s book</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32A31SzVhyw\"><strong>The Giving Tree</strong></a><strong> by Shel Silverstein (1964)</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a6b4bfff0136e8e6a4a1c41b85f7a8d7727dcdf1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a6b4bfff0136e8e6a4a1c41b85f7a8d7727dcdf1/64_0_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Giving Tree by Shel Silverstein.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018I come back to this whenever I get frustrated\u2019: The Giving Tree by Shel Silverstein.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Particular Books</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I keep going back to this book because I have to remind myself of humanity, humility and giving without expecting. You have a different respect for your parents when you have children yourself. It has nothing to do with how good or bad your children are. They are just children. Children expect without giving back. I believe we borrow energy from the world when we come into it. When we die, we have to give that energy to someone else to take on. We are on borrowed time. I come back to this book whenever I get frustrated or stuck. Not that I am claiming that I am able to give as it says.</p> <h2>5 | Place</h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.kalakshetra.in/\"><strong>Kalakshetra</strong></a><strong>, India</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ea4a6438f1f0edc85196bfce637cd4d57fc37ebd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ea4a6438f1f0edc85196bfce637cd4d57fc37ebd/0_0_3872_2324/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Kalakshetra institute.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A spiritual experience\u2019: The Kalakshetra institute.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I was in India again last year, in Chennai, and invited to give a masterclass at Kalakshetra. It is one of the oldest Indian classical institutes and it was a spiritual experience. They were taking class under the banyan tree. In the middle of this sacred place, nature and art come together. There is an ancient theatre of wood and straw and clay with a few lights and such atmosphere \u2013 the sounds of insects and musical instruments. It was inspiring. Place changes everything. For me, life and art are fused. I felt I would like to spend more time in this place, knowing it would influence my work.</p> <h2>6 | Documentary</h2> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Za3lZcrzzcM\"><strong>Amy by Asif Kapadia</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"bb2f387e8a7c3e03e10f9a1c0175af22463e003d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bb2f387e8a7c3e03e10f9a1c0175af22463e003d/0_280_1992_1195/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Amy Winehouse\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Something ancient about her voice\u2019: Amy Winehouse.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This is a film that reflects on fame and the unreality that can become your reality, which can be very dangerous if you don\u2019t have the right support. Asif Kapadia is a wonderful film director. He is able to capture the essence of people (think of his terrific film, <em>Senna</em>). He was able to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/05/amy-winehouse-documentary-asif-kapadia-review\">guide the audience through Amy\u2019s journey</a> and see it from her perspective, so you can empathise \u2013 Asif is great at that. I wish I had seen Amy perform live, there was something ancient about her voice. As soon as she opened her mouth, you felt there was a history to it.</p> <h2>7 | Concert</h2> <p><strong>Brad Mehldau: </strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/18/brad-mehldau-review-wigmore-hall-london-bach\"><strong>Three pieces after Bach</strong></a></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41002bb1bcb6e7783e838ef57dfa9f62d4682a6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41002bb1bcb6e7783e838ef57dfa9f62d4682a6b/0_47_4612_2768/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pianist Brad Mehldau\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Thinking aloud when he plays\u2019: Brad Mehldau</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Natkin/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brad Mehldau is a phenomenal jazz pianist. He takes well-known songs and transforms them seamlessly, as if they were originally written as jazz. His mind, his creativity, as he is improvising is amazing: you feel he is thinking aloud as he plays. This was a long, intense, ingenious evening in which your mind floated away. He translated Bach (Fugue No 16 in G minor, Prelude in C major from The Well-Tempered Clavier, and Book 1\u2019s D Minor Prelude No 6). I am eclectic in my musical tastes. I admire artistry.</p>",

Fundacion Arca and Socorro Animal Ecuador were among the groups that went in to help injured animals. Here, four people share their experiences of helping injured pets. </em></p> <h2>Valentina Le\u00f3n, president, <a href=\"http://fundacionarca.com/\">Fundac\u00edon Arca</a></h2> <p>We entered Ground Zero breathlessly and with our hearts oppressed. The desolation of the place made it look like a ghost town. Manta\u2019s central shopping district, Tarqui, was completely destroyed in the earthquake and it was impossible to imagine the hustle of commercial activity that would have filled the streets just days before. The smell of putrefaction was heavy in the air and I felt overwhelmed by the pain, anguish and desperation of human and animal victims who had perished there, and of those who are still alive. We began to walk down the streets looking for signs of life.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d03e91ead0510794b1d0c136ddc9a4c10b915df5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d03e91ead0510794b1d0c136ddc9a4c10b915df5/0_30_886_532/500.jpg\" alt=\"ARCA Ecuador Rescue 2016\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Keeble Photo C Going into a wrecked house to entice a cat to safety</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Keeble/Humane Society International</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Suddenly, I heard an intense cat scream \u2013 a mixture of loneliness and a call for attention. We looked for several minutes, but we could not see the cat. His call seemed to come from inside a building at high risk to collapse \u2013 we could not go inside it.</p> <p>We were close to despair by the impossibility of entering the building, and then I saw the cat on the roof of the neighbouring house. I went into the ruins trying to approach him but it was inaccessible and he was very afraid. Finally he decided to come down and approached us. So in need of affection, he rubbed up against the hands of his rescuers.</p> <p>The magnitude of the disaster in Ecuador is unimaginable. Many towns along the Pacific Coast have been destroyed. Many people lost their loved ones, businesses and work. The country\u2019s economy is also seriously injured.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"a13435294d8f71bf9782899bfa3a5088cc456fa5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a13435294d8f71bf9782899bfa3a5088cc456fa5/0_0_886_591/500.jpg\" alt=\"ARCA Ecuador Rescue 2016\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Man and dog John Keeble Photos Ecuador 2016</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Keeble/Humane Society International</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The coast of Manabi province is in ruins, and in this tragedy the animals are also victims. Some are wandering the streets disorientated, others remain in what was once their home, waiting for something, others still share a makeshift tent, roof or shelter with their families. There are thousands of animals in need of help. Animals are also victims of poverty, abuse, and indifference. They lack veterinary care and policies to protect them.</p> <p>The cat we rescued from Ground Zero came home with me. I named him Filipo and he is with me now \u2013 purring, warm and secure. I share his story while I plan how to help other animals. There is an urgent need of medicines, veterinarians, homes, food, time, dedication and love based on sustained work to rebuild their lives. <br /></p> <h2>John Keeble, photojournalist</h2> <p>I\u2019ve joined one of the animal rescue teams trying to help the thousands of animals in need after the earthquake. The team of volunteer vets and support staff have been treating and feeding hundreds of dogs and cats found in the wrecked buildings or brought to makeshift surgeries by their anxious owners.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"92859127c5a6f698743da4d5c3fd085ef6345747\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92859127c5a6f698743da4d5c3fd085ef6345747/0_0_886_1329/667.jpg\" alt=\"ARCA Ecuador Rescue 2016\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">At a free roadside clinic, the vets work till evening to respond to demand.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Keeble/Humane Society International</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Streams of owners and their pets have arrived for a free roadside clinic in the district of Chone, Manabi province. It is a poor community and the earthquake has made it even poorer. The demand for help leaves the vets working into the evening.</p> <p>Soldiers guarding the team and keeping the crowd of pet owners in order are looking increasingly tense as the vets work using light from mobile phones. Other volunteers edge to the front of the crowd to squirt worming medicine into reluctant canine mouths, and to assess each animal\u2019s condition before directing people to the right line for care or for animal food.</p> <p>This is an area, even without before the earthquake, that is best avoided after dark. It is known as being lethally dangerousbut no one is leaving until the last animal has been seen and the the last owner given bags of food.</p> <h2>Dani Moncayo, Socorro Animal Ecuador</h2> <p><br />My sister Valeria and I watched news of the earthquake as it emerged on our TVs. We were shocked, like everyone else. People were being rescued but we could see how the animals were suffering too. It was heartbreaking and we knew we had to do something for the animals.<br />We got donations of food at first but as we saw how some foundations were helping animals we decided to raise money to support their efforts. We knew we had to appeal to the wider world because most people here were focused on the needs of people.</p> <p>We are still in the emergency phase of trying to help the thousands of animals that need food, shelter and attention from veterinarians \u2013 so many were hurt, others were left alone when their owners were killed or were force to abandon them when they had to leave the damaged areas.<br /></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"a51fbcd292a9c3b714cd6aad4060cf2f2c034a52\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/a51fbcd292a9c3b714cd6aad4060cf2f2c034a52/0_0_886_591/500.jpg\" alt=\"ARCA Ecuador Rescue 2016\" width=\"500\" height=\"334\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A dog receiving treatment by the road.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Keeble/Humane Society International</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Animals suffer like people. They feel the fear of the earthquake and the fear of being abandoned without food, shelter and people. Animals are as scared as people when the aftershocks strike. People can get psychological help but animals cannot. That is why we need to search for them.</p> <p>Many animals still have their owners but they cannot afford medical help or food for them. It is a terrible situation. Damaged homes and businesses are being cleared and there is a real risk that animals living in the buildings will be killed or badly injured and left to die slowly.<br /></p> <h2><strong>Cristina Bernardi, lead veterinarian, </strong>Fundac\u00edon Arca</h2> <p>We were walking past a soldier guarding an area of Tarqui and he told us about three cats in a house. We found the house but couldn\u2019t open the door I called through a tiny hole in the door and two kittens came through. They were starving. I spent 10 minutes feeding them before they would let me pick them up. I looked into the room for the third kitten but it wasn\u2019t there. I don\u2019t know what happened to it. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fd78750482f961800a0bc0f2c714f16a20955e02\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fd78750482f961800a0bc0f2c714f16a20955e02/0_0_886_1329/667.jpg\" alt=\"ARCA Ecuador Rescue 2016\" width=\"667\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Young student vets have volunteered to help.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: John Keeble/Humane Society International</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>A couple of hours earlier, our team was treating animals in an open and populated part of Tarqui - vaccinating, worming and giving out food. We were shocked to find so many dogs with advanced distemper and we had to put seven of them to sleep. Later in the day we reached Chone, another town hit by the earthquake, and picked up three soldiers to guard us and our supplies. </p> <p>Our team, which includes four young students who have taken on work normally done by fully-trained veterinarians, are finding extra health complications in the animals , such as parasites. During our days here, we have helped hundreds of animals and their owners but we know that it is almost nothing compared to the needs of animals throughout the earthquake area. </p> <p><em>Donations made to Humane Society International\u2019s emergency Ecuador earthquake animal fund will be used to buy veterinary medical supplies and support the team of trained veterinarians who treat animals in more remote areas.

Neuroscientists and sports psychologists agree that the way a team imagines itself performing is just as important as the strength of the players.</p> <p>There\u2019s increasing evidence that mental practice can improve physical performance. A group of people were asked to lift their finger a thousand times in their minds, with an instrument checking that they were not exerting any muscle force. At the end of the process, they could lift more with their fingers than those who had not done the mental exercise.</p> <p>So Claudio Ranieri\u2019s coaching strategy, in which he encouraged the players to focus on one game at a time and concentrated on building teamwork, should be praised. He may have made the players run around a lot, but what he really worked on in coaching sessions was training the players\u2019 brains.</p> <p><em>Dr Daniel Glaser is director of Science Gallery at King\u2019s College London</em></p>",

One of them is <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2001/mar/22/healthandwellbeing.health2\" title=\"\">ayurveda</a>, which is a very old system [with medicines often based on herbs, minerals and metals] indigenous to India, and then there is also yoga. Siddha is similar to ayurveda but the texts are different and come from a different part of India. There is unani, which is originally from the Greek hippocratic system of medicine that came to India with Arab scholars. Then there are naturopathy and homeopathy, which are European in origin. Any of these things, you can go to a government-funded facility to use.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Because India is so pluralistic, most people are willing to accept more than one thing on an equal footing</p> <footer> <cite>Aarathi Prasad</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Your grandfather practised ayurveda, and was involved in pushing for integration with western medicine after independence. Was that the motivation for your book?</strong><br />My mother would tell me about him and his work, and at home if I cut my finger we\u2019d go to the kitchen and put turmeric on it. So culturally it was very strong in my upbringing. But I didn\u2019t know that he had pushed for integrated medicine. That was all new to me. When India was a British colony, the study of traditional forms of medicine as medicine was banned. So what do you do when the colonists leave? Do you choose to use the medicine that the colonisers brought or do you go back to what was considered medicine before?</p> <p><strong>There\u2019s an argument that if a herbal remedy, such as those of ayurveda, has an effect on the body, the chemicals responsible should be identified and extracted so it can be regulated and dosed correctly. How does that fit with the views you encountered?</strong><br />That\u2019s exactly what many of the people I talked to, and the government, are trying to do \u2013 that is, use the best of both. There is the example of a South American plant: tribal people say \u201cthe fruit is very nutritious but we also use it for infertility.\u201d And so the ayurvedic gatherers take it back to the lab and look for active ingredients in it. It\u2019s very much like the drug discovery process, but a little less random because scientists are trying to understand the cultural context in which people are already using the plant, and whether they feel it is working. It is anecdote, but anecdote is a form of evidence.</p> <p><strong>Is there any resistance? </strong><br />Yes. A lot of westen doctors say, \u201cKeep your knowledge\u201d, while some ayurvedic doctors say, \u201cYou are not doing ayurveda properly\u201d. Ayurveda has become like any other medical system where you go to university for a few years, you study a range of subjects, a lot of them western medical subjects. There is friction but I think the future is using the best of both\u00a0worlds.</p> <p><strong>In this push for integration is there not a danger of fuelling pseudo-scientific research? One idea is to use modern genetic techniques to investigate \u201cimbalances\u201d in the body\u2019s \u201chumours\u201d, for example\u2026</strong><br />Ayurvedic research institutes even have a word for it: <a href=\"https://www.igib.res.in/?q=ayurgenomics\" title=\"\">ayurgenomics</a>. It\u2019s similar to the hippocratic idea of the four humours. In ayurveda there are three, but the idea is the same, that disease comes from imbalance. People have a predominance of one type of \u201chumour\u201d over another and they are looking at whether those categorisations can be linked to what your genetic sequences look like.</p> <p><strong>You are a geneticist \u2013 is this a runner?</strong><br />No, absolutely not. Chemical analysis is interesting and so is drug development but the genomics thing is bizarre.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1186cc7ecec16c7b71cf5d6cc5baa5c69a0b8fd9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1186cc7ecec16c7b71cf5d6cc5baa5c69a0b8fd9/0_207_3918_2351/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A woman receiving an Ayurvedic treatment in Kerala, India.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A woman receiving an Ayurvedic treatment in Kerala, India.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>Would you visit an ayurvedic practitioner?</strong><br />Personally I wouldn\u2019t, but I would do yoga. I think there is a lot on the system of nutrition that makes a lot of sense. People go to alternatives when modern medicine doesn\u2019t have an answer \u2013 they see a lot of parents of autistic kids coming in.</p> <p><strong>You describe an encounter with someone who said they had prayed to a goddess and their wife was cured of TB. How do you respond to statements like that?</strong><br />They don\u2019t have any other explanation. It\u2019s something really interesting about India. Because it is so pluralistic on so many levels, most people are willing to accept more than one thing on an equal footing. So [they\u2019d say]: \u201cMaybe it was the goddess, maybe it was the medicines, we are not sure \u2013 but does it even matter because she is better now?\u201d</p> <p><strong>Many of the initiatives to provide access\u00a0to good healthcare seem to come from determined individuals and philanthropic organisations rather than the government. Does that frustrate you?</strong><br />Yes, it is predominantly people\u2019s own [efforts] \u2013 they have spotted a problem and made sacrifices or used their own money or got family money or started an initiative themselves. The government seems to be working for the public through supporting private hospitals but the money never filters back into the public system and so the government hospitals are dire and oversubscribed. The percentage of GDP going into healthcare is appallingly low, and while I was writing the book it dropped\u00a0further.</p> <p><strong>One of the more dramatic folk remedies in the book involves swallowing live fish \u2013 tell me about that.</strong><br />It is a cure for asthma \u2013 obviously! When I first looked at [the practitioners\u2019] website, I couldn\u2019t believe it \u2013 it was almost state-sponsored and sounded completely bonkers. They make a secret herbal formulation, they get live fish about the length of your finger and they stuff the herbs into its mouth and put the fish down your throat. The other bizarre thing is that it has be on a particular day every year at a certain time. I thought, these people are charlatans \u2013 this\u00a0is\u00a0ridiculous.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/dec/06/homeopathy-wont-cure-you-unless-you-have-a-little-faith\">Homeopathy won\u2019t cure you \u2013 unless you have a little faith</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Did meeting them change your view?</strong><br />I was surprised actually because they\u2019re a really nice family and they\u2019re doing this charitably. Something like 70-80,000 people come. The state actually gives a stadium over to this and the ministry of fisheries keep aside the fish for them. They are not trained as ayurvedic doctors. The point is, for a lot of people who are poor, if they see that a doctor will do something for free, they turn up. There\u2019s a lot of opposition \u2013 people say this needs to be tested and question the government supporting it. It is the same for homeopathy: the government supports homeopathy and there is no evidence for that either. People will come to swallow fish for asthma with their inhaler in their pocket. Indians hedge their bets.</p> <p><strong>Does the inclusion of homeopathy and naturopathy in Ayush have a detrimental effect on the image of traditional\u00a0Indian medicines?</strong><br />I think so. There\u2019s this idea that they\u00a0are natural and they can\u2019t cause\u00a0any harm. Of course that\u2019s not true: herbal remedies will have effects\u00a0because there\u2019s something in\u00a0them. Homeopathy won\u2019t \u2013 because\u00a0there\u2019s nothing in it, though it might prevent you being diagnosed with whatever it is that is really affecting you. I would\u00a0drop those two, and look to things that have a professionalised system and some evidence and logic behind them.</p> <p><strong>What\u2019s the biggest challenge for healthcare in India?</strong><br />Funding is one major thing the government could do immediately. And\u00a0you need to take into account cultural context: when you have tribal\u00a0people who wrap their dead in\u00a0white clothes then they\u2019re not likely\u00a0to feel comfortable with doctors\u00a0and nurses wearing white clothes . A lot of doctors I spoke to said we need more textbooks that are\u00a0written here for the Indian cultural\u00a0context. And we need more\u00a0doctors.</p> <p><em>In the Bonesetter\u2019s Waiting Room: Travels through Indian Medicine by Aarathi Prasad is published by Profile and the Wellcome Collection (\u00a314.99). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/376869/\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to order a copy for \u00a311.99</em></a></p>",

The gist of the album is in Anohni\u2019s takedown of irreversible climate change, in the chorus you can sing along to. \u201cI want to see the animals dying in the trees,\u201d she howls, playing devil\u2019s advocate about what will happen if we don\u2019t curb emissions, massively, by yesterday. <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/152637866\">Drone Bomb Me</a> \u2013 the second taster \u2013 is even better: sung in the voice of a young Afghan girl, begging for death since her family are all gone. \u201cLet me be the one you choose tonight,\u201d Anohni sings, an anguished play on pop coquettishness.</p> <p>On Watch Me, the US National Security Agency is cast as a father figure whose attentiveness is controlling and downright sinister. \u201cI know you love me/ Cos you\u2019re always watching me,\u201d Anohni coos, while HudMo and Oneohtrix pour out the contents of their toy boxes in a deluge of foxy digitals. Anohni\u2019s stated mission \u2013 to smuggle polemical content in through pop Trojan horses \u2013 is accomplished here.</p> <p>The subject matter, then, is unrelenting. But Anohni\u2019s impassioned delivery succeeds in making ecstatic music out of it, carried along by propulsive soundbeds; music that is equal to the apocalypse. There\u2019s room for art, too. Most startling of all these songs, perhaps, is Obama, where Anohni accesses her lowest register to take the outgoing president to task over a legacy of kill lists. There\u2019s a hint of Indian devotional music to her vocal, or perhaps the call to prayer.</p>",

      "body": "<p><strong>You have designed </strong><a href=\"http://tillmans.co.uk/campaign-eu\"><strong>25 posters against Brexit</strong></a><strong>. What prompted you, as an artist, to make this high-profile, pro-European statement?</strong><br />Several things. First, it is a much more complex issue than all the shouting you hear in the media by those wishing to leave. It\u2019s not about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/05/david-cameron-boris-johnson-eu-referendum-countryfile-bbc\">Boris versus Cameron</a>. It has huge consequences for Britain and for Europe, but the debate is being fought on peripheral subjects that have been made to seem central \u2013 quotas and the length of the working week, things that can be negotiated. The big issue for me concerns isolationism and the rise of rightwing extremism in Europe and beyond. The extremists are diametrically opposed to the EU\u2019s founding values. We forget that this is something that binds us and protects us and that, as one of the posters puts it, is \u201cthe largest peace project in human history\u201d.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/sep/17/how-the-world-caught-up-with-wolfgang-tillmans-photography-overload\">How the world caught up with Wolfgang Tillmans</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>Was there a single moment or event that led to the creation of the poster campaign?</strong><br />Well, the Iraq war was a formative experience for me and many in my generation: to march with a million people and then know the leaders had already decided. I did demonstrate, but I did not speak out. I thought there was enough outrage by others. This time it feels like maybe we are sleepwalking into a big, wrong decision. I don\u2019t want to wake up on 24 June and feel I have not done enough to prevent that happening. It\u2019s so important. I want to put all my energy behind it.</p> <p><strong>Do you consider yourself an activist?</strong><br />I\u2019m an activist for moderation [<em>laughs</em>]. And for progress. In the last 60 years we have seen so much progress in terms of women\u2019s rights and gay rights, but there is always a minority that are authoritarian and against those advances. I have observed this as a gay man. Those people will not give in on gay rights. Putin will never give in on gay rights. Right now, ordinary, decent people need to stand up for those progressive values and not just take them for granted.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"8ad4b064fa44176104b142ed07833ea87e468561\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8ad4b064fa44176104b142ed07833ea87e468561/0_0_1684_2384/706.jpg\" alt=\"A poster from Wolfgang Tillmans\u2019s EU campaign.\" width=\"706\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A poster from Wolfgang Tillmans\u2019s EU campaign.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Wolfgang Tillmans/Between Bridges</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong>You are a German who lives between Berlin and London, and attended college in the UK. Do you consider yourself a citizen of Europe?</strong><br />Yes. I honestly do. My identity is European. City-wise, I\u2019m a Londoner. Nationally, I\u2019m German. But, really, I see myself as a product of European reconciliation and cultural exchange. That is what has enriched my life so much. Look at the <a href=\"https://www.erasmusplus.org.uk/erasmus-projects\">Erasmus project</a>, which might appear a small thing, but it enables young people from the EU to study abroad for an extended time. My sister went to Florence for half a year when she was 23. That kind of opportunity can transform your life.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Standing up for the middle ground should be the new cool, because it is so dangerous not to</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>It seems almost inevitable that you will be dismissed in some quarters as a German \u2013 and an artist \u2013 who should not be interfering in British politics.</strong><br />Oh yes, the German thing. \u201cWhy is he telling us what to do?\u201d But, I have lived here for 26 years and contributed to British taxes. I went to college here. I have been the recipient of Britain\u2019s biggest art prize and I have been made a full member of the Royal Academy of Art. So, I think I\u2019m allowed to speak on something I believe passionately in \u2013 which is Europe. And I firmly believe that the values the EU stand for are actually British values on a world stage.</p> <p><strong>Would you consider leaving Britain if Britain leaves the EU?</strong><br />I don\u2019t think so, but who knows? I\u2019m not interested in engaging in Project Fear. They\u2019re not going to suddenly shut down easyJet and start searching every single truck full of tomatoes coming in from Europe. For me, it is more about the message it will send out. The minority of loud voices against will have triumphed. The voices of reason and negotiation will have lost. If you look at what is happening with Trump in the US, you can\u2019t help but feel that the angry and unreasonable voices are getting louder and louder. There\u2019s a disproportionate emphasis in the British media towards leaving. I often wonder why. I even wrote a letter to British Airways in 2003 because on their flights you were always handed free copies of the <em>Daily Mail</em> and you opened it up and were exposed to propaganda.</p> <p><strong>Have you specifically aimed your poster campaign at the young? I notice the Glastonbury festival features on one: \u201cDon\u2019t come to Glastonbury without having used your postal vote!\u201d</strong><br />To stand up or celebrate the middle ground is to be somehow uncool, but I really feel we need to do this right now. I think standing up for the centre ground should be the new cool, because it is so dangerous not to. The democracy that the EU represents \u2013 worker\u2019s rights, women\u2019s rights, gay rights \u2013 is a shining beacon to protesters in Poland and Russia. Britain, as a cradle of democracy, should see the bigger global picture. I have a strong sense of history repeating now and of my generation, for the first time, not being exempt from history.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/jonathanjonesblog/2016/apr/26/anti-brexit-posters-wolfgang-tillmans-eu-referendum\">These anti-Brexit posters show just what we lose by leaving the EU</a> </p> </aside>  <p><strong>This is a one-off project that seems dramatically different in the context of your other work.</strong><br />Yes, and I thought about that for a long time. In a loose sense, it connects with an ongoing series I have been making called <a href=\"http://www.serralves.pt/en/activities/wolfgang-tillmans-on-the-verge-of-visibility/\"><em>On The Verge of Visibility</em></a>, which is about the porousness of the border between sky and water, but is quite abstract. This project is different. It\u2019s about information. At one point, it was just going to be text on the posters. Personally, I think it is good to have a group of images that are not identifiable with me and my style. It\u2019s primarily about getting the message across clearly and forcefully.</p> <p><strong>You have always been known for \u2013 and sometimes criticised for \u2013 the \u201c</strong><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/sep/17/how-the-world-caught-up-with-wolfgang-tillmans-photography-overload\"><strong>everydayness</strong></a><strong>\u201d of your photographs. The posters are quite a shift in style away from the personal and the observational.</strong><br />Yes, my work has sometimes been criticised for being somehow non-specific or lacking in rigour, but, in fact, the rigour is in the nuances. I have always looked at the nuances of everyday things because I feel that is a political responsibility, too \u2013 to look in an open, unprejudiced, fearless way at the world around you.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Why and how do we sing and what makes us enjoy listening to others sing? The question resounds through this wise and witty second book from Tracey Thorn, author of the bestselling pop memoir <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/10/bedsit-disco-queen-thorn-review\" title=\"\"><em>Bedsit Disco Queen</em></a><em>, </em>which chronicled her 30-year music career including her time in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jun/17/everything-but-girl-early-albums-interview\" title=\"\">Everything But the Girl</a> and subsequent solo adventures. This \u201cinside story of singing\u201d is wide ranging, charting her own development (from the \u201cjoyous experience\u201d of singing along to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2005/may/22/popandrock1\" title=\"\">Patti Smith</a>\u2019s <em>Horses</em> as a teenager to becoming a professional singer) and examining the mechanics of singing and anatomy of the throat, since \u201csinging is a physical activity as much as an emotional one\u201d.</p> <p>The title refers to Thorn\u2019s stage fright and a nightmare she would have about being naked at the Albert Hall, while alluding to ideas of emotional exposure and vulnerability. \u201cThere\u2019s more thinking in singing than you might think,\u201d writes Thorn, who not only draws on the rich reservoir of her experience but also weaves in thinking from throughout the ages (including Roland Barthes\u2019s 1972 essay The Grain of the Voice and Ian Bostridge\u2019s <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/singer-s-notebook.html\" title=\"\"><em>A Singer\u2019s Notebook</em></a> exploring the relationship between singing, feeling and performance), and incisive interviews with singers Green Gartside, Alison Moyet and Linda Thompson, among others.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m writing as a book-lover, too, drawn to those points where my love of singing and my love of literature overlap; where novels or poems articulate deeper truths about singing, and its significance,\u201d writes Thorn. Some of the most compelling parts of the book are Thorn\u2019s insightful discussions of characters in fiction who embody different aspects of singers and singing: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jul/14/fiction.reviews1\" title=\"\"><em>Bel Canto </em>by Ann Patchett<em> </em></a>featuring a character obsessed with a singer; <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/dec/09/fiction.asbyatt\" title=\"\"><em>The Song of the Lark </em></a>by Willa Cather, whose heroine leaves her home town and becomes a singer; <em>A Slipping-Down Life </em>by Anne Tyler, a fascinating exploration of the nature of fandom.</p> <p>Finding your unique, personal sound is \u201cthe key ingredient in becoming a singer\u201d, believes Thorn. \u201cListeners will follow you a long way if you keep them interested. The aim isn\u2019t necessarily to feel beholden to your innate voice, but above all to aim for one that has confidence in itself, and expresses something unique.\u201d</p> <p>Thorn eloquently strikes upon some profound truths about human communication as she tests the powers and limits of the human voice.</p> <p><em>Naked at the Albert Hall is published by </em>Virago (\u00a38.99). <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/374928/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a37.19</em></a></p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>George Osborne has a fairy godmother who, with a wave of her wand, showers money over much of the population. It hardly seems possible in this age of austerity, but it happens all the time and soothes the anger of many who might otherwise protest at the closure of local amenities and cuts to welfare budgets.</p> <p>This godmother comes in several guises, but essentially always does the same thing: she steals from the future to pay for things today.</p> <p>And Osborne is not a bystander in this. He has created the conditions for this heist and in some cases become the fairy godmother himself \u2013 helping to soften his image and create millions of mini-lottery winners he hopes will vote for him in 2020.</p> <p>Last week we heard from the insurer Legal &amp; General how <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/03/parental-help-behind-25-percent-of-uk-mortgages-bank-of-mum-and-day\" title=\"\">the \u201cBank of Mum and Dad\u201d</a> will help finance 25% of UK mortgage transactions this year. It said parents could find themselves lending their children as much as \u00a35bn to help them on to the property ladder, providing deposits for more than 300,000 mortgages.</p> <p>Some of the money will come from savings, but there are estimates that much of the \u00a32.7bn extracted from retirement plans under Osborne\u2019s new liberalised pension rules has gone straight into funding mortgage deposits for children and grandchildren.</p> <p>And that\u2019s not all. Osborne has also benefited from the \u00a353bn extracted from the banks since 2010. This money is the punishment for the PPI rip-off scandal, the foreign exchange fixing scam, the Libor interest rate racket and the recklessness that meant banks needed to be punished for nearly going bust in 2008. The financial regulators have acted like Camelot, the lottery operator, which takes every contribution and then redistributes them unevenly according to an agreed formula.</p> <p>For most people who have received a slice of the estimated \u00a325bn of PPI compensation, it doesn\u2019t feel like compensation. They never really missed the money in the first place. It is more like a tax break to be spent on a new car, a loft extension or conservatory.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/apr/11/misconduct-has-cost-uks-banks-53bn-over-15-years-ppi\" title=\"\">The rest of the \u00a353bn</a> has gone to compensation-claims companies, which show up in official figures as one of the biggest recruiters of the last five years, and to the regulators themselves and the Treasury, which has used the levy to subsidise government spending and disguise the extent of austerity. The bank levy boosted the exchequer with \u00a32.2bn in 2014. This money flowed into the economy, where once it would have filled the pockets of shareholders, many of them pension funds.</p> <p>Legal &amp; General echoes the sentiment of many on the left who say flogging the family silver and stealing from the future cannot go on. Sadly, they couldn\u2019t be more wrong. There is always a fairy godmother waiting to dispense good cheer.</p> <p>The insurer argues that the Bank of Mum and Dad will soon run dry, saying that in London parental contributions were so great they made up more than 50% of the wealth (excluding property) of the average household. But what is to stop wealth extraction continuing? Such is the postwar accumulation of wealth that the net value of UK property is more than \u00a34 trillion and these days more people own their home outright than have a mortgage.</p> <p>Windfalls from selling the family silver are also an essential element of Osborne\u2019s attempts to balance the budget over the next five years, just as they were for his mentors, Lords Howe, Lawson and Lamont \u2013 the Tory chancellors who dominated the 1980s and early 1990s.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"503ba47dcdbf28e9448d5a0c476229dc00580df3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/503ba47dcdbf28e9448d5a0c476229dc00580df3/0_44_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Lloyds bank cash machines\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lloyds: being offloaded as soon as possible.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Privatisations in the 1980s were followed by demutualisations in the 1990s and the personal borrowing boom in the 2000s, supplemented by compensation for endowment mis-selling and personal pension mis-selling. In each case, millions of families were able to boost their largely static incomes with one windfall after another.</p> <p>The chancellor has already sold the Royal Mail and plans to offload the rest of Lloyds Bank and Royal Bank of Scotland. Those banks could have been a benefit to the nation in years to come when they had either fully recovered and commanded a good price or proved useful as state-owned investors in small businesses and the green economy. Instead, they will be offloaded at the earliest opportunity to support Osborne\u2019s short-term aim of achieving a budget surplus.</p> <p>Housebuilding is a priority, but the Treasury believes there is no need to fund housing associations with cash when you can let them borrow. Likewise, other public bodies that were once directly funded will borrow just to meet their statutory obligations.</p> <p>Banks are offering mortgages that will mean borrowers making monthly payments into their 80s, allowing people to spend more today on purchasing a home, with Osborne\u2019s permission, than the old rules would allow.</p> <p>Universities are another example. They are squealing for more money to prevent standards dropping. Osborne has already put most of the bill for university funding on the credit card, via his loan scheme landing graduates with upwards of \u00a340,000 of debt. He is expected to simply raise the \u00a39,000-a-year fee cap to allow students a higher credit limit. Next stop will be selling the student loan book \u2013 again bringing forward funds that will need to be repaid at a later date.</p> <p>Like a plate-spinning conjuror, Osborne knows it is bad economics to rely on a fairy godmother turning up every year to boost living standards: yet it has proved successful ever since the 1980s and will probably underpin his plans for the next four years.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Spotlit by phone flashes and smiles, James singer Tim Booth roams through the crowd, making his way up to a delighted balcony. The crowds part fluidly for this messianic lead singer, his clear voice never faltering. He\u2019s generous with the hand-clasps and half-hugs though; a Bono with whom you might conceivably share a vodka smoothie.</p> <p>Thirty-four years on from his band\u2019s spindly beginnings, Booth remains beloved, at the helm of a lodestone indie rock band who show little sign of slowing down. James\u2019s 14th album, released in March, came within a whisker of knocking Adele off the No 1 album slot. This broad UK tour is virtually sold out.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/may/12/how-we-made-sit-down-james-tim-booth\">Tim Booth and Larry Gott of James: how we made Sit Down</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Goateed and with his head shaven, Booth now looks a little like Ming the Merciless reborn as a more compassionate yoga instructor. He is singing Say Something, from James\u2019s 1993 album <em>Laid</em>, a tune that could serve as a primer in literate indie rock. It boasts lyrics that \u2013 yes \u2013 say something (Booth is addressing an inscrutable interlocutor). The vocal melody is blithe, the guitar line, succinct; it\u2019s faintly baggy in the drums, as befits that era. In the absence of Sit Down \u2013 James\u2019s anthem, which they make a point of skipping tonight \u2013 this is one of the biggest singalongs, deployed during the encore of James\u2019s first of three mid-tour London shows.</p> <p>Soon after, there is <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8OobMrlvrY\">Nothing But Love</a>, a song off their most recent album. It shows signs of becoming a future favourite. There\u2019s a brisk mandolin intro from Adrian Oxaal, followed by Andy Diagram\u2019s freewheeling trumpet, giving way to an open-hearted tune about the power of love, built to be bellowed en masse.</p> <p>Twenty-one songs into a 23-song set, then, it\u2019s not hard to grasp the enduring appeal of this band, even if your own personal tastes have long since left the building. James are, without a doubt, the indie rock dream made flesh \u2013 if that dream means continuing returns more than serious paradigm-shifting.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8OobMrlvrY\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/I8OobMrlvrY?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> </figure>   <p>Although their peak roughly coincided with the Madchester era into the 90s, James continue to release new albums that are liberally sprinkled with strong songs. Unperturbed by changes of fashion, these albums sell in reasonable quantities, to faithful fans who actually pay money for music.</p> <p><em>Girl at the End of the World</em>, the album that nearly unseated Adele, crowns a run of solid post-reunion records. We are in a small venue for James. This hefty tour sees the band playing arenas in Birmingham and their home town of Manchester.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Eight people are on stage \u2013 almost an anachronism in the age of the compact digital outfit</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Having got through their messy drug phases decades ago, James look like a great place to wield a guitar. The seven men playing the instruments (Oxaal replaces the non-touring Larry Gott on guitar) can walk the streets unmolested. Booth himself lives in California \u2013 a new song, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XM99WTJXhic\">Move Down South</a>, deals with that state\u2019s drought, rather than, say, the act of leaving Leeds for London.</p> <p>Somehow, despite James\u2019s continuing reach, Booth escapes the fevered scrutiny that makes the lives of Morrissey (an early supporter), or even Thom Yorke, (whose dance moves owe something to the boneless Booth) a little sub-optimal. Eight people are on stage \u2013 almost an anachronism in the age of the compact digital outfit. They break down to a folksier acoustic four-piece for <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mElWoynAfmU\">Just Like Fred Astaire</a>, another joyous singalong.</p> <p>This is not the most silvery of bands \u2013 much of their set remains reliably four-square, anchored by a fantastic drummer in David Baynton-Power, and embellished by keyboards and violin. But if James remain cheerfully unmysterious compared with the big music of the Celtic rock bands they faintly echo, they are definitely lifted by Saul Davies\u2019s violin and Diagram\u2019s arcing trumpet, which, tangentially, looks sugar-coated under ultraviolet light.</p> <p>They have not exactly mellowed with age, either. Another new song, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swq2EzRv2cM\">To My Surprise</a>, recalls the synth-y drama of the Killers, a previous client of the album\u2019s producer, Max Dingel. Booth is exasperated in the chorus. \u201cWere you just born an asshole?\u201d he sings.</p>",

      "headline": "Apple\u2019s FBI row was an opportunity missed",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Towards the end of last year, the FBI locked horns with Apple over the matter of an encrypted iPhone. It belonged to the employer of one of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_San_Bernardino_attack\" title=\"\">San Bernardino killers</a> and, because of an unbelievable cock-up, the FBI had failed to obtain all of the phone\u2019s backed-up data. But they couldn\u2019t get into the phone because they didn\u2019t know the password. And they couldn\u2019t get it by the normal computerised brute-force guessing technique conventionally used to obtain user passwords.</p> <p>Why? Because the Apple iPhone\u2019s operating system has an ingenious trick built into it. After a certain number of incorrect guesses, it automatically destroys all the data stored on the phone. It\u2019s a bit like having a house key that automatically incinerates the entire contents of the dwelling if it suspects that a burglar has got hold of it.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>If internet users freak out about spooks hoovering up their webmail, they might cut back on their online usage</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>So the FBI sought a court order to compel Apple to write a special version of the operating system without this ingenious destructive mechanism \u2013 which could then be downloaded to the phone. Apple refused, on various grounds both technological and legalistic, and the stage was set \u2013 so some of us thought \u2013 for a legal battle that would go all the way to the supreme court.</p> <p>In the end, it didn\u2019t happen. The <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/21/fbi-apple-iphone-hack-san-bernardino-price-paid\" title=\"\">FBI bought a hack</a> from an Israeli security company which had already found a way round the problem, called off the legal suit, and nobody got their day in front of the supremes. Which was a pity, because it means that a really important question posed by digital technology remains unresolved. Put simply, it\u2019s this: what limits, if any, should be placed on the power of encryption technology to render citizens\u2019 communications invisible to law enforcement and security authorities?</p> <p>In a way, we have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/edward-snowden\" title=\"\">Edward Snowden</a> to thank for this. His revelations about the extent and intrusiveness of state snooping may have made some citizens nervous; but they induced utter panic in the internet companies that depend on \u201c<a href=\"http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=49122\" title=\"\">surveillance capitalism</a>\u201d for their revenues. After all, if internet users began to freak out about spooks hoovering up their webmail, tweets, status updates etc... then they might cut back on their use of online services, thereby throttling the supply of digital data the companies sell to advertisers.</p> <p>To pre-empt this, the companies began to introduce encryption into their products. And not just any old encryption either, but automatic end-to-end encryption, for which they did not hold any keys \u2013 which meant that if the feds came armed with a warrant, the companies could say, truthfully, that they were unable to help. Apple was an early participant in this game, but in due course Google and others followed suit, at which point the spooks and the cops began screaming blue murder. The FBI director <a href=\"https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/otd/going-dark-issue\" title=\"\">fumed to Congress</a> about the world \u201cgoing dark\u201d on his agents, while in the UK, David Cameron declared his determination that there should be <a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-07/15/cameron-ban-encryption-u-turn\" title=\"\">no no-go areas in cyberspace</a> for law enforcement.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/may/02/brazil-whatsapp-block-72-hours\">Brazilian judge orders mobile providers to block WhatsApp for 72 hours</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Despite this, the encryption bandwagon rolled on. The most significant move came on 5 April when the makers of WhatsApp, the world\u2019s most popular messaging app, announced they were going the whole hog. \u201cFrom now on,\u201d wrote WhatsApp, \u201cwhen you and your contacts use the latest version of the app, every call you make, and every message, photo, video, file, and voice message you send, is <a href=\"https://blog.whatsapp.com/10000618/end-to-end-encryption\" title=\"\">end-to-end encrypted by default</a>, including group chats.\u201d</p> <p>Since WhatsApp (now owned by Facebook) has upwards of a billion users, this is a pretty big deal. And it was certainly too much for the Brazilian judge who, last Monday, ordered a 72-hour shutdown of the service for its <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601381/brazils-whatsapp-ban-is-a-harbinger-of-international-encryption-battles/#/set/id/601385/\" title=\"\">100 million Brazilian users</a> because investigators in a narcotics case suspected that the culprits had hidden behind the service\u2019s encryption. The ban led to a huge outcry because Brazilians (like South Africans) are <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/s/601393/brazilians-will-always-remember-the-great-whatsapp-blackout-of-2016/#/set/id/601399/\" title=\"\">very intensive users</a> of WhatsApp (which may have more to do with the fact that it\u2019s free than that it\u2019s encrypted), and last Tuesday another judge overturned it.</p> <p>But these are just the opening skirmishes in a conflict that will ultimately have to be resolved. Technology has provided citizens with military-grade encryption that ensures their communications cannot be accessed by agents of the state, even when operating under lawful authorisation. Is this a techno-utopian dream or a liberal-democratic nightmare? Or both? You can see why I wish it had gone to the supremes.</p>",

      "body": "<p>As Les Dawson proved with such precision, any fool can play the piano badly, but it takes real skill to play it <em>brilliantly</em> badly. Similarly, Morecambe and Wise knew that the perfect way to mangle \u201cGrieg\u2019s piano concerto by Grieg\u201d was to play \u201call the <em>right</em> notes, but not necessarily in the right order\u201d. Now, to the august list of superbly maladroit comedic musicians we may add Meryl Streep, who takes centre stage in this very likable, frequently hilarious, yet still poignant tragi-comedy from director Stephen Frears. Streep plays the titular songbird, a New York socialite and eager patron of the arts whose enthusiasm for a good tune is matched only by her inability to sing one. Not that it stops her from trying. Inspired by the \u201cprofound communion\u201d of a performance by soprano Lily Pons, Madame Florence resumes her own singing lessons, her private recitals leading to 78rpm recordings and even an October 1944 concert at Carnegie Hall, which has since passed into legend.</p> <p>The real Florence Foster Jenkins was one of those larger than life characters you just couldn\u2019t make up. No wonder, then, that she has inspired numerous theatrical and cinematic productions.

Earlier this year, Catherine Frot won a best actress C\u00e9sar for playing a fictionalised version of \u201cthe first lady of the sliding scale\u201d in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/mar/20/marguerite-review-tragicomic-tale-tone-deaf-singer\" title=\"\"><em>Marguerite</em></a>, a film whose central character\u2019s name, \u201cMarguerite Dumont\u201d, alludes to the longstanding comic foil of the Marx Brothers\u2019 movies. Frears himself says that Jenkins \u201creminded me of Margaret Dumont\u2026 just preposterous, but touching at the same time\u201d, an assessment that perfectly sums up both Streep\u2019s performance and the overall tone of Frears\u2019s film.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/apr/29/florence-foster-jenkins-exclusive-clip-from-meryl-streep-comedy-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4tyj2\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2495882\"            data-video-name=\"Florence Foster Jenkins: exclusive clip from Meryl Streep comedy \u2013\u00a0video\"            data-video-provider=\"Pathe\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-5722184fe4b0f300275c7c8e\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/04/28/160428streep_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/04/28/160428streep_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/04/28/160428streep_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11443138&amp;format=video/webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/04/28/160428streep.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/video/2016/apr/29/florence-foster-jenkins-exclusive-clip-from-meryl-streep-comedy-video\">Florence Foster Jenkins: exclusive clip from Meryl Streep comedy \u2013 video</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p>Working from a screenplay by Nicholas Martin, <em>Florence Foster Jenkins</em> stays fancifully faithful to true events, following Jenkins\u2019s rehearsals with pianist Cosm\u00e9 McMoon in the run-up to the big show, which will fulfil her lifelong ambition.

Just as Wood became celebrated for directing <em>Plan 9 From Outer Space</em>, labelled \u201cthe worst movie ever made\u201d, so Jenkins is called \u201cthe worst goddamn singer in the world\u201d by those who scorn her atonal appeal.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/04/florence-foster-jenkins-film-worlds-worst-singer-by-tom-service\">Florence Foster Jenkins: we may laugh, but to be this bad took talent</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But Burton evidently loved Wood, and Frears has clearly fallen for Jenkins too. And who wouldn\u2019t? As played by Streep, she is a heroic figure, made physically fragile by syphilis (a wedding gift from her former husband) but strengthened by a love of music which turns a deaf ear to her own shortcomings. Like Streep\u2019s later-life Thatcher in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/jan/08/the-iron-lady-review\" title=\"\"><em>The Iron Lady</em></a>, Jenkins becomes \u201can eloquent lesson in fidelity and courage\u201d, whatever one may think of her work and legacy.</p> <p>Amid the joy, there are hints that Jenkins\u2019s friends are only in it for the money. In one pointed exchange, David Haig\u2019s ever-so-slightly slimy vocal coach Carlo Edwards conspiratorially tells Bayfield: \u201cShe spoils us all, doesn\u2019t\u00a0she?\u201d But while the more formally adventurous <em>Marguerite</em> posited the <em>absence</em> of a husband\u2019s love as central to its heroine\u2019s madness, Frears\u2019s film affords Grant\u2019s silver fox an air of love and devotion to his \u201cbunny\u201d, even as his extracurricular \u201csport\u201d takes him away from her. At times I found myself wiping away a tear, genuinely moved by their \u201cvery happy world\u201d. More rigorous critics may sneer \u2013 I say \u201cBravo!\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>The BBC\u2019s recent hit drama <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/the-night-manager\"><em>The Night Manager</em></a>, a thriller about a spy who infiltrates an arms dealer\u2019s network, is the sort of show that\u2019s sometimes described as \u201caspirational\u201d \u2013 not because most people aspire to hang out with the kind of foreign despots liable to gas their own people, but because it\u2019s the sort of world that features private jets and five-star hotels and characters called things like \u201cDickie Onslow Roper\u201d and \u201cLord Langbourne\u201d and the kind of long-necked women who drape themselves languidly over business tycoons\u2019 arms.</p> <p>It is, to use another piece of shorthand, posh; a world of money and privilege \u2013 and apart from two overworked civil servants trying to bring them to heel from a dingy London office, one of whom is Olivia Colman, the BBC\u2019s resident everywoman \u2013 almost the entire cast comes from what used to be called the \u201cofficer class\u201d. So it\u2019s not exactly a surprise when, just after the final episode is broadcast, the <em>Guardian </em>runs a story about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/shortcuts/2016/mar/28/dragon-school-tom-hiddleston-tom-hollander-hugh-laurie-night-manager\">where the three male leads went to school</a>. Because for the past 18 months or so, the papers have been full of stories about how increasingly rarefied acting is becoming. How difficult it is for anyone from any normal background to break into it. How some of the great actors of the past 30 years simply wouldn\u2019t make it today.</p> <p>The story is not that the three stars \u2013 Hugh Laurie, Tom Hiddleston and Tom Hollander \u2013 are all privately educated. That would surprise no one. The story is that they all went to the same private school: the Dragon School, a small prep school in Oxford with fees of up to \u00a328,000 a year that also educated Emma Watson, Jack Davenport and Jack Whitehall, among others. From there, Laurie and Hiddleston both went on to Eton, the launchpad for what are some of the hottest actors of the moment, alma mater to Eddie Redmayne, Damien Lewis and Dominic West.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Our national psychodramas are being acted out by graduates of our most expensive public schools</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What unites Laurie, Hiddleston and Hollander most, of course, is talent. They all give standout, highly praised performances. And, arguably, it\u2019s anecdotal evidence of nothing very much; commenting on it reveals nothing more than a certain leftwing chippiness on the part of the commentator.</p> <p>Certainly, the issues at stake have little to do with Laurie, Hiddleston or Hollander. It\u2019s far bigger than any of them. But it\u2019s also not posh-bashing for the sake of posh-bashing. There\u2019s now <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/feb/27/class-ceiling-working-class-actors-study\">evidence of an inequality</a> that runs like a seam through the entire profession and which goes far beyond the anecdotal. This year, academics from the London School of Economics and Goldsmiths College, in a peer-reviewed study, found that only 27% of actors come from a working-class background and that the profession is \u201c<a href=\"http://www.lse.ac.uk/newsAndMedia/news/archives/2016/02/LSE-research-finds-acting-has-become-a-largely-middle-class-profession.aspx\">heavily skewed towards the privileged</a>\u201d. In February this year, the Sutton Trust, a thinktank dedicated to social mobility, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2016/feb/27/class-ceiling-working-class-actors-study\">included acting for the first time in its survey of leading professions</a>, and found, among other things, that 67% of British Oscar winners and 42% of Bafta winners went to a private school.</p> <p>Countless stars have spoken out about it, including Julie Walters, who\u2019s said that \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jan/24/julie-walters-people-like-me-wouldnt-get-a-chance-today\">people like me wouldn\u2019t get the chance today</a>\u201d and Judi Dench, who gets letters \u201ccountless times a week asking for help to get through drama school\u201d. And, in this light, <em>The Night Manager </em>starts to seem more like a parable. Because it depicts a world that is run by and for a rich, privileged elite. And it turns out, that\u2019s true not just within the dramatic confines of the story, but outside it too. That there\u2019s a tiny, well-born cohort who seem to be getting all the plum roles.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"68d277cc996cee89c2c08ba7bb7210230a349698\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/68d277cc996cee89c2c08ba7bb7210230a349698/0_151_4168_2501/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The Night Manager\u2019s male stars, Tom Hiddleston (left) and Hugh Laurie, went to the same prep school and then on to Eton.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The Night Manager\u2019s male stars, Tom Hiddleston (left) and Hugh Laurie, went to the same prep school and then on to Eton.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images for AMC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The bigger question is whether it matters. Acting is structurally unfair anyway, especially for women \u2013 so much is based on looks, on having the kind of languid limbs that can be draped over a business tycoon\u2019s arms. Does it really matter if this tiny elite is dominated by Etonians? Or by the 7% who are privately educated rather than the 93% who aren\u2019t? There are so many inequalities in Britain today that in some ways this feels like the least of them.</p> <p>But it\u2019s part of a much bigger picture. Because what has happened in acting and therefore what we see on our screens is intimately connected to what is happening in Britain. Acting, culture, identity, representation and politics are all inextricably entwined. The actors on our screens, the dramas that are commissioned, the way we view ourselves, the politicians we vote for, our ability to empathise with people from other parts of our culture, are all of a piece. Can it really be just a coincidence that the upper echelons of acting and government are dominated by Old Etonians?</p> <p>The Liverpool-based screenwriter <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/profile/frankcottrellboyce\">Frank Cottrell Boyce</a>, who wrote the story for the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games, tells me that he believes actors are like everyone else, just more visible. \u201cThe shortage of working-class actors is simply a mirror of what\u2019s going on everywhere: a shortage of working-class academics, engineers and politicians. I\u2019m much more concerned about the broader picture because it\u2019s a beacon, an indicator, of a much deeper problem.\u201d</p> <p>Actors are simply the most visible, he says. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue simply because we\u2019ve noticed it but it\u2019s going on everywhere, in every profession. It\u2019s about access to education and being able to take a risk. That\u2019s the nursery of innovation not just in the arts but in science, in business. What\u2019s happening to the dramatic arts, should be a warning to people that this is happening everywhere. Actors are simply the end of the process. University or college or art school used to be where you\u2019d go to meet your contemporaries and start something off. But they\u2019ve been completely monetised. Universities are transaction service providers, students are service users, it\u2019s not a creative space or an intellectual space any more, it\u2019s a service where you get a piece of paper in exchange for your student loan. And it\u2019s completely changed the nature of it.\u201d </p> <p>Because now it\u2019s about money. And there\u2019s simply not enough of it go around. Every week, he says, he is inundated with letters. \u201c\u2018Can you give me \u00a3500?\u2019 I get them week in, week out, and everybody else does too.\u201d</p> <p>Acting has changed because Britain has changed. And money, and its Great British handmaidens \u2013 inequality, privilege, class \u2013 is at the heart of it. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/24/game-of-thrones-star-wars-casting-nina-gold\">Nina Gold</a>, one of the most influential casting directors in Britain, goes to the showcases that the drama schools hold every year for the graduating class and has seen the shift at first hand.</p> <p>She says: \u201cThere\u2019s definitely a big homogenous load of middle-class actors all quite similar to each other. It\u2019s not just class-wise, there just seem to be fewer characters, people who don\u2019t conform to the ideal look, people who are overweight, or funny-looking. I really miss that.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"bd3c81210d07c3d27ba6ea5b020687119545ee4a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd3c81210d07c3d27ba6ea5b020687119545ee4a/520_9_1509_1885/801.jpg\" alt=\"Julie Walters in the film adaptation of Educating Rita.

When you think of all the fabulous actors of the moment, you think of Eddie Redmayne, Tom Hiddleston, Dominic West, Benedict Cumberbatch. There\u2019s Michael Fassbender. But he\u2019s Irish and German so goes right by the whole class distinction.\u201d </p> <p>There are brilliant and successful working-class actors out there \u2013 Gold cast Peckham-born <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/dec/13/star-wars-force-awakens-john-boyega-stormtrooper-observer-profile\">John Boyega </a>in <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens </em>and she found him (initially for the film <em>Attack the Block</em>) by \u201clooking really hard\u201d outside the usual drama schools \u2013 but the change has been dramatic. \u201cWhat I want to get across is that I really, really want there to be more working-class actors and it needs to happen. Because it\u2019s got nothing to do with talent, ability or intelligence. It\u2019s to do with money. And it\u2019s a reflection of how society is working. It\u2019s very much a mirror of the way it is in real life.\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s always been tough, of course. Getting in to drama school is tough. And making it once you\u2019ve got out is tougher still. \u201cEven in the best-case scenario, you\u2019re getting rejected left, right and centre,\u201d says Nina Gold. \u201cEven if you\u2019re successful. And then if you do become really famous, that\u2019s a whole hell of its own. My son wants to do drama A-level and I find myself thinking, please, God, let him never, ever want to become an actor.\u201d</p> <p>And even someone as successful and patently talented as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/apr/21/stuart-maconie-working-class-heroes-poverty-porn-bbc-radio-4-review\">Maxine Peake </a>tells me how she was turned down by Manchester Metropolitan University\u2019s theatre school three times and Guildhall School of Music and Drama three times before finally being accepted by Rada.</p> <p>\u201cThen, at the final workshop, they said to me, how are you going to pay for it if you do get in? And I said, \u2018I can\u2019t. There\u2019s no way. I\u2019m from a single-parent family, My mum works part-time. We\u2019re skint.\u2019\u201d</p> <p>Rada helped her get a scholarship and she went straight from there to the late Victoria Wood\u2019s <em>Dinner Ladies </em>and the rest is history. As a rags-to-riches, Cinders-you-shall-go-to-the-ball fairytale, it\u2019s a great story. And it does still \u2013 on rare occasions \u2013 happen.</p> <p>In Rada\u2019s elegant 1931 building in Bloomsbury, central London, I meet Yasmin Taheri, 22. She\u2019s from Mirfield near Huddersfield, and like Peake, she grew up in a one-parent family. She tells me how she applied to dozens of drama schools and how she supported herself to pay for it. The process costs hundreds, if not thousands of pounds. It\u2019s anywhere between \u00a350 and \u00a380 to audition for each round at each drama school, not to mention the travel. \u201cI worked in McDonald\u2019s and as a care assistant, as a medical secretary, as a receptionist, in an Italian restaurant, as a Spanish au pair\u2026\u201d</p> <p>And Taheri didn\u2019t apply once or twice, she carried on for five years, and then, eventually, miraculously, got in. What was that like, I ask her. \u201cOh my God!\u201d she says and even today looks like she still can\u2019t quite believe it. And Rada has helped her, as it did Maxine Peake, find a scholarship which now covers her maintenance.</p> <p>The fairytales do still happen. It\u2019s in Rada\u2019s DNA. Royalties from <em>Pygmalion</em>, George Bernard Shaw\u2019s play about a flower girl who learns to act like a duchess (which later became the musical <em>My Fair Lady)</em>, helped pay for the founding of the school. But, it\u2019s getting rarer and rarer. In just a few years the whole landscape has changed. It used to be hard for everyone. Whereas now, it\u2019s still hard for everyone but it\u2019s a whole lot harder, quantifiably harder, if you happen to come from anything other than money and privilege.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"dd4005769d021d6051922fb612dec323ae665596\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/dd4005769d021d6051922fb612dec323ae665596/0_98_4256_2554/1000.jpg\" alt=\"John Boyega with his Bafta Rising Star award for Star Wars: The Force Awakens.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">John Boyega with his Bafta Rising Star award for Star Wars: The Force Awakens.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Kendal/Barcroft Media</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Because for every Taheri, there are hundreds, maybe thousands more Tom Stockses. I meet 23-year-old Stocks in Canary Wharf in a break from his job in a call centre. It\u2019s known informally as \u201cthe actors\u2019 call centre\u201d and \u201cis three floors of out-of-work actors who just come and go all the time\u201d. Stocks has written the kind of letters that Judi Dench and Frank Cottrell Boyce have received, as well as emailing hundreds of agents. Do you ever hear back? \u201cNever.\u201d And he\u2019s applied to all the drama schools \u201cand I paid the ridiculous audition fees for all of them\u201d.</p> <p>And then he won a place at the well respected East 15 Acting School in Loughton, Essex. It was an amazing piece of good fortune. And yet \u2013 it wasn\u2019t quite amazing enough. \u201cI was quite naive, thinking OK, it\u2019s 12 grand but I can borrow that from the government,\u201d he says. And you can\u2019t? \u201cNo. The only way you can fund it is with a career-development loan which isn\u2019t like a student loan. You have to pay back \u00a3200 a month for the next five years come what may.\u201d </p> <p>It\u2019s possible to get student loans to study drama, if the course is affiliated to Ucas, and if it\u2019s your first degree. But Stocks, like many actors before him, had already been to university \u2013 a performing arts course at the University of South Wales in Newport, where he did three jobs to pay his maintenance.</p> <p>At East 15, he would get a showcase, a crucial first step if you want to make it as an actor. It\u2019s just that he can\u2019t figure out how to pay for it. He grew up in Bolton and his father is a chef, his mother a school dinner lady. \u201cI decided to defer for a year and get a job and try and save the money. But I didn\u2019t have nearly enough so I thought, I\u2019m going to go all in and just borrow it. But then my dad sat me down and said, you\u2019ve already got all your student loans from university and \u00a3200 a month is such a big commitment and there\u2019s no loopholes. And in the end, I just couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d</p> <p>He deferred for another year and \u201cthen it came to Christmas and it came to a point where I was chasing a dream. I was just never going to get the finances. My parents couldn\u2019t pay for it. And I was so deluded to think I could get this money on my own. A bunch of actors writing to private sponsors. It was never going to happen.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"87fd1e3e5efd23836635ea910786640081b67600\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/87fd1e3e5efd23836635ea910786640081b67600/1988_55_3016_3770/800.jpg\" alt=\"Line of Duty actor Daniel Mays has criticised \u2018the Downton effect\u2019 on British television.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Line of Duty actor Daniel Mays has criticised \u2018the Downton effect\u2019 on British television.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Richard Saker for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He shrugs. There was nothing to be done. So, he\u2019s moved to London and is attending open auditions and has launched something called <a href=\"http://www.actorawareness.co.uk/\">Actor Awareness</a>, a campaign for greater diversity and representation in the industry. He\u2019s had messages of support from the cast of <em>This Is England</em> and John Challis (Boycie from <em>Only Fools and Horses</em>), and an \u201canonymous\u201d \u00a31,000 donation that arrived just hours after he told Sir Ian McKellen about it. He\u2019s impressively upbeat and dynamic and determined to get on and do something. \u201cPeople thought I was just whining initially but I\u2019ve really put my money where my mouth is.\u201d But later I ask Nina Gold what her advice would be to someone from a working-class background, and I can\u2019t help thinking of Stocks. \u201cIf you can somehow find a way to get to drama school, go,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s not the only way but you learn a lot, you get to act a lot, all day, every day, and you get seen by the industry.\u201d It\u2019s just a brutal fact of life that Stocks can\u2019t afford it. And his place will go to someone else who can.</p> <p>If good drama reflects us back at ourselves, what does it mean that the version of ourselves that we see on screen is so often male and Etonian? That we\u2019re living in a Britain where our national psychodramas are being acted out by graduates of our most expensive public schools?</p> <p>Daniel Mays, giving an interview to the <em>Radio Times </em>to publicise his leading role in <em>Line of Duty </em>recently, spoke about how British TV is \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/15/tv-working-class-writers-downton-abbey-daniel-mays\">awash with the <em>Downton</em> effect</a>\u201d. Period dramas \u201chave a place\u201d, he said, \u201cbut there are a lot of public-school actors and writers about at the moment\u201d. The great, starring roles of recent times, the ones that go to Cumberbatch and Hiddleston and Lewis and Redmayne, the roles that have propelled them into the big time, are not great working-class heroes.</p> <p>They\u2019re not the kind of roles that Daniel Mays \u2013 currently on stage as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/apr/10/the-caretaker-old-vic-observer-review\">Aston in Harold Pinter\u2019s <em>The Caretaker</em></a> \u2013 gets. Nina Gold mentions him when I ask her about the standout stars she\u2019d seen at drama schools. \u201cYou really thought, my God, he\u2019s brilliant.\u201d</p> <p>But then, class, she says, is one of the hardest things to cast against type. \u201cLike Eddie Redmayne, who is genuinely, totally brilliant, we even cast him to play a woman. Why would you cast him to play a working-class character? What\u2019s the advantage? Though from his point of view, it\u2019s probably fun to do.\u201d</p> <p>And what, you can\u2019t help wondering, is our obsession with period drama all about? <em>Downton</em>, suggests <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/josie-long\">Josie Long,</a> comedian and co-founder of the charity <a href=\"http://www.arts-emergency.org/\">Arts Emergency,</a> \u201cspeaks to that certain weird thing that is going on in the UK. Something very repressive that is reflected in our art.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s what happens, she thinks, \u201cwhen you don\u2019t have different voices coming through\u201d. And \u201cposh fetishisation\u2026 posh as aspiration\u201d becomes a defining feature of our culture.</p> <p>Posh is at the very heart of mainstream viewing, a cornerstone of all TV schedules and a guaranteed seller abroad. <em>The Night Manager</em> is currently being broadcast in America on the cable channel AMC, which contributed a large part of its \u00a318m budget. It\u2019s a vision of Britain that sells.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s about young people from working-class backgrounds not being able to get on the first rung</p> <footer> <cite>David Morrissey</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>And at the other end of the social scale is\u2026 well, what? In his 2011 book, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jun/08/chavs-demonization-owen-jones-review\"><em>Chavs</em></a>, the journalist and activist Owen Jones argued that the artistic representation of the working classes has all but disappeared from our screens. And in its place is an underclass to be feared and despised. There\u2019s been no modern austerity equivalent of the great, epoch-defining Alan Bleasdale drama, <em>Boys from the Blackstuff</em>, a series that seemed to signal the high-water mark of Thatcherism. If you were alive in the 80s, you followed Yosser Hughes\u2019s tragic efforts to find work and hang on to his family. It elicited huge public sympathy for him, and crucially, others like him. What\u2019s the defining programme on poverty during George Osborne\u2019s reign as chancellor? <em>Benefits Street</em>.</p> <p>Five years ago, when I wrote about Jones\u2019s book, I rang <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jan/13/phil-redmond-british-tv-elite-failing-to-tell-working-class-stories\">Phil Redmond</a>, the creator of <em>Brookside</em> and <em>Grange Hill </em>to ask him what he thought, and when I ring him again, he says it\u2019s the same, only worse, and launches into a vivid monologue about how the TV industry works. \u201cYou might have somebody saying, well the prime minister has all these plans to regenerate sink estates, why don\u2019t we do a drama about a sink estate? And they\u2019ll say, good idea! Who would make that? It reminds me of a very good idea somebody had about garden cities in the 1930s, between the wars, with these great historical social forces at work. Fascinating stuff. What\u2019s Dominic doing at the moment?\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/sep/16/david-morrissey-working-class-actors-priced-out\">David Morrissey</a>, another actor who has spoken out on the subject, points out that \u201cfor every <em>Downton</em>, there\u2019s a <em>Happy Valley</em>\u201d. Almost everyone I talk to mentions <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/happy-valley\"><em>Happy Valley</em></a>, the brilliant <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/feb/07/sally-wainwright-writer-happy-valley-second-series\">Sally Wainwright</a> BBC drama set in the Calder valley, as the counter-example to <em>Downton </em>and <em>The Night Manager</em>, but it\u2019s perhaps pretty damning that portraying ordinary working people with warmth and humanity is, in 2016, seen as a revolutionary artistic act.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"11cd05a31c1963f4bac7d73ec0e162db49ae7223\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/11cd05a31c1963f4bac7d73ec0e162db49ae7223/85_89_4030_2418/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Sarah Lancashire in Sally Wainwright\u2019s police drama Happy Valley, set in west Yorkshire.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Sarah Lancashire in Sally Wainwright\u2019s police drama Happy Valley, set in west Yorkshire.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ben Blackall/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Morrissey, though, it\u2019s not about the kinds of drama being made, it\u2019s simply about access. \u201cIt\u2019s about young people from working-class backgrounds not being able to get on the first rung. Not being able to take a risk. The creativity that comes from suburban bedrooms. That world has gone and that has enormous consequences for our nation. If you look at how important the creative industries are to Britain, how much things like the Beatles and Harry Potter have formed our national identity, it\u2019s like we\u2019re going around tarmac-ing over the oil wells.\u201d</p> <p>And it\u2019s not just acting, he says. \u201cYoung people are being asked to work for very little money and so it\u2019s becoming a de facto middle-class profession. We\u2019re not looking after them in our industry and I\u2019d say that\u2019s true of your profession too.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s a good point. But it\u2019s striking in journalism how this affects content \u2013 local London stories being treated as topics of national interest, Port Talbot being viewed as somewhere just outside Mars, an awful lot of quinoa \u2013 so it seems improbable that it doesn\u2019t in TV and film too. Or as Edward Kemp, the artistic director of Rada, who describes himself as having \u201cthe classic British director training of an English degree from Oxford University\u201d, says: \u201cI think the fact that our gatekeepers, of whom I\u2019m one, all look rather like me and have my background, must have an impact. I can\u2019t see how it can\u2019t.\u201d </p> <p>We\u2019re talking in his office, in Rada\u2019s elegant Bloomsbury building with its photos of eminent alumni in the lobby, dozens of them, the great and the good, the stars of British stage and screen for more than a century. In the 50s, he tells me, a man called John Fernald took over as principal. He had served with men from all backgrounds during the war and encouraged students to celebrate their roots and keep their accents. \u201cSheila Hancock is very sharp on this because she caught the end of the previous era and speaks RP whereas her husband, John Thaw, was part of this new generation that came through. It meant that when there were writers and directors ready to make movies in which Albert Finney and Tom Courtenay and all those people starred, there was a generation of actors who were able to make that happen.\u201d</p> <p>It\u2019s all connected. In the 60s, the first working-class actors with working-class voices were part of a wider phenomenon, the great explosion of social mobility and cultural blossoming that expanded our ideas about what is and isn\u2019t a fit subject for art. David Morrissey tells me he was inspired to become an actor after seeing the film, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/sep/11/kes-ken-loach-review\"><em>Kes</em></a>, the first time he\u2019d seen his life reflected on screen. I feel a bit the same way about Phil Redmond\u2019s <em>Grange Hill</em>. I just hadn\u2019t realised at the time that it was the kind of gritty social realism that would subsequently vanish.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2bc67dd7033e449f5899d1506a6df1a2720c4427\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2bc67dd7033e449f5899d1506a6df1a2720c4427/0_530_4690_2814/1000.jpg\" alt=\"David Bradley in Ken Loach\u2019s film Kes, the movie that inspired David Morrrissey to act.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">David Bradley in Ken Loach\u2019s film Kes, the movie that inspired David Morrrissey to act.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But what now? Now that this whole process is in reverse? Already, the dramatist Jimmy McGovern has said how hard it is to even find working-class actors to play his roles. Is it the start of a great cultural contraction? Are our ideas about what is dramatically interesting diminishing? Will we reach the stage that Julie Walters fears, where it\u2019ll be \u201cmiddle-class people playing working-class people, like it used to be\u201d.</p> <p>Rada, in fairness, is doing its best to keep the traditions of the 60s alive, but it\u2019s getting harder and harder. \u201cWe get defensive about diversity because actually 40% of our students come from family backgrounds with an income of less than \u00a325,000 and 60% of our students are getting some kind of bursary from us,\u201d says Kemp. Rada is lucky because its alumni are often rich and many of them want to give back and it\u2019s able to help a significant number of its students. \u201cBut the real challenge for the actor starting out is how do you survive afterwards,\u201d says Kemp. The rep [repertory theatre] system which provided full-time employment for actors has all but disappeared. \u201cAnd how do you sustain a career with an expectation that you\u2019ll live within reach of London because that\u2019s where the industry is largely based? At that point the bank of mum and dad is incredibly useful.\u201d</p> <p>Kemp\u2019s conclusion, like Frank Cottrell Boyce\u2019s and Nina Gold\u2019s, is that it isn\u2019t about acting. It\u2019s about money. It\u2019s about what we\u2019ve done to our education system. \u201cI would love it to be the world that Julie Walters came from, where it was free, but I would love that for everything in higher education,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just drama schools. It\u2019s an issue about how we pay for higher education.\u201d</p> <p>The third and final part of the puzzle is schools. Last year, Jessica Hynes won a Bafta for her role in <em>W1A</em> and used the occasion to make an impassioned speech about how children from low-income families were being driven out of the arts. She\u2019s spent the last year visiting schools, talking to headteachers and learning about what is happening to drama. \u201cThe worst thing is the academy system,\u201d she says, \u201cwhich has monetised all subjects and schools simply don\u2019t receive any money from arts subjects, so they\u2019ve become incredibly difficult to justify.\u201d</p> <p>John Baugh, the head of the Dragon School, also points to the stresses and strains that state schools operate under. \u201cThere\u2019s an obsession with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2016/apr/29/more-than-30000-people-sign-petition-to-boycott-year-2-sats\">Sats </a>which seem to be the only measure of whether a school is deemed to be successful or not.\u201d</p> <p>But drama, says Hynes, \u201cis not prancing around or finding the next Orlando Bloom. It\u2019s about how you build confidence, how you connect with other people. It\u2019s about coming into a class where you feel different. Where you feel able to express yourself in another way. And it affects all other subjects. There\u2019s so much focus on Stem [science, technology, engineering and maths] subjects, but don\u2019t you think engineers need confidence and presentation and teamwork skills?</p> <p>\u201cWait a moment, I\u2019m going to tell you what Eton says on this\u2026\u201d She stomps off to retrieve a piece of paper. \u201cThis is from the Eton website,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is what they say about drama. \u2018The aim is to provide the boys with a safe and stimulating environment in which to develop skills not easily learned in the schoolroom: physical and vocal self-confidence; the social disciplines of group work; imaginative spontaneity and the disciplines required to channel it; an extended emotional range; the power of their own creativity and a respect for that of others.\u2019</p> <p>\u201cDon\u2019t all children deserve that? Not just Etonians?\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"01e4f06680616ed5e249121c2807fc52e5764f94\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/01e4f06680616ed5e249121c2807fc52e5764f94/198_370_3933_2360/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Jessica Hynes used her awards success in W1A to speak out about inequality of opportunity in the arts.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Jessica Hynes used her awards success in W1A to speak out about inequality of opportunity in the arts.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Jack Barnes/BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In her Bafta speech, Hynes, who grew up in a single-parent family in Brighton, urged people to support <a href=\"http://www.arts-emergency.org/alumni/josie-long/\">Arts Emergency</a>, founded by the comedian Josie Long and her friend Neil Griffith, which campaigns to create opportunities for young people from low income backgrounds. \u201cAnd it crashed their website. I\u2019m very proud of that. They got 20,000 hits.\u201d</p> <p>Arts Emergency pairs up mentors and mentees \u2013 young people trying to find a crack into the sort of professions that rely heavily on contacts and networks and a certain savvy knowhow. Julie Hesmondhalgh, the Accrington-born actor, who played transgender Hayley Cropper in <em>Coronation Street </em>and was recently in <em>Happy Valley</em>, is one of the latest mentors to volunteer. She tells me about a young woman from Burnley called Lisa-Marie Ashworth whom she\u2019s been trying to help for the past year or so and whose life has been genuinely turned around by drama. \u201cI were quite disruptive at school,\u201d Ashworth tells me, though this sounds like something of an understatement. She was repeatedly excluded, and was on track to leave school with no qualifications whatsoever.</p> <p>\u201cShe\u2019s this classic girl. Stunningly beautiful. Proper working-class. And absolutely primed to become a statistic,\u201d says Julie Hesmondhaulgh. \u201cNobody could contain her. And then on a whim she auditioned for the school play and just blew them away. It was like Miles Davies picking up a trumpet.\u201d </p> <p>When I talk to Ashworth, she\u2019s still on tenterhooks waiting to hear if she\u2019s got a place at drama school next year. \u201cShe\u2019s not someone who wants to be rich and famous,\u201d says Hesmondhalgh. \u201cShe\u2019s hungry for theatre. And she really turned it around. She went back to school, retook her GCSEs. It would just be amazing if she could break out of the life that\u2019s been mapped out for her.\u201d</p> <p>A couple of weeks later, Ashworth emails me the good news: she might just do that; she\u2019s been offered a place at East 15.</p> <p>Later, I look up Eton\u2019s website and marvel at its facilities: not one but two professionally staffed theatres including \u201ca flying system, orchestra pit and revolving stage\u201d. (Frank Cottrell Boyce says: \u201cThey\u2019ve got a classical stage and a TV studio. Honestly, you could train a monkey. It would be a disgrace to leave there and not be a brilliant actor.\u201d)</p> <p>But the skills required to become an Oscar-winner will also help you become prime minister, or mayor of London, or chief executive of a leading company. Or win a lead role in <em>The Night Manager</em>.</p> <p>Olivia Colman gets her man in the end. Because the TV version of <em>The Night Manager </em>is a morality tale that sees the billionaires brought to book. Colman brings Dickie Roper to heel and the monied elite who think they can get away with it, don\u2019t. But life is not like that. Just ask Tom Stocks. You probably won\u2019t see him interviewed in the <em>Radio Times </em>any time soon, but ring up customer service at Virgin Wines and you might get him on the end of the line. His latest campaign is to get drama schools to abolish their audition fees.</p> <p>\u201cIt just annoys me. You\u2019re up against it already. Surely everyone deserves a level start? You can\u2019t win a race if you\u2019re already 100 metres behind.\u201d</p> <p>Britain has changed so quickly, the gains of 40 years of social progress undone in half a generation, that most of us are still struggling to compute it, but the evidence is right there in front of us, on our cinema and television screens. It\u2019s not posh-bashing to say this is a problem. Laurence Fox, the son of James Fox, suggested the likes of Julie Walters banging on about it should \u201cshut up\u201d. But maybe we should be taking more notice not less.</p> <p><em>To contribute to Arts Emergency or join its Alternative Old Boy\u2019s Network </em><a href=\"http://www.arts-emergency.org/\"><em>click here</em></a></p> <p><em>For more information on Actor Awareness </em><em><a href=\"http://www.actorawareness.co.uk/\">click here</a></em></p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 12 May 2016.

      "headline": "Brexit isn\u2019t to blame for slowing UK growth. It\u2019s more serious than that",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2009/mar/05/interest-rates-quantitative-easing\" title=\"\">The last time the Bank of England cut interest rates was in March 2009</a> and the decision was, in the modern idiom, a bit of a no-brainer. Official figures released later that month showed unemployment rising above two million for the first time since 1997, and the economy was in freefall.</p> <p>It was the nadir of the global slump and Threadneedle Street\u2019s monetary policy committee had no hesitation in reducing the cost of borrowing to 0.5%, comfortably lower than it had ever been in the history of the Bank, which stretches all the way back to 1694.</p> <p>The belief in the City was that the Bank would not leave interest rates at this level for long. Speculation about when the MPC would start nudging up borrowing costs began almost immediately.</p> <p>But it is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/05/timeline-seven-years-of-record-low-interest-rates-bank-of-england\" title=\"\">now seven years, two months and counting since that cut,</a> and still the Bank has not budged. What\u2019s more, there are plenty of arguments in favour of the next move in rates being down rather than up.</p> <p>Reason number one is that the economy is slowing. It is not just that GDP growth eased from 0.6% in the fourth quarter of 2015 to 0.4% in the first quarter of 2016. Rather, it is that the prospects for the second quarter look even worse.</p> <p>Each month, data firm Markit produces forward-looking surveys for activity in the three main sectors of the economy: services, manufacturing and construction. The results, released last week, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/05/services-sector-slump-fans-fears-of-uk-economic-slowdown\" title=\"\">showed that all three sectors were at their weakest since the first half of 2013</a>.</p> <p>According to Markit, the findings of the three surveys are consistent with growth slowing to 0.1% in the second quarter, representing an economy operating at stall speed. The Bank of England prides itself on being pro-active and pre-emptive, stepping in early so that it does not have to play catch-up. On that basis, there is a case for a cut in interest rates when the MPC meets later this week. The chances of it opting for a fresh stimulus are, however, slim. For a start, Markit\u2019s prediction of 0.1% growth in the second quarter are based on incomplete evidence. It is still only early May, and the end of the second quarter is almost two months away. A lot can happen in that time.</p> <p>Even if, as seems likely, the Markit forecast turns out to be accurate, Mark Carney and his MPC colleagues have a ready-made excuse for sitting on their hands: the threat of Brexit. For the time being, all poor economic data can be blamed on caution being shown by businesses and consumers before the referendum on 23 June.</p> <p>The assumption is that individuals are putting off spending decisions and that companies are shelving investment decisions until they know the outcome of the referendum. If the polls are right and Britain remains in the EU, the economy will then boom in the second half of the year, as it makes up all the ground lost in the first six months.</p> <p>That\u2019s the theory at least. But it all rather relies on the threat of Brexit being the sole reason for the slowdown in the economy, and under scrutiny this doesn\u2019t stand up.</p> <p>For example, it is hard to understand why the Brexit threat should be responsible for the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/20/uk-unemployment-rises-and-pay-growth-falls\" title=\"\">increase in unemployment by 21,000 in the latest ONS figures</a>, given that the period covered was November 2015 to February 2016, and it was only at the end of the latter month that the referendum was announced.</p> <p>This argument is given weight by the slowdown seen on the other side of the Atlantic. Given that the UK tends to follow the US with a short lag, it would not be that much of a surprise if one or two MPC members voted for a rate cut this week.</p> <h2>Get ready for peak oil<br /></h2> <p>The end of the oil era has been predicted for so long that it has ceased to attract much interest. Critics rightly say it\u2019s now difficult to know who to believe. Were not forecasters urging governments to go green not so long ago, because we had reached \u201cpeak oil\u201d and the world was running out of crude? And yet now we are awash with the stuff, hence the collapse in oil prices.</p> <p>But it still gives observers pause for thought when someone of the stature of Professor Paul Stephens, oil expert at Chatham House, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/may/05/oil-firms-environment-energy-climate-change\" title=\"\">states baldly that Shell, BP et al have 10 years to adapt or die</a>, as he did last week.</p> <p>Although he is seen as close to the industry, he nevertheless believes Big Oil should diversify into renewables, perform mega-mergers or slim down to cope with a brave new world where oil demand will fall, carbon regulations will grow and high-cost oil reserves will be stranded.</p> <p>His gloomy prognosis follows the annual general meeting season in which an increasing number of Big Oil shareholders questioned whether businesses were sufficiently prepared for the likely outcomes from the recent UN climate change agreement negotiated in Paris and signed in New York.</p> <p>And it comes just weeks after Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s biggest oil exporter, announced plans to sell off at least part of its hydrocarbon inheritance to reduce its dependency on oil revenue.</p> <p>There is no doubt that volumes of oil \u2013 and, particularly, lower-carbon gas \u2013 will be needed well into the 2030s. The global transport system is still heavily dependent on black gold and full electrification is a long way off.</p> <p>But change is happening quickly too. The sale of electric cars in Norway last year grew by 71%. Almost one in five cars there is a plug-in despite the nation being a major crude producer.</p> <p>So the end of the oil era is not for the birds \u2013 or even the birdwatchers, the environmentalists, or the anti-oil obsessives. It is now becoming part of fund-manager and mainstream dialogue. Change is coming.</p> <h2>Going for broke on BHS</h2> <p>Tomorrow sees the start of MPs\u2019 inquiries into the collapse of BHS and why its pension fund has a \u00a3571m deficit. Two select committees \u2013 work and pensions, chaired by the redoubtable Frank Field, and business, innovation and skills, chaired by Ian Wright \u2013 will start by quizzing the pensions regulator and the Pension Protection Fund. The main figures in this scandal \u2013 Dominic Chappell, the former bankrupt whose consortium owned BHS at the moment of its demise, and prior owner Sir Philip Green, who received more than \u00a3500m from BHS in dividends, rent and other fees \u2013 will come later.</p> <p>Many issues must be addressed, from the role of the pension trustees to the cash handed to Green.</p> <p>Field has said that if he doesn\u2019t get a pension settlement, Green should lose his knighthood.

      "body": "<p>Italian <em>Vogue</em> once called <a href=\"https://www.cafeoto.co.uk/\">Cafe Oto</a> in Dalston the coolest venue in London. They should know. That was a while ago but it remains the place to go for the untrod, the untried, the novel. The name is a Japanese word meaning noise, sound or music. Founded eight years ago as an all-day cafe and night-time music place, Oto trades on experiment. It conspicuously attracts both young and old: anyone hungry for the new and prepared to queue for an hour to get in. You can never be sure what you might get. It may appear like a chaos of interminable soundchecks, but when eventually the music starts, the crowd, standing or sitting around the performers, falls silent. They know how to listen.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"466b2fee8e6d82fdc539b091fc84b0f5af659fc0\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/466b2fee8e6d82fdc539b091fc84b0f5af659fc0/0_0_5616_3744/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Joseph Houston and Aisha Orazbayeva at Cafe Oto.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Joseph Houston and Aisha Orazbayeva at Cafe Oto.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Antonio Olmos for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>One of Oto\u2019s mainstays is <a href=\"http://www.kammerklang.co.uk/\"><strong>Kammer Klang</strong></a>, the umbrella name for a series of near-monthly live events by different ensembles. Music ranges from the fully notated to the freely improvised, to electronic, classical and jazz, performed by newcomer or star veteran. I went to hear the young violin and piano partnership of <a href=\"http://aishaorazbayeva.com/\">Aisha Orazbayeva</a> and <a href=\"http://www.josephhouston.co.uk/\">Joseph Houston</a> play works by the iconoclastic American composer Christian Wolff (born 1934), with whom they have worked. Orazbayeva and Houston are emerging as expert interpreters of experimental music. No doubt they give good Brahms too.</p> <p>Wolff, close to the circle that included John Cage and Morton Feldman, was mostly self-taught musically, having also been a classics lecturer at Harvard. He is a mix of the marginal and the influential, the home-loving normal and the liminal extraordinary. His 1964 classic For 1, 2 or 3 People involves a mix of rules and indeterminacy. The score looks like <a href=\"http://www.spiralcage.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Christian-Wolff-for-12-or-3-People.png\">little individual maths puzzles</a>, or a lot of limbless pin men attached to staves: players must make their own choices and respond to each other in the act of performance. Here, Houston\u2019s prepared piano and Orazbayeva\u2019s hushed violin, playing tiny cells of ideas which hung in the air, made expression out of minimal ingredients. A new work, Wade in the Water, commissioned by the Kazakh-British duo, was more expansive, with quick-fire dialogue as if in reworked baroque mode interrupted by long pauses. All music is about sound and silence. Wolff makes an extreme and provocative case.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Few pianists have the ambition, or a brave enough page-turner; no wonder Levit thanked his even before taking his bow</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If you had to find a composer of huge intellectual capacity at the opposite end of the spectrum, you might come up with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferruccio_Busoni\">Ferruccio Busoni</a> (1866-1924). Maximalist hardly begins to describe his love of notes, and storms of them, often hurled thunderously, piano-crashingly fortissimo at the keyboard. Driven by an obsession with Bach, his compositions are a form of homage. Busoni has a forbidding reputation \u2013 mechanical, knotted, brainy \u2013 but in the hands of the right pianist the marriage of daunting structure and pure feeling is disarming. <a href=\"http://igor-levit.de/?lang=en\"><strong>Igor Levit</strong></a>, the Russian-born German virtuoso charting his own route in terms of repertoire, is that player.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"468db78d479d1e7409569b0424f9137c14e79fc8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/468db78d479d1e7409569b0424f9137c14e79fc8/0_24_1200_720/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Compulsive listening\u2019: Igor Levit.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Compulsive listening\u2019: Igor Levit.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Simon Jay Price</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Currently a <a href=\"https://wigmore-hall.org.uk/artistic-series/igor-levit-perspectives\">featured artist at Wigmore Hall</a>, Levit limbered up for Busoni\u2019s magnum opus, the <em>Fantasia contrappuntistica</em> (1910), via a programme dominated by Bach. He brought absolute clarity and certainty to Bach\u2019s Ricercar a3 from <em>The Musical Offering</em> and Contrapunctus 1, 4 and 11 from <em>The Art of Fugue</em>. Communing with the piano as if no one else is there, Levit keeps the threads of fugue and counterpoint so clear that you imagine, momentarily, you too might have followed all the inversions and countersubjects and variations without recourse to score or analysis. His range of colour and dynamics, concentration and freedom, make compulsive listening.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/01/igor-levit-the-leaner-meaner-piano-machine\">Igor Levit: the leaner, meaner piano machine</a> </p> </aside>  <p>As for Busoni\u2019s immense <em>Fantasia contrappuntistica</em>, it\u2019s no surprise that this work is rarely heard in the concert hall. Few pianists have the ambition (or a brave enough page-turner; no wonder Levit thanked his even before taking his bow) to wrestle with its technical and musical challenges. Perhaps, too, they are resistant to a work that dares explore a possible ending to Bach\u2019s unfinished <em>Art of Fugue</em> as well as adding the composer\u2019s own massive, wild-eared fantasy. His best-known pieces are his versions of Bach\u2019s Chaconne in D minor, and Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland which Levit \u2013 drained, exhausted, but still up for more \u2013 played as an encore. For Busoni, Bach was his life\u2019s work. The attachment was so complete that his wife was once introduced as Mrs Bach-Busoni. Today that might have been grounds for divorce.</p> <p><em>Star ratings (out of 5)<br /></em><em>Kammer Klang **** <br />Igor Levit ****</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>I meet Kevin Rowland for lunch in his local vegan restaurant in east London. He is dressed down today, at least by his often extravagant sartorial standards, in buttoned-up denim shirt, wide denim jeans and a large flat cap. The look, from the stripy fisherman\u2019s jumper draped over his shoulders to his well-groomed \u2019tache and goatee, is bohemian, rather than full-on dandy. He seems relaxed and looks tanned and healthy.</p> <p>\u201cYeah, I feel all right,\u201d he says, smiling, \u201cbut I do have to work at it. I\u2019ve made an album exactly how I wanted to. I\u2019ve expressed myself in the way I wanted.\u201d</p> <p>The album in question is called <a href=\"http://dexysonline.com/\"><em>Let The Record Show: Dexys Do Irish and Country Soul</em></a>. It is, as its title suggests, an unlikely hybrid, comprising a selection of Irish ballads mixed with some other songs that, as the blurb puts it, \u201cloosely fall under the heading country soul\u201d. They include Joni Mitchell\u2019s Both Sides Now and Rod Stewart\u2019s You Wear It Well, which is stretching the definition of country soul somewhat but, as ever, Kevin Rowland walks to the beat of his own drum.</p> <p>Essentially, what unites them all is that he likes them and they lend themselves to the kind of no-holds-barred emotional delivery that has been his signature since <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/dexys-midnight-runners\">Dexys Midnight Runners</a> unveiled their statement-of-intent debut, <em>Searching for the Young Soul Rebels</em>, in 1980. \u201cAll the songs on here are deep within me,\u201d he says, \u201cand I\u2019ve had a real urge to do them for a long time. They are as much a part of me as if I had written them myself and I put as much of myself into them. One hundred per cent, probably more.\u201d</p> <p>As fans of Dexys will attest, Rowland is nothing if not totally committed to his singular brand of soul-baring intensity. The strident thrust of early songs such as Geno and Dance Stance may have been tempered by the years, but the intensity remains and is now channelled into vocal performances that walk the line between passionate and melodramatic. He does not so much sing a song as inhabit it, in much the same way as a method actor might immerse himself in a role.</p> <p>\u201cYou don\u2019t just rock up to the studio and just sing the song,\u201d he tells me, \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get inside the song. You\u2019ve got to know who you are when you are singing the song and you gotta know who you\u2019re singing to. Otherwise it\u2019s not going to be believable.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5b232b803e55129131fb43dfaa8c3a1d51ebf662\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5b232b803e55129131fb43dfaa8c3a1d51ebf662/0_137_4868_2920/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Rowland and the current Dexys personnel, Lucy Morgan and Sean Read.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rowland and the current Dexys personnel, Lucy Morgan and Sean Read.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>During his recording of the supremely melancholy Irish ballad Carrickfergus, he says he related so much to the protagonist that he began to experience chills. \u201cIt\u2019s the words of a long-distance man \u2013 the Irish labourers who travelled around England, often walking from town to town and sleeping rough, in search of work. He\u2019s dying and he wants to return to Ireland where his love is buried. I related to that in a very real way and began to feel cold and shivery when I was singing in the studio.\u201d On the recording, you can hear him cough during the song and utter a long sigh at its end. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t because I had a cold,\u201d he says, \u201cIt just came out and, when I played it to a friend I trust, he said, \u2018You\u2019ve got to leave the cough on there.\u2019 That\u2019s when it occurred to me that the cough and the sigh at the end are actually a part of the song.\u201d</p> <p>A week after our meeting, I witness Rowland stride out on to the stage of the Royal Festival Hall as part of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/03/imagining-ireland-review-royal-festival-hall-easter-rising-kevin-rowland\">Imagining Ireland</a>, a diverse musical celebration to mark the centenary of the Easter Rising of 1916. Wearing a pale pink 1920s suit with the widest trousers imaginable, he proceeds to tear down the place with his rendition of the Irish song The Curragh of Kildare. As the song progresses, you can feel the initially suspicious audience respond to his passionate delivery. His even more emotive take on Carrickfergus, covered by the likes of Bryan Ferry and Van Morrison before him, becomes a soulful tussle between him and his current collaborator and co-producer, Sean Read.</p> <p>On record, though, it\u2019s a different matter. Without the live setting, the same songs sound somewhat overworked and overwrought, too reverent and literal. I tell him that it is hard for me to imagine anyone singing a song like Forty Shades of Green or the more recent, but equally romantic The Town That I Love So Well without succumbing to the sentimentality that is explicit even in their titles. Rowland is having none of it.</p> <p>\u201cThey\u2019re not sentimental to me,\u201d he says, firmly and with just a trace of the old combativeness. \u201cI\u2019m the son of a builder. I\u2019m not the son of an intellectual, and the kind of people who find songs like these sentimental are usually intellectual types, people who aren\u2019t in touch with themselves. I first heard those songs sung by my uncles and aunts, unaccompanied, and they sang them beautifully and I responded to them in a purely intuitive way. To me, they\u2019re just beautiful songs and I sang them as best I could.\u201d</p> <p>Which raises the question, why did he not do an entire album of Irish songs? \u201cWell, that was the idea back around 1983, when I originally wanted to do it,\u201d he says of the album\u2019s long gestation. \u201cI was going to [County] Mayo a lot back then, getting into roots a lot. I was exploring Irish culture and going to Derry and Belfast to try to understand what was going on there, too. My idea then was to do a whole album called \u2018Irish\u2019, but, as time went on, I just thought I\u2019d really like to do You Wear It Well and Both Sides Now.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"fb01e0e4246f02835671c16c8048adf7cbde401d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb01e0e4246f02835671c16c8048adf7cbde401d/0_252_3456_2073/1000.jpg\" alt=\"One I made earlier: Dexys Midnight Runners in the woolly hat period.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One I made earlier: Dexys Midnight Runners in the woolly hat period.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: David Corio/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>He explains that the Rod Stewart song soundtracked the end of a magical summer in the early 1970s when Rowland worked at Butlins, in his late teens. \u201cIt just captured the romance of that time for me and that feeling of melancholy when you are leaving something beautiful behind.\u201d Joni Mitchell\u2019s song was just powerful. \u201cI first heard Both Sides Now when I was 13 and it touched me in a very deep way. Still does. It has just so much beauty to it. I\u2019m an intuitive guy and I can\u2019t often articulate why I do the things I do, nor am I even interested in doing that unless someone like you asks me to. For me it\u2019s about finding the beauty and expressing it, whether it\u2019s an Irish ballad or a soul song or one of my own songs.\u201d</p> <p>Rowland\u2019s Irish roots have always shone through in his music, though, from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Searching_for_the_Young_Soul_Rebels\">cover of <em>Searching for the Young Soul Rebels</em></a>, which featured a young lad clutching his possessions after his home had been burned down by a sectarian mob in Belfast, to the stirring recital of the names of great Irish writers on the single Dance Stance, and on to the Celtic gypsy-soul of <em>Too-Rye-Ay</em>. Born in Wolverhampton to Irish parents, he lived in Mayo, where his parents grew up, from the age of one to four, before returning to his home city. \u201cI remember starting school and having the piss taken out of me all the time,\u201d he tells me, \u201cThen, we moved from Wolverhampton to London when I was 10 and that was even worse because Irish people were not held in high esteem here back then. You have to fit in to survive as a kid, so I became good at accents very quickly.\u201d</p> <p>We talk about how the Irish songs he sings may have a different resonance for first-generation Irish people like him who grew up in Britain. When I ask him if he feels Irish, he says: \u201cAlong the way, I have wanted to get away from it and I\u2019ve embraced it. And now I think I can honestly say that I\u2019m in a place where I\u2019m comfortable with who I am. I think all identities are a dead end, really. So, I\u2019m not saying this or that about Ireland with this record, except that this is how I do these songs that I love.\u201d</p> <p>Rowland\u2019s teenage years were fraught and he had several run-ins with the law, including an arrest for assaulting a gang of men with an iron bar. The original Dexys Midnight Runners were a way of channelling his alienation and, initially, he ran the group as a cross between a gang and a team, imposing strict rules about physical fitness, dress \u2013 donkey jackets and woolly hats \u2013 and, though they were named after a brand of amphetamine, banning all forms of drug use and rejecting all things rock\u2019n\u2019roll.</p> <p>\u201cNo one else was talking about soul in 1978,\u201d he tells me, \u201cYou weren\u2019t reading about soul in <em>NME</em> back then. That\u2019s why it was cool to me. It had potential to be radical. To me, it was after punk and it was new and a bolt from the view and I loved soul but now I think it was a bit narrow. In fact, I wish we had never said that word, soul, because once you label something, you kill it. I think we should never have said anything except we\u2019re Dexys and this is our music.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c6c42a67c91268c6eb9d7f176b2272c298f6dfbd\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c6c42a67c91268c6eb9d7f176b2272c298f6dfbd/0_46_1246_1557/800.jpg\" alt=\"Rowland\u2019s appearance at the 1999 Reading festival in a dress.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Rowland\u2019s appearance at the 1999 Reading festival in a dress.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Michael Walter/PA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>That music has taken on many radically different guises since then, while somehow remaining essentially and identifiably Dexys. After the huge crossover success of Come on Eileen and the accompanying album <em>Too-Rye-Ay</em>, he found himself all at sea in the mainstream. \u201cI was fairly comfortable being the outsider knocking on the door,\u201d he said of that time in 1999, \u201cbut once the door opened and I stepped inside, I was completely lost.\u201d When <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/mar/07/popandrock1\">1985\u2019s album <em>Don\u2019t Stand Me Down</em></a>, still considered by many his masterpiece, flopped, his career nosedived, dramatically leading to bankruptcy and a spell in rehab. (I reviewed the record somewhat equivocally for <em>NME </em>back then, and today, more than 30 years later, he brings it up as he has on the few occasions we have met since. \u201c<em>NME</em> definitely had it in for us at that time,\u201d he says, \u201cBut don\u2019t worry about it. It\u2019s in the past. It was all a long time ago.\u201d Back then, though, I used to dread bumping into him, as he had beaten up another journalist who had written an unfavourable review.)</p> <p>In 1999, he released an album of cover versions called <em>My Beauty </em>on Creation Records, posing on the cover in drag. At that year\u2019s Reading festival, he donned a white dress, stockings and lipstick to sing Whitney Houston\u2019s The Greatest Love of All to a bemused audience that responded with boos and bottles. \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2003/sep/19/2\">Four years ago I was nuts</a>,\u201d he told the <em>Guardian</em> in 2003.</p> <p>Thirteen years of silence separated <em>My Beauty </em>and the release of <em>One Day I\u2019m Going to Soar</em>, Dexys\u2019s critically acclaimed <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/may/31/dexys-one-day-im-review\">late comeback from 2012</a>. In interviews, he spoke of prolonged periods of therapy to battle drug use and feelings of guilt about past behaviour. Today, he does not want to dwell on the past, but he does say, \u201cFor a long time, I wasn\u2019t able to express myself in the way that I wanted. I would try to do things, but nothing seemed to work creatively. And, at the time, I would probably have been saying to myself, \u2018Oh, no label wants to sign us\u2019 or whatever, but deep down I think I knew that what I was doing wasn\u2019t really good enough to put it out in the world.\u201d</p> <p>There is a palpable aura of calmness, if not quite serenity, about Kevin Rowland these days, as if he has finally made peace with his own impossible demands regarding art, beauty and, above all, passionate intensity. \u201cI probably had to go though all the things I went through in order to make the music I wanted to make again,\u201d he says, \u201cwhich is incredibly hard, but I also recommend it, taking 20 years off or whatever time it was. Sometimes you just have to step back.\u201d</p> <p><em>Let the Record Show: Dexys Do Irish and Country Soul will be released on 3 June on 100%/Warner Music</em></p>",

Finally, under pressure from interviewer Sarah Montague, Fallon conceded that \u201cLondon is safe with a Conservative government working with the new mayor of London\u201d.</p> <p>In his <em>Observer </em>article, Khan, whose team were not keen on Jeremy Corbyn attending Saturday\u2019s ceremony, according to reports, also delivers a clear message to the Labour leader on how to win elections after a set of local, Scottish and Welsh results that left some Labour MPs questioning Corbyn\u2019s future. Labour suffered disastrous losses in Scotland, where it slipped to third place behind Ruth Davidson\u2019s Scottish Conservatives. In English local elections, however, the party avoided predicted losses in key strongholds in the south.</p> <p>\u201cI learnt a great deal throughout the course of the campaign \u2013 about myself, about London and about the importance of reaching out to all sections of society. But there are two lessons in particular,\u201d Khan writes. \u201cFirst, Labour only wins when we face outwards and focus on the issues that the people actually care about. And secondly, we will never be trusted to govern unless we reach out and engage with all voters \u2013 regardless of their background, where they live or where they work.</p> <p>\u201cSquabbles over internal party structures might be important for some in the party, but it is clear they mean little or nothing to the huge majority of voters. As tempting as it might be, we must always resist focusing in on ourselves and ignoring what people really want.\u201d</p> <p>Khan suggests Corbyn is failing to appeal to a wide enough electorate, including middle-class and disaffected Tory voters.</p> <p>\u201cLabour has to be a big tent that appeals to everyone \u2013 not just its own activists. Campaigns that deliberately turn their back on particular groups are doomed to fail.</p> <p>\u201cJust like in London, so-called natural Labour voters alone will never be enough to win a general election. We must be able to persuade people who previously voted Conservative that Labour can be trusted with the economy and security as well as improving public services and creating a fairer society.\u201d</p> <p>Khan, the Tooting MP, secured 57% of votes in the mayoral contest once second preferences were taken into account. Sources close to Corbyn said he was planning a public event with Khan in the next few days. The Labour leader is also expected to address his MPs at what could prove a difficult meeting of the parliamentary Labour party on Monday.</p>",

However, it is fair to say that this is the least essential of the three films. The narrator Scheherazade (Crista Alfaiate) is fleshed out as a character. Her adventure \u2013 a brief escape to an archipelago populated by outlaws \u2013 is a playful tangle of anachronisms. But charm dissipates with the final story, an overlong documentary-style portrait of a working-class bird-trapping community. Tonally, it\u2019s reminiscent of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/gallery/2010/apr/23/raymond-depardon-cities-photography-exhibition\" title=\"\">Raymond Depardon</a>\u2019s glum portraits of French rural life, spiked with surreal flashes. If this was Scheherazade\u2019s final story, it would have been unlikely to stave off her execution.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aJgLXhdUgQ\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/_aJgLXhdUgQ?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aJgLXhdUgQ\">Watch the trailer for the Arabian Nights trilogy.</a></figcaption> </figure>",

      "body": "<p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2015/aug/28/mona-hatoum-a-retrospective-in-pictures\">Mona Hatoum</a>\u2019s most famous work lies in wait around the first corner of <a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/mona-hatoum\">this show</a>, a spectacle of fleshy revulsion and creeping claustrophobia. It is experienced in a cubicle the size of a miniature space capsule. Here you stand in the darkness, sardine-tight with your fellow viewers, staring down at the film beneath your feet, which shows a headlong tumble down a moist and scarlet tunnel \u2013 a throat, perhaps, or an unthinkable stretch of intestinal tract.</p> <p>The film goes on its way through the bodily orifices, meeting sudden bends and black holes. Tunnelling, probing, sliding, it passes down through whirlpools and gullies. An endoscopy camera is clearly in use in someone\u2019s body, though the magnified images render everything so bizarre as to appear more alien than human. As the film continues its relentless downward spiral there is the sense of watching something between a melodrama and a horror movie, with the added vertigo of being sucked into the pit: don\u2019t look down!</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A cake of soap stuck with strands of human hair is only (and exactly) what revolts billions of people every day</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsci0WAd_Lk\"><em>Corps \u00e9tranger</em></a> is exactly the right title for this act of bodily estrangement. This is Hatoum\u2019s self-portrait as a foreign body. Born in Beirut to Palestinian parents in 1952, the artist moved to London in 1975 after civil war broke out in Lebanon. She came to study art and has lived here ever since, at first a stranger in a strange land but gradually internationally established with a Turner shortlisting and many prizes overseas, including Berlin where she spends part of the year. This piece, with all its overtones of surveillance, violence, privacy and estrangement, appears as much biographical as political in its aesthetics. It was created in 1994. On the strength of this major retrospective, alas, that may have been Hatoum\u2019s strongest work.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsci0WAd_Lk\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"345\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qsci0WAd_Lk?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsci0WAd_Lk\">Mona Hatoum\u2019s masterpiece?

The filings are black, form further intestinal shapes across the surface and look like some kind of outlandish fur. With a slight movement of passing air, the dark filaments shiver. It is a spectacular object, to be sure, at least for the first few seconds of looking. But as soon as one learns the scientific forces that underpin the visual effect, it rapidly takes second place.</p> <p>First impressions tend to count above all (and to a fault) in Hatoum\u2019s work. Here is a French park chair sprouting pubic hair, a quick double take straight out of Magritte, with a weak pun on pubic and public in the title. Here is a photograph of a man\u2019s naked back, the hair soaped into grotesque <a href=\"http://www.wikiart.org/en/vincent-van-gogh/the-starry-night-1889\"><em>Starry Night</em></a> whorls, tritely titled <em>Van Gogh\u2019s Back</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"ac12ee3b8bd8e5c12d4416a907975716d1d51a4e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ac12ee3b8bd8e5c12d4416a907975716d1d51a4e/0_0_3456_5137/673.jpg\" alt=\"Hot Spot, 2013 by Mona Hatoum at Tate Modern.\" width=\"673\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Hot Spot, 2013 by Mona Hatoum at Tate Modern.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: James Gourley/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Many small works on paper and fabric incorporate nail clippings or strands of nameless hair, taking all their vaunted impact from the inherent repugnance of these human relics. Tiny hairballs are dotted through the galleries. On a pewter dish lies a cake of soap stuck with strands of human hair, raising the teenage question of bodily provenance. This is only (and exactly) what revolts billions of people in the shower every day.</p> <p>So you begin to look harder for deeper meanings. In a darkened gallery many cages are stacked, locker-style, around a naked lightbulb that swings slowly back and forth, casting sinister grid-shadows all over the walls. The obvious inferences are of imprisonment and torture. But each cage is small, and each door is open, so that the work somewhat resembles an aviary where the birds have flown. And the title \u2013 <em>Light Sentence </em>\u2013 seems peculiarly ambiguous, or at the very least by no means as piercing as the installation appears to deserve or suggest. The ideas are there, but not the visceral effect.</p> <p>The earliest works here are performance pieces. Hatoum tripping and scrambling inside a glass cylinder smeared with clay, to the sound of Arabic revolutionary songs; dragging herself along the ground among English day-trippers taking tea in a leafy park to mark the chasmic distinction between them; footprinting Sheffield with the word \u201cUnemployed\u201d (literally: the word was inked on the sole of her shoe) to draw attention to the record numbers of jobless citizens in 1986. Surviving photographs indicate the dramatic potency of these actions.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>They may be bodied forth in three dimensions, but Hatoum\u2019s pieces so often feel like ideas on paper</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>But something is lost when she translates her ideas into sculpture. Sometimes it is the simple fact that no transformation has actually occurred, as with the hairballs and soap, or that the shifts appear peculiarly trivial: a procession of tin soldiers going round and round in circles; a rusty iron bed positioned in a cell in an American penitentiary where it looks right at home.</p> <p>Numerous surrealist reprises, such as graters and sieves sprouting nails and screws, go straight back to Marcel Duchamp. Others involve ineffectual enlargement. The three-fold grater enlarged to the proportions of a drawing-room screen, and displayed exactly thus, makes a fine observation of the formal analogies between them. But that is as far as it goes. Graters have their own powers of suggestive menace \u2013 the bullet-hole perforations, the wound-slicing slits, the inadvertent grating of one\u2019s own flesh that is irresistibly proposed, not least by experience, since it happens to absolutely everyone \u2013 so that the massive scale seems pretty superfluous.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4a746b3d934426e46d254b9dfb255471efee6c84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4a746b3d934426e46d254b9dfb255471efee6c84/0_25_3600_2444/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Grater Divide, 2002 by Mona Hatoum at Tate Modern.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"679\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Grater Divide, 2002 by Mona Hatoum at Tate Modern.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Lengths of barbed wire dangle from the ceiling like a shower of hard rain. The curators like to imply that you will only discover their true identity as barbaric instruments \u201cheavy with connotations of conflict and exclusion\u201d on closer inspection. But it is perfectly obvious what they are from any distance; and perhaps obviousness is too often the problem. A powerful mechanism sweeps a circle of sand, slowly raking and smoothing, making and unmaking in continuous (political) cycles. Globes, whatever you do with them (and Hatoum runs the gamut), remain irreducibly political symbols.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/apr/17/mona-hatoum-interview-installation-artist-tate-modern-exhibition\">Mona Hatoum: \u2018It\u2019s all luck. I feel things happen accidentally\u2019</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There is so often a shortfall between object and idea in this show. The installation entitled <em>Homebound</em>, for instance, doesn\u2019t rise to the searing double entendre of its title. Here is a domestic scene rigged up with a fluctuating electric current so that everything, from cots to buckets to birdcages and chairs, glows and emits a ferocious crackle. You see all the horrifying associations but they aren\u2019t generated as active feelings by this melodramatic son et lumiere.</p> <p>They may be bodied forth in three dimensions, but Hatoum\u2019s pieces so often feel like ideas on paper (it would be interesting to read her writings). Of course there are exceptions where everything coincides \u2013 her collapsed rubber cot, for instance, forlorn as a malnourished infant \u2013 but they are all too few in this show. The most inert exhibit is a set of hand grenades in luscious hues cast in Murano glass and displayed in a shining vitrine. You can see the thinking here, but the objects do not occasion the all-important feeling. They are no more or less than the very thing they are destined to be: baubles for a rich collector.</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-modern/exhibition/mona-hatoum\">Mona Hatoum is at Tate Modern, London until 21 August</a></li> </ul>",

      "body": "<p>That photo of your toddler running around in a nappy or having a temper tantrum? Think before you post it on Facebook. That\u2019s the advice from French authorities, which have warned parents in France they <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/12179584/French-parents-could-be-jailed-for-posting-childrens-photos-online.html\">could face fines</a> of up to \u20ac45,000 (\u00a335,000) and a year in prison for publishing intimate photos of their children on social media without permission, as part of the country\u2019s strict privacy laws. </p> <p>It\u2019s a development that could give pause for thought for many parents used to sharing details of their children\u2019s lives across social media. A <a href=\"http://www.nominet.uk/todays-children-will-feature-in-almost-1000-online-photos-by-the-time-they-reach-age-five/\">2015 study</a> by internet company Nominet found parents in the UK post nearly 200 photos of their under fives online every year, meaning a child will feature in around 1,000 online photos before their fifth birthday. </p> <p>\u201cYour favourite picture of your child sitting on the potty for the first time may not be their favourite picture of themselves when they\u2019re 13,\u201d says author and child psychologist Catherine Steiner-Adair.</p> <p>Given the relative youth of social media, it\u2019s hard to say exactly how growing up online could affect children but there are concerns around infringing privacy, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/sep/21/children-privacy-online-facebook-photos\">safety and security</a> (for example providing information that could be used by somebody to steal your child\u2019s identity), and leaving children open to bullying. </p> <p> Professor Nicola Whitton of Manchester Metropolitan University is among those predicting trouble. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to get a backlash in years to come from young people coming to realise that they\u2019ve had their whole lives, from the day they were born, available to social media. A recent University of Michigan study found that children aged <a href=\"http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/03/08/dont-post-about-me-on-social-media-children-say/?_r=0\">10 to 17 \u201cwere really concerned\u201d</a> about the ways parents shared their children\u2019s lives online</p> <p>\u201cParents have to work out what\u2019s right for them, but be aware that this is another person, another human being, who may not thank them for it in 15 years to come. </p> <p>\u201cIt may seem hard, but my line would be don\u2019t put pictures online until they\u2019re of an age where it\u2019s appropriate to discuss it with them,\u201d Whitton says. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ec08e4f334b53af99cf14bf9ada0930be17afc71\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ec08e4f334b53af99cf14bf9ada0930be17afc71/0_126_1908_2205/865.jpg\" alt=\"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg shows a photo of himself as a baby.\" width=\"865\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg shows a photo of himself as a baby.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Justin Sullivan/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>This doesn\u2019t have to mean a serious conversation every time you capture a charming moment on camera and want to share it, says Professor Sonia Livingstone at the London School of Economics.</p> <p> \u201cIf [parents] can be open with their children about what they wish to share, with whom and why, this need not result in a draconian crack-down on all sharing,\u201d she says.</p> <p>She suggests parents think about exactly who they are sharing with, because 50 friends is one thing and 500 random people quite another. The recent <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"http://www.nominet.uk/todays-children-will-feature-in-almost-1000-online-photos-by-the-time-they-reach-age-five/\">Nominet study</a> found 17% of parents had never checked their Facebook privacy settings. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>\u201cEveryone needs to consider the needs of themselves and others in an open way, bearing in mind that the digital world is changing, that images are permanently posted, and that the conditions of sharing and norms are all shifting in unpredictable ways,\u201d says Livingston.<br /></p> <p>Social sharing isn\u2019t inherently bad for children; sharing pictures can benefit children, for example, by helping to maintain connections with family members such as far away grandparents and cousins abroad. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>If a child doesn\u2019t like a photo posted by their parent, they could ask them to take it down. If that\u2019s not possible, social media sites such as <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/help/www/428478523862899?rdrhc\">Facebook</a> and <a draggable=\"true\" href=\"https://support.twitter.com/forms/private_information\">Twitter</a> have reporting functions to request photos be removed. On Facebook, if a third-party has posted the image and refuses to take it down, parents themselves can request removal of a photo of a child under 13, while those 14 and over are expected to make the report themselves. </p> <p>However, parents sharing photos of their children online isn\u2019t just about future embarrassment. One of the complaints Steiner-Adair hears from children is that parents are \u201cobsessed\u201d with snapping photos, particularly when they excel at their hobbies and activities \u2013 making them feel pressured to perform to help mum and dad get the right snap to share. <br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p> <p>Children notice when parents come to their pageant or sports match and focus on photography instead of them, says Steiner-Adair. \u201cThey look out into the audience looking for their parents and all they see is a sea of smartphones \u2026 [when] what the children really want is to see you smiling at them.\u201d </p> <p><br tabindex=\"-1\" /></p>",

      "body": "<p>A playwright and actor has launched legal action against British Airways and London City airport, alleging that they irreparably damaged her \u00a325,000 wheelchair, made her daily life more difficult and caused problems for her business.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.athenastevens.com/\">Athena Stevens,</a> 31, who has cerebral palsy, estimated that the incident last October had so far cost her \u00a370,000. \u201cIt has completely closed my life down,\u201d she said, adding that she had had to hire extra support workers to assist her with her daily routine and activities, and had been left unable to travel on public transport.</p> <p>Her business, which employs five people, and includes the making of online documentaries and interviews, had also been disrupted, she claimed.</p> <p>Stevens, currently appearing <a href=\"http://www.finboroughtheatre.co.uk/productions/2016/schism.php\">in her play Schism at Finborough theatre in London</a>, said: \u201cI am acting, but that doesn\u2019t mean I am not inhibited. Not having my chair for rehearsals, getting to and from the theatre etc is a nightmare. I have had to spend \u00a350 on a single taxi ride home.\u201d</p> <p>The incident, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/jan/27/ba-and-london-city-airport-irreparably-damaged-25000-wheelchair\">first reported in January</a>, prompted a petition in support of Stevens. It has so far been backed by more than 52,000 people on the website of the <a href=\"https://you.38degrees.org.uk/petitions/anthea-s-wheelchair?bucket=blast3\">campaign group 38 Degrees</a>.</p> <p>Stevens said her wheelchair was broken when she attempted to take a flight to Glasgow. She was forced to use a back-up manual chair at first but has been renting an electric chair since January.</p> <p>This has, however, caused problems when the actor tries to get into her home and office. She has alleged she cannot use the rental chair on the tube, travel up five-inch kerbs or go up and down stairs properly.</p> <p>\u201cI\u2019m paying about \u00a3200 a week for a wheelchair that can\u2019t clear the threshold of my flat unless I get out and push it,\u201d she said. While acting, she has had to use a manual wheelchair.</p> <p>Stevens had not insured the chair that she claims was damaged in October. She said she had attempted to get it covered but no underwriters were willing to offer insurance as there were only about 500 in the world and a suitable replacement would be likely to cost more than \u00a330,000.</p> <p>BA has refunded \u00a3680 for the return tickets she and her PA were unable to use in October, because the plane could not accommodate her chair. The airline and airport had offered to pay taxi fares up to a total of \u00a31,000 before she launched the legal action last month.</p> <p>BA told the Guardian: \u201cMore than 426,000 people with reduced mobility travelled with us last year and we take their needs extremely seriously.</p> <p>\u201cAlong with London City airport, we investigated Ms Stevens\u2019 concerns thoroughly and we continue to try to seek a solution with her and her legal representatives.\u201d</p> <p> London City airport said: \u201cThe airport is working with the passenger and British Airways to resolve this matter. The situation is being dealt with by lawyers and we are therefore unable to provide further comment.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>I hope what you\u2019re reading here is just another piece of paranoid nonsense about the BBC.</p> <p>You see, while the debate rages about the future of the corporation, I and many others have been having quiet talks with the culture secretary, John Whittingdale, and the subjects discussed and conclusions that seem to have been reached bear no relation to the pretty frightening speculation plastered all over front pages last week.</p> <p>The latter loudly \u201creport\u201d that the BBC is going to be made to surrender editorial control to government appointees, that it\u2019s going to be told to steer away from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/01/government-could-ban-bbc-from-showing-top-shows-at-peak-times\" title=\"\">scheduling \u201csuccessful\u201d formats against commercial competitors</a>, that it\u2019s going to be under review from the government every five years, and that it\u2019s going to lose more of its licence fee to other organisations.</p> <p>Behind closed doors, though, myself and other creatives within broadcasting have been reassured the opposite: that the BBC is loved throughout the land, that its licence fee is safe, that the government is simply not allowed to and has no intention of telling it what programmes to make, and that its editorial independence will be preserved.</p> <p>I\u2019m not being indiscreet here: these are all assurances that Whittingdale has made public many, many times. And yet the suspicion remains that all is not quite what is being said aloud. Maybe it\u2019s just an unfortunate run of circumstances. Rather like the run that had the culture secretary state clearly at last year\u2019s Edinburgh TV festival he had no plans to privatise Channel 4, only for a civil servant from his department to be <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/sep/24/government-considering-channel-4-privatisation-document-slip-up-reveals\" title=\"\">photographed not long after with a sheaf of papers</a> outlining the logistics of embarking on such a move.</p> <p>So maybe I should relax and try really hard to square the culture secretary\u2019s profuse support for the brilliance of the BBC with his reported remarks to Cambridge University\u2019s Conservative Association that the demise of the BBC would be a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/04/bbc-john-whittingdale-impartiality\" title=\"\">tempting prospect</a>\u201d. Maybe I should console myself that he did ask for a plurality of views and now he\u2019s giving them.</p> <p>But such confusion, verging on paranoia, damages confidence in our broadcasting industry. Let\u2019s not forget that our media and communications sector makes up 8% of GDP, more than the oil and car industries combined. These are real jobs, real investments, making British broadcasting an important part of this country\u2019s global reach: anyone responsible for its future has to speculate discreetly and judiciously, not openly and for quick headlines.</p> <p>That was the main theme of my <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/aug/26/ministers-want-bbc-to-consider-assisted-suicide-says-armando-ianucci\" title=\"\">MacTaggart lecture</a> last year in Edinburgh, in which I chided the government\u2019s consistent running down of the BBC. John Whittingdale was in the audience and took it all in good grace. Since then he\u2019s gone out of his way to open up the discussions, organising sessions with creative and production figures from television who\u2019ve all had the opportunity to persuade him about what\u2019s great and world-beating about the BBC, where it can be improved, but also where it must be supported. I do get a sense that the message sunk in: the BBC is unique, popular, and potentially a huge international commercial success, so tampering with it must be done with great care.</p> <p>So why now this change of tone so late on? Why the almost audible shrieks of pleasure in the headlines about <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/07/bbc-forced-disclose-salaries-highest-paid-stars-john-whittingdale\" title=\"\">making presenters\u2019 wages public</a>, halting populist shows, stamping on political \u201cbias?\u201d Can it be that, deep in government, people are just annoyed that the BBC is so well liked? Rather like junior doctors, local schools and benefits for the disabled, most of us regard the corporation as a very good thing, whether we\u2019re from the right or the left. That confounds those who believe that market forces alone can determine what works and what fails.</p> <p>So, frustrated that their plan to cut the corporation to shreds can\u2019t happen because it would be deeply unpopular, are those same people looking for subtler ways to administer a quieter, gentler death? Otherwise why the stories, coming from No 10, that David Cameron wants the BBC charter to be reviewed every five years instead of 10, that it should have a new ruling body in which at least half its members are appointed by the government of the day, and that this body should have <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/13/government-choose-bbc-board-john-whittingdale\" title=\"\">involvement in day-to-day operational decisions</a>, including news coverage?</p> <p>It sounds deeply tedious but is quietly sinister. Just imagine, every five years, always coming up to a general election, the board of government appointees demanding the BBC change its tone, alter its stance, be careful of what it says, as it covers the election. And if the party in power looks like losing, what additional pressures on reporting will be enforced?</p> <p>Cameron might argue he wouldn\u2019t directly interfere, but what of the future? Why should the BBC have formalised in its charter even the merest prospect of being directly influenced by the likes of Boris Johnson, Jeremy Corbyn or Theresa May?</p> <p>No truly impartial journalist can work properly under such conditions. They could do, but what they said would be deadly dull. The BBC is there to question, to test, to hold a mirror up to British society, reflect it back, but to challenge the image too. What it can\u2019t be is told to be dull.</p> <p>That essentially is the tenor of the attack on the BBC: we can\u2019t destroy you, so can we make you boring instead? The briefings and speculation are a warning to all present and future BBC employees: don\u2019t have any fun. Don\u2019t make programmes that are too well liked; don\u2019t think that if you produce a show in-house and it does well, we won\u2019t sell it off to an independent; don\u2019t think you can have an entertaining Saturday night; don\u2019t think you can embark on any investigations that are in any way mischievous or provocative; above all, don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to leave you alone, because we won\u2019t.</p> <p>For a manifesto inspired by the free market, it\u2019s quite a statist, centralised and authoritarian prospect. It will eliminate in an instant any goodwill that may have marked the past 10 months of discussions. Above all, it will damage an industry that is world-beating and popular, and which the market tells us should be allowed to thrive.</p> <p><em>Armando Inannucci is the award-winning writer of the BBC series The Thick of It</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>While Terrence Malick should be applauded for developing his own distinctive cinematic vernacular, there comes a point when his formula of breathily portentous voiceover and wafty imagery starts to nudge into self-parody. Following the odyssey of a successful, womanising screenwriter (Christian Bale), the film unfolds in Hollywood, Vegas and on innumerable sun-kissed beaches. The cinematography, by Emmanuel Lubezki, creates a beguiling magic-hour wonderland out of the southern Californian backdrop, but the material \u2013 particularly the use of women \u2013 feels queasily inappropriate at times. Is it commentary on the objectification of young girls in a world where female flesh is currency? Or is it just a film which objectifies young girls? There are many shots of immaculately maintained naked female bodies, not all of whom are given voices and some not even faces. You start to wonder if Malick uses the mantle of high art in the same way that a flasher uses his mac. Of the female characters who get to be, well, characters, Cate Blanchett alone manages to deliver something more nuanced than Malick\u2019s default setting of \u201cfree-spirited, gambolling wood nymph\u201d. Knight of Cups is not without moments of poetry however: an underwater shot of dogs in a swimming pool, chasing elusive tennis balls, is as effective a metaphor for Hollywood as the rest of the picture put together.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI2j1FHCjtM\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/SI2j1FHCjtM?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SI2j1FHCjtM\">Watch the trailer for Knight of Cups.</a></figcaption> </figure>",

      "body": "<p>In a few weeks\u2019 time, thousands of year 11 students will enter examination halls all over the country, anxiously clutching copies of John Steinbeck\u2019s Of Mice and Men. As they put the finishing touches to their essays and hand over their papers, it will mark the end of an era in English teaching.</p> <p>The novel is taking something of an enforced rest from the curriculum. In 2014, the then education secretary, Michael Gove, announced <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/may/25/mockingbird-mice-and-men-axed-michael-gove-gcse\">that British children should study British writers</a>, and so Steinbeck must make way for Austen, Dickens and Bronte from next year.</p> <p>There\u2019s nothing wrong with them, of course, but let\u2019s take a moment to mark the passing of a book which has been central to students\u2019 experience of English for well over a decade. The government was concerned that as many as 90% of young people study the novel. But as someone who has taught and examined Of Mice and Men more times than I care to remember, I\u2019d like to offer some reassurance. Yes, it is short, but everything you\u2019d want to teach a child about literature is there. Symbolism, structure, pathos, characterisation, imagery: it\u2019s got it all. More than that, the themes of hope, friendship, loyalty and vulnerability speak to students and their very modern concerns. The idea of choosing to believe that there is something better just around the corner, despite the horror of one\u2019s present circumstances, is very real especially for many from disadvantaged and difficult backgrounds.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Every single time you read the ending, you could hear a pin drop</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>I know I will not be the only one to have stood in front of a class of fairly tough teenagers, and marvelled at how they are transfixed by this story of two friends seeking to make a better life for themselves. They wince as Lennie, the kindly but vulnerable farm labourer, is subjected to bullying at the hands of Curley, the boss\u2019s son. They sneer and scoff at the \u201csluttish\u201d behaviour of Curley\u2019s wife, before realising that she too is fragile and insecure despite her confident exterior. They are shocked at the treatment of Crooks, the stable buck who is ostracised for his skin colour, and Candy, the swamper who is deemed too old to be of value. They quite enjoy the swearing. And every single time you read the ending, you could hear a pin drop.</p> <p>Maybe this is fanciful or naive, but I like to think that as they learn about how characters are more complex than they appear, so they learn that people are too. Maybe next time they have to deal with someone who is weaker than them, or who has been cast out by society, or who comes across badly, they\u2019ll call to mind the inhabitants of the Salinas Valley and pause before they react. </p> <p>I\u2019ve overseen the most fascinating discussions often sparked off by the most unlikely students. Students who have rarely taken much interest, suddenly form passionate views on the nature of friendship, or whether loyalty should have any limits. They want to talk about the extent to which ethnic minorities still metaphorically live in a space removed from mainstream society, or whether bullies ever win. Let\u2019s not kid ourselves, some of these students may not read many more books in their lives, and I\u2019m happy that this will have given at least some the experience of really engaging with literature and feeling its relevance.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/quiz/2014/may/29/mice-men-mockingbirds-gove-quiz\">Mice, men and mockingbirds: who said what? \u2013 quiz</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s true that Of Mice and Men has been a fixture of many English departments for a long time. I could pretty much recite the whole thing. But each cohort of students discovers the text anew, and I never tired of witnessing their reactions, or challenging their perceptions. We\u2019ll get there with Dickens too, but I suspect it\u2019ll be more of a struggle.</p> <p>It\u2019s worth saying, by the way, that the official position is that nothing has been banned and, while American texts no longer feature on the GCSE set text lists, schools are free to supplement this with any book they choose. I\u2019m sure English teachers will join me in suppressing a smirk at the idea that there would be time to luxuriate in reading non-compulsory books with a class who are facing more exams than any year 11 in recent history.</p> <p>So for now, George and Lennie must join Atticus Finch and Holden Caulfield at the back of the cupboard until another education secretary comes along and gives them a reprieve. Nothing lasts forever, and we will get used to the new changes in time. But I for one will miss them. </p> <ul> <li><em>Follow Ryan Wilson on Twitter <a href=\"http://twitter.com/rhwilson83\">@rhwilson83</a>.</em></li> </ul> <h2><strong>Follow us on Twitter via <a href=\"https://twitter.com/GuardianTeach\">@GuardianTeach</a>.

      "body": "<p>There\u2019s a riveting scene in the final act of <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/liam-scarlett\">Liam Scarlett</a>\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/productions/frankenstein-by-liam-scarlett\"><em>Frankenstein</em></a> where Elizabeth (<a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/laura-morera\">Laura Morera</a>), the young wife of Victor Frankenstein (<a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/federico-bonelli\">Federico Bonelli</a>), is left alone with the creature (<a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/steven-mcrae\">Steven McRae</a>) that her husband has created. Wide-eyed, almost fainting with dread, Morera allows herself to be led through a classical pas de deux. We know, and she knows, that at the dance\u2019s conclusion, the creature will kill her. McRae plays with Morera like a cat with a mouse, dancing between ironic courtesy and visceral savagery. We feel her terror, her blood turning to glue.</p> <p>This subversion of form, romantic dream into lethal nightmare, is pure gothic. Equal in their imaginative potency are the duets between McRae and Bonelli. Victor has brought the creature to life, but then, horrified by his creation, has abandoned him. With pitiful desperation, the creature begs his creator for kinship. McRae is all pleading, reptilian need, winding himself around Bonelli with quasi-erotic suggestiveness, and even after murdering half his family, seems to beg him to recognise their affinity.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"16d790f060aeb2a9ebe0d5a3812ca3380c8c11ea\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/16d790f060aeb2a9ebe0d5a3812ca3380c8c11ea/0_345_4812_2888/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A scene from Frankenstein at the Royal Opera House.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A scene from Frankenstein at the Royal Opera House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These exchanges, as technically accomplished as they are emotionally intense, show that Scarlett is a choreographer to be reckoned with. But, as previous works such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/may/18/serenade-sweet-violets-dgv-royal-ballet-review\"><em>Sweet Violets</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/nov/16/royal-ballet-age-of-anxiety-ceremony-of-innocence-aeternum-observer-review\"><em>The Age of Anxiety</em></a> have demonstrated, his narrative skills are not yet equal to his facility for dance-making. To turn Mary Shelley\u2019s novel into a vivid 21st-century ballet, and to do justice to its profound and elusive subtext, you need a more experienced directorial eye than Scarlett\u2019s.</p> <p>As it is, we\u2019re overwhelmed with exposition, family backstory and inconsequential set pieces which lock the work solid, so that it\u2019s almost an hour, or feels like it, before Victor even goes to university. The Frankenstein household\u2019s dancing domestic staff are a case in point: choreographically charming but contextually ludicrous \u2013 Shelley\u2019s novel contains not a suggestion of sentimentality \u2013 and a pointless brake on the action. The same is true of a tavern scene in Ingolstadt, featuring jaunty harlots culled lock, stock, and barrel from <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/apr/28/place-prize-mayerling-review\"><em>Mayerling</em></a> and <em>Romeo and Juliet</em> (balletgoers familiar with the works of Ashton and MacMillan will, to say the least, experience a strong sense of deja vu throughout <em>Frankenstein</em>).</p> <p>Meanwhile, Scarlett dashes past the moments in which the story\u2019s key themes are played out. <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/john-macfarlane\">John Macfarlane</a>\u2019s set for the university anatomy theatre is magnificent, and <a href=\"http://www.roh.org.uk/people/thomas-whitehead\">Thomas Whitehead</a>\u2019s mad, rationalist professor a terrifyingly grim creation. Much fun is had with dancing nurses nonchalantly arranging body parts. But Victor\u2019s creation of the monster, the point at which he symbolically abandons all notions of human and religious principle, is rushed. A bathetic, Jamie Oliver-style, bish-bash-bosh operation. There\u2019s no sense of the unholy grandeur and ghastliness of the event.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"fb9cd03313a220146975fec63889412dc623eea8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/fb9cd03313a220146975fec63889412dc623eea8/229_374_3052_3814/800.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Like a cat with a mouse\u2019: Steven McRae as the Creature with Laura Morera as Elizabeth.\" width=\"800\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Like a cat with a mouse\u2019: Steven McRae as the Creature with Laura Morera as Elizabeth.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Bonelli dances superbly, and is never less than an elegant presence. But he\u2019s always too busy doing things, whirled from scene to scene by the exigencies of the plot. We get no real sense of the morbidly obsessive egotism that drives him. McRae\u2019s creature fares better, as he is untrammelled by specious business, and is essentially all body-language. McRae\u2019s portrayal is brilliant; his dancing is eloquent in its anguish, and we sense every beat of his lonely, vengeful heart. We need him at the centre of the work, but until the last act he remains a marginal figure, skulking on the sidelines as we watch the only moderately interesting doings of the Frankenstein household. Morera, meanwhile, is a sympathetic and sensitive Elizabeth, but is permitted no character development beyond the continuous repetition of her devotion to Victor.</p> <p>None of this is enhanced by <a href=\"http://www.lowellliebermann.com/\">Lowell Liebermann</a>\u2019s score, which washes unmemorably over the action, offering the dancers little opportunity for sophisticated phrasing. It does, however, have the advantage that it can be freely cut, as it will need to be if <em>Frankenstein</em> is to be reanimated into a ballet of consequence. That the Royal Ballet has allowed Scarlett to get in so far over his head is reprehensible. He is unquestionably a great talent, but he is equally clearly not ready for a commission on this scale. Why, in the wake of <em>Sweet Violets</em>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2013/jun/02/raven-girl-review-itmoi\"><em>Raven Girl</em></a>, <em>The Age of Anxiety</em>, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/nov/01/royal-ballet-carmen-carlos-acosta-review-mixed-bill-viscera-afternoon-faun-tchaikovsky-pas-de-deux\"><em>Carmen</em></a> and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2016/feb/21/christopher-wheeldon-triple-bill-review-royal-ballet-strapless-after-the-rain-within-the-golden-hour\"><em>Strapless</em></a><em> \u2013 </em>all expensive failures \u2013 does the company not insist that its narrative choreographers are guided by experienced directors?

      "body": "<p>Winter may finally have thawed, sending us warily out into the scattered sunlight, but this week\u2019s DVD slate is an unseasonably interior affair \u2013 led by a pair of literal chamber pieces. In <strong>The Hateful Eight</strong> (EIV, 18), Agatha Christie proves an unexpected addition to Quentin Tarantino\u2019s long list of pop-thriller influences. Cramming its crusty ensemble of rogues in a snowbound Wyoming log cabin for the better part of three long hours, this bounty-hunter face-off amounts to a pressure cooker of post-civil war tension and resentment.</p> <p>As tangled backstories of vengeance and violation emerge between the eponymous octet of gunslingers, it\u2019s obvious that few will survive this cosy deathtrap. The game is in what order and formation they\u2019ll fall. Tarantino, for his part, doesn\u2019t seem that invested in the outcome: this ugly cat\u2019s cradle of murderous agendas serves as a mere hanging structure for his trademark bursts of extreme violence and extravagant verbiage. Tarantino cannot under-deliver in those departments, but this nonetheless feels stiff and passionless by his standards. Shot in gleaming 70mm Panavision and scored to shivering, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8977YNfJdBU\">Oscar-winning effect by Ennio Morricone</a>, the film elegantly exposes bloody reserves of American social and racial prejudice, and is too enamoured of its own lustrous cinematic surface to probe them.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s hard to turn away from Kristen Wiig\u2019s gutsy, last-nerve performance as a manic-depressive hermit</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s no spoiler to reveal that <strong>Room </strong>(StudioCanal, 15), Lenny Abrahamson and Emma Donoghue\u2019s effectively heart-clutching adaptation of the latter\u2019s Booker-shortlisted bestseller, leaves the confines of its four-walled purgatory sooner than Tarantino\u2019s claustrophobic epic. The trick of novel and film alike, however, is that it deftly escapes from one prison to another, expanded and contracted by the psychology of those who inhabit it \u2013 chiefly, the addled, raddled interior of Brie Larson\u2019s Joy, a teenage victim of abduction and rape who comes to live only for the child she never chose to have.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"41a59ac7378dbec0a70875083c8f404728f4fd14\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/41a59ac7378dbec0a70875083c8f404728f4fd14/144_0_6472_3884/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018A remarkable, often wrenching performance\u2019: Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay in Room.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A remarkable, often wrenching performance\u2019: Brie Larson and Jacob Tremblay in Room.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Donoghue\u2019s novel was inspired by the Josef Fritzl case, but eschewed lurid criminal detail, instead taking the perspective of Joy\u2019s five-year-old son, Jack \u2013 played here with canny emotional urgency by Canadian newcomer Jacob Tremblay. Despite some stray attempts with voiceover, the film can\u2019t quite replicate his rapt, stunted point of view; instead, it works best as a concentrated two-hander, with cinematographer Danny Cohen cornering Larson and Tremblay so tightly you can practically feel their breath on each other\u2019s faces. It\u2019s a remarkable, often wrenching, two-headed performance: Larson\u2019s best actress Oscar was hard earned, but the lack of corresponding recognition for Tremblay\u2019s fevered, alert co-playing hardly seems fair.</p> <p>If you\u2019re seeking lighter relief, you won\u2019t find it in <strong>A War</strong> (StudioCanal, 15), Danish director Tobias Lindholm\u2019s excellent investigation of an Afghanistan war commander on trial for accidental civilian fatalities \u2013 braided with a keenly observed war-at-home study of his wife\u2019s domestic exhaustion. Lindholm, previously responsible for the <em>Captain Phillips</em>-predating pirate drama <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/09/captain-phillips-enough-said-gloria-week-end-filth\"><em>A Hijacking</em></a>, is a rare film-maker indeed, one whose surging humanity never disrupts the quiet composure of his gaze. Composure isn\u2019t a strong suit of <strong>Welcome to Me </strong>(Precision Pictures, 15), a darkly jovial reality-TV satire that keeps trying comic tones on for size. Still, it\u2019s hard to turn away from Kristen Wiig\u2019s gutsy, last-nerve performance as a manic-depressive hermit financing her own chat show with a lottery windfall.</p> <p>On the documentary front, Amy Berg\u2019s <strong>Janis: Little Girl Blue </strong>(Dogwoof, 15) is the top DVD option. A conventionally constructed but engrossing account of Kozmic Blues queen Janis Joplin\u2019s tragically condensed rise and fall, it injects fresh perspective into a known downward spiral via extensive incorporation of Joplin\u2019s personal correspondence \u2013 liltingly voiced by Cat Power.</p> <p>Netflix, meanwhile, has <a href=\"http://www.netflix.com/WiPlayer?movieid=80039643\">a solemn corker</a> on offer in <strong>Welcome to Leith</strong>, a stark, frightening community portrait of a one-horse town in North Dakota that unwittingly becomes a congregation point for toxic white-supremacist factions. Directors Michael Beach Nichols and Christopher K Walker calmly tease out the agitation and terror felt by a population invaded by politics not their own. Against what is shaping up to be an aggressively polarised US presidential election, this is riveting viewing.</p>",

These slightly disjointed 15 tracks provide ample evidence of 360-degree skills, of house and funk steals, often undercut with the clattery skip of bass music. A woozy Anderson .Paak feature, Glowed Up, where beats fall a nanosecond out on purpose, is testament to hip-hop chops; there\u2019s also doses of post-Flying Lotus jazz, in the form of Weight Off (featuring BadBadNotGood).

It was written over four years, and charts a range of life experiences, but it is unavoidably the songs about the death of Cohen\u2019s wife, Peaches Geldof-Cohen, that form the album\u2019s emotional core. The largely acoustic Country Home is especially powerful, addressing the subject with such candour that you feel caught between applauding its courage and looking away. The intensity diminishes elsewhere, and there is some respite in the poppy, piano-assisted chorus of New Morning Comes, but no trite redemptive arc: this is a sensitive and subtle response to living with grief.</p>",

From Cambridge to Prague, through secret societies and gardens, an exclusive spa where dieters sleep themselves thin and a hotel no one ever checks out of, the breadth of Oyeyemi\u2019s imagination is impressive, teetering, as ever, on the edge of magical realism. Her use of fairytales, folklore and ghost stories is distinctly reminiscent of the work of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/angelacarter\" title=\"\">Angela Carter</a>, but the writer\u2019s messages here can be somewhat harder to decipher. Apt, then, that images of locks and keys \u2013 both actual and metaphorical \u2013 are threaded through each of the tales, reminding us that there\u2019s always more than meets the eye. Admittedly, some cast a less powerful spell than others, but as a rule any impenetrability is counterbalanced by inviting, luscious prose.</p> <p><em>What Is Yours Is Not Yours is published by Picador (\u00a314.99). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/387080/\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to order it for \u00a311.99</em></a></p>",

Created as part of an installation, it\u2019s a piece which would sit just as comfortably in a gallery as it does in a cinema. Rivers blends documentary and fiction \u2013 the first 40 minutes is an account of film-maker Oliver Laxe shooting a feature in the High Atlas mountains in Morocco, before Laxe becomes the protagonist of Rivers\u2019s own hallucinatory narrative.

      "body": "<p>The school where <a href=\"http://www.danejeremyhurst.com/\">Dane Hurst</a>, star of <a href=\"http://www.rambert.org.uk/\">Rambert dance company</a>, learned to dance was eaten by termites and burned down by children. Thirteen years after he left South Africa, he has returned to the junction of Gelvandale and Helenvale in Port Elizabeth to show me where it was.</p> <p>A childcare centre stands there now, locked behind breezeblocks and barbed wire. There\u2019s a TB clinic, an armoured post office, a liquor store and scrubby grass. A man emerges from an outbuilding and Dane introduces himself, tells him he\u2019s a dancer in the UK, but that he grew up here. The man, Justin, tells him about the gangs who roam these streets. He counts on his fingers: there are 18 gangs in the 1.5km from the old bus terminus to the house Dane grew up in. They\u2019ve had 50 gun deaths in the past three months \u2013 the latest a two-year old girl caught in crossfire. To my surprise Dane says that his uncle was recently killed just here while washing his car. \u201cOh man,\u201d smiles Justin. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing \u2013 small world.\u201d Neither man reveals any other feelings.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>What does a\u00a0child do in all this volatility? Well Dane, he danced</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Dane is as alert as a cat to sudden noises though: metal being sheared in a makeshift workshop, a car roaring by, whistles from a corner manned by drug dealers. What does a child do in all this volatility? Well Dane, he danced. He tells Justin he wants to share this with other young people who want to escape the streets. \u201cI\u2019ve recently bought a dance floor over in London and right now as we speak it\u2019s on a ship being sent back here.\u201d</p> <p>This floor is not just any floor: this is the former rehearsal floor of Rambert, sold when the dance company moved from Chiswick to its new home on London\u2019s South Bank. All the roles that Dane has danced for Rambert, he learned on this floor. Mark Baldwin, Rambert\u2019s artistic director, compares it to his desk blotter: \u201cYou can probably see all the tracings of the work that we\u2019ve done for the last 15 years,\u201d he says. To Dane, it\u2019s a foundation. The reinforced vinyl will soften young South Africans\u2019 landings; it\u2019s a shock absorber, protecting joints, and it withstands friction and heat.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"717dd3af478d43d1265da7b739101666d5fd50d9\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/717dd3af478d43d1265da7b739101666d5fd50d9/0_202_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Hurst back in South Africa, where he first discovered his love of dance.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Coming home: Hurst back in South Africa, where he first discovered his love of dance.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karl Schoemaker for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dane won best male dancer at the Critics\u2019 Circle Awards in 2014, just after he bought the floor. At the ceremony he announced his dream to use dance to empower the young in his home city, and he asked for help. Now his plans have grown. He approached the architect <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2002/aug/10/weekend.tomdyckhoff\">Adam Kalkin</a> to design a dance centre made out of shipping containers, for when there are funds to build it. The centre will house the floor. Port Elizabeth, as its name suggests, suits shipping containers. Dane looked out to sea as a child in Gelvandale. \u201cAll the houses are right on top of each other,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of chaos in the street, but whenever you look out you see the ocean and somehow in your heart it makes you feel OK.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>He saw a local boy crash through the termite-eaten floor and wanted to be that powerful</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>He chanced on ballet because his grandmother made costumes at the local dance school, the Toynbee Club. It was the time of apartheid. Gwen-Mary Wells, the ballet teacher, was white. She ignored segregation to teach in Gelvandale, which was designated a \u201ccoloured\u201d area. The Toynbee building swayed in the wind. People pelted it with stones. When pupils opened windows, the stone pelters stared at them through security wire. Yet for young Dane it was shelter. Sitting under Grandma Patty\u2019s sewing table, he watched another local boy \u2013 Warren \u2013 leaping out of sight. Once, Warren crashed through the termite-eaten floorboards and Dane wanted to be that powerful.</p> <p>Growing up, Dane was torn between several houses and parents who were both, at times, unemployed. House by house, Dane learned to contain himself. His mother, Maureen, lived north of the city in Booysen Park with Dane\u2019s three sisters, in a house only partly built when her marriage ended. Dane lived with his father\u2019s family in Gelvandale. His father fought his own demons. There was little food in anyone\u2019s cupboard, so dance was a release.</p> <p>Then Maureen took Dane to live with her and his sisters: a single mother with four children. They struggled for money. Dane felt guilty about his taxi fares back to Gelvandale for ballet class so he stopped, quickly losing the rigour and the freedom of living in the moment.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"7f98508fff0db85bc1cabf738a3680f85cea0d72\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/7f98508fff0db85bc1cabf738a3680f85cea0d72/0_202_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children in the township of Zwide, learning some dance moves with Hurst.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Dance is a sort of language that we use to make new friends\u2019: children in the township of Zwide, learning some dance moves with Hurst.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karl Schoemaker for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Instead, he tried to connect with the local kids, but he became caught up in a crowd who burned tyres and was hauled in by police and put into a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casspir\">Casspir truck</a> \u2013 one of the infamous symbols of apartheid oppression. He knew that he needed to do what Warren had done \u2013 to take flight. He went back to live at his father\u2019s so he could dance. One day he caught his mother watching him through a hole in the Toynbee Club wall, desperate for a sight of him. He ran after her. She fled. Dane focused. He won competitions. Gwen-Mary Wells guarded his winnings for him. His ambition was to escape abroad.</p> <p>SPRING 2015. Dane is in Kensington, west London, explaining to Lady Sainsbury his plan to take the floor back home , and to ask her for help. \u201cCan you show me the right direction?\u201d he asks. She has a photograph, dated April 1993, to show Dane. In it, she is dancing with Nelson Mandela at a private party in Johannesburg. She asks Dane what Mandela is doing with his fists.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>In the dance studio what colour you are means nothing. When music plays there are no barriers</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Dane explains that Mandela is doing a joyous Toyi-Toyi, a dance of African freedom. Decades earlier, Sainsbury had been a ballerina with <a href=\"http://www.sadlerswells.com/\">Sadler\u2019s Wells ballet</a>. Moments before the photograph was taken, she\u2019d had a discussion with Mandela where they agreed that, now that apartheid was ending, they could renew the flow of South African dancers to the UK. She would raise funds for exceptional students to train at the Rambert School. Warren Adams, the dancer who inspired Dane, won an early scholarship. Dane got one of the last. Adams is a Broadway choreographer now. When Dane tells Warren about his plans for the dance floor, Warren says: \u201cThat\u2019s modest!\u201d</p> <p>Dane tells Warren about a studio made out of shipping containers and Warren slows. \u201cWow, that\u2019s\u2026 ambitious,\u201d he says.</p> <p>\u201cI know it\u2019s crazy,\u201d says Dane.</p> <p>Warren: \u201cCrazy wins every time.\u201d</p> <p>Rambert has been Dane\u2019s family while he\u2019s been in Britain. At just 32, he is risking a lot to leave. He last danced with Rambert in Edinburgh last November. Until he\u2019d had this idea, being a dancer was his one wild dream: \u201cMost people say you must be crazy to leave a job. I feel like my heart is overpowering my mind. I\u2019ve grown up in the company, but like all relationships you have to step away from the household. Now\u2019s the time.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3862a2bb1c61557ac9a018a1fd672818b0ea088f\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3862a2bb1c61557ac9a018a1fd672818b0ea088f/0_202_6016_3611/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Children in Dane's dance workshop\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Far reaching: the workshops aim to give the children a way to survive that isn\u2019t violent.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Karl Schoemaker for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>By the time we are standing on the corner where he learned to dance, it\u2019s April and the dance floor is on a ship called Presence, heading south. Dane has established an organisation called the Moving Assembly Project and launched a pilot project in Port Elizabeth: two weeks of workshops at the Ubuntu Health and Education Centre in the township of Zwide. Ubuntu was established to help children affected by HIV, but it is open to all.</p> <p>Outside is red-stone ground, scorched metal, corrugated roofs, litter. Shipping containers serve <em>vetkoek</em> burgers or advertise diamond and gold exchange. Inside, the children are encouraged to make a noise and support each other.</p> <p>Dane has invited <a href=\"http://estelamerlos.blogspot.co.uk/\">Estela Merlos</a>, another ex-Rambert dancer, to Africa to help him teach. The atmosphere is lively.</p> <p>Fifty children are learning a dance. One of them, Ayabonga Mayinje, fights the smile that comes over him with the music. Sesethu Budaza doesn\u2019t fight his; he\u2019s grinning. Lebogang Gobodo gracefully pushes air away. \u201cDance is some sort of language that we use to make new friends,\u201d says Amanda Coko, putting her actions into words.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"9b1e908ca72f99e376e823afb1ad927726811cdf\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b1e908ca72f99e376e823afb1ad927726811cdf/937_23_2109_3007/701.jpg\" alt=\"Hurst dancing in Rambert\u2019s Transfigured Night by Kim Brandstrup last November.\" width=\"701\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Taking the stage: Hurst in Rambert\u2019s Transfigured Night by Kim Brandstrup last November.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Tristram Kenton for the Guardian</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Most of the children speak Xhosa, some Sotho. Being mixed race, Dane resents that he was only allowed to learn \u201cthe colonial languages of Afrikaans and English\u201d, but says \u201cdance makes me feel part of the world. In a dance studio your language means nothing, what colour you are means nothing. When music plays there are no barriers.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cDancing is talking a lot of things,\u201d adds Gobisa Siwisa, another of the children. \u201cOne day I was washing dishes in the kitchen. Then I was making some moves and mother says, \u2018What you dancing, I don\u2019t believe it!\u2019\u201d A week ago, the students were themselves suspicious about the workshops. But who doesn\u2019t want to dance?</p> <p>In their lunch hour they cavort to Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z. Now they\u2019re feeling something more concentrated take shape. They dance duets, take each other\u2019s weight, gently, without embarrassment. A feisty girl who lip-reads dances sideways on, following the others. Dane stands like a prince.</p> <p>The success of the Ubuntu workshops augurs well for further workshops in the rural township of Grahamstown and in Durban, and for the entire future of Dane\u2019s dream.

This bold claim is amply proven in an account of dazzling transparency, dance-like rhythms and utter clarity. Sometimes the balance seems not quite right, for example when organ continuo dominates, but some superb ensemble numbers pit voices against virtuosic instruments so each seems to outdo the other in joyous exuberance. The five soloists complement each other well, and the addition of just five extra singers is all that is needed to explode Bach\u2019s universal vision into life.</p>",

But her voice as a film-maker is very much her own. <em>Evolution</em> takes place in a seaside hamlet populated entirely by young boys and their older female carers. The community is dominated by a doomy concrete medical facility on a nearby headland, to which the boys are all sent \u201cto be cured\u201d. When one of the children discovers the body of another boy in the sea, he starts to suspect that he and the others are being fed lies, along with the muddy-looking elver porridge that the women serve up at every meal. There are similarities to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2011/feb/13/never-let-me-go-review-ishiguro\" title=\"\"><em>Never Let Me Go</em></a>, but the oblique oddness of the film most closely resembles Had\u017eihalilovi\u0107\u2019s earlier picture, in which girls in a boarding school are groomed for some unspecified but undoubtedly sinister fate. Had\u017eihalilovi\u0107 is a brilliant visual stylist. There is something about her gaze which is as remorseless as nature itself, even as the worlds she depicts are often macabre and unnatural. She uses colour eloquently \u2013 dull seaweed greens provide contrast for the vivid red of a starfish and the boy\u2019s clothes. The casting is equally effective. The women have the guileless pallor of Vermeer portraits, which, given the imagery that unfolds, makes them unbearably creepy to watch.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXf8VS6iK_g\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QXf8VS6iK_g?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QXf8VS6iK_g\">Watch the trailer for Evolution. </a></figcaption> </figure>",

But every so often, it stumbles upon a moment of emotional truth. Tom Hiddleston, in the central role, bears a passing resemblance to the singer. But he is so focused on recreating Williams\u2019s mannerisms that he fails to connect with the man in the way that Joaquin Phoenix managed as Johnny Cash in the similarly formulaic but superior <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2006/feb/05/3\" title=\"\"><em>Walk the Line</em></a>.

In the 1930s, the accordionist Tony Murena\u2019s hybrid of American jazz and French musette vied for popularity with the music of Django Reinhardt and St\u00e9phane Grappelli. A virtuoso of the instrument, he toured major concert halls throughout Europe and South America. Listening to him today, you sometimes wish he\u2019d take it easy on the virtuosity and give music more of a chance, but it\u2019s impressive nevertheless. He sounds happier with triple time than the four-in-a-bar of swing, but among these <a href=\"http://www.milanmusic.fr/catalogue/1380\" title=\"\">27 short tracks</a> there\u2019s the fastest version of Count Basie\u2019s Jumpin\u2019 at the Woodside I\u2019ve ever heard.

Now 29, he has delivered a handsome traditional album in <em>Hearts Broken</em>, its eight antique songs given modern treatments built on the punchy bass playing of producer Duncan Lyall, with brass, electronica and even beatbox in the mix. Henderson is foremost a uillean piper, and he makes his pipes and whistles wail and rock on tracks like Two Brothers, but his singing also brings a brooding intensity to murder ballads like Young Edmund or the loping Lovely Nancy. Splendid.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Here is <a href=\"http://www.hughbonneville.uk/\">Hugh Bonneville</a>, the amiably stuffy dad of <em>Downton</em>, cast as a man who denounces his town and its inhabitants. He declares them reeking with corruption. Here is <a href=\"https://www.cft.org.uk/whats-on/event/an-enemy-of-the-people\"><strong>An Enemy of the People</strong></a> showing once again that it shifts its emphasis with each production. In Howard Davies\u2019s production, the central figure looks like the prototype of all 21st-century whistleblowers. He also looks like a figure driven by sibling rivalry.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/culture/ibsen\">Ibsen</a> wrote his 1882 play in response to the drubbing he had got for <em>Ghosts</em>. It\u2019s easy to think of it as a straightforward story of one truth-teller against convention: for \u201cenemy\u201d read \u201chero\u201d. This is how <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/feb/23/theatre-archive-roy-hattersley-meets-arthur-miller\">Arthur Miller</a> saw it when in 1951 he stripped \u201cthe dull green tones of Victorianism\u201d from the play and made of it a magnificent clarion call. Yet one of the arresting things about Ibsen\u2019s play is the complication of its central figure. <a href=\"https://literature.britishcouncil.org/writer/christopher-hampton\">Christopher Hampton</a>\u2019s subtle 1997 version, used here, shows him as both principled and preposterous.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Bonneville is well-equipped to register amiable joshing and puckered anxiety</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Stockmann, a medical officer, seeks to expose the pollution of the municipal spa, which brings prosperity to his town. He is at first supported by the local press and town worthies. But his brother, the mayor, pointing out that everyone\u2019s living will go down the drain if the baths close, turns journalists and public opinion against him. At which point Stockmann rounds on townspeople and dignitaries. Early translations had him talking about breeding \u2013 common curs versus refined poodles \u2013 and got Ibsen suspected of fascism. Hampton\u2019s version speaks more insinuatingly about levels of intelligence.</p> <p>Bonneville is well equipped to register amiable joshing and puckered anxiety. He is less persuasive at rendering passionate commitment and despair. I did not believe he had ever spent a morning scowling over lab results. I did believe in his childish self-satisfaction and false modesty. Don\u2019t, he dimples, think of having a torchlight procession in my honour.</p> <p>Davies\u2019s production brings out something that runs throughout as a dark, subterranean seam. The intense rivalry between the two brothers is cleverly thrown into contrast here by the merry behaviour of Stockmann\u2019s own two sons. In the early scenes, Bonneville and William Gaminara\u2019s finely slippery mayor are too stately with each other. But skittishness breaks through. Bonneville gives little leaps at his conquests. An episode in which he discovers his brother\u2019s staff of office is turned into a nimble display of mockery.</p> <p>The disappointment is that the production is not more taut. Davies has excelled at putting a society \u2013 its dilemmas and its intricate fabric \u2013 on stage. Yet, despite a lively performance by Alice Orr-Ewing as Stockmann\u2019s daughter, the first half ambles. The crucial confrontation with the crowd is wooden, with off-the-peg ordinary people muttering in headscarves and felt hats up and down the aisles. Ibsen\u2019s questions are made clear but not forcefully embodied.</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.cft.org.uk/whats-on/event/an-enemy-of-the-people\">\u2022 An Enemy of the People is at the Chichester Festival theatre until 21 May</a></p>",

While there has not been a significant change in bulk billing rates, GPs have absorbed [the rebate freeze], they\u2019ve absorbed it for a period of time,\u201d he said.</p> <p>The RACGP\u2019s campaign is similar to the one run by the AMA since the 2014 budget, after the Abbott government tried to introduce mandatory $7 GP co\u2011payments, and a $5 cut to GP rebates.</p> <p>The health minister, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/sussan-ley\">Sussan Ley</a>, says the extension is necessary because of \u201cthe current fiscal environment\u201d.</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Bafta and <em>Evening Standard</em> award-winning playwright <a href=\"https://twitter.com/royboywilliams\">Roy Williams</a>, 48, grew up in Notting Hill, west London, the youngest of four born to Jamaican parents. His father left for America when he was two. When he started messing around at school, his mother hired a tutor for him who also ran a black theatre company. Williams later did a degree in theatre writing at <a href=\"https://www.bruford.ac.uk/\">Rose Bruford College</a>. His plays mine the politics of the everyday: racism, poverty, teen pregnancy, stupid violence \u2013 from <em>Sing Yer Heart for the Lads</em> (2002) to <em>Fallout</em> (2003), inspired by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/uk/lawrence\">Stephen Lawrence</a>\u2019s murder, and the boxing drama <em>Sucker Punch</em> (2010). His new play, <a href=\"http://www.hackneyempire.co.uk/5241/shows/soul-a-new-play-by-roy-williams.html?gclid=CI_gl-Ggw8wCFcsW0wodqyEE3w\"><em>Soul</em></a>, explores the final days of the Motown singer Marvin Gaye, and his relationship with the father who shot him dead when he was 43. </p> <p><strong>When did you first hear Marvin Gaye\u2019s music? </strong><br />It would have been <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rjlSiASsUIs\">Sexual Healing</a> in 1982. Basically my hormones were talking! I went on a school cruise \u2013 40 inner-city schoolboys visiting places in the Mediterranean \u2013 and there was this one girl from another school that I really fancied. There was a disco and I danced to Sexual Healing with her. Then two years later this shocking story came out about him getting shot by his dad. I remember finding it very hard to comprehend that a man could kill his own son. It planted a lot of seeds in my head, though it took years before they got shaken out.</p> <p><strong>This is your first play about a real-life character. </strong><br />I was approached in 2010 to write a drama about Marvin by a documentary-maker. He put me in touch with <a href=\"http://jamesdacre.com/\">James Dacre</a> who had just directed <em>The Mountaintop</em> about Martin Luther King. And that\u2019s when I started seriously looking into Gaye\u2019s relationship with his dad. And it caused me to come away with a level of compassion for his dad, and Marvin too. Obviously no one can excuse what he did but there were unusual circumstances that led to his death.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Sometimes I feel chained to the fact that I have my father's name; even when he\u2019s not here, he has an influence on me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>You travelled to New York to meet Gaye\u2019s sisters, Jeanne and Zeola? </strong><br />I was hoping they\u2019d help \u2013 and my God, they did. The first question I asked them was: \u201cWhat was it like having Marvin Gaye as a brother?\u201d Because he wasn\u2019t just famous, he was colossal. And they revealed a lot about growing up with him, the family situation they went through. They were very honest. It was almost like they just needed to tell. Because their perspective hasn\u2019t been documented as much as Marvin\u2019s relationship with Berry Gordy of Motown, or his wife. And that struck a chord with me: who really cares about the siblings of famous people? No one.</p> <p><strong><em>Soul</em> is not a jukebox musical but you have the coup of Gaye\u2019s close collaborator Gordon Banks writing music for the play. </strong><br />Yes, he worked with him in his later years as a session guy, and he was also married to Zeola. He\u2019s going to do some original music for us.</p> <p><strong>A lot of your plays have absent or complex fathers. </strong><br />I didn\u2019t get to meet my father until I was 39, when I finally decided to bite the bullet and go and see him, because he lives in America. I would never compare myself to Marvin but it\u2019s interesting that he was named after his father, as was I. Something was driving him, and although he and his father had the most awful relationship, there was love there. But also frustrated love, because they didn\u2019t know how to articulate it. And there\u2019s a thin line between love and hate. I had an almost nonexistent relationship with my father, but I was named after him as well \u2013 so sometimes I feel chained to the fact that I have his name; even when he\u2019s not here, he\u2019s having an influence on me.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOS4rVsJWDc\"                                                                        > <iframe width=\"460\" height=\"259\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AOS4rVsJWDc?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe> <figcaption> </figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>Several of your plays have transferred to America. </strong><br />Yes, <em>Sucker Punch</em> was done twice, which I\u2019m thrilled about. The themes seem to strike a chord in the light of things that have been happening there in the last couple of years such as the whole \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/19/blacklivesmatter-birth-civil-rights-movement\">I Can\u2019t Breathe</a>\u201d movement and the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/trayvon-martin\">Trayvon Martin</a> situation. I think people think, Yeah, I can relate to that, that\u2019s been happening here as well. It\u2019s also a chance for them to understand what\u2019s going on for black Britons over here, which I think they know very little about.</p> <p><em>Soul is at </em><a href=\"http://www.royalandderngate.co.uk/Productions/290220/282700/Soul\"><em>Royal &amp; Derngate</em></a><em>, Northampton, 20 May-11 June, and </em><a href=\"http://www.hackneyempire.co.uk/5241/shows/soul-a-new-play-with-music-by-roy-williams.html\"><em>Hackney Empire</em></a><em>, London, 15 June-3 July </em></p>",

One actually wants to go to what may have been, back then in 1924, the most sulphurous, mephitic place on this black Earth: impossible smokestacks loom and belch, dizzying aqueducts sail the high, dark sky. It\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/mar/15/metropolis-fritz-lang-philip-french-classic-dvd\">Fritz Lang\u2019s <em>Metropolis</em></a> given a greasy coat of toxic tar; and it\u2019s venal, and my, it\u2019s exciting.</p> <p>This is how CGI wizards establish, viscerally, the world of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b079vtpm\"><strong>Peaky Blinders</strong></a>, which opened its third season run with an episode typically full of style and pride, of grit and of blood. The Shelby brothers \u2013 chiefly Tommy, courtesy of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/sep/24/cillian-murphy-interview-peaky-blinders-ballyturk\">Cillian Murphy</a> and the mesmerisingly perfect planes of that face \u2013 now rule the city, the police force, the bookies and the boondocks: as one Blinder observed, though carefully out of earshot: \u201cThey\u2019ll make him the fucking lord mayor next.\u201d And well they might: Tommy is trying to go straight, or as straight as Tommy can go, planning to buy a wharf in Boston, heart set on his own bit of lily-white-legal Brummie globalising. He\u2019ll be hampered only by his own past and, perhaps more crucially, his own personality, which no man can escape, and has made also the possibly fatal (and unaccountable) error of marrying Grace (Annabelle Wallis). So pretty, so perfect, so vacuously insipid she could drive a monk, through sheer itchy boredom, to fevered genocide. Despite the ragtime, the cocaine, the cocktails, the trappings, everyone is scared. Even Tommy is scared enough to take on a nasty strike-breaking job on behalf of the White Russians and the British establishment, thus adding to the burthens on brother Arthur, still fighting so many wars on so many fronts, now faced with ideological betrayal.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Perry makes a great companion: lucid and unafraid to show his intelligence, nor to expect the same of his interviewees</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>This terrific series has many strengths, not least the music \u2013 perfectly suited interjections from Nick Cave, from Radiohead \u2013 but one standout is the unflinching way in which it contrasts the worlds of power and money with the grubby, ripped fingernails of appalling violence necessary to achieve them. So Arthur saunters out undaunted, in jazzy slo-mo, at the very end, but three minutes earlier he had been grappling for his life with a Russian infiltrator: what should have been a mundane murder was suddenly eye-gougingly awful, with finger-biting, spat blood, popping cartilage, the tearful, begging grunts of desperate men; genuinely shocking. The biggest action franchise in the world, 007, took half a century to do this, to admit that violent men do violent things, with <em>Skyfall</em>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3959f9535a5839c68c1ff62ac8b26dfb6a53a90a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3959f9535a5839c68c1ff62ac8b26dfb6a53a90a/0_150_2000_1200/1000.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Immensely watchable\u2019: Grayson Perry, who explored masculinity in his new series All Man.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Immensely watchable\u2019: Grayson Perry, who explored masculinity in his new series All Man.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/grayson-perry\">Grayson Perry</a> joined a very particular bunch of violent men, cage fighters from the north-east, for the start of his immensely watchable new three-part series, <a href=\"http://www.channel4.com/programmes/grayson-perry-all-man?promo=coming_soon\"><strong>All Man</strong></a>. He didn\u2019t join them in his trademark little-girl dress, but the geordie lads were so grounded, and Perry himself such an appealing personality, that it would have raised scarcely an eyebrow. Perry bigged up his own \u201clifelong sissiness\u201d \u2013 utterly separate from his transvestism, a distinction that might elude lesser souls than the wise tattooed heads he was addressing \u2013 in an effort to explore just why these guys needed to be so tough. \u201cWhy do you guys need to be so <em>tough</em>?\u201d he asked, almost toughly.</p> <p>The answers he touched on, in this ostensible exploration of contemporary confused masculinity, gave pause for thought. The fighters, who don\u2019t really have to be tough in the way the peaky blinders had to be tough (in order to not get killed), all had nonetheless a Zen-like approach to training, and a highly developed sense that the banter, the bravado, even the tattoos, were all a \u201cskin\u201d, a costume, and as such to be taken less than seriously. They exuded, in fact, a thoughtful approach to modern male life, which delighted and confused Grayson Perry in equal measure \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m almost holding up cage fighters as an example of touchy-feely man.\u201d Might they be better equipped for the modern male world, having embraced and explored violence and discovered true answers come harder than that, than many contemporaries, left without jobs in a post-industrial north, but still silent, closed, unadaptable? As Perry said: \u201cWhen they need to change, to be flexible and emotionally resilient, they struggle; the carapace, the shutters, don\u2019t flex.\u201d The young male suicide statistics for the area told their own story.</p> <p>Perry\u2019s artworks, in reaction to his visit, were a labour intent on heartfelt tribute. They were also quietly brilliant. A miners\u2019 banner, and an urn, representing \u201ca folk-art requiem for a certain type of man\u201d. They were unveiled after the miners\u2019 gala in Durham Cathedral; a sombre and male affair, and this cross-dressing potter was accorded the fiercest of welcomes. Unusually poignant, and Perry makes a great companion: lucid and unafraid to show his intelligence, nor to expect the same of his interviewees.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86387eb85a29e645d192b48ca686216c0375e96b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86387eb85a29e645d192b48ca686216c0375e96b/60_0_1800_1080/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Dr James Fox in front of one of Julie Brook\u2019s Firestacks in the \u2018fascinating\u2019 Forest, Field &amp; Sky: Art Out of Nature.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Dr James Fox in front of one of Julie Brook\u2019s Firestacks in the \u2018fascinating\u2019 Forest, Field &amp; Sky: Art Out of Nature.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Some remarkable art, too, in the inelegantly titled <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b079ckkf/forest-field-sky-art-out-of-nature\"><strong>Forest, Field &amp; Sky: Art Out of Nature</strong></a>, in which art historian Dr James Fox led us round some of our landscape\u2019s finest collisions and collusions with mankind. There was much beauty here, in the attempts by highly individual artists to work wholly with nature, often spending lifetimes doing so. David Nash\u2019s <em>Ash Dome</em>, its location as (remarkably) secret today as in 1978, in which the artist trained and finagled Welsh trees to grow in an exceedingly lovely way; <a href=\"http://www.juliebrook.com/\">Julie Brook</a>\u2019s Jura <em>Firestack</em>, stone circles on the littoral with driftwood fires that burn until the tides bury them; Charles Jencks\u2019s landscapes; <a href=\"http://jamesturrell.com/\">James Turrell</a>\u2019s skyspaces. What I (think I) learned: a cultural act can be the placement of a pebble on a beach, and art allows us to feel part of the universe but separate from it, which might be as good a definition as any of what partitions us from the animals.</p> <p>It was fascinating, even if at times the portentous voiceover \u2013 \u201cthis art, like nature, in perpetual change\u201d; \u201csince the dawn of\u2026\u201d \u2013 had me wanting to quote Mr Burns in <em>The Simpsons</em>: \u201cEver since the beginning of time, man has yearned to destroy the sun.\u201d</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f0012386f204a741cff7090fca88b6a14eccf9ac\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f0012386f204a741cff7090fca88b6a14eccf9ac/0_192_5760_3456/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Julia Louis-Dreyfus (Selina Meyer) in Veep\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Julia Louis-Dreyfus (Selina Meyer) in Veep.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: HBO</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>On that same side of the Atlantic, <a href=\"https://www.sky.com/watch/channel/sky-atlantic/veep\"><strong>Veep</strong></a> returned, joyously.

      "body": "<p>If you spend some of your time writing about newspapers, then the more of them there are to write about the merrier. So the <em>New Day </em><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/feb/21/new-day-trinity-mirror-cut-price-i\" title=\"\">got a cautiously benign welcome at launch</a> two months ago. Even if you didn\u2019t think a cheap and determinedly cheerful paper for lapsed female readers was a real bet, rather than a fresh folly of market research, you hoped you were wrong.</p> <p>But old, residual doubts did for that <em>New Day</em> last week. It was selling maybe 30,000 \u2013 not the 200,000 planned. It was utterly inconspicuous. It didn\u2019t do stories that might get it noticed. It was cheap but not cheerful.</p> <p>Blame Simon Fox and the Trinity Mirror managers behind this flop? That\u2019s natural, and probably unavoidable. Look at the last ABC-audited national sales figures: the <em>Mirror</em>, down 12.66% in a year, the <em>Sunday Mirror</em>, down 14.34%, and the <em>People</em>, down 15.59%, are the three worst performers right along old Fleet Street.</p> <p>Well, of course, the future is digital, you may say: and <em>Mirror</em> figures are better there. So they are too, modestly, across Trinity\u2019s local paper empire. But newsprint nationals \u2013 including the <em>New Day</em> \u2013 tell a different story: of titles cut and cut so they can\u2019t come again, of a failure of nerve and vision.</p> <p>It\u2019s back to the basic question that\u2019s lingered ever since Trinity bought the <em>Mirror </em>some 17 years ago. Can the monopoly operators of our local press compete against Murdoch, Desmond et al on a national stage where brashness and boldness matter? Answer: alas, it would still seem not. And don\u2019t just write this failure off as some further triumph for digital potency. This <em>New Day</em>, as conceived, run and promoted, would have died from the same palsy any day in the last 100 years.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Last week, on World Press Freedom Day, we paused to salute the scores of journalists around the world who have died to tell their stories since May 2015. This week there\u2019s a chance to examine this problem more forensically in a new book, <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/413679/\" title=\"\"><em>Reporting Dangerously</em></a> (Palgrave Macmillan, \u00a319.99). It\u2019s a masterwork of testimony and facts from Simon Cottle, Richard Sambrook and Nick Mosdell; its size and scope offer a chance to be more thoughtful.</p> <p>For reporters and editors don\u2019t all live in war zones. Almost twice as many die in non-conflict areas \u2013 poor, desperate countries where crime spirals unchecked and impunity blankets violence. Take two of the world\u2019s hardest cases, Mexico and Brazil. A 2010 report to US Congress estimated that 22,000 Mexicans had died in drug-related violence over the previous four years. It\u2019s a toll that goes on and on (killing journalists along the way).</p> <p>But why do we \u2013 and Mexico \u2013 hear so little of it? A reporter explains: \u201cWe get a call from citizens that there\u2019s been a murder on street corner X. If we call the police, they say there\u2019s nothing. The ambulance service says there\u2019s nothing. The citizens are watching the police at the scene examine the body or see the body go into the coroner\u2019s van. The coroner says they have no information \u2013 so there\u2019s no story. There was no murder on street corner X.\u201d</p> <p>And Brazil, if you\u2019re thinking of an Olympic summer, is much the same: only one in 10 murders solved. A recent report tallies 321 cases of murder, kidnapping, assault and harassment of journalists, with the toll continually rising. And the impact is lethal, in turn. Because no one properly charts the killings, often far out of town, no one in the big cities registers their impact.</p> <p>It\u2019s as though the worst wasn\u2019t happening. Impunity covers sloth and corruption. There is no one dying to tell the story because, in hard terms, there is no story.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Dragging on his American-brand cigarette, Rami al-Khatib leans back and looks away. There is a wry smile but it hints at a bubbling frustration. I have asked him whether he feels optimistic about the future. \u201cThere are two questions you should never ask a Syrian,\u201d he says, \u201cand that\u2019s one of them.\u201d</p> <p>From behind a wisp of smoke, Khatib, 29, a law student at Damascus university before the conflict, adds: \u201cThe other is: where do you see yourself in five years\u2019 time?\u201d The young Syrian\u2019s disdain at the line of questioning is understandable. Khatib was born in the now infamous city of Palmyra, where Isis massacred hundreds and where Vladimir Putin last week emphasised his role in winning it back for the regime by <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/may/05/palmyra-amphitheatre-hosts-russian-concert-after-recapture-by-syrian-forces\">staging a classical concert in its ruins</a>. Brought up in Homs, Khatib helped with the 2014 evacuation and watched as snipers picked off women walking through the rubble. He still has family in the city.</p> <p>It was only because a guard at an Assad regime checkpoint recognised his mother as one of his former teachers that Khatib\u2019s increasingly desperate parents were able to escape Isis. His 15-year-old sister had been told by an Islamist fighter that she and her father would be lashed the next time he saw her. \u201cShe was covering everything but he was asking her to cover properly,\u201d Khatib says. \u201cShe had never worn the hijab before, you know.\u201d</p> <p>He lightens briefly while talking about a \u201cfriendly\u201d regime sniper in Homs who, when his shift came, would aim his bullets into the walls behind them rather than take a life. \u201cHe was a good guy \u2013 although I never actually saw him.\u201d</p> <p>But talk of optimism and the future can\u2019t come easily when you have lost countless friends and family in a chaotic, genocidal conflict. Deaths in Syria total more than 470,000, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/feb/11/report-on-syria-conflict-finds-115-of-population-killed-or-injured\">according to the Syrian Centre for Policy Research</a>. One in 10 of the country\u2019s population has been killed or injured since the crisis erupted in March 2011. Khatib has been told his friendly sniper is dead now, too.</p> <p>Meanwhile the political and military situation is dire. Isis holds huge swaths of land in the east of the country, while the regime, with the help of Russian air power, is advancing from the west and through the middle, swirling around the key opposition stronghold, Aleppo, along with the loosely pro-regime Kurds. They are all eating into opposition territory, which in itself is controlled by armed groups ranging from the moderate Free Syrian Army to the al-Qaida-affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra, and every flavour of Islamism in between.</p> <p>It is a bloody, unfathomable mess. And the ceasefire that brought a little respite has now broken. In a new low, Bashar al-Assad\u2019s air force was accused on Thursday of bombing a refugee camp on the Syrian side of the Turkish border, killing dozens. Yet Khatib, quick to smile, and keen to talk to about the wonder of Palmyra before the war, does, miraculously, hold out some hope. For all the debate about the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/mar/09/uk-passes-bill-law-aid-target-percentage-income\">UK\u2019s pledge to spend 0.7% of its national income on development</a>, he suggests British taxpayers should know that his hope has much to do with them.</p> <p>Khatib is one of 26 people, including 18 Syrians, working in the south-eastern Turkish city of Gaziantep, 30 miles from the Syrian border, on a <a href=\"http://www.project-tamkeen.org/\">British-government- funded development programme called Tamkeen</a>, the Arabic word for empowerment. A further 76 Syrians working for the programme live in Syria itself, in 38 communities across four opposition-held provinces: Idlib and Aleppo in the north-west, and the southern areas of Deraa and Rif Damascus, the province that hosts the capital city, and where opposition-held parts are currently under siege from the Assad regime.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/gaziantep-map/giv-12515Oc4dIZsmztmL/\" data-alt=\"Gaziantep's position in Turkey close to the Syrian border.\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/uploader/embed/2016/05/gaziantep-map/giv-12515Oc4dIZsmztmL/\">Gaziantep's position in Turkey close to the Syrian border.</a> <figcaption>Gaziantep\u2019s position in Turkey close to the Syrian border.</figcaption> </figure>  <p>\u201cThey can\u2019t go in and out of Rif Damascus so we have never met any of the people we work with there; it is always over Skype,\u201d says Lejla Catic, programme manager.</p> <p>Launched in 2013, and run by development consultants Adam Smith International, Tamkeen is different to anything else being funded by the global community in Syria. It is the first programme to combine the provision of aid \u2013 in the form of schools, hospitals and services as basic as waste management and water treatment \u2013 with the perilous job of trying to create the foundation for legitimate government in a war zone. In short, it is building democracy from the bottom up. And doing it as the bombs fall.</p> <p>Tamkeen field officers in Syria set up committees of up to 11 local notables and professionals in rural areas, villages, towns or cities. Each committee services a community of between 30,000 and 100,000 people.</p> <p>In opposition areas, rather scrappy, often corrupt, local administrative councils have popped up to try to keep basic services running, and so at least one of those councillors will sit on their local Tamkeen committee.</p> <p>The inclusion of at least one woman is a target but where it is impractical, because of the often deeply conservative culture in some parts of the opposition-held territory, a subcommittee of women is established \u2013 there are parts of Syria where women are not allowed to leave their homes unescorted.</p> <p>The Tamkeen committee is then offered a menu of project options to be funded from HQ in Gaziantep. But the funding \u2013 from the UK\u2019s Department for International Development (DfID)and the EU \u2013 only comes if principles of \u201cparticipation, transparency and accountability\u201d can be shown to have been adopted. The hoops to be jumped through will be familiar to any English local authority.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"3f36af241da0c43f4571d319592ad3db91f61f7b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/3f36af241da0c43f4571d319592ad3db91f61f7b/0_357_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Members of Tamkeen, an NGO funded by Britain and the EU attempting to introduce democratic structures in Syria.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Members of Tamkeen, an NGO funded by Britain and the EU attempting to introduce democratic structures in Syria.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Notables on the committee have to talk to the people they presume to serve. They must ask them about their priorities and needs through surveys, at public meetings, via Facebook pages and by addressing people after Friday prayer. The women\u2019s subcommittee must be allowed to make its own decisions and have its interests pursued.</p> <p>Once a project proposal from the community is approved in Turkey, the locals then have to establish a procurement plan \u2013 showing how they will get the best price for the materials and work to be done.</p> <p>And as the projects get under way, they must update their community about what is being done through monthly reports, videos on Facebook and regular public meetings. Comment boxes are set up and feedback must be pursued. The project should be completed in nine months, and after that it is passed to the local council to maintain.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Once a pit stop on the silk road trade route, Gaziantep is now a key stop on the jihadi highway</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It is, Tamkeen\u2019s advocates say, everything that development work in Iraq and Afghanistan has not been. This isn\u2019t throwing money at powerful players, hoping that their warlord reputations and hold on the people will lead in a Hobbesian way to a big, powerful, central government. One of the designers of the Tamkeen project, Zane Kanderian, says that model had cost many billions of US dollars and left little but corruption, envy, faction and bloodshed. The new project, Kanderian says, is about building demand for good government. \u201cThose of us involved in democracy promotion in Iraq and Afghanistan were selling the car with no engine,\u201d explains Kanderian. \u201cIn Syria we are helping them to build the engine in the hope they will be able to build the car around it.\u201d</p> <p>But none of this is easy. They are, after all, trying to do it in Syria: a spitting fire of a war zone.</p> <p>The landscape of Gaziantep from the Tamkeen offices is peculiarly beautiful. Blocks of apartments stretch as far as the eye can see, the silver water barrels on their roofs twinkling as they catch the sun; the horizon only broken by the minarets of this conservative city\u2019s many mosques.</p> <p>Prominent on a noticeboard in the main room in Tamkeen\u2019s offices is a picture of the smiling Syrian activist and journalist <a href=\"https://cpj.org/2015/12/syrian-journalist-naji-jerf-shot-dead-in-gaziantep.php\">Naji Jerf, 38</a>. The photograph acts as a reminder to the close-knit staff that, five floors down, Gaziantep can be an ugly place.</p> <p>Jerf, a friend of staff in the Tamkeen office, was shot dead in broad daylight as he walked down a busy road in the centre of the city in December. He had been due to join his family in France, where he had been granted asylum, the very next day. But he had made two anti-Isis films and the extremists wanted him dead.</p> <p>Last month, Halab Today TV presenter Mohammed Zahir al-Sherqat, another vocal critic of Isis, was shot dead close to the road where Jerf was murdered. And last Sunday a car bomb believed to have been planted by Isis killed two officers and wounded two dozen others at a police station. More than 30 suspects have been arrested since the attack.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8cadbdb859242c7b4b8dc2396c239245a92a3526\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8cadbdb859242c7b4b8dc2396c239245a92a3526/0_1152_3675_2205/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The sprawling city has seen the murder of activists and journalists in broad daylight.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The sprawling city has seen the murder of activists and journalists in broad daylight.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Before the war, Gaziantep\u2019s claim to fame, if it had one, was being home to the world\u2019s finest baklava, the honey-soaked pastry. Today, less than an hour\u2019s drive from Syria, it is a modern-day Casablanca \u2013 a destination for spies, refugees, foreign-aid workers and \u2013 perilously for Tamkeen \u2013 Isis sleeper cells.</p> <p>It was through here that the British teenagers Shamima Begum, Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase were transported from Bethnal Green, east London, to join Isis. This is where 29 suicide vests, 330lbs of C4 explosive, and grenades and a cache of Kalashnikovs were found in an apartment by Turkish police in December. And this is where Ibrahim El Bakraoui, one of the two brothers identified for being responsible for the killing of <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/brussels-attacks\">32 people in Brussels in March</a>, was picked up by Turkish police as a suspected Isis fighter before the attacks, only to be deported to the Netherlands at his request when the Belgian authorities insisted he was not linked to terrorism.</p> <p>Gaziantep has the feel of a modern city. There is a Starbucks, a Novotel and two shopping centres full of well- known stores. One British Foreign Office official says: \u201cMy mum worries when I go there but it has got a Marks &amp; Spencer and I tell her it can\u2019t be dangerous if it has a Sparks.\u201d</p> <p>But the apparent normality of the city cloaks real danger. Staff working on Tamkeen are advised to regard large parts of Gaziantep as being out of bounds, particularly the most obvious places such as the better restaurants where alcohol is served. Meetings at the elegant four-storey building that is home to the Syrian interim government, a white elephant of an organisation slowly being closed down by western donors due to its corruption and inefficacy, are avoided by non-governmental organisations because of the risk of a hit.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Those who could leave Syria have left. Those who stayed are the ones who can\u2019t afford to leave</p> <footer> <cite>Lelja Catic, Tamkeen programme manager</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>There are rumours that Isis operatives trail westerners who enter the city and anecdotes abound of jihadis on planes coming and going from Gaziantep airport with their beards covered by scarves and their socks pulled up high to reach their short trousers (a telltale sign of Isis fighters, who are forbidden the \u201clavish\u201d wearing of garments below the ankle).</p> <p>Perhaps it is the constant roar of the traffic combined with the strong sun and smell of petrol, but there is also something hypnotic about the place. It feels like anyone could disappear from one of the main roads or empty side streets, and the trance of those around would barely be disturbed.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the sprawling apartments that make up much of the city are said to host thriving people-smuggling and sex-slave trading, where the wives and daughters of Sunni Muslims killed by Isis are sold on in order for the so-called caliphate to replenish its coffers. Indeed, while it was once a pit stop on the silk road trade route, through which goods and culture would reach Europe from the Orient, Gaziantep is now a key stop on the jihadi highway, with all the perils that brings.</p> <p>\u201cWe avoid public places and carry alarms,\u201d says Marwa Bouka, a Syrian who works for a local NGO.</p> <p>\u201cI worry about what could happen here, big style,\u201d says Khatib. \u201cMy wife is an Australian journalist but she is in Sydney now. She left after Jerf was killed. She didn\u2019t feel safe and I can understand that.\u201d</p> <p>Khatib says he believes his colleagues need to be more careful; that it should be a concern, he says, of their every waking minute. But then things are put in stark perspective when the Tamkeen field officers, and the people they are trying to help, deep in the toxic quagmire that is Syria, come to visit and tell their stories.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"86e58b7893e05be8c9a7d1c12ddea033fe7bbfd1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/86e58b7893e05be8c9a7d1c12ddea033fe7bbfd1/0_3_5370_3222/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Brita Haji Hasan, president of Aleppo city council.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Brita Haji Hasan, president of Aleppo city council.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Brita Haji Hasan, the president of Aleppo city council, would be a busy man at the best of times. Aleppo was Syria\u2019s biggest city before the war, with some 2 million residents. Today, just 400,000 people remain in the opposition stronghold, which is under attack from the Assad regime, leaving just one road in and out.</p> <p>In his efforts to avoid Assad and Kurdish forces, it had taken Haji Hasan 10 hours to travel the 76 miles between Aleppo and Gaziantep for our interview. When the father of eight returned to Syria the next day he was seized by armed Kurdish secret police from his home and only released four days later.</p> <p>But before that drama, talking in the leafy garden of a cafe, shielded from the hum of Gaziantep\u2019s traffic, Haji Hasan tells me about the many departments that make up his council. He shows me pictures of meetings, waste disposal vehicles in action, street cleaning and engineers at work. His pride in these mundane details (and this is a tough man who was hung up by his wrists and lashed when the 2011 revolution started) is touching.</p> <p>Then he shows me a photograph of the corpse of Hasan Amory, 29, a father of two and council engineer killed by a Syrian air force missile as he headed into work on the morning we meet.</p> <p>It has been a horrendous period for the city of Aleppo. Haji Hasan says that since Assad restarted the missile strikes and barrel-bombings \u2013 dropping metal containers filled with high explosives, shrapnel, oil and chemicals \u2013 an average of 25 people have been killed every day. The busy al-Sakhour market placed has just been bombed for the 15th time, killing seven people. But, he says: \u201cWe have to try to live on.\u201d And that, he adds, is where Tamkeen comes in.</p> <p>The programme has provided Aleppo city council with \u00a3820,000 so far. In the past year, the money has helped repair the one road suitable for emergency vehicles, funded a water treatment centre, trained teachers, constructed a filter station to deal with the poor-quality fuel available to the city and built two centres for women to learn languages, vocational skills and first aid. \u201cBut it isn\u2019t the sum of money that is important,\u201d says Haji Hasan, whose council receives $500,000 every six months from the US. \u201cThe amount isn\u2019t huge but the work is great. If we compare it with other programmes this is much better. This is sustainable.\u201d</p> <p>Aleppo council was until recently beset by internal disputes and, as such, struggling to make decisions and offer services to its people, a job difficult enough in the circumstances. Haji Hasan says the Tamkeen committee in the area offered the council a model of how to avoid accusations of corruption.</p> <p>\u201cThe purpose of the programme is to promote good governance, and when you establish that the proper delivery of services follows,\u201d Haji Hasan says. \u201cTamkeen also insists on projects to empower women, and now, I think because of that, we have seven female management staff at the council. It creates a culture where women are encouraged to participate, and that\u2019s so important because so many have lost their husbands.\u201d</p> <p>It is almost impossible to judge how effective this attempt to disseminate good governance is. But the story of Aleppo doesn\u2019t stand alone. Last summer the people of Termanin, in the province of Idlib, west of Aleppo, stood up to the al-Qaida-affiliated group Jabhat al-Nusra. The militia had used threats to get their placemen to the top of the council. Tamkeen, which won\u2019t work with proscribed groups, had to withdraw its funding and committee. As a result the doctors and engineers in the area addressed villagers at the mosque, asking whether they had appreciated the open governance that had delivered a water wheel, construction vehicles and repairs for their schools. The positive response led the moderates on the local council to stand down. They threatened to establish a separate council with the villagers\u2019 support. Al-Nusra gave in.</p> <p>In Nashabiyeh, in Rif Damascus, the local council has asked Tamkeen to share the templates of its financial documents with it, so that it can copy the procurement processes that had freed Tamkeen from accusations of corruption. In Nawa, in Deraa province, the local council has started to hold public meetings to hear from the people, having seen how that model was embraced when Tamkeen arrived. And one local council north of Aleppo has started publishing its financial reports on Facebook and has installed comment boxes around the area, as Tamkeen had done when taking soundings on projects.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"da134aa270f91431be3fb388e3d8212e81b24e04\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/da134aa270f91431be3fb388e3d8212e81b24e04/0_0_5169_3101/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Syrian exile and Tamkeen activist Rami Al-Khatib on the streets of the old town in Gaziantep.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Syrian exile and Tamkeen activist Rami Al-Khatib on the streets of the old town in Gaziantep.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>For Nisreen Alzaraee, 34, Tamkeen\u2019s research manager, it is a good start. \u201cWorking with Tamkeen is one of the things that helps me sleep at night,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is not just relief, support for displaced people, or services for people who don\u2019t have electricity. We are working with governance \u2013 we are working on the ideas of the revolution.</p> <p>\u201cTamkeen is not easy. It is demanding \u2013 we ask so much of them; to implement really demanding concepts. But it is important because one day the donors will get tired. A more sexy crisis will come around and the money will dry up. Syrians need tools, they don\u2019t need money.\u201d</p> <p>In the past three years Tamkeen has funded 63 education projects, including the rebuilding of war-damaged schools; built 78 training programmes for councillors; set up 42 health projects, including the building of clinics and the funding of new ambulances; ensured the construction of 127 pieces of vital infrastructure such as wells and electricity generators; established two food safety programmes and built six vocational centres. Some \u00a33.8m of British cash has so far been spent out of a total of \u00a317.2m allocated by DfID and the EU, with a new round of projects across Syria about to be launched. Above all, Tamkeen believes it has embedded the principles of legitimate, responsive government in areas where the concepts are almost entirely new. The American government has thrown huge amounts of money around Syria and, in the words of one senior foreign official, has a reputation for delivering \u201cbig expensive stuff\u201d. But now it too is launching a similar programme, so impressed has it been by Tamkeen\u2019s results.</p> <p>There have been failures. In al-Teeba, in Deraa near the Jordanian border, a generator funded by Tamkeen was found in the mayor\u2019s garden. Tamkeen pulled out because trust had been breached. In Aleppo city, road repairs were unsatisfactory, the supplier was sued for using substandard material and the cash recouped.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2016/mar/15/voices-from-syria-refugees-camp-paradise-conflict-teacher-midwife\">Voices from Syria: 'This camp is a paradise compared to life back home'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Tamkeen finance officers, working behind a thick, secure door in a separate room from the rest of the staff in Gaziantep, scrutinise accounts and have people on the ground verifying projects, but recognise there will always be fraudsters or plain negligence. \u201cCorruption happens in every country,\u201d says Catic. \u201cThe difference between good and bad governance is how you deal with it. So we tell them: deal with it.\u201d</p> <p>But the military situation threatens Tamkeen and its work. In February, the opposition was driven out of the countryside north of Aleppo by an unprecedented bombing campaign by the Russian airforce and the Assad regime, allowing Kurdish forces affiliated to the regime to move in. \u201cThree of our communities were taken over by the Kurds after 20 shells an hour were landing on the people there,\u201d says Catic, who was a teenager during the Bosnian war, and hid in a basement with her family for three months as the Croat forces shelled them. \u201cFebruary was the worst month in Syria. In Bosnia, during shelling we would go to basement. With the barrel bombs they are using there is nothing you can do, nowhere for you to go, because it destroys everything.\u201d</p> <p>The result of the brutal assault was a mass exodus of people north towards the Turkish border from the towns of Tall Rifat, Marea and Deir Jamal, where Tamkeen had been working. Vast refugee camps have now spread around the border town of Azaz holding 150,000 people, some of whom have come under attack from Isis forces advancing from the east, burning down tents as they go.</p> <p>Tamkeen decided to follow the people as they fled and is now working in the camps, providing waste management, building toilets and establishing health programmes. It is erecting 163 tents and putting whiteboards inside so that 6,000 students can have an education. And it has established a course to train 150 teachers.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"d885ea77c18475a6ddae145fc8d23e2049f0d259\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d885ea77c18475a6ddae145fc8d23e2049f0d259/0_400_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gaziantep has the feel of a modern city, but Tamkeen staff must be vigilant about their security.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gaziantep has the feel of a modern city, but Tamkeen staff must be vigilant about their security.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Andy Hall for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But that all starts to sound like humanitarian aid rather than the building of self-governing, capable communities. Can Tamkeen really operate on the move?</p> <p>There has been a sudden, but perhaps inevitable, loss of people from Syria able to do the things Tamkeen asks of them. \u201cWe have seen a drop in capacity since May last year,\u201d admits Catic. \u201cI think what has happened is that after five years of conflict it has finally dawned on people that this is not going to end, our people are being killed, the kids are not receiving an education, and we have to leave.</p> <p>\u201cThose who could leave Syria have left. Those who stayed are the ones who can\u2019t afford to leave. It took from April 2011 to May 2015 for this to happen. For four years people really tried.\u201d</p> <p>Catic has a solution. \u201cThis requires a no fly zone,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople are tired of the bombing. You lose strength.\u201d But there is also the ominous question of whether Tamkeen needs to wake up to what the envelopment of opposition territory by the Assad regime might mean. Should Tamkeen stand its ground, and try to nurture the values it stands for in areas coming under the control of Assad\u2019s brutal government? Views in the Syrian community are mixed.</p> <p>Diad Abdullah, 32, a field officer working north of Aleppo, was tortured by the regime. He believes that anyone linked to Tamkeen would be immediately imprisoned or worse if they stayed to carry on their work. But Mazen Gharibah, 29, a senior project manager at a Syrian opposition organisation coordinating relief efforts, says it would be unconscionable to leave people without working local government. Staying is a risk worth taking, he says.</p> <p>Neil Fowler, head of Syria operations for Adam Smith International, has worked in Afghanistan and Somalia, and knows compromises often have to be made. He admits this might well be the next challenge as the military situation develops. \u201cThe programmes we implement are designed on the basis that people in awful situations still deserve basic services, livelihoods and a voice in the way they are governed,\u201d Fowler says. \u201cIn that respect, all ordinary Syrians deserve the same, no matter who rules them.</p> <p>\u201cWorking in regime areas, however, would mean finding a way to operate free from the interference of a highly centralised and controlling government authority and security services. We also have a profound respect for our Syrian colleagues \u2013 most of whom have been the victims of regime brutality \u2013 and that means respecting their views on how and where we work.</p> <p>\u201cWhat we can do is explore what has worked in other countries, and be ready to respond to shifting views and the peace process.\u201d</p> <p>In other words, as Rami al-Khatib implied: no one really knows what the future holds for Syria.</p> <h2>\u2018To have to leave Syria for ever is not acceptable. I would rather be killed\u2019</h2> <p> <strong>Bakri Azzin, 28, Tamkeen field office, Aleppo</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8e010a04c7dffa43f30d03ded63fc8557285cf7a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8e010a04c7dffa43f30d03ded63fc8557285cf7a/697_56_4775_2865/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Bakri Azzin\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Asked why he stays in Aleppo, as the missiles strike and the barrel bombs fall, Azzin says: \u201cIt\u2019s another life in my country.\u201d He doesn\u2019t mean to say that it is a better life there, nor that it is worse. Azzin means to say, he explains, that it is the life he chooses to lead.</p> <p>\u201cFor it to be decided that you have to leave your country for ever is not acceptable to me. That\u2019s a decision that is very hard to be taken. I would prefer to be killed in my country.\u201d</p> <p>Azzin\u2019s 21-year-old brother was killed in 2013 by an Assad regime tank shell. He was a photographer and had been documenting the carnage in Khan al-Assal, a town eight miles west of Aleppo. The opposition-held town had been the scene of brutal massacres, attributed to the al-Qaida-affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra militia, and a chemical attack attributed to the regime.</p> <p>Azzin\u2019s mother went into deep shock following her son\u2019s death, becoming hysterical in response to the noise of war around her. In 2014, Azzin moved her and the rest of his family to Gaziantep. \u201cMy mother became terrified of the sounds of shelling and jets,\u201d he says. \u201cI stay in Syria because it is my country. We believe in our revolution; that we deserve some freedom in my country, and I don\u2019t need to be a refugee for the rest of my life in Europe or Turkey. As humans we have the right to live in our country as humans.\u201d</p> <p>Azzin is responsible for overseeing the projects that the Tamkeen committee in Aleppo choose to undertake. \u201cI oversaw road repairs and water filtering,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were coordinating with the council. Our mission was to discuss with the community and find the quotation of everyone who wanted to supply.\u201d</p> <p>But as the Assad regime launches shell after shell, he is worried for the future. \u201cThey attacked the 700-metre area that is keeping Aleppo from being besieged, but I don\u2019t know if we will be able to defend it. If they besiege it will be worse than Homs. There is nothing to support human life in the city.</p> <p>\u201cNo farming, just buildings. There are no green spaces to farm. It will be a crazy situation. [There are] at least 350,000 in the city now. We won\u2019t even be able to find baby food for the children.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018I vowed never to take my children back to Syria\u2019</h2> <p> <strong>Iman Al-Zahrawi, 32, gender officer</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"4ba45595192978dd21c9cec04c8c0a640880a008\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/4ba45595192978dd21c9cec04c8c0a640880a008/0_1255_3580_2148/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Iman Al-Zahrawi\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>The stories Zahrawi tells are extraordinary. That she smiles so freely is almost incomprehensible.</p> <p>After being told that her son was dead under the rubble of the family home in Aleppo, she refused to accept the news. Her 12-year-old was subsequently dragged from the ground alive.</p> <p>A close friend, with whom she had been drinking coffee, was cut in two in front of her by the shrapnel from an Assad regime barrel bomb. \u201cI can see it now: the bottom part remained standing while the top slid to the ground.\u201d</p> <p>On another occasion, Zahrawi, a mother of four, was forced by the bullets of Turkish guards to crawl across the Turkish/Syrian border on her stomach, just three weeks after giving birth by caesarean section. She was trying to reach Gaziantep to receive training on good governance, which she might pass on to others in Aleppo.</p> <p>This slight woman was until last month working in the countryside north of Aleppo as a field officer, helping a female-only Tamkeen sub-committee achieve its project goals in that ultra-conservative part of Syria.</p> <p>Little frightened her, although much left her frustrated. \u201cThe community wouldn\u2019t support the women, no,\u201d she says. \u201cAt one point I was being harassed by al-Qaida fighters. A guy stopped me when I was buying fruit for my children. He stopped and told me: \u2018Please, if you are living in our community you should be dressed like us.\u2019 I said: \u2018Please, maybe you should fight on the front. If you are here, you are not a man. When I see a man, I will dress more appropriately.\u2019 He walked on.\u201d</p> <p>Zahrawi adds: \u201cThe problem is that no one opposes them. They are used to being able to order people around.\u201d</p> <p>In February, the Russians started to bomb the area in which she worked and the population fled north. Tamkeen offered her a chance to come to Gaziantep with her children for a short break. It was there that the horror of all she had seen hit her.</p> <p>\u201cI was walking down the street and an aeroplane came over and my children freaked out,\u201d says Zahrawi. \u201cThey were hiding and screaming, trembling. I had a breakdown in the street and vowed never to take my children back to Syria.</p> <p>\u201cBut me? I would go back in a heartbeat.\u201d</p> <h2>\u2018The regime arrested my friends and pursued us\u2019</h2> <p><strong>Kholoud Waleed, 31, Tamkeen, gender specialist</strong></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f096d2095de41e6297311627c79a43b48c36a8d4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f096d2095de41e6297311627c79a43b48c36a8d4/0_179_5370_3222/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kholoud Waleed\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> </figure>  <p>Waleed, an English graduate from Damascus University, was hunted through the Syrian countryside by the Assad regime for her role as cofounder of a group of women activists.</p> <p>\u201cWe were organising silent demonstrations against the corruption of the regime. We were calling for freedom, democracy and human rights,\u201d she says. Her brother, who worked for the Syrian Red Cross, was taken by the regime in 2012 and is still missing.</p> <p>Waleed is from the town of Daraya, close to the Syrian capital, which was one of the regime\u2019s early targets in clamping down on dissent. \u201cWe had checkpoints early in 2011 and demonstrators were shot at with live bullets,\u201d she says. \u201cThen a massacre happened. In August 2012, a thousand people were killed. We had a small group of people who held arms but they were all killed.</p> <p>\u201cWe had lots of orphans who we had to look after who were completely traumatised. We worked with them for two months and then the regime broke in again and so we all fled the town. It was once a town of 500,000 people. Now there are only 8,000.\u201d</p> <p>Waleed fled into the countryside with her family. She says: \u201cWe found a shanty house to rent; it was a stable, although they called it a house. But the regime forces found and arrested a few of my friends and then started to pursue us.</p> <p>\u201cThey arrested the first one of us and her mother. Her mum entrapped another two girls; she had no choice. She called them and said: \u2018I want to meet you in this place.\u2019 The two girls went to her and were taken by the intelligence forces.</p> <p>\u201cAnd then they started to call me. They said: \u2018Are you the English teacher? Come and meet me. I want you to teach my kids. I want to meet you in half an hour.\u2019 I turned off my mobile and took out the sim card and fled the country.\u201d</p>",

      "body": "<p>If the select committee hearings into the collapse of BHS might be compared to a heavyweight boxing bout \u2013 Sir Philip \u201cthe medallion stallion\u201d Green against Frank \u201cearnest Ernest\u201d Field \u2013 tomorrow we have the undercard.</p> <p>Metaphorically donning the silk dressing gowns and shadow boxing their way into the ring will be Alan Rubenstein, chief executive of the Pension Protection Fund, plus Lesley Titcomb and Nicola Parish, respectively chief executive and director of case management at the Pensions Regulator.</p> <p>They will face a tag-team of inquisitors: Field\u2019s work and pensions select committee, and the business, innovation and skills (BIS) committee chaired by Iain \u201cLeading\u201d Wright.</p> <p>Field has already irked the medallion stallion with some low blows before the bell has rung, but it looks doubtful whether punches will be pulled for the number crunchers.</p> <p>In the pre-bout publicity, Field jabs: \u201cA major aim of the work and pensions committee representatives will be to test how adequately both organisations have carried out their duties to help protect members\u2019 pensions under the existing law, whether the existing law is inadequate and, if so, how should it be strengthened, or whether existing powers are adequate but were not fully exercised.\u201d</p> <p>Seconds out.</p> <h2>Osborne\u2019s song remains the same<br /></h2> <p>In other Westminster grilling news, the chancellor, George Osborne, will be appearing in front of the Treasury select committee on Wednesday, to be quizzed about the UK\u2019s membership of the European Union. Well, that\u2019s what it says on the tin, although when Osborne speaks about UK membership of the EU, he tends to talk about the exact opposite.</p> <p>That\u2019s what happened last month, when the chancellor\u2019s mandarins published a 200-page tome entitled \u201cHM Treasury analysis: the long-term economic impact of EU membership and the alternatives\u201d, which put the emphasis squarely on the alternatives. You\u2019ll recall that the study claimed UK GDP would shrink by 6% by 2030 if we vote to leave the EU, which apparently would cost every household the equivalent of \u00a34,300 a year.</p> <p>Well, maybe. But without wanting to belittle the work of serious economists, most dismal scientists struggle to predict where they\u2019ll have dinner \u2013 so 2030 is heroic guesswork. Meanwhile, that \u00a34,300 figure is based on dividing their guess on how much GDP the UK will have missed out on, by the number of UK households. It is stretching it to imply that\u2019s income.</p> <h2>Sympathy for the bookies?<br /></h2> <p>A high-rolling punter stumbles into a fancy casino and turns \u00a31m into chips. Before he starts playing cards, he gets talked into spending \u00a35 on the casino\u2019s own lottery game, which boasts a first prize of \u00a325,000. The punter then hits the tables and loses the whole million.</p> <p>Still, on his way out, the punter gets collared by a croupier and informed that very few people bought lottery tickets, so he\u2019s scooped the top prize.</p> <p>Would anybody have any sympathy for the casino manager if he then started moaning that he\u2019d lost \u00a325,000? Yet that is effectively what the bookies have been asking everybody to believe with their constant bleating about Leicester City winning the Premier League, having started the season at odds of 5,000-1. What really happened was the bookies coined it in all season on the back of freak results, only to hand a fraction back last week.</p> <p>We may get a reality check on this on Wednesday, when William Hill gives a trading update and holds its annual general meeting \u2013 but don\u2019t, er, bet on it. The myth of the bookies being fleeced by Leicester\u2019s triumph comes second only to the even more unbelievable line that the Foxes triumph was football\u2019s \u201cgreatest fairy tale\u201d. No: it was the third-greatest footballing fairy tale in the East Midlands \u2013 in the past 44 years.</p>",

If you\u2019re David Cameron, do you (a) stick loyally by John Whittingdale as he blunders deeper into the media mire of BBC charter renewal or (b) sit back and think about an inevitable 24 June reshuffle? Is he a dead culture secretary walking \u2013 or, rather, talking too much?</p> <p>Whittingdale came under relentless fire last week as the latest trial balloon from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport crashed and burned. <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/01/government-could-ban-bbc-from-showing-top-shows-at-peak-times\" title=\"\">Shift <em>Strictly Come Dancing</em>, by exhortatory government decree</a>, to some off-peak time so that it doesn\u2019t take audience ratings from <em>The X Factor</em>? Even the <em>Daily Mail</em> gagged over that.</p> <p>Lord Puttnam and his public service broadcasting inquiry <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/02/puttnam-inquiry-bbc-government-department-culture-media-sport\" title=\"\">took careful aim</a>. \u201cWe have been continuously assured by the culture secretary that he wants the BBC to \u2018thrive in the years to come\u2019, but the drip, drip of these leaks suggest the opposite, that the government wants a significantly diminished corporation\u201d. Sir David Attenborough cuddled a baby lion and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/may/03/david-attenborough-warns-against-playing-fast-and-loose-bbc\" title=\"\">snarled at Whitehall ambitions</a>. Chris Patten, former chair of the BBC Trust and the Tory party, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/03/bbc-strictly-lord-patten-john-whittingdale\" title=\"\">delivered a broadside</a> on behalf of \u201cbesieged\u201d former colleagues.</p> <p>All the usual Beeb-loving liberal suspects, you might say. Perhaps. But the interesting thing was how no one chirped up to defend old Whitto. He\u2019s the butt of quite good, widely repeated jokes by the chancellor. He\u2019s not a suitable case for supportive treatment.</p> <p>That\u2019s because confusion follows him every step of the charter way. \u201cI love the BBC. I\u2019ve not set out to destroy the BBC,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is not the job of secretary of state to tell the BBC what programmes they should and should not be making,\u201d he adds. \u201cEditorial independence is paramount.\u201d</p> <p>But, then, it\u2019s an \u201cinteresting question\u201d whether the corporation should bid against ITV for Saturday night specials such as <em>The Voice</em>. \u201cThere are savings within the BBC that don\u2019t require them to slash news budgets or close a channel\u2026 news is not the first place they should look, in many ways it should be the last place.\u201d Some programming \u201cisn\u2019t meeting the needs of communities\u201d. And so on and so forth, a monologue featuring \u2013 in only the last few days \u2013 the notion of a five-year, mid-charter check on quality, the<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/apr/25/bbc-chief-meets-george-osborne-to-seek-protection-for-licence-fee-funds\" title=\"\"> hinted return of top-slicing licence fees</a>, plus that idea about shifting <em>Strictly</em> times (a riff on an earlier push to get the BBC evening news shifted from 10 so ITV had no direct competition). Oh! And he made a joke about the corporation \u201cdriving him insane\u201d so that it was \u201c<a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/04/bbc-john-whittingdale-impartiality\" title=\"\">tempting to abolish it</a>\u201d.</p> <p>Stir in the toxic development of a new BBC unitary board substantially appointed by HMG and the brew bubbles menacingly. This is a corporation that can be cut on a Treasury whim, told what to show when by the DCMS \u2013 and have its collar felt when politically necessary. Impartiality over Brexit? \u201cI\u2019ve talked to the director general about this, and I\u2019ve written to the chairman of the trust.\u201d</p> <p>Whittingdale recruited the charter team who guide his hand. He\u2019ll have a dominant hand in choosing the new BBC board and perhaps the new Ofcom committee that will take over regulation. He can\u2019t resist chipping in with threats and promises. He likes to show who\u2019s in charge. But does anyone, seriously, want to him to do this gabby, intellectually chaotic job? The chap who\u2019s really in charge of Whittingdale \u2013 writing detailed memos, laying out most of these plans \u2013 is of course David Cameron. But is he really so heedless as to leave implementation to the chap <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/may/05/gary-lineker-john-whittingdale-chump-bbc-joke\" title=\"\">Gary Lineker calls \u201cthe chump\u201d?</a></p> <p>Of course there are many things at Broadcasting House you can frown at. Excessive stress on retaining the licence fee: exceeding confusion over internal reorganisation: extreme unhappiness over cuts not properly thought through. But there\u2019ll be time to worry about all that once the charter cavalcade has left town. Things, in the meantime, have become so busybody-ridiculous that the first, fundamental question of BBC Trust abolition is twisting into life again. Do we really want to lose the trust \u2013 and its quality control responsibilities \u2013 to find it replaced by a tame board, compliant Ofcom subcommittee and the ghost of Whitto riding shotgun? Now there\u2019s something it would truly be tempting to abolish. Dump the chump.</p>",

He expands on Wilmot\u2019s world in this chronicle of 1666, a breezy account of an England in which (in addition to London going up in flames) Isaac Newton sees an apple fall from a tree, Eyam in Derbyshire becomes the famous quarantined plague village and Charles II is a \u201csuave and all-welcoming figurehead\u201d. Divided into readable chapters on \u201cKing and Court\u201d, \u201cScience and Superstition\u201d, \u201cGoing Out\u201d and so on, <em>Restoration</em> \u2013 at just over 250 pages \u2013 perhaps lacks the depth that the period requires: Claire Tomalin\u2019s Pepys biography <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/sep/29/biography.whitbreadbookawards2002\"><em>The Unequalled Self</em></a> is still the definitive account of the time.

      "body": "<p><strong>I have been communicating with TalkTalk for a number of months following its cyber attack, regarding scam calls I\u2019ve been receiving from people claiming to be TalkTalk. This culminated in me making a complaint. During this time I was told that my account details were definitely not accessed. Having just renewed my contract, I asked for a letter to confirm this.</strong></p> <p><strong>But this morning I received another call, and when I asked the caller to confirm my details, they had my full name, address and postcode. TalkTalk has confirmed that it was a scam call. </strong></p> <p><strong>I am extremely concerned that the company previously told me that none of my account details were taken, and now I don\u2019t know if other details have also been taken. I wish to terminate my contract but TalkTalk will not guarantee that I won\u2019t be charged a fee. </strong><em>AM,</em> <em>Londonderry</em></p> <p><strong>\u2022 My elderly and partially sighted father was recently scammed out of \u00a34,900 by a bogus TalkTalk engineer who managed to convince him he really was from TalkTalk. My father has endured great stress and his bank account is still frozen some weeks later.</strong></p> <p><strong>TalkTalk said it had sent him an email warning about scams, but he has problems reading emails and usually just deletes the ones that are not in large print. However, had they sent a physical letter he would have been able to read that using his magnifying glass. My father was completely unaware that such a scam was going on.</strong></p> <p><strong>TalkTalk has offered him \u00a350 as a goodwill gesture, but in my opinion this is them accepting responsibility but refusing to pay the money he lost.</strong></p> <p><strong>My father\u2019s bank is also refusing to give him any information about why they cannot trace the payment he made to the bogus TalkTalk engineer so he can be reimbursed. </strong><em>NH,</em><strong> </strong><em>by email</em></p> <p>Last year Guardian Money revealed how <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/feb/27/threat-to-millions-of-talktalk-customers\" title=\"\">scammers were using customer details hacked from TalkTalk or a subsidiary to con customers</a> out of varying sums \u2013 often several thousand pounds</p> <p>The scammers call a customer, quote their TalkTalk account and other personal details to make the caller believe they work for the company, and offer to make refunds for some imagined inconvenience. Having persuaded the customer to give them access to their computer they are able to empty their bank account. It\u2019s a very clever scam \u2013 one that relies on the victim thinking they are talking to genuine TalkTalk staff. In almost all the cases we are aware of, both the bank and TalkTalk have always denied any responsibility.</p> <p>The above letters, plus another that we received this week, show this is still going on. We suspect the list of customer details has been sold on many times, as various groups have targeted TalkTalk customers.</p> <p>At the time of its data breach, TalkTalk shamefully chose to email its customers \u2013 it\u2019s cheaper than sending out letters \u2013 and inevitably many didn\u2019t see the warnings as they ended up in their spam filters.</p> <p>We asked the company about both the above cases. It said it has again checked AM\u2019s details and is adamant that they were not taken as part of the data breach. It is possible they have been called up randomly and the scammers have quoted personal details available from other sources, it suggests.</p> <p>In the second case, it again said it bears no responsibility. \u201cWe sympathise with NH\u2019s loss but unfortunately the scam described would not have been possible without him providing confidential information to the scammers. We\u2019ve taken a number of significant steps to alert, inform and advise customers to help them protect themselves, and we would advise anyone who has fallen victim to a scam, and revealed banking information, to contact their bank immediately,\u201d it says.</p> <p>We are rapidly coming to the conclusion that the risks of online banking for some people outweigh the benefits.</p> <p><strong>We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.

      "body": "<p>It was tough finding time to write this piece, what with the children, the emails, the laundry, the meetings, the phone calls. Want to know more about my struggle? No, I bet you don\u2019t. We have all listened to frenzied itineraries from parents who also hold down a job and who evidently hope to impress and inspire sympathy in equal measure. The truth is that many of Britain\u2019s families are in the same beleaguered state. More mothers and fathers than ever are tired out yet believe that\u2019s just how it is.</p> <p>The findings of January\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.workingfamilies.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Modern-Families-Index-2016.pdf\">Modern Families Index</a> show that almost a third (29%) of the nation\u2019s parents are complaining of burnout, not just from long hours at work but from toiling at home. Domestic chores and the logistics of children\u2019s aspirational hobbies mean more than a third (35%) of those asked by the charity <a href=\"http://www.workingfamilies.org.uk\">Working Families</a> believe they are chasing their tails in a race they do not remember entering. Annual leave is regarded as a coping mechanism, many said, and 28% of parents admitted faking sickness to deal with hectic lives.</p> <p>So while joyful images of orthodox family life \u2013 the so-called \u201cquality time\u201d made up of country walks and fond joshing around the dinner table \u2013 still dominate advertising, that time is rapidly diminishing, even as it is being labelled and sold to us.</p> <p>Tony Crabbe, a business psychologist who last year wrote <a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/346314/\"><em>Busy: How to Thrive in a World of Too Much</em></a>, believes working parents in Britain now bear the brunt of an obsession with cramming the day, particularly those educated, professional parents who work longer hours. \u201cThe quality of the attention we are supposed to give is exhausting, with the jumping backwards and forwards from work and home,\u201d he argues. \u201cAnd what creates a perfect storm is this pressure to be a perfect parent. There is a kind of arms race at the school gates as to how many after-school activities kids are doing.\u201d</p> <p>The Index study, conducted with the care provider Bright Horizons, spoke to 1,000 British mothers and fathers across a range of ages and from varied income brackets, and it shows that almost half of working families now have both parents in full-time jobs. Men no longer have that time-honoured right to come in, sit down and kick their shoes off, although according to the findings, mothers are nearly twice as likely as fathers to pick up domestic tasks as soon as they walk in the door. Flexible working, if it is possible, does not reduce stress levels either. Far from it being a panacea, an <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jan/02/work-life-balance-flexible-working-can-make-you-ill-experts-say\">occupational health study</a> earlier this year reported a growing danger that employees feel \u201con duty\u201d all the time.</p> <p>\u201cThere has never been a generation that has less time alone with its brain than ours,\u201d says Crabbe. \u201cYet the skills workers will need in the future are creative ones. Creativity is a muscle, and it doesn\u2019t work without some dead time in our diaries, time to let things settle and sediment.\u201d</p> <p>A good test of a stressed-out family is when the suggestion of something fun and new to do simply sounds like another burden. But what has driven so many households into this ceaseless battle with the clock? Is it a fear of wasting time? Most parents believe it is the high cost of living and a wish to secure a good life for their children that urges them on. Yet if the cost is surrendering \u201ca good life\u201d now, is it worth it? We asked three busy families to explain how they cope \u2013 and why.</p> <h2>\u2018It\u2019s about how much we want for our children\u2019<em><br /></em></h2> <p><em>Carrie and Matt James have Erin, 16, Patrick, 14, Catherine, 11, and Orla, 7</em></p> <p>Carrie and Matt James live in a cul-de-sac not far from the front in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, and have four children, Erin, Patrick, Catherine and Orla. Their daughters have a consuming interest in Irish dance, which takes up two hours every evening, with occasional three-hour weekend workshops, and Patrick, who loves both rugby and football, plays a couple of evenings in the week, with regular matches at the weekend. On one average weekday evening their kitchen table is covered with fairy cakes to decorate for a school sale.<br /></p> <p>Carrie, 46, works across the county as an immunisation nurse three days a week and also does a spot of cleaning. The extra money goes on expensive Irish dancing outfits. \u201cThere are times I look at my life and think: well, I haven\u2019t actually got time to breathe. I go into overdrive, and then feel I could go under tomorrow,\u201d she admits. Her girls go to the sought-after grammar school nearby. Some childcare comes courtesy of Matt\u2019s mother, with Carrie\u2019s mother stepping in, too.</p> <p>\u201cPatrick and the girls walk home and let themselves in, or Granny picks them up. Most nights everyone goes off in different directions. Patrick has sports. Orla has running club and gymnastics, as well as the dance practice in Raleigh, though some nights we have to drive further. If we are in traffic, I just tell myself I can only do what I can. I don\u2019t want to have a heart attack.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I haven\u2019t got time to breathe. I go into overdrive and then feel I\u00a0could go under tomorrow</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>What keeps Carrie going, she says, is a faith that being active is good and will help her children. \u201cAlthough if you speak to my mother she would say you only need to make sure you feed your children and get them to Mass. My brain is always thinking about the next thing. When it all pushes down on me I have a good cry.\u201d</p> <p>Erin is tackling A-levels, Irish dance and a Duke of Edinburgh Award. \u201cWe are usually all together for a Sunday roast,\u201d she says. \u201cWe have enough time together, I think, although Dad doesn\u2019t enjoy going up to town.\u201d In the morning Matt, 44, who works at a bank, makes a packed lunch for the girls before he leaves at 7.30am, and in the evening he comes in at 8pm to change his clothes for rugby with Patrick or to drive his dancing girls to and fro. \u201cA lot of what we do is based around how much we want for our children. There is a push for them to have better things and do better things, but we do have to pinch ourselves sometimes because of how lucky we know we are.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Tony Crabbe\u2019s expert opinion:</strong> When Carrie describes moments when she has \u201cno time to breathe\u201d, she\u2019s describing a lack of control. We plan a busy day, but when real life intervenes, and there\u2019s no slack, we\u2019re in trouble. Even in a traffic jam, however, you can take a few seconds to breathe and stop your mind racing. An involving hobby, like dance, is great, but unstructured family time is also good. My wife Dulcie and I have ritualised the idea of having three cups of tea together, to talk in a freer way.</p> <h2>\u2018I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d be a good mother if I didn\u2019t work\u2019</h2> <p><em>Katy and Simon Daniels have Luca, 4, and Scarlett, 2</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"2675cf5b4181b968deea4d2189eea6df3d371ef8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/2675cf5b4181b968deea4d2189eea6df3d371ef8/705_261_4096_2458/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Simon and Katy, sitting on a child's bed, with their children, Luca and Scarlett, jumping on it\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018We don\u2019t usually talk about what we are doing it for, but it is always busy\u2019: Simon, with Katy and their children, Luca and Scarlett.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>At 8.30pm in a three-bedroom townhouse in Greenhithe, Kent, Katy, a 34-year-old IT training officer in a financial firm, and Simon Daniels, a 44-year-old foreign exchange trader, have a little stretch of evening ahead now that their young children are asleep.</p> <p>For Katy, who commutes to Canary Wharf three days a week, leaving the house with both children at 7am and returning with them just before 6pm, the hardest thing is an unwelcome feeling of \u201cliving from one day to the next. If one of the kids looks ill on a Tuesday I have to think: will they be worse tomorrow? I went back to work so we would have money to do nice things and then, of course, it had to be the kind of job that allowed me to afford 20 hours of childcare each week for both of them. I like working \u2013 I don\u2019t know if I would be a good mother if I didn\u2019t.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>My husband earns more than me, so if one of us needs to take the day off it is me</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Eight months into her first maternity leave Katy remembers wondering: \u201cIs that it? What purpose do I have now?\u201d and realising she wanted to talk about more than her children. \u201cI do have that guilt factor though. If I could change one thing it would be that my husband was able to take up more of the responsibility. But because he earns more, if one of us needs the day off then it will be me.\u201d</p> <p>Simon, who is ironing after putting Luca to bed, sees his own routine \u2013 getting up for work at 5.30am and returning home at 6.45pm \u2013 as a natural development. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about what we are doing it for. We don\u2019t know if we are doing parenting right, but it is always busy: dancing, swimming, football. My elder child from my previous marriage has netball on Saturday and the other one has athletics. When we need to relax we go for a walk.\u201d</p> <p>Simon believes it is to do with social conditioning. \u201cWe are programmed in a particular way, and unless something is put in front of you that changes that, like being made redundant, you just do what others are doing.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Tony Crabbe\u2019s opinion: </strong>Katy feels \u201cambushed\u201d by each day, but actually this is not a bad strategy. We often feel burdened by the anticipation of the stuff that lies ahead of us, so one of the best things we can do is to decide to deal with something later. Simon is concerned about simply conforming. He could build some variety into his routine for just one week, which makes it easier to imagine changes if you need to make them later. \u201cDead time\u201d \u2013 such as the walks Simon enjoys \u2013 is crucial for mental health; TV doesn\u2019t cut it, as your mind should wander. </p> <h2>\u2018I want good schools to give them the edge\u2019</h2> <p><em>Afua and Emmanuel Okoye have Mary, 7, and Marise, 16 months </em></p> <p>Afua and Emmanuel Okoye both work full-time and have two young daughters. Afua is head of marketing for a healthcare company with a head office in London, so sometimes she has a two-hour commute from her home in Kent. On other days she works in a local office but leaves home at 6.45am to be at her desk early so she can set off in the afternoon in time to reach her baby\u2019s nursery before it closes at 6pm.<br /></p> <p>\u201cIt is a demanding job, and when you put two kids on top, it is challenging. The system doesn\u2019t reward working mums \u2013 you feel more punished. If you leave on time, they ask why you are in such a hurry.\u201d Mary goes to a breakfast club at school, which she says she loves, and she is picked up later by Afua from an afterschool club. \u201cShe is awake before 7am, and so it is a long day for her. And it is worse for the baby, because she has to be up by 6.30am.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Working mums feel punished. If you leave on time, they ask why you are in such a hurry</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>On Saturdays there are ballet and swimming lessons, followed by gymnastics. \u201cThere\u2019s no time for the games I\u2019d like to play with Mary, so I feel like I\u2019ve failed anyway. I wonder if I am missing the time to talk to her and find out if things are going right and if she is happy. I worry about it all: in the morning, when my husband takes Mary to school, I constantly ring him to check has she got this or done that. I only sleep well on a Friday night when I am at home the next day.\u201d</p> <p>Yet Afua values her working life and says that if Emmanuel earned twice as much, she\u2019d still like to work, just shorter hours. \u201cYou do question what you are doing. You know you\u2019ll blink and your daughter will be 15 and you won\u2019t get that time back. But society looks down on people who don\u2019t seem busy. It is a status thing, perhaps.\u201d</p> <p>For Emmanuel, 35, there is no choice in his mind. He is the head of retail for a company based in London and he leaves at 7am each weekday to drop off Mary, often returning at 8pm after she is in bed.</p> <p>\u201cThe only time I have to myself is on the train, when I listen to music,\u201d he says, \u201capart perhaps from Sunday afternoon, although that is full of homework. There are times it is very stressful, but I suppose this is what we wanted when we got married. I am doing it to give the children the best. Mary says she is bored when there is nothing to do, so it is those extra things that keep her occupied that I am working to pay for. I want to get both of them into good schools, so that they have qualifications that will give them the edge.\u201d</p> <p><strong>Tony Crabbe\u2019s opinion:</strong> Afua recognises things are stacked against her. She is keen to do the right thing, so not having time for games is a cause of guilt. But pausing if your child randomly asks you to do something is not as hard as we think \u2013 often they just want two minutes. I call them butterfly moments, they don\u2019t last long but they shouldn\u2019t be put off. Emmanuel wants to give his children what they need. But boredom is a gift we might forget to give them. Children need time off and they perform better if they learn how to think for themselves.</p> <p><em>Since this final interview was conducted, Afua has changed jobs and has asked for the names of her family to be changed</em></p>",

      "headline": "Beyond the beach: Bulgaria\u2019s hidden treasures",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>I\u2019m laden with juicy fat cherries, freshly plucked from the tree. The sun shines and we\u2019re picnicking among spangles of wild flowers and long grasses. A track steers back to the wood-beamed house where we are staying, past mud-and-timber houses tilting back into the earth.</p> <p>I\u2019m with my husband Mark and two children in a tiny hillside hamlet called Baba Stana, close to the village of Oreshak, in the heart of central Bulgaria\u2019s Balkan mountains. It\u2019s peaceful and bucolic, and far from the cheap-and-cheerful skiing or beach packages Bulgaria is most known for.</p> <p>Yet people don\u2019t think to come for the mountain scenery with its world-class frescoes and monasteries, even though many are Unesco world heritage sites. Somehow rural Bulgaria doesn\u2019t sound that appealing.</p> <p>Having flown into <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/travel/sofia\">the capital, Sofia</a>, with its gold-domed Eastern Orthodox churches, we\u2019d stayed in Casa Ferrari, a small friendly guesthouse. The city brims with layers of history all mixing together into everyday life \u2013 Bulgaria had to grapple its independence from the Ottoman Empire after the Turks ruled for half a millennium.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f00f432078b84c68bcf5d6148b1305c89c2c11db\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f00f432078b84c68bcf5d6148b1305c89c2c11db/0_301_4084_4597/888.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018Bulgaria\u2019s former capital, the town of Veliko Tarnovo\" width=\"888\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">The town of Veliko Tarnovo: Bulgaria\u2019s former capital, where artists sit in the old town painting gilt icons\u2019:</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rolf Richrdson/Getty Images/Robert Harding World Imagery</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>I walked down into the underground metro. It\u2019s easy to use, and sections of preserved Roman streets can still be seen as you step off the escalators. Back at the top people strode among Roman amphitheatres and grand Stalinist architecture. From Sofia we\u2019d corkscrewed up through Bulgaria\u2019s mountainous landscape to Baba Stana. Road signs are in the Cyrillic alphabet and few people speak English, which makes navigating interesting. But the roads are easy to drive, with little traffic, although those you pass drive horrifyingly.</p> <p>The hamlet is half-empty. Derelict houses stand next to lived-in ones, creating a strange sense of abandoned beauty. A local family is having breakfast alfresco, their children playing among barns that lean. Few people still live here, most having moved to urban areas. Occasionally ancient villagers wander past and give a smile in the absence of any shared language. The sound of hay being raked falls from terraced fields. Most of those who remain here work the land.</p> <p>The view from our terrace stretches far over the hilltops, and a smattering of terracotta pantile roofs peep from the tree canopies. Cowbells and cicadas serenade us from flower-filled meadows; birds and butterflies skitter among plum trees. Our children are free to explore on their own, with no vehicles for me to worry about. The land is still riotously green, wild and untouched.</p> <p>We buy our provisions from the few tiny shops at Oreshak, which have a cottage industry in ceramics. It also has one unexpected visitor attraction: the charmingly quirky Cherni Ossum museum, created by a local biology teacher with taxidermied animals, many from the region. This delights our boys as they gaze up at bears towering over them.</p> <p>What we didn\u2019t expect to find was a modern hotel like the recently opened <a href=\"http://arthotel.bg/en\">Casa Art</a>. Small and stylish, it has a spa, individually decorated rooms, and a restaurant with an excellent sommelier. There is also a lot of funky colour and lively art.</p> <p>We eat traditional Bulgarian dishes of dried meats, grilled fish and fresh <em>shopska</em> salad (a typical salad here with salted vegetables and cheese). \u201cWe are very proud of this hotel,\u201d the sommelier tells us. \u201cIt\u2019s unique.\u201d The food is delicious and costs a fraction of what it would back at home.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"20e902de185ec9f0776b242bfd451291b06eb3c8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/20e902de185ec9f0776b242bfd451291b06eb3c8/0_720_3910_2346/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pick of the crop: shopska salad, with salted vegetables and cheese.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pick of the crop: shopska salad, with salted vegetables and cheese.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Zoryana Ivchenko/Getty Images/Moment Open</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But it\u2019s the quiet, pastoral nature of the place that\u2019s the real draw of the Bulgarian countryside. We are told that in the Balkan National Park, which contains Europe\u2019s largest protected beech forest, wolves and bears (and golden eagles) roam among the mountains. We don\u2019t see any of those, but exploring these vast wildernesses and swimming in nearby rivers is enough.</p> <p>Driving through the mountains we pass villages where gardens burst with roses, and gypsies ride by on horse-drawn carts, beautiful bright pom-poms tied around the horses\u2019 necks flaring out. A little further, at Chiflik, there are natural hot mineral springs with open-air pools. There are beautiful towns, too, reminders of when the country was part of one of Europe\u2019s biggest and most powerful empires. In Lovech, steep cobbled streets lead up to a medieval fortress overlooking the River Osam. In Veliko Tarnovo, Bulgaria\u2019s former capital, artists sit in the old town painting gilt icons on to slabs of dark wood. And Arbanasi\u2019s Nativity Church rivals Romania\u2019s best with its floor-to-ceiling frescoes. </p> <p>Bulgaria has more than 100 monasteries, which hide in remote gorges or perch on hills. Outside the Trojan monastery, a 10-minute drive from Oreshak, home-produced honey and antique icons are laid out on vintage cars in an impromptu market. Monks wander around the wooden balconies under a spectacular portico painted with apocalyptic scenes. </p> <p>Inside the monastery, amid the soft smell of incense, we come across a revered three-handed icon of the Virgin Mary. Queues of people move forward to touch her and leave banknotes at her feet. This is a land where the mountains are still rich with tradition and nature thrives.</p> <h2>Essentials<br /></h2> <p>Rooms at<a href=\"http://arthotel.bg/en\"> Casa Art</a> in Oreshak start at \u00a325 per night.

      "body": "<p>In 2014 the bed overtook the sofa as the most used item of furniture in British homes. This shift might be something to do with shrinking living space, but it mostly is the outcome of a behavioural change indicated by other well-I-never statistics \u2013 that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-28677674\">Britons now spend more time looking at screens than sleeping</a> and that 80% of smartphone users look at their devices within 15 minutes of waking up.</p> <p>I receive these nuggets from the trio in charge of the British pavilion at this year\u2019s Venice Architecture Biennale, <a href=\"http://design.britishcouncil.org/blog/2015/oct/22/british-council-announces-winning-venice-proposal/\">Jack Self, Shumi Bose and Finn Williams</a>, who say they want to address Britain\u2019s \u201canxious relationship to the idea of home\u201d. Aged 29, 32 and 33 respectively, and selected through an open call for entries by the British Council, they are the youngest ever to receive this honour and appear determined to use the stage of the world\u2019s biggest architectural exhibition to make an impact.</p> <p>They have chosen as their theme housing, a subject now so vast, intractable and pervasive, at least in the more expensive parts of the country, that it dominates mayoral election campaigns and dinner parties, pervades the twittersphere, and inhabits the sleeping and waking dreams of those with and without homes, politicians, planners, economists, landlords, developers, tenants, owners. And, indeed architects, whose job description is about doing something or other to do with buildings and might therefore be thought to have something to contribute, but who have so far tended to be ineffectual in leading the debate.</p> <p>Self, Bose and Williams are not architects in the sense that they have designed a number of completed buildings. None of them, indeed, are fully recognised by the Architects Registration Board, the official body for such matters, although ARB begrudgingly accepts that <a href=\"http://www.jackself.com/bio\">Self</a>\u2019s qualification, obtained in Australia, has some validity. They have all studied architecture, but they have different ways of putting that training into practice. <a href=\"http://www.arts.ac.uk/csm/people/teaching-staff/spatial-practices/shumi-bose/\">Bose</a> teaches, writes, edits and curates. Self also writes, has worked for the esteemed practice of Jean Nouvel and now has his own practice that is somewhat conceptual in its output. <a href=\"http://commonoffice.co.uk/index.php?/about/people/\">Williams</a> has been working in the planning departments of local authorities for eight years, first in the London borough of Croydon and then for the Greater London Authority.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>A square bed is proposed to allow for the increasing range of activities we do on mattresses</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The three combine speculation with (in Williams\u2019s case) decisions that have definite effects on the built environment. They are following different career paths to some in previous generations, who might have advertised their skills (in the 60s) by building a nice little house for themselves or (in the 80s) a natty flat conversion. As representatives of Generation Rent, these options are not open to them.</p> <p>Perhaps for these reasons Self, Bose and Williams avoid the tracks along which the arguments on housing usually run \u2013 build on green belt or brownfield land? How much \u201caffordable\u201d housing can be squeezed out of developers? What does \u201caffordable\u201d mean? They are not pretending to have all the answers \u2013 indeed they say that \u201chousing issues are at least as old as capitalism\u201d and that there is no ultimate solution to them. Instead, they are offering approaches that take into account not so much prices and numbers as the changes in the way people inhabit their homes.</p> <p>This is why they like the data on furniture and screentime. Traditional ways of occupying a home, with particular rooms dedicated to particular functions, are they say \u201ccollapsing\u201d under the pressures of both new technology and insecure tenancies (again, more in some places than others), which mean that \u201cmore and more people are living month by month in insane lets\u201d. Why, then, they ask, should homes be compartmentalised in a way that is fundamentally Victorian?</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9108e60a387f38450e100116c1f1aa020992db26\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9108e60a387f38450e100116c1f1aa020992db26/0_0_3411_4547/750.jpg\" alt=\"Williams, Bose and Self outside Futuro House.\" width=\"750\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Williams, Bose and Self outside Futuro House.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>In Venice, under the title Home Economics, they will communicate their thinking in a series of rooms that will be structured around the theme of time more than space, \u201cthe first exhibition on the architecture of the home to do so, as far as we know\u201d. There will be sections on the ways we inhabit homes over periods of hours, days, months, years and decades. They are doing so not alone but in partnership with artists, designers and other architects. There will be an audio guide by the writer Will Self, uncle of Jack. They have also taken advice from (for example) RBS and <a href=\"http://www.pegasuslife.co.uk/\">Pegasus Life</a>, which develops and runs high-end \u201cretirement living\u201d. They want their speculation to connect back to financial and other realities.</p> <p>Under \u201cHours\u201d, they will propose a communal living room, where, in the interests of saving time and space, flat dwellers share as much as possible \u2013 tools, vacuum cleaners, even clothes, which are kept in a transparent communal wardrobe. The hope is to make sharing \u201ca luxury, not a compromise\u201d. \u201cDecades\u201d, by the London/Oslo practice <a href=\"http://www.hesselbrand.com/\">Hesselbrand</a>, will try to address the tendency towards \u201cunder-occupancy among the elderly and over-occupancy among young\u201d, whereby old people are tending to live in homes bigger than they now need, while \u201cliving rooms and even bathrooms become bedrooms\u201d.</p> <p>Here, the proposal is for rooms that have qualities rather than designated functions such as bedroom, bathroom and kitchen; that are to varying degrees \u201clight and dark, open and closed, private and public, wet and dry, soft and hard\u201d. The notion is that such spaces can adapt to people\u2019s changing needs and desires through their lifetimes; as part of the same concept, communities are imagined where residents volunteer to mind children or help the old.</p> <p>The hope is for exchange between generations. A square bed is proposed, 2m x 2m, to allow for the increasing range of activities we do on mattresses, and which \u201cdoesn\u2019t dictate which way you should sleep, or even how many people can rest here together\u201d. It \u201csounds like a Swedish orgy scenario\u201d, says Self, \u201cbut it is a serious attempt to question the structure of families\u201d.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"21837fa335d16a9eba93694937ccd546a49fe73a\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/21837fa335d16a9eba93694937ccd546a49fe73a/0_0_1241_1754/708.jpg\" alt=\"Artworks by OK-RM and Matthieu Lavanchy from the Home Economics exhibition\" width=\"708\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Artwork by OK-RM and Matthieu Lavanchy from the Home Economics exhibition.</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>If some of this sounds dreamy and theoretical, at least one idea has some prospect of becoming reality, as a London borough is interested in exploring it. \u201cYears\u201d, developed with the architect <a href=\"http://www.julia-king.com/\">Julia King</a> and the community builders <a href=\"http://nakedhouse.org/\">Naked House</a>, imagines a \u201cshell\u201d stripped of all the fixtures and fittings (\u201cnot even a kitchen sink\u201d) with which developers make a chunk of their profits. They have worked out a way to lock resale price of the home into the value of the shell only, whatever might be added to it. The idea is both to lower the price and to liberate interior works from concerns about resale value. Whatever you do to the home is because it suits you, not because it puts the price up.</p> <p>Self, Bose and Williams represent one version of the future of British architecture. They are intelligent, articulate, political, keen to contribute to society, a bit bolshy. They do not view their trade as the creation of magical individual buildings by famous and singular magicians, but as collaborative and wide-ranging. \u201cArchitecture is the most powerful design method that exists,\u201d says Self, \u201cand as soon as you apply it you can get absolutely incredible results.\u201d</p> <p>Architecture, for them, includes the conception of mortgages that enable one kind of a home rather than another. Williams regards his time spent in municipal offices, in which he does not directly design buildings, as architecture. At the same time they stress the importance of other kinds of expertise, such as those of their collaborators and advisers in Venice: \u201cArchitects shouldn\u2019t design everything but they should be involved in everything.\u201d</p> <p>We are holding this conversation in an example of the <a href=\"http://www.futurohouse.co.uk/\">Futuro House</a>, a UFO-like structure conceived in the 1960s by the Finnish architect Matti Suuronen, restored by the artist Craig Barnes, and currently standing on the roof of Central Saint Martins college of art and design in London. It\u2019s engaging but also cautionary in that only around 60 now exist, an example of architects\u2019 penchant for imagining futures that never arrive. Their mistake is usually to express themselves through fixed forms, a fate that might also befall some of the ingenious constructions in the British pavilion. Certainly no one expects them all to become reality. But there is thinking and imagination there more flexible than Suuronen\u2019s that could contribute to the future ways of living on this crowded island.</p>",

A lovely week, really, with the sun, and the elections, and all. Um. Anyway, come with me, dear reader, as I find programmes to change your mood, whether you want to laugh, cry or be freaked out.</p> <p>If it\u2019s laughter you want, then may I recommend David Quantick\u2019s second series of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07blq4n\"><strong>52 First Impressions</strong></a>. Performing for a live audience, Quantick tells tales from a life spent interviewing pop stars and working with famous people. It\u2019s less glamorous than that sounds. It\u2019s also human.</p> <p>Too many Radio 4 comedy shows feel detached from the person hosting them: overworked scripts and elaborate setups can kill a connection with the listener. Quantick\u2019s show is funny, because he is a funny person and knows how to write jokes. But it\u2019s also funny, because it\u2019s him, in front of a crowd, and not a professional comedian reading his lines. There\u2019s a realness about the show that brings you closer and makes you laugh for the fun, as well as the jokes. Also, his presentation skills are a lot better than in the first series.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There were many small triumphs: one couple rejoiced when their son called them his parents rather than his mums</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b078xpfn\"><strong>For Better Or Worse</strong></a>, about gay marriage, brought a tear to my eye. Specifically when Will Anderson and Ford Hickson read out their vows, which were made a long time before civil partnerships or gay marriage became legal. One of the vows was about remembering those who were no longer with them: they got married in 1994, the year that the greatest number of people died from Aids.</p> <p>Oh, I really enjoyed this programme. Love that overcomes obstacles is the most romantic love of all, and it was heartening to hear from so many couples, committed to each other no matter what anyone else thought. There were a few shocks, too. I wasn\u2019t surprised to hear that gay couples \u2013 male and female \u2013 tend to share parenting more equally than straight couples; but it was a jolt to discover that, when it comes to divorce, for every one male couple divorcing, there are three female ones. Male couples seem to negotiate more freely about sex: we heard from one couple who share lovers they find through apps. Female couples tend to go for serial monogamy: when it\u2019s over, it\u2019s over.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"92ed464e16b9fef7030d697cbed135873a3f9032\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/92ed464e16b9fef7030d697cbed135873a3f9032/0_1_3000_1799/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Peter McGraith and David Cabreza on their wedding day in 2014.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A blast of liberation: Peter McGraith and David Cabreza on their wedding day in 2014.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Rex/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>There were many small triumphs in the show: one couple rejoiced inwardly when their son called them his \u201cparents\u201d rather than his \u201cmums\u201d. Another couple felt cheered by being able to go through customs as married. But still, it isn\u2019t always easy. Parents able to accept their grownup child\u2019s same-sex relationship don\u2019t always prove to be so liberated when that relationship leads to marriage. Presenter Peter McGraith had some great lines \u2013 \u201cthat blast of liberation you feel when you realise that you are the thing that people loathe or pity and you feel good about it\u201d \u2013 and he asked the right questions. McGraith married his partner, David , in 2014, the first gay wedding to be registered in the UK, and we heard a little blast of cheering and car horns bipping at the top of the show. Great.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"71b097d0ea7a31bb6774d9685dfe3ee82d5bf6ff\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/71b097d0ea7a31bb6774d9685dfe3ee82d5bf6ff/179_0_1566_939/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Leo Johnson and Timandra Harkness\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Future shock: Leo Johnson and Timandra Harkness.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: BBC</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>And finally, prepare to be scared by <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b04gyx0t\"><strong>FutureProofing</strong></a><strong>.</strong> I\u2019ve missed this series so far, but will definitely catch up on the strength of this week\u2019s show, which looked at future trends around crime. What crimes will be committed? Who will commit them and how? How will they be dealt with? We were warned that as our gadgets become smarter \u2013 think video baby monitors, clever cars, heating that\u2019s programmable from your phone \u2013 the potential for actual physical harm becomes much more likely.</p> <p>Forget credit card fraud. Consider the fact that car brakes can be hacked into, or pacemakers, or aeroplanes, or entire hospitals. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve chosen examples that have actually happened,\u201d said the expert. Waaaah! I wasn\u2019t a huge fan of the banter between the presenters, Timandra Harkness and Leo Johnson, but individually they were excellent, asking tricky questions and following up woolly answers. And, God, it\u2019s all so <em>Black Mirror</em>\u2026</p>",

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>Roger Bundy was surprised when he got a penalty charge notice for \u00a370 for failing to pay the toll on the Dartford Crossing in east London. Not least because he had not used either the bridge or the tunnel that carry the M25 across the Thames Estuary, linking Kent to Essex.</p> <p>Bundy, from Blandford Forum in Dorset, was the victim of a licence plate misreading by the automated camera system which incorrectly fined his blue Nissan Navara instead of the white van that had gone through the toll in May 2015. Almost a year later he is being threatened with legal action to recover a debt he doesn\u2019t owe, for a journey he never made.</p> <p>A camera system which can recognise number plates replaced toll booths at the busy crossing in 2014, and has so far generated 3.5m penalty charge notices for drivers who have failed to pay. A series of complaints to <em>The Observer</em> has shown how the system is far from foolproof, however, with cameras misreading number plates and people being pursued for fines they are unaware of. This can in turn lead to a complaints system which can appear inflexible.</p> <p>Thousands of those incorrectly charged simply pay up to avoid the risk of an escalating fine, according to Auto Express. Last August the motoring magazine found that while the vast majority of appeals were upheld (80%), only one in 25 motorists actually appealed a fine.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/jan/13/penalty-dart-charge-system-dartford-crossing-remote-payment\">We\u2019re all paying the penalty for the new Dart Charge system</a> </p> </aside>  <p>In Bundy\u2019s case the camera confused a C with a G on the plate, an apparently easy mistake to rectify given that the charge notice included the photo. His wife Clare called Highways England, which administers the charge, and pointed out the discrepancy. \u201cI spent 20 minutes trying to get through to someone who kept telling me I had to pay, even though he could see the problem,\u201d she said.</p> <p>In September a second demand was sent and, because Bundy had not paid the original fine, it had risen to \u00a3105 plus the \u00a32.50 toll. Again Clare rang to point out it wasn\u2019t their vehicle. \u201cOver the 25 minute call I was repeatedly told to pay up and was not allowed to be put through to a manager,\u201d she says.</p> <p>In December Bundy, from Blandford Forum, Dorset, was threatened with court proceedings and in March a debt collecting firm advised that they would commence legal action within 14 days. \u201cI sent a letter to Dart Charge [the system for paying the toll], the court and the bailiffs with photos of our vehicle and their photo of the white van,\u201d says Bundy. \u201cNow I\u2019m waiting, wondering if the next knock at the door is the bailiffs.\u201d</p> <p>Only when <em>the Observer</em> contacted Highways England about the case did the agency acknowledge the mistake. \u201cThere have clearly been errors here, both when issuing the penalty and in not cancelling it in a timely manner when the mistake was first brought to our attention,\u201d a spokesperson says. \u201cWe have written to the Bundys to apologise in full and confirm that all enforcement action has been cancelled.\u201d</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>There have clearly been errors here, both when issuing the penalty and in not cancelling it in a timely manner</p> <footer> <cite>Highways England</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Laura Townshend of Basildon, Essex, also received a fine for a crossing she never made, last July. In her case she had sold the vehicle in question. She says she sent Highways England the official paperwork proving she was not the registered keeper at the time of the offence. The only response, two months later, was a threat of court proceedings unless she paid \u00a3105 plus the \u00a32.50 toll.</p> <p>Alarmed, she paid up. \u201cI went to pay the fine online and found another fine due for a crossing with the same car in February. I had not received any notification of this, nor did I make a crossing on that date,\u201d she says. \u201cAs even a letter from the DVLA seems not to be enough to prove I don\u2019t own the car, I made a very bad decision and paid both fines \u2013 \u00a3215 \u2013 to avoid a court case and costs.\u201d Highways England claims never to have received her supporting documents and says it will consider a refund if she resends them.</p> <p>Many more motorists who do use the crossing, one of the UK\u2019s busiest, fail to pay the charge because of confusing signs. The only warning of the levy is a large C which is identical to the symbol for the congestion charge, the \u00a311.50 fee for vehicles entering central London. A recent poll by the AA found that 60% of drivers mistook it for the latter, an entirely different fee which is not payable on the Dartford crossing.</p> <p>Non-Londoners are likely to have no clue of the symbol\u2019s meaning. When the booths were bulldozed to reduce congestion, it seems the levy went from being a toll to a \u201ccongestion charge\u201d and was increased by 20%. This distinction was never explained, nor is the fee called a congestion charge on the website, but the new terminology gets round the fact that the levy, introduced to cover the costs of building the Dartford Bridge, is still in place 13 years after it was paid for.</p> <p>Nowhere on the signs is the price of a crossing mentioned, and no payment details are given. Drivers are merely invited to \u201cfind us online\u201d before midnight the following day, a problem for those without internet access and baffling for the thousands of overseas visitors who use the route to and from Stansted and Gatwick airports.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>I paid my crossings, but the payments were used to pay for ones made the week before I hired the car</p> <footer> <cite>Shirley Palframan</cite> </footer> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Some in leased or rented cars have been fined, even though they have paid the fee, because Dart Charge\u2019s system has misapplied their payment to a previous customer. Shirley Palframan, who lives in Brunei, found \u00a3150 had been deducted from her account by car rental company Easirent for a crossing made before she visited the UK.</p> <p>\u201cI paid for my crossings, but the payments were used to pay for crossings made the week before I hired the car. This meant my journeys were showing as unpaid, resulting in penalty charge notices and additional administration fees from the hire company,\u201d she says.</p> <p>Receipts for her payments and her car rental failed to move Highways England, which only refunded the charge when <em>The Observer</em> got involved. According to Easirent, misapplied payments have been a frequent problem for customers who, as they are not the registered keeper of the vehicle, cannot appeal their fines directly.</p> <p>Highways England promised that changes to the system should minimise such mistakes, but, according to a local rental company, Chelmsford Van Hire, the problem is still so prevalent it has given up charging administration fees to customers who incur penalty charges because it can\u2019t tell who is liable.</p> <p>\u201cPayments for these vehicles are still being put against previous unpaid crossings made by other customers, due to the fact that, unlike the London congestion charge website, Dart Charge don\u2019t have a facility to specify what date you are paying for,\u201d says director Deborah Lashmar, who wrote to us to vent her frustration.</p> <p>Frequent users of the crossing can create either a pre-paid or a pay-as-you-go account to pay the charge automatically, but even this does not safeguard them from fines. Tina Mackenzie of Basildon, Essex, faces a bill of \u00a31,397 for 13 crossings because her pre-paid account dropped below the \u00a310 minimum last November. It should have been topped up automatically, but unbeknownst to her, her bank declined Dart Charge\u2019s request for \u00a310 due to insufficient funds.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/nov/10/charged-150-toll-dartford-bridge\">I was charged \u00a3150 in tolls when I wasn\u2019t even in\u00a0the country</a> </p> </aside>  <p>It wasn\u2019t until February that the first penalty charge notices were sent to her employer from whom she leases her car. \u201cHad this first penalty been served in good time I would have been aware that my Dart Charge account had run out of funds and I would have topped it up,\u201d she says. Highways England says warning emails were sent, even if they were not received, but after <em>the Observer</em> intervened it apologised and cancelled the charges.</p> <p>The agency insists that 93% of motorists comply with the system and the signs are perfectly adequate. Those who misunderstand are given leeway. \u201cThe first time we issue a penalty letter we give the vehicle owner the chance to pay the charge within two weeks and avoid any fine,\u201d a spokesperson says.</p> <p>For many of those who are erroneously fined and refuse to pay up, however, the system can prove inflexible. The Dartford Crossing is more or less a captive market since the nearest alternative river crossing is a congested 15 miles away, which means that a crucial route that was supposed to become toll free in 2003 is earning the government millions.</p> <h2>Paying the penalty</h2> <p>Spanning the river Thames between Dartford and Thurrock, some 50m vehicle journeys are made each year on the Dartford Crossing, <em>writes Shane Hickey</em>. Sixteen miles east of central London, it forms a link between the Kent and Essex sides of the M25. Southbound traffic uses the Queen Elizabeth II bridge, while northbound traffic goes through the two two-lane Dartford tunnels.</p> <p>Since November 2014, instead of stopping at a barrier to pay at a booth, motorists have had to pay remotely - online, at retail outlets or by phone. Around 140,000 motorists use the bridge every day. A single journey for a car costs \u00a32.50, and there is a penalty charge of \u00a370 if this goes unpaid. That is reduced to \u00a335 if paid within two weeks, but increases to \u00a3105 after four weeks.</p> <p>The changes to the toll system were introduced to ease congestion at the busy junction by removing the need for drivers to stop and pay.</p> <p>When the scheme started drivers were urged to beware of fake wesbites which clamed to be portals to pay for the charge, in a similar manner to scams to pay the London congestion charge, or to provide the free European health card, driving licence renewals or tax returns.</p>",

      "body": "<p>The Malaysian pianist Dennis Lee\u2019s recording of works by Szymanowski <a href=\"http://www.hyperion-records.co.uk/dc.asp?dc=D_CDH55081\" title=\"\">for Hyperion</a> won high praise for his handling of the music\u2019s complex sonorities, and again, this time in Debussy, it is the clarity of Lee\u2019s playing that first strikes the listener. Despite the impressionistic intent of Debussy\u2019s piano pieces, their shifting harmonies and open pedal passages need clear direction to succeed. Jardins sous la pluie from <em>Estampes</em> (1903) is just such an example. Lee never lets the ceaseless raindrops wash away the contours of the piece. That same confident and yet sensitive approach imbues the first set of <em>Images</em> (1904) and the bubbling optimism of <em>Deux Arabesques</em> (1888). Hugely enjoyable.</p>",

      "body": "<p>Amir Khan would have loved to tell the world personally what he thought about another painful evening of his intriguing career, because he has never been one to dodge a challenge. But he had to deliver a second-hand message from a nearby hospital here on Saturday night to reassure fans and inquiring writers he had recovered fully from a devastating knockout by Saul \u201cCanelo\u201d \u00c1lvarez a couple of hours earlier.</p> <p>No amount of sympathy from well-meaning friends could wash away the pain and disappointment he felt after a nano-second of distraction cost him consciousness and left him in a dazed heap at the Mexican\u2019s feat near the end of six tense rounds at the T-Mobile Arena.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/may/08/amir-khan-saul-canelo-alvarez-middleweight-title-fight-boxing\">Canelo \u00c1lvarez knocks out Amir Khan and eyes Gennady Golovkin fight</a> </p> </aside>  <p>\u201cI\u2019m OK everyone,\u201d he said through the promoter, Oscar De La Hoya. \u201cThat\u2019s boxing for you. Congratulations to Canelo. Much love to all the fans.\u201d</p> <p>The promoter, Oscar De La Hoya, was glowing in his praise for the loser, whom he has always admired, declaring he would be back to challenge for world titles, but not at middleweight.</p> <p>\u201cWe took precautionary measures and Amir Khan went to hospital,\u201d he said. \u201cHe had an evaluation and he\u2019s OK.\u201d</p> <p>De La Hoya added: \u201cAmir Khan is one of the bravest fighters on the planet. He didn\u2019t lose anything today. He will come back. I\u2019m telling you one thing, he can beat anyone at 147 [lbs] or 154. There is no shame in his performance. He was up on one scorecard and the other two were really close. I had it even. His speed and amateur experience... I didn\u2019t expect him to be this fast. He\u2019s a gifted, disciplined boxer. He got caught with one punch, which was coming at him lightning fast with tons of power.</p> <p>\u201cCanelo said he was really frustrated in the early rounds, and that is what Amir does to you. I\u2019ve always said Amir is too brave for his own good. There will not be another middleweight with speed like Amir Khan\u2019s.\u201d</p> <p>Khan had \u201cdared to be great\u201d, as De La Hoya said of the Bolton fighter\u2019s attempt to overcome the disadvantage of coming up two weight divisions and, briefly, he looked as if he might defy logic, the critics and the bookmakers. For nearly quarter of an hour, he produced probably the best pure boxing performance of his 35-bout professional career since winning Olympic silver 12 years ago.</p> <p>Indeed, he boxed very much on Saturday night as he did as that brilliant, precocious teenager in Athens against the renowned Cuban amateur Mario Kindelan, circling and pecking, each quicksilver jab calculated to sting without retribution. Alvarez was confused and frustrated \u2013 but patient.</p> <p>Khan was 23 seconds from the comfort of the bell, having protected his chin assiduously for nearly six rounds, but he knew in the horrible aftermath of defeat that he had done only half the job of holding at bay a fighter who probably outweighed him on the night by a stone.</p> <p>Before he left for hospital, Khan said in the ring, \u201cI\u2019m one of the fighters to step in the ring with whoever. I was getting in the ring with a big guy. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t make it to the end. I\u2019m naturally a 147-lbs fighter, and this challenge came and it was hard to turn down. I will probably go back down to that weight.\u201d</p> <p>His trainer Virgil Hunter was reluctant to give the winner much credit, accusing him of not giving the fans \u201cthe fight they want to see\u201d, adding, \u201cAmir set the tone.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/sport/gallery/2016/may/08/canelo-alvarez-v-amir-khan-wbc-middleweight-title-in-pictures\">Amir Khan knocked out by Canelo \u00c1lvarez: WBC middleweight title \u2013 in pictures</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The challenger should not be faulted for his effort \u2013 which is never less than total \u2013 but there was an inevitability about the ending. \u00c1lvarez had been swinging hard, and missing more than he landed, but there was a look in his eye that screamed attack. After giving up the first four rounds to an opponent who might have been boxing on roller skates, the champion waited for an opening, his long right arm rifling over Khan\u2019s limp left and crashing on to the side of his jaw, which swivelled like a light bulb being removed.</p> <p>As the lights went out for Khan, the cheers went up for \u00c1lvarez, a hero to so many poor Mexicans, at home and in the United States, where they have had to suffer in recent months the scorn of Donald Trump, who sweepingly branded them as unwelcome and untrustworthy guests. This was their moment of vindication. Trump had sensibly stayed away. But he knew what they thought of him.</p> <p>For all that, Hunter reckoned \u00c1lvarez short-changed his public. Until the perfect punch landed, the champion fought the fight he was allowed to by a switched-on challenger.</p> <p>Later, attention naturally turned to the first genuine mega-fight the sport has had since Floyd Mayweather Jr and Manny Pacquiao finally swapped blows last year. That was an anti-climax. But \u00c1lvarez taking on Gennady Golovkin \u2013 who was ringside \u2013 to unify their strands of the middleweight championship would almost certainly not disappoint, and would most likely end in one of them getting knocked out. That is a prospect to excite fight fans.</p> <p>\u201cGolovkin, where are you?\u201d De La Hoya shouted from the ring apron at the post-fight press conference, to no reply. \u201cWherever you are, make sure you answer your phone tomorrow. If we come to an agreement, we will let everyone know.\u201d</p> <p>Although \u00c1lvarez called out Golovkin from the ring, his connections said earlier in the week he was three fights away from such a match. It will not be an easy fight to negotiate.</p> <p>Pressed on the contradiction, De La Hoya insisted, \u201cI\u2019m not talking to any other fighter \u2013 just Triple G, correct. I have all his representatives on speed dial. If that\u2019s the fight that everyone wants, if that\u2019s the fight Canelo wants, I\u2019ll get some rest and started making some early-morning phone calls.\u201d</p>",

Last election we chose Tony Abbott. The election before that we didn\u2019t choose anyone. And the election before that we chose Kevin Rudd. </p> <p>It\u2019s time to lift our game.</p> <p>Then again, elections are choices. We can only choose from what\u2019s on offer \u2013 and some years offer slim-pickings indeed. But this year the menu looks a lot better.</p> <p>In fact, it is the most exciting time to be a ... no, sorry, I won\u2019t go that far.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/08/eight-things-to-know-at-the-start-of-this-eight-week-election-campaign\">Eight things to know at the start of this eight-week election campaign</a> </p> </aside>  <p>But we do have two good options for prime minister.</p> <p>Yes, I mean that. Bill Shorten and Malcolm Turnbull are not perfect individuals, granted, but who among us is without flaws? But neither man is a narcissistic egomaniacal control freak nor a robotic sloganeering exercise freak. </p> <p>So already we can predict our choice this time might just be better than before.</p> <p>But we are choosing not just a person and a personality. We are also choosing policies. We are choosing between competing visions for our nation\u2019s future. We are choosing (on most issues, anyway) what we want our government to do in our name and with our money.</p> <p>I have valued this aspect of Australian democracy since moving from Ohio to Sydney in 1994. We don\u2019t run a presidential system down under. We ask \u2013 no, demand, through compulsory voting \u2013 that each of us pay attention to the problems we face and the policy solutions each side offers. Some of us may only tune in for the 20 minutes it takes to vote on election day, but most of us spend a bit more time deciding which party we will support. And we all (well, mostly all) turn up to vote. And that is awesome.</p> <p>By contrast, look at the horror show that is taking place in America at the moment. Donald Trump! I hold a BA (Hons) in political science from an American university. That means I am qualified to offer expert analysis of Trump\u2019s success in the Republican primaries. Here it is: </p> <p>WTF America? </p> <p>In all seriousness, I do know a thing or two about American democracy. In 1990 I was an intern in the office of Ohio Governor Dick Celeste (a very progressive Democrat whose name gave rise to a charming bumper sticker that adorned many a Republican\u2019s car: \u201cDick Celeste before he dicks you\u201d). If we had compulsory voting in America Dick Celeste might have ended up president in 1992. Maybe I could have been an intern for the US president in the 1990s \u2013 imagine how differently my life might have turned out.</p> <p>But I digress.</p> <p>American democracy \u2013 lacking party discipline in the House of Representatives and the Senate, lacking compulsory voting and lacking direct cabinet accountability to the legislature and the people \u2013 is left, well, lacking.</p> <p>Australian democracy truly is remarkable. Yes, we had a few far-from-perfect prime ministers in the past few years, but we survived. In fact, compared to the overwhelming majority of nations on earth, we thrived, even through the global financial crisis. The Australian political system \u2013 the Westminster system \u2013 ensured that survival. Surprise, surprise, I believe that when a group of MPs removes an unsuitable prime minister (or premier) it is not evidence that the system is broken, but rather that it works as it should for the good of the nation.</p> <p>And if you don\u2019t agree with me, let\u2019s chat next year when President Trump, an economic and foreign policy disaster elected by a fraction of the eligible voters in America, is unable to be removed from office by his disgruntled fellow Republicans in Congress.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2016/may/08/poll-of-polls-who-will-win-the-australian-election\">Poll of polls: who will win the Australian election?</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Australia, on 2 July <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2016/may/08/poll-of-polls-who-will-win-the-australian-election\">we have a clear choice between the two major parties</a>, the Liberal/National Coalition and the Australian Labor party, when it comes to most of our biggest challenges. Granted, there are no major differences between Labor and the Coalition regarding asylum seekers and refugees. There are no really significant differences when it comes to taxation arrangements for superannuation. And there is absolute agreement about commitment to the National Disability Insurance Scheme. There is a lot of similarity on trade and on encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship. And there is now no major difference on the major parties\u2019 commitment to build submarines in South Australia. Also, too bad if you are a smoker \u2013 both major parties agree it\u2019s time to give up or strike it rich. And there is \u2013 as usual \u2013 a definite unity ticket between the major parties on national security.</p> <p>So where do our choices lie? </p> <p>Education \u2013 primary and secondary. Education \u2013 training, vocational and university. Taxation, especially as it relates to company tax and housing. Hospital funding and primary health care. Foreign aid. Funding infrastructure. Pensions, especially for seniors and families. Industrial relations and workplace pay and conditions. Childcare. Paid paternity leave. Same-sex marriage. Climate change. </p> <p> Commentators (of which I am now one) will tell you this election is about who is best placed to fix the structural challenges in the budget and return Australia to surplus.</p> <p>Voters will make their decision in this election as they do in every other election: which side is most likely to make my life and my children\u2019s lives better?</p> <p>It\u2019s time to choose, Australia. It\u2019s time to pick a side. Choose wisely.</p>",

      "body": "<p>\u201cThere\u2019s a great book in this upheaval, and she\u2019d be the ideal chronicler of the times. She\u2019s always had the eye. For most people, what lies outside our front door is tragedy. For Enola, it\u2019s material.\u201d</p> <p>So says 99-year-old Douglas Mandible, patriarch of the titular family in Lionel Shriver\u2019s 13th novel. He\u2019s speaking in 2031 of his daughter, Nollie, a former bestselling author back in the days when people still paid for books, but his words could apply equally well to their creator. Shriver too has always had the eye \u2013 an unflinching gaze trained on aspects of contemporary American life most of us prefer not to look at for too long, from teenage violence in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/27/fiction.features\" title=\"\"><em>We Need to Talk About Kevin </em></a>to the obesity crisis in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/may/11/big-brother-lionel-shriver-review\" title=\"\"><em>Big Brother</em></a>, by way of the US healthcare system in <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/mar/28/lionel-shriver-so-much-for-that\" title=\"\"><em>So Much for That</em></a>. With <em>The Mandibles: A Family 2029-2047</em>, she turns that unsparing focus on the economy, following the present precariousness of the global markets to its logical conclusion \u2013 a near future in which the dollar collapses, America is relegated from superpower to pariah state, and civilisation all but breaks down.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2013/apr/21/lionel-shriver-profile-big-brother\">Lionel Shriver: time to talk about  her big brother | Observer profile</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Through the four generations of the Mandible family (their curious name carrying connotations of being chewed up), she explores what financial ruin looks like to those who have the most to lose from it. In 2029 \u2013 a century on from the first Great Depression \u2013 Douglas is sitting pretty in\u00a0his plush care home on a family fortune built two generations earlier from the manufacture of diesel engines. Though the rest of the family see little trickle-down \u2013 a source of great resentment to Douglas\u2019s son, Carter, who is pushing 70 and still waiting for his inheritance \u2013 they live comfortably in the expectation of financial security. It turns out there is no such thing.</p> <p>As the dollar crashes, it is replaced by a new reserve currency, the bancor (an international monetary unit originally proposed by John Maynard Keynes), administered by a Russian- and Chinese-led consortium of countries that pointedly does not include the US. Some smell an \u201corganised fiscal coup\u201d \u2013 the words of Dante Alvarado, America\u2019s first Latino president, whose response is to lock down his country in a state of \u201cfiscal warfare\u201d. All gold reserves, down to wedding rings, are forfeit to the government. Hiding gold becomes treason. So does owning bancors. No\u00a0one can leave the country with more than $100 in cash. Most significantly, the president declares a \u201creset\u201d on the national debt, rendering all treasury bonds void. The Mandible fortune is wiped out at a stroke.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Teenagers in 2029 are called Goog and Fifa; there are fleeting references to \u201cEd Balls\u2019s government\u201d</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>If the novel is initially slow to gather momentum, it\u2019s because the set-up it requires is so complex, and because Shriver\u2019s research is so exhaustive. Thus the reader is fed tranches of economic theory in the early chapters, made scarcely more palatable for being dressed up as dinner-party conversations. Carter\u2019s self-important son-in-law, Lowell, is a tenured professor of economics, which allows him to hold forth authoritatively on the background to the crash (though, ironically, he discovers that his job is among the most dispensable as the economy implodes).</p> <p>But once the premise has been established as all too chillingly plausible, the novel revs up into a multifaceted family saga where marital, sibling and inter-generational relationships fracture in the face of increasingly punitive sanctions and shortages. The characters\u2019 middle-class assumptions crumble as life is stripped down to a matter of mere survival: a college degree in design or music becomes an unimaginable luxury (Lowell\u2019s 17-year-old daughter turns instead to prostitution) and they look back with incredulity on a world where people had the leisure and means to indulge affectations.</p> <p>Shriver presents this future with her familiar undercurrent of black humour and a sly nod to the reader; having gone to so much trouble to make the story\u2019s economic foundation solid, she also reminds us now and again of its artifice. \u201cPlots set in the future are about what people fear in the present. They\u2019re not about the future at all,\u201d Lowell pompously tells his daughter. \u201cThe truth is, throughout\u00a0history things keep getting better\u2026 But writers and film-makers keep predicting that everything\u2019s going to fall apart. It\u2019s almost funny,\u201d he adds, right before everything falls apart.</p> <p>She also has fun with the tropes of speculative fiction. Teenagers in 2029 are called Goog and Fifa; there are fleeting references to \u201cEd Balls\u2019s government\u201d and, later, the \u201cChelsea Clinton administration\u201d; and slang has evolved, so that by 2047 the word bullshit has been replaced by treasury, as in: \u201cYou\u2019re talking treasury, kid.\u201d</p> <p>But for all the sharp-edged comedy (a thriving Mexico builds a border wall to keep out desperate illegal Americans), and for all that it ends with a knowing Orwellian wink, <em>The Mandibles </em>is a profoundly frightening portrait of how quickly the agreed rules of society can fall apart without money to grease the wheels. I finished it and immediately started stockpiling toilet paper.</p> <p><em>The Mandibles: A Family, 2029-2047 is published by Borough Press (\u00a316.99). </em><a href=\"https://bookshop.theguardian.com/catalog/product/view/id/391688/s/the-mandibles-a-family-2029-2047/?utm_source=editoriallink&amp;utm_medium=merch&amp;utm_campaign=article\" title=\"\"><em>Click here to buy it for \u00a312.99</em></a><em> </em></p>",

He is under threat from inside now.\u201d </p> <p>The international community, according to Bennett, should demand that the north refrains from developing weapons, put a cap on the ones it has now and stops indoctrinating the population to see the US as an eternal enemy if it is serious about peace.</p> <p>He pointed out that in the past Pyongyang has declared its intention to attack outside powers if the regime is under threat. \u201cA North Korea with 20 or 30 or 50 nuclear weapons is a direct threat to China, and not just to the U.S,\u201d he said.</p> <p>Others viewed the congress in a similar light. \u201cThey want to declare Kim\u2019s legitimate rule for the next 50 years,\u201d said Victor Cha, Korea chair at the Washington-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies. \u201cHigh-level purging by Kim in advance of the party congress suggests some internal churn.\u201d</p> <p>In remarks apparently aimed at nations such as South Korea, Japan and the United States, Kim suggested that the nation will look to internationalise further, and \u201cimprove and normalize the relations with those countries which respect the sovereignty of the DPRK and are friendly towards it, though they had been hostile toward it in the past\u201d.</p> <p>Toward that end, it is likely that a more outward-looking party elite will be selected. \u201cThe congress is likely to close by electing new party leaders, most importantly to the party\u2019s central commission,\u201d said Alison Evans, senior analyst at IHS Country Risk. \u201cThis cohort \u2013 like that elected to the legislature in March 2014 \u2013 is likely to be relatively young, with more women and individuals who have experience abroad.\u201d</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/26/north-korea-releases-propaganda-film-showing-washington-under-nuclear-attack\">North Korea releases propaganda film showing Washington under nuclear attack</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Pyongyang has seen development in recent years due to the rise of an informal economy, in which dollars can be traded for the local currency on the black market and many haggle goods to stay afloat. The regime apparently turns a blind eye to such activity as it has allowed the nation to fend off crises such as the famines of the 1990s.</p> <p>Evans said that since Kim Jong Un came to power, \u201cthere have been minimal economic reforms, despite his overarching policy agenda of <em>\u2026</em>\u2018dual progress\u2019 in both military and economic terms.\u201d</p> <p>Foreign journalists have been kept away from the congress, despite being invited into the country to cover the event.</p>",

      "body": "<p>We\u2019ve all heard the importance of looking within, finding yourself, and being authentic to what you see. What could possibly be wrong with that?</p> <p>Actually, Chinese philosophers 2,000 years ago would say our emphasis on self-discovery has led us dangerously astray and constrains us.</p> <p>Consider the self the way that they did: there is no true self and no self you can discover in the abstract by looking within. Such a self would be little more than a snapshot of you at that particular moment in time. We are messy, multifaceted selves who go through life bumping up against other messy, multifaceted selves. Who we are at any given moment develops through our constantly shifting interactions with other people.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Being untrue to ourselves helps us break bad patterns. Confucius taught that we must \u2018overcome the self\u2019</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>Philosophers, such as Confucius, advocated living \u201cas if\u201d. They said that by engaging in as-if rituals \u2013 which are the very opposite of the sincere, authentic approach to ourselves \u2013 we will develop into better human beings.</p> <p>How does this work? Consider a game of hide-and-seek with a child. When you play at being a befuddled adult who can\u2019t hide very well, both you and the child know you are just pretending. But by taking on these roles you have both broken from your usual patterns. The triumphant child experiences competence over an adult; the adult is the fallible, vulnerable person bested by a child.</p> <p>We break from who we are when we note the not-so-good patterns we\u2019ve fallen into and then actively work to shift them \u2013 \u201cas if\u201d we were different people in that moment. Such opportunities exist all around us. When we greet someone cheerfully even though we\u2019re feeling down at the moment; when we calmly respond to an infuriating person even though our \u201creal\u201d feeling is anger. In all such instances, we enter an alternate reality in which we draw on different sides of ourselves and each time we do so we come back slightly changed.</p> <p>Being untrue to ourselves helps us break bad patterns. Confucius (who presumably saw the dangers of too much self-absorption and would have almost assuredly been horrified by the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/careers/careers-blog/myers-briggs-employee-personality-test-accurate\">Myers-Briggs test</a>) taught that we must \u201covercome the self\u201d. His rituals liberated people from the notion of any sort of essential self.</p> <p>But if there\u2019s no essential self and you are always changing, you might wonder how you could ever decide what\u2019s best for you. Here again, the notion of living life by breaking from who you think you are can help. Consider the example of a student we know: throughout secondary school he\u2019d excelled in maths and science, so when he went to university he expected to continue along that path, and planned on studying economics. He had an interest in Chinese, but quit after a term because learning a foreign language didn\u2019t seem to be a strength of his.</p> <p>After encountering Chinese philosophy, he realised that he didn\u2019t need to limit himself to his strengths and proclivities, nor did he have to stick to a plan he\u2019d previously made, so he returned to Chinese, did a postgraduate degree in Asian studies, and now works as a diplomat.

      "body": "<p><strong>Evening, Friday </strong>Dinner table, with extended family. You breathe out with the breath of a thousand potatoes, and prepare yourself for the traditional digestif: an elderly relative explaining why the <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/02/labour-suspends-two-councillors-alleged-antisemitism\">Labour party is antisemitic</a>. This is an argument that can be imposed on to any topic \u2013 Germany, the countryside, boating. But today it is the Labour party, and as usual you are arguing on the side of \u201cno\u201d, with your pleas to interrogate the source of the story, and to look at individuals rather than write off the whole of the party, or of Suffolk, or of the seas. But this is an unwinnable fight, because on their side they have memories of siblings being shuffled on to trains, and their homes being bombed, and with that comes the sureness that it is only a matter of time. So you settle into your ice cream and talk about Beyonc\u00e9 instead.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>As they were crossing the road, the men at the tables started chanting: \u2018We hate Jews.\u2019 You say: I\u2019m calling the police</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>Midday, Saturday</strong> Driving through London on a warm afternoon, you\u2019re unaware of an anti-war demonstration happening near Hyde Park. \u201cBeep your horn!\u201d people shout, and you do. You hate war. Beep! You\u2019re crawling through the crowds, but it\u2019s fine, you hate war, and you\u2019ve texted your friend to say you\u2019ll be late. Then someone smacks your bonnet: \u201cBeep!\u201d You\u2019ve just beeped, but fine, beep. This group of people, though, their signs say \u201cBoycott Israel\u201d, so you try to avoid eye contact until you\u2019re alongside the less specific banners, even though they keep shouting through the window. If they look in your eyes, they might know. You\u2019re going to Israel for a family wedding soon. You\u2019ve bought a strappy dress. But you haven\u2019t told many people you\u2019re going, and you\u2019re not sure exactly why. You understand Israel as a home, and a holiday destination, and as a symbol. But you can keep those empathies in your head at the same time as this feeling of deep dread at the very bad things, and you can stare ahead through the windscreen with a sense of shallow apology, and you can pretend you haven\u2019t heard the shouting.</p> <p><strong>Afternoon, July</strong> Your parents are leaving your flat, having come to visit your week-old child, her eyes just opening, her 6lb body more story than flesh. They call you from the car. Bit odd. Do you know the man who runs the caf\u00e9 downstairs? As they were crossing the road, the men at the tables started chanting: \u201cWe hate Jews.\u201d You say: I\u2019m calling the police. Please don\u2019t, say your parents. Let\u2019s not make a fuss. Your mum was irritated with herself. She wished that, instead of getting into the car she had told them about her new grandchild, and looked them in the eye and asked about their families, too.</p> <p><strong>Morning, Passover</strong> A non-Jewish friend on the way to your family\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passover_Seder\">seder</a> remarks to a colleague that she didn\u2019t realise Peckham\u2019s Morrisons didn\u2019t have a kosher section. He replies: \u201cOf course not, they all live in north London.\u201d And later she tells you this, her eyebrows knotted, because she\u2019s realised how many times she hears this \u201cthey\u201d, this strange otherness discussed in throwaway euphemisms. Jokes about bagels. A friend\u2019s recurring screech: \u201cI\u2019m Jewish!\u201d upon receipt of the bill at dinner, despite it being a distant bloodline, and despite them being blonde. And while you quietly maintain a fraction of your elderly relatives\u2019 paranoia, you realise you live within clingfilm, protected enough that you don\u2019t have to debate your right to exist, or to hide. Occasionally the seal breaks.</p> <p><strong>The internet, May</strong> You are wearily learning about how you are supposed to feel about antisemitism from a series of clever men whose foreskins, it\u2019s clear, have no bearing on their authority speaking on a subject which 0.5% of the UK navigate daily. You are seeing your experience used as a political grenade. And the worst thing about it, you think as you walk through the glittering of Britain in blossom season, is that your opinions (even yours, the opinions of a pork-eating God-sceptic, of a person only Jew-ish) are already assumed. When yours are firmly wobbly. It\u2019s not possible for you to support Israel uncritically, as your elderly relatives might. But it\u2019s uncomfortable to hear a non-Jew criticise it, in part because that criticism feels stained \u2013 with Yid chants, with the trick-or-treater\u2019s joke about Goldilocks and the big nose, with the swastika sprayed on your fence at night. You don\u2019t want to be forced to have an opinion. Because there is no room for nuance when you\u2019re pressed against the wall.</p> <p><em>Email Eva at <a href=\"mailto:e.wiseman@observer.co.uk\">e.wiseman@observer.co.uk</a> or follow her on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/EvaWiseman?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@EvaWiseman</a></em></p>",

      "headline": "The Sichuan, London: restaurant review",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p><strong>The Sichuan, 14 City Road, London EC1Y 2AA (020 7588 5489). Meal for two, including drinks and service: \u00a375</strong></p> <p>Some communal restaurant dishes are more communal than others. Most of the time we thrill to the novelty of something served as it would be at home \u2013 oh look! A chicken! \u2013 take our share, and then retreat back to that emotional place labelled \u201cmine!\u201d<br /></p> <p>And then there\u2019s the grilled fish at <a href=\"http://www.thesichuan.co.uk/\">the Sichuan</a>, a new Chinese restaurant located on an unlikely stretch of London\u2019s City Road just down from Old Street roundabout. That fish is not something merely to be eaten. It\u2019s a drama full of character and plot twists. It\u2019s an experience to be interrogated, after the fact, by those who were there. As far as I\u2019m concerned there are now only two sorts of people: those who have shared the grilled fish special at the Sichuan and those who have not.</p> <p>The fish was not offered to us. I had asked for a translation of something scribbled in Chinese on a blackboard. All I knew was it cost \u00a328, pretty much the most expensive item available. I was presented with a laminated sheet in the shade of a shiny red double-decker bus: at the top, a photograph of a fish head peeking through a pile of chillies, accompanied by game-show host starbursts; below that, a list of extra ingredients you could add. We were told to order three vegetables to go with it, included in the price. So: black ear fungus, bamboo shoots for squeak, and broccoli because all good boys eat their greens. (Later I noticed the other side of the list included fried \u201ccrispy pork slice\u201d. I think that might be a mistranslation of bacon. I may have to go back.)</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"8d2665b599ad6551a0c3290c4faf770b9aa3d51d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/8d2665b599ad6551a0c3290c4faf770b9aa3d51d/375_454_4769_2861/1000.jpg\" alt=\"The unforgettable grilled fish special.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Feel the burn: the unforgettable grilled fish special.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>What arrived was a three-dimensional still life. Inside a deep oven dish, submerged in a liquor the colour of a 2p piece, lay a hint of fish. At one end was the wave of a tail, at the other, the gawp of a mouth. It took us a while to work out that the bit in between had been opened out to flat before being grilled to a crisp and then smeared with a salted soya bean and chilli paste. Piled on top and bobbing in the liquor were peanuts and shredded spring onions, handfuls of dried red chillies, slices of bamboo shoot and the encouraging greenery of that broccoli. All it needed to complete the pastoral image was a dragonfly with iridescent wings buzzing from leaf to leaf.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>This isn\u2019t a dish you eat so much as explore. It\u2019s an edible rock pool. It\u2019s a\u00a0moment\u2026</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>All of which added to the shock of the first mouthfuls. It looked luscious and savoury. Instead we got a thump of chilli but, more insistently, of numbing Sichuan peppercorns. They made my lips vibrate and fizz. Saliva production went into overdrive. This wasn\u2019t just a taste. It was a total physiological response. I blinked, swallowed, swallowed again and thought about calling for my mum. But she\u2019s dead and would, in any case, have told me not to be such a bloody wuss. So I pushed on. Surely something that looked as deep and intense as this couldn\u2019t be just a brutal punch in the mouth, could it?</p> <p>No, it couldn\u2019t. The Sichuan grilled fish special takes commitment. Like getting a taste for booze in adolescence, you really do have to stay with it. Quickly the numbing passed and the flavours opened up: the pearly flesh of the sea bass, the skin smeared with the savoury bash of the bean paste, the crunch of the peanuts, the quiver of the fungus. This isn\u2019t a dish you eat so much as explore in pursuit of the undiscovered country. It\u2019s an edible rock pool. It\u2019s a moment. I can guarantee you will return to the memory with whomsoever you share it. Do you remember that time we had the grilled fish at the Sichuan? The look on your face? The skin? The way the peanuts and the black ear fungus and the chillies got wrapped up in each other like lovers? Well of course you do.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"c03fa4a36997633ae5e1216248985f5c800a0ed8\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c03fa4a36997633ae5e1216248985f5c800a0ed8/1160_345_3093_3093/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A salad of black ear fungus, a black mass with red dots on a white plate.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018A brisk wake-up\u2019: a salad of black ear fungus.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>None of this should come as a huge surprise. The chef, Zhang Xiao Zhong, has form. We are not used to following Chinese chefs from gig to gig as we do those from France or Italy or Spain, but he deserves to be followed. Zhang was one of those who opened <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2006/may/21/foodanddrink.restaurants\">Bar Shu in Soho a decade ago</a>. It wasn\u2019t the first restaurant to serve Sichuan food in Britain, but it was the first to make a noise about doing so. After that he went to <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/aug/18/hutong-restaurant-review\">Hutong</a>, 40 floors up in the Shard, a place where the view of the food was obscured by the general view; my main memory of Hutong was the floor-to-ceiling windows in the men\u2019s loos, against which the urinals had been built, so you got to piss on the city.</p> <p>After Hutong, the Sichuan must feel like a relief \u2013 a place where you will only ever concentrate on lunch. It\u2019s a high-ceilinged room, with a bit of distressed brickwork and, out back, the view of trees. Finding a Chinese restaurant here is not especially odd. They even have them in Nuneaton these days. Finding a good one, however, is strange. Likewise, while a significant Chinese clientele does not necessarily mean quality \u2013 even <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/feb/24/rudest-restaurant-london-wong-kei\">Wong Kei</a> has one of those \u2013 it\u2019s still intriguing that they\u2019ve already arrived here. It\u2019s the kind of place where bankers could gather, unwatched, to plot ripping off their clients, because none of their colleagues would ever dream of booking a table.</p> <p>The cooking is bold and serious. A salad of black ear fungus with chilli, vinegar, sesame oil and soy is a brisk wake-up. It swiftly starts the appetite\u2019s engine. Another cold dish of roasted and chopped aubergine, the slippery pieces tangled in each other and dressed with sesame seeds, has an equally invigorating acidity. We fall in love quickly with slices of beef fried with cumin and coated in a dark sauce, shouty with umami and fire, and another dish of \u201cfish-fragrant\u201d stir-fried shredded pork with cucumber, more black ear fungus and bamboo shoots.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"5969e1da8029ef862f40641d9485ee4f63b10f84\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5969e1da8029ef862f40641d9485ee4f63b10f84/550_600_3500_2100/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Roasted and chopped aubergine, a plate of yellow strips of aubergine in an orange sauce.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018Invigorating acidity\u2019: roasted and chopped aubergine.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The latter two are slightly sweeter than I recall the food being at Bar Shu, but not unattractively so. I do not intend to order rice, what with carbs being the enemy and all, but letting such sauces go would be criminal. Prices are occasionally the same as at Bar Shu, but for the most part cheaper, and in many places significantly so. But that\u2019s not what you\u2019ll talk about if you eat here. What you\u2019ll talk about is that whole grilled fish. If you have any sense.</p> <h2>Jay\u2019s news bites</h2> <p>\u25a0 Last autumn I proved my incompetence by visiting the glorious <strong>East Pier Smokehouse</strong> at St Monan\u2019s in Fife on the last day of its 2015 season. I\u2019m delighted to report it\u2019s now back open, Wednesday to Sunday from 11am to 5pm. It goes to seven-day opening, with dinner on Saturday and Sunday, from June. Go for hot smoked sea bass, smoked fish curry and the best of the catch at startling prices (<em><a href=\"http://eastpier.co.uk/\">eastpier.co.uk</a></em>).</p> <p>\u25a0 News of another great collaboration: on 28 June <strong>Raymond Blanc</strong> will be cooking alongside his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 <strong>Ollie Dabbous</strong> at the latter\u2019s London restaurant. Both will be cooking two courses using ingredients from Le Manoir\u2019s kitchen garden. Tickets are \u00a3120 (<em><a href=\"http://dabbous.co.uk/\">dabbous.co.uk</a></em>)<em>.</em></p> <p>\u25a0 London\u2019s <strong>Borough Market </strong>has launched its talks series, which this year range from an investigation of our food choices, through the secrets of a successful food start up, to a discussion panel on what has driven Britain\u2019s food revolution.

      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>If you are anything like me, at this time of year your windowsills will be covered with little tomato plants just beginning to produce their very first side shoots. Conventional wisdom says to nip out these lateral shoots that spring up at the axils, where the leaves meet the stem, in order to concentrate the plant\u2019s energy on producing fruit. Unlike many pieces of received gardening wisdom, this advice is well supported by trials and scientific evidence, giving you larger fruit and earlier harvests. It\u2019s what it says to do next, confining these shoots to the compost bin, that I think is a missed opportunity.</p> <p>You see, the vigour that makes these lateral shoots a drain on the parent plant\u2019s energies also means they make fantastic cuttings. Being packed full of growth hormones, they are super easy to root and their incredibly rapid growth rate means they often catch up with their parent plants within as little as a month.</p> <p>Considering the price of some tomato seed (F1 varieties can be more than \u00a31 each) I am surprised the practice is not more widely recommended. Aside from being extremely cost effective, it can also be a nifty second chance if part of your batch of seedlings has succumbed to damping off, or is clobbered by frost from planting out too early. Left it too late to sow them this year? No problem. Just buy one or two small plants from a garden centre and use the cuttings from these.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ff61bf5d21db41aa92b254d79f6c25e8d3346975\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ff61bf5d21db41aa92b254d79f6c25e8d3346975/0_0_5124_3074/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Pick of the crop: tomato seedlings showing their first true leaves.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Pick of the crop: tomato seedlings showing their first true leaves.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>To get started, slice off the side shoots with a clean pair of scissors when they reach about 5-10cm long and poke the lower cut end into a small pot of gritty seed and cutting compost so that the first pair of leaves is just proud of the surface. You shouldn\u2019t require any rooting hormone, heated propagators or antifungal treatments, as in my experience the success rate of these cuttings is more than 95%. This makes them a perfect crop for teaching kids how to take cuttings, right up there with geraniums and hydrangeas. Give the pot a good soak and place it on a windowsill in a warm room, away from direct sunlight. Within as little as a week your plants will have started to take root. They can start to flower within a month \u2013 far faster than if you were to start from seed.</p> <p>At this time of year, each plant should produce up to six side shoots to make cuttings from. This can be done right up until the middle of June to still produce an outdoor crop. This window of opportunity is probably longer if you have a greenhouse.</p> <p><em>Email James at <a href=\"mailto:james.wong@observer.co.uk\">james.wong@observer.co.uk</a> or follow him on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Botanygeek?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">@Botanygeek</a></em></p>",

But the svelte new <a href=\"http://www.bmw.co.uk/en_GB/new-vehicles/7/saloon/2015/introduction.html\">7-Series </a>from BMW is on a mission to change that. It\u2019s the first car to feature \u201cgesture control\u201d. Using a tiny camera hidden in the centre of the dashboard it captures your hand movements so that when you wave, swipe, jab or twist your fingers in mid-air you perform various functions. You can answer or reject phone calls, zoom in and out of the map, or adjust the volume of the radio. It\u2019s quite a party trick. Though, in keeping with most modern technology, it doesn\u2019t always do what you want, so you usually end up using your fingers in the traditional way \u2013 to press buttons. For the sake of thoroughness I used my fingers to make a rude gesture at the car. But it politely ignored me.</p> <p>The latest 7-Series which is aimed squarely at Eurocrats, CEOs, chauffeurs and understated royalty is far from radical looking. It looks near identical to the outgoing model. But that meticulous exterior conceals a technological revolution on the inside of almost Wagnerian proportions. There isn\u2019t a single aspect of driving or travelling in this car that has not in some way benefited from smart new tech. Using the key fob, for instance, you can remotely set the aircon, as well as checking that it is locked, that the windows are closed and even how much fuel you have left.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"b37d0557781f740f7fec42a786db14ca07428bee\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/b37d0557781f740f7fec42a786db14ca07428bee/0_424_8688_5213/1000.jpg\" alt=\"interior of the 7 series\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Inside story: the luxurious interior \u2013 complete with ionised aircon and massaging seats</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When you approach, the BMW unlocks itself in expectation, it\u2019s so pleased to see you. The infotainment screen flickers to life and the words \u201cWelcome Martin\u201d scroll across it. Obviously, it\u2019ll say <em>your</em> name not mine \u2013 it isn\u2019t only Martins who get to drive this car. While you ponder your warm welcome, the loungey seats get busy massaging your back and buttocks. The ambient air is fragranced and ionised. Driving a 7-Series never feels like work \u2013 though for many chauffeurs that\u2019s exactly what it is. It\u2019s a spa on wheels and it\u2019s way more comfortable than my home. From dynamic laser lights and adaptive cruise control to every conceivable passive and active driving aid, including predictive active suspension which uses the GPS to set the car\u2019s air suspension and adaptive dampers for the coming road conditions, this BMW is the ultimate in luxurious service. It\u2019s your very own night manager.</p> <p>The car is 130kg lighter than it used to be. It comes with a new generation straight six cylinder engine in petrol or diesel. Later this year there will also be hybrid and four-wheel-drive versions. On the road the car is as muffled as a snowy night. It\u2019s so elegant and well-mannered it drags your behaviour up to its lofty standards. I serenely drove 600 miles in the car, up to Yorkshire and back and arrived home fresh, unruffled \u2013 and without making a single obscene gesture.</p> <h2><strong>Whistling Billy set to take Chateau Impney Hill Climb by steam</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"222b8408f47ca5f8cab47ee00272f3f26df28d82\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/222b8408f47ca5f8cab47ee00272f3f26df28d82/21_104_1324_794/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Building up a head of steam: Bob Dyke in the Whistling Billy which has a top speed of at least 70mph\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Building up a head of steam: Bob Dyke in the Whistling Billy which has a top speed of at least 70mph</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p><strong> <br /></strong>A 1905 steam car, which has been painstakingly recreated over eight years, will make its competition debut at this summer\u2019s Chateau Impney Hill Climb on 9 and 10 July. The event will see some 200 pre-1967 cars race against the clock to claim victory on one of the UK\u2019s most challenging hill climb courses. The steam car, known as Whistling Billy, is owned by Dr Bob Dyke and until recently it has been illegal to race steam cars against petrol cars, but after 100 years that ban has been overturned. </p> <p>Whistling Billy was one of the fastest of any type of car on the American dirt track races in the early 20th century. Built by the White Sewing Machine Company in 1905, the steam car was engineered specifically for racing. Originally known as the White Rocket, the car was lovingly renamed Whistling Billy by the crowds who watched it race due to the howling noise that came from its burners as it went down the straights. </p> <p>It won numerous races in its early years and in 1905, it shaved nearly four seconds off the world track record for the mile on a dirt round track with a time of 48.45 seconds. However, after a string of near misses, 1912 would prove to be the end of Whistling Billy. During a practice run in Portland, Oregon, the car crashed over an embankment and was found upside down, broken in half. The driver was seriously injured, but survived. Following the crash, the car was said to have ended up in storage, before being moved onto a farm and left to rust and ruin. </p> <p>Bob\u2019s journey with the car began in 2003, when the organiser of a major motorsport exhibition telephoned him and said that they wanted to showcase the steam racing car because it had won so much. \u201cI told them that they couldn\u2019t find it as it was written off in 1912 \u2013 so I said I\u2019d rebuild it for them!\u201d says Bob. \u201cIt\u2019s a faithful, accurate rebuild using mainly correct, original parts from White steamers,\u201d he adds. \u201cI had photographs of Whistling Billy at the time, which were very helpful in figuring out how to put it all together, and allowed me to get the exact dimensions.\u201d </p> <p>The Whistling Billy\u2019s current top speed stands at 70mph, but according to Bob, there is a lot more throttle to open yet. Despite its dirt racer past, Bob is confident that the car will perform well on hill climb tarmac at the Droitwich even. \u201cI think that Billy is a class above, really. When it\u2019s going well, it goes like stink!\u201d</p> <p>Tickets for 2016\u2019s event are \u00a320 per person, and under-16s will be admitted free with a ticket-holding adult.

      "body": "<p>When <a href=\"http://yukoart.com/category/work/\">Yuko Shimizu</a> moved to New York in 1999 she had no interest in \u2013 or money for \u2013 interiors. \u201cI rented an apartment in an unhip area of Brooklyn and bought all the used Ikea furniture from the guy moving out,\u201d she says.</p> <p>But when she came to buy her own place eight years ago, viewing more than 100 apartments changed her thinking. \u201cI realised that decorating your home is part of your personality.\u201d</p> <p>From her interior choices, you might guess she is comfortable with risk. Early 20th-century wooden wall panels are painted solid black and topped with graphic wallpaper. A narrow hallway is covered in bold monochrome stripes that extend from the walls across the ceiling. A modernist Barcelona chair sits next to a Versailles-style dome seat. These things could easily not have worked.</p> <p>Shimizu herself took a leap of faith in her mid-30s when she ditched a corporate PR job in Japan for art school in New York. The risk paid off and she\u2019s now, at an undisclosed age, a respected illustrator. She\u2019s also keen to point out that she\u2019s not to be confused with <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/jul/06/hello-kitty-movie\">the other Yuko Shimizu </a>who created Hello Kitty.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"62cf069fd33b0b689a4e89a9f45bec68008222fe\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/62cf069fd33b0b689a4e89a9f45bec68008222fe/0_0_6846_9182/746.jpg\" alt=\"Lines of enquiry: the neat and compact kitchen.\" width=\"746\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Lines of enquiry: the neat and compact kitchen.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Seelen. Styling: Marc Heldens</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When Shimizu found her third-floor, one-bedroom apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, she approached decorating as she does her work. \u201cLooking at the apartment I realised, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s like a three-dimensional space you fill in,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cMy drawings are not simple. They\u2019re highly decorative, but they have rhythm \u2013 parts where it\u2019s tight and parts where you let go.\u201d</p> <p>And so she set to work. For the main areas of her home she chose a palette of black and white with an accent colour of red. \u201cThe tone is important,\u201d she says. \u201cIn Asia there\u2019s a Chinese red that is cooler with a lot more black, and a Japanese red that shifts more towards orange. I like both but, for interiors, the Japanese red brightens a room.\u201d</p> <p>Indeed, red continually beams out against the black and white throughout her home: from the artwork to her bedroom door, and the lettering on a cushion that says \u201cBE NICE OR LEAVE.\u201d (\u201cI sometimes give these as presents because people love them,\u201d she says.) Most notably, it\u2019s the base colour of the wallpaper in her lounge \u2013 a depiction of galloping zebras and flying arrows. Originally designed for a New York restaurant, this is a cult print spotted in Wes Anderson\u2019s <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/film/movie/91078/royal.tenenbaums\"><em>The Royal Tenenbaums</em></a>, covering the walls of Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s character\u2019s room. The flow of the animals creates the feel of a fairground carousel circling overhead.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"54f56ee3c34deddfa8a721de93ec93a7cfe2196d\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/54f56ee3c34deddfa8a721de93ec93a7cfe2196d/0_723_3744_4835/774.jpg\" alt=\"Colour co-ordinated: Yuko Shimizu outside her apartment with her chihuahua \u2018Bruiser\u2019.\" width=\"774\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Colour co-ordinated: Yuko Shimizu outside her apartment with her chihuahua \u2018Bruiser\u2019.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Mark Seelen. Styling: Marc Heldens</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>When it comes to furniture, Shimizu decided to challenge herself to a \u201cNo Ikea rule.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s pretty hard because they have some great stuff,\u201d she says, \u201cbut the problem is, whichever country you go to, everyone has the same furniture and it feels wrong.\u201d So she tries to buy original items, either on Etsy and eBay, or when she travels.</p> <p>She is a collector of both \u201cjunk and expensive things\u201d \u2013 from figurines of Chinese dictators to <a href=\"http://www.fornasetti.com/\">Fornasetti</a> pieces. \u201cI like to support artists,\u201d she says, \u201cand often that means I can\u2019t immediately buy the thing I want [because it\u2019s too expensive], but that\u2019s OK. One day I might be able to.\u201d</p> <p>While others might admire Shimizu\u2019s choices, committing them to a living space requires courage. Does she enjoy the risk of things potentially not working? \u201cI guess that\u2019s what artists are, right? If your vision and viewpoint is the same as everyone else\u2019s, you\u2019re probably not doing art,\u201d she says. \u201cYour home is your space and is where you can take risks. It\u2019s a bit like my work,\u201d she adds. \u201cI don\u2019t need everyone to love it.\u201d</p> <p><a href=\"http://roads.co/books/visual/living-with-yuko-shimizu\">Living With Yuko Shimizu</a> <em>is published by Roads, \u00a311.99.

      "body": "<h2>British Academy Television Awards 2016</h2> <p><strong>8pm, BBC1</strong><br />To the Royal Festival Hall, where Graham Norton again hosts British telly\u2019s poshest gong show. Wolf Hall has nominations in almost all the big categories, with Mark Rylance likely to pick up Leading Actor. Other contenders include Ian McKellen, who surely won\u2019t beat Cucumber\u2019s Cyril Nri to the Supporting Actor prize, and Adele, whose BBC1 album launch is up for Entertainment Programme.<em> Jack Seale</em></p> <h2>Attenborough At 90</h2> <p><strong>7pm, BBC1<br /></strong>Kirsty Young interviews David Attenborough in front of a live audience on his 90th birthday. His career trajectory means that this is also a potted history of British television, upon which the naturalist has had colossal influence. Here, Attenborough discusses his unparalleled highlights reel with characteristic wit; guests include Michael Palin and Chris Packham, with contributions from David Cameron and Tim Peake, among others. <em>Andrew Mueller</em></p> <h2>Burma\u2019s Secret Jungle War With Joe Simpson</h2> <p>8pm, BBC2<br />Joe Simpson, the mountaineer who told his amazing story in Touching The Void, travels to Myanmar to retrace the footsteps of his father Ian, who fought in the Chindits, the battalion locked in brutal guerrilla conflict behind enemy lines against the Japanese army at the end of the second world war. Accompanied by Ed Stafford, he finds himself embroiled in the modern-day turmoil triggered by the country\u2019s first free elections in decades.<em> Ben Arnold</em></p> <h2>The Durrells</h2> <p>8pm, ITV<br />Last in the series. Preparations begin for Louisa\u2019s hasty wedding to Sven, but it\u2019s not just the family having doubts. Meanwhile, Gerry tries to drum up business for his newly opened zoo and Larry is pulled in two different directions when Nancy starts to feel stifled by his family and their off-kilter antics. Will he leave the Corfu sunshine for her or retreat back to the comforting nuttiness of the Durrell bosom? A delicious, sunny treat from start to finish. <em>Julia Raeside</em></p> <h2>Hillsborough</h2> <p><strong>9pm, BBC2<br /></strong>Even following the inquest verdict, there are still tears of rage to be shed; over the disaster itself, over the lies that followed it, and over the 27 years it took to find justice. This two-hour film draws on footage from the day, dramatisations and interviews with survivors and bereaved family members, and police officers whose individual humanity contrasted starkly with the cowardly attempts by their \u201csuperiors\u201d to shift blame on to the fans. Mandatory viewing. <em>David Stubbs</em></p> <h2>Marooned With Ed Stafford</h2> <p><strong>9pm, Discovery<br /></strong>There\u2019s something of the first-person video game about this rather useful new series in which Ed \u2013 lovechild of Bear Grylls and Tom Hardy \u2013 aims to survive for 10 days in remote locations, armed only with a camera. And dropped into the Gobi desert, it\u2019ll be game over pretty quickly unless he can find water, avoid the bears and find something to eat. Some reptiles were definitely harmed during the making of his programme. \u201cFour-lizard kebab\u201d, anyone? <em>Ali Catterall</em></p> <h2>Marvel\u2019s Agents Of SHIELD</h2> <p><strong>9pm, E4<br /></strong>After an unexpected betrayal, SHIELD are on even shakier ground than usual. Meanwhile, their creepy foe, Hive, the embodiment of an ancient cosmic evil capable of enslaving Inhumans with a glance, is ramping up recruitment. Genetic manipulation could be the key to Hive\u2019s powers, so Fitz and Simmons are sent undercover to locate Holden Radcliffe (guest star John Hannah), a Dr Moreau-type who runs a dodgy chop shop out of a Bucharest night spot. <em>Graeme Virtue</em></p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e680195462f20c41cebb42475a3a09f2e0d18673\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e680195462f20c41cebb42475a3a09f2e0d18673/0_174_3770_2261/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Tatsuya Nakadai and P\u00eet\u00e2 in Ran\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Tatsuya Nakadai and P\u00eet\u00e2 in Ran</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: film company handout</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Film Choice</h2> <p><strong>Ran<br /></strong><strong>(Akira Kurosawa, 1985), 10.30pm, BBC4<br /></strong>Kurosawa\u2019s majestic adaptation of King Lear has powerful-but-flaky Lord Hidetora (Tatsuya Nakadai) dividing his lands between two unworthy sons while the youngest, truthful one is banished. Ran, or chaos, ensues, along with furious, bloody screen battles as the rivals struggle for power, destroying their foolish father in the process. Despairing and bleak, it\u2019s done on the heroic scale. <em>Paul Howlett</em></p> <p><strong>Robot &amp; Frank<br />(Jake Schreier, 2012), 11pm, BBC2</strong><br />Veteran burglar Frank (Frank Langella) is bordering on dementia and, this being the near future, his worried kids (Liv Tyler, James Marsden) fix him up with a robot butler-cum-watchdog. Grumpy Frank\u2019s not too happy, until he enlists his companion in his burglary plans and turns him into a robber robot. They make an engaging odd couple in this warmhearted sci-fi comedy. <em>PH</em></p> <p><strong>Smart People<br />(Noam Murro, 2008), 11.45pm, BBC1</strong><br />A likable tale of literary folk: Denis Quaid is an arrogant English professor in Pittsburgh, knocking out books with titles including You Can\u2019t Read. He struggles with his acerbic daughter (Ellen Page), his ne\u2019er-do-well stepbrother (Thomas Haden Church) and former student-with-a-crush (Sarah Jessica Parker). It\u2019s not a particularly original romcom, but the snappy dialogue keeps it lively. <em>PH</em></p> <h2>Today\u2019s Live Sport</h2> <p><strong>Premier League Football: Tottenham Hotspur v Southampton 12.30pm, Sky Sports 1</strong><br />With Manchester City v Arsenal to follow in the later game.</p> <p><strong>IPL Cricket: Kolkata Knight Riders v Gujarat Lions 3pm, Sky Sports 2<br /></strong>Coverage of the match from Eden Gardens in Kolkata.</p> <p><strong>Challenge Cup Rugby League: St Helens v Hull FC 4pm, BBC2<br /></strong>The sixth-round encounter from Langtree Park.</p>",

It was a proper head-turner \u2013 anodised paint job, tapered carbon forks, T-section top tube \u2013 and a brand I hadn\u2019t heard of: Bowman. I guessed it was one of those poncey pricey frames that bankrupt you and then leave you too terrified to actually enjoy it. But it turns out Bowman builds rugged, rideable frames for the year-round, no-nonsense cyclist. The firm is the brainchild of Neil Webb who, after 20 years in the industry, decided to go it alone. His bikes are designed at his base on the outskirts of southeast London and then built in Taiwan. There are currently five models, each named after a landmark familiar to cyclists in the southeast\u2013 Palace, Pilgrims, Foots Cray and Layhams. This one is the Pilgrims (named after the Pilgrims\u2019 Way). It features generous \u2018RoadPlus\u2019 geometry which gives you the clearance to fit wider tyres or mudguards so you can swap in bigger rubber and turn off the road to tackle trails. In all you\u2019ll get bespoke looks for Sundays, but a sturdy worker for weekdays (<a href=\"https://bowman-cycles.com/product/pilgrims/\"><em>Bowman Cyles</em></a>).</p> <p><strong>Price: \u00a3750 (frameset only, complete bikes from \u00a31,500)<br /></strong><strong>Frame: 7005-T6 aluminium<br /></strong><strong>Forks: tapered carbon<br /></strong><strong>Brakes: post mount discs<br /></strong><strong>Hidden Guard Mounts</strong></p> <h2><strong>Women\u2019s bike workshops</strong></h2>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f3a78a60f79dedd58c7828100060512f61e8bcd4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f3a78a60f79dedd58c7828100060512f61e8bcd4/0_908_4662_3546/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Saddle up: young women cyclists\" width=\"1000\" height=\"761\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Saddle up: would you be able to fix your gears and get yourself home?</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Anyone who has enjoyed the thrill of escaping the city traffic and heading out into the open countryside on two wheels has also probably experienced the frustration of having a puncture or a mechanical in the middle of nowhere.

      "body": "<p><strong>Imagine you are given the opportunity to change the arrangements of your current job. Would you rather: a) work fewer hours and make less money or b) work more hours and make more money?</strong></p> <p>If you said a) then good news: a study published this year found that people who value time over money tend to be happier. Across six experiments \u2013 with university students, museum visitors, and respondents to an online survey \u2013 researchers found that the people who think it\u2019s better to have more time than more money gave higher scores on questionnaire-based measures of happiness.</p> <p>You might think this is a spurious result. Perhaps, for example, people who pick option a) do so because they tend to be financially well off (and so can afford to turn down the money), and it\u2019s this financial security \u2013 rather than valuing time over money per se \u2013 that makes them happier.</p> <p>But this isn\u2019t the case. The link between prioritising time over money (as mentioned by the type of question we\u2019ve just asked) held even after controlling for income, marital status (married people tend to be happier), materialism, and even how much spare time people feel they have. This doesn\u2019t mean, of course, that we can infer causality. So even if it were possible to force yourself to change from being a b-type to an a-type person (which it probably isn\u2019t), there\u2019s no reason to believe that it would necessarily make you any happier.</p> <p>Psy-Q<em> by Ben Ambridge is published by Profile Books at \u00a38.99.

      "headline": "No smoke without fire: how to barbecue low and slow",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>The difference between barbecue cooking and regular home cooking is that the focus is less on convenience and more on fun. This is the main reason I steer clear of gas. There is nothing inherently wrong with gas, it\u2019s just a bit boring. When you\u2019re cooking with coal and wood, things are less predictable. You have to man the fire and watch your meat to make sure it doesn\u2019t burn. There is a primal pleasure in live fire cooking.</p> <p>How much to spend on a barbecue depends on what you want to cook. If you want to smoke meat for hours on end a <a href=\"http://www.biggreenegg.co.uk/\">Big Green Egg</a> is hard to beat. But if you are more likely to stick to steaks and burgers and things that smoke in a few hours, a standard kettle barbecue is fine. I\u2019d recommend a cast-iron grate for the steaks and a cast-iron pan to sear burgers.</p> <p>If you don\u2019t want to spend much money, go DIY. This could mean building a brick pit and using scrap from a builder\u2019s yard. All you need is an area in which to build a small coal fire, and a place to sit the meat close to the flame to get colour \u2013 and also further away to slow-cook the meat. Buy a good probe thermometer. For smoking it\u2019s almost an essential.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--supporting\" data-media-id=\"d2893ef45e746ab79e4a445dc4242f3d573292c6\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/d2893ef45e746ab79e4a445dc4242f3d573292c6/0_1624_4405_5736/768.jpg\" alt=\"Al-fresco cooking: chef Neil Rankin cooking with a Big Green Egg.\" width=\"768\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Al-fresco cooking: chef Neil Rankin cooking with a Big Green Egg.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Suki Dhanda for the Observer</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Beef</h2> <p>Ox cheek is now available in some supermarkets. It\u2019s a slow-cooking dream because it has all the fatty qualities of larger slow-cooked meat such as shin or fatty brisket, but it is small enough that you can cook it quickly (5-6 hours at 120C).</p> <p>Asado de tira is a thin cross-sectional cut from the short rib and is a great quick-cook steak for grilling. British short ribs aren\u2019t as large as the American varieties so this cut suits our beef better (2-3 minutes on a grill).</p> <h2>Lamb </h2> <p>Lamb ribs are among the best cuts available for slow cooking. Like ox cheek they are smaller than normal ribs but have a high fat ratio, so they cook quicker (5-7 hours at 120C).</p> <p>Thin-cut lamb chops, like the ones you find in Indian grill restaurants, are great to feed guests who are getting hungry and impatient at a barbecue. Try cooking them hot and fast on the grill, and have a bowl of your favourite spices and seasonings at the ready to coat them in as they come off the grill. Think also about making a thick and heavy ginger and garlic curry sauce to go on after cooking (2-3 minutes on a grill).</p> <h2>Pork<br /></h2> <p>Pig wings or pork hocks are affordable and cook on the barbecue brilliantly. There are few cuts left on animals that are still good value and taste so good. Get your butcher to remove the skin and season with salt and pepper or your favourite rub. Cook for 6-7 hours or until soft and tender. Eat like Obelix (6-8 hours at 120C).</p> <p>Pork shoulder steaks are far more interesting and marbled than loin chops. Cook them fast to a nice medium, and slice. They go great with chimichurri sauce or a dollop of good mustard (6-8 minutes on a grill).</p> <h2>Chicken and duck<br /></h2> <p>Chicken is perfect for a barbecue: go whole. Open up the cavity and spread the legs as much as possible to enable heat to cook the bird evenly. Cook for about an hour and 20 minutes at 120C. Make sure it is cooked through, then eat it straightaway or let it cool then grill it hard to get some good char, or roast it in a hot oven for crispy skin. Duck is much the same, but I\u2019d remove the legs and cook the crown separately. The legs need longer to cook unless you don\u2019t mind well-done breast meat. In my opinion, if you\u2019re going to overcook the breast, take it further so it\u2019s like Chinese crispy duck. In between this stage and medium it lacks character.</p> <h2>Vegetables<br /></h2> <p>Vegetables are a dream on the grill. Don\u2019t be scared to get some heavy black colour on the outside. This is bitter for meat but it tastes great on vegetables. Buy what\u2019s fresh, in season and looks good, and throw everything on the grill until it is soft inside. If it gets too black, take it off to one side. Halve some lemons, caramelise the insides on the grill and dress the veg with this juice, some good olive oil and lots of fresh herbs.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"1cdda4e2e848b754b3bcf884f921dfc62938a490\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/1cdda4e2e848b754b3bcf884f921dfc62938a490/62_211_2551_3076/829.jpg\" alt=\"\u2018There is a primal pleasure in live fire cooking\u2019: whole barbecued chicken.\" width=\"829\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">\u2018There is a primal pleasure in live fire cooking\u2019: whole barbecued chicken.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Paul Winch-Furness</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <h2>Whole barbecued chicken<br /></h2> <p>Serves 2-4<br /><strong>bird </strong>1.6-2kg <br /><strong>smoker cooking temperature</strong> 120-130C<br /><strong>cooking time</strong> 1-1\u00bd hours</p> <p>Give your chicken your favourite rub and get your smoker to 120C. As the temperature will not be as accurate as the oven, you need to be flexible with the cooking time. Use a probe thermometer to check that the breasts hit 68C; with touch, this is the point where the breasts just begin to firm up. Don\u2019t cook the chicken longer than this to be safe because it will self-cook a little further once it\u2019s out of the smoker, and you can always give it more time after it\u2019s jointed. That way you avoid cooking the whole thing dry. Eat it straightaway, or leave it to cool for an hour, then roast in the oven at 240C for 15 minutes to get a crispier skin.</p> <h2>Last-minute grilled salad<br /></h2> <p>Serves 6-8<br /><strong>fennel bulbs</strong> 1 whole, and 1 thinly sliced<br /><strong>courgettes</strong> 3, thickly sliced lengthways<br /><strong>Tropea onions or red onions</strong> 3, cut in half lengthways (unpeeled)<br /><strong>spring onions </strong>3 <br /><strong>leek </strong>1 <br /><strong>broccoli </strong>4 stalks<br /><strong>English asparagus spears </strong>3 <br /><strong>globe artichoke</strong> 1, trimmed, quartered lengthways<br /><strong>dandelion leaves</strong> a small bunch <br /><strong>Romaine lettuce</strong> 1, cut in half lengthways<br /><strong>olive oil</strong> to taste<br /><strong>lemon juice</strong> to taste <br /><strong>flat-leaf parsley</strong> 4 tbsp, chopped <br /><strong>chives</strong> a handful cut into 2.5cm lengths<br /><strong>puffed wild rice</strong> 2 tbsp (deep-fry raw wild rice for a few seconds in 180C oil, drain)<br /><strong>crispy garlic slices</strong> 1 tbsp <br /><strong>parmesan</strong><br /><strong>salt</strong></p> <p>Cook the whole fennel bulb in the hot coals for 10 minutes until blackened, then peel off the outer charred layer. Lay the fennel and courgette slices, the onion halves, spring onions, leek, broccoli, asparagus and artichoke quarters on the barbecue grill. Cook, turning as needed, until tender and heavily charred. As they are cooked, remove them. Leave the leek until it is blackened all over, remove and peel off the outer layer. Roughly chop all the veg, including the fennel bulb. Grill the dandelion leaves for a few seconds, and the lettuce halves on one side until almost black.</p> <p>Combine all the grilled vegetables on a large platter. Dress with olive oil, lemon juice and salt, then sprinkle with the herbs, puffed wild rice, crispy garlic and parmesan.</p> <p><em>Low and Slow: How to Cook Meat by Neil Rankin</em> is out now (\u00a325, Ebury Press).

      "body": "<p><strong>Ch\u00e2teau Bas d\u2019Aumelas Barathym Rouge, Gr\u00e8s de Montpellier, Languedoc, France 2014 (\u00a39.90, </strong><a href=\"http://shop.thesampler.co.uk/store/\"><strong>The Sampler</strong></a><strong>) </strong>The Sampler is a small independent merchant whose fame in wine circles extends far beyond its two stores in the posher bits of London (Islington\u2019s Upper Street and South Kensington). As its name suggests, it was the first shop to exploit the whizzy dispensing machines known as Enomatics that keep wine fresh and allow punters to draw off a small sample for tasting in exchange for a small fee. Ten years since it first opened, sampling is still its USP, with 80 wines available to taste at any time. But it\u2019s the quality of its wider range of 1,500+ wines (available online if, like me, you\u2019re not in London) that is the biggest draw, starting with this exuberantly juicy, lavender and blackberry-scented light-touch Languedoc red.</p> <p><strong>The Scholium Project The Prince in His Caves, California 2014 (\u00a345, </strong><a href=\"http://shop.thesampler.co.uk/store/\"><strong>The Sampler</strong></a><strong>) </strong>What makes The Sampler\u2019s sampling culture particularly attractive to those many wine enthusiasts who are not on a banker\u2019s salary or don\u2019t have access to a country house with a cellar is the chance to try, albeit in miniscule amounts, some seriously smart or mature wines that they wouldn\u2019t otherwise be able to afford by the bottle. At the time of writing, the Islington store was offering samples of a bunch of top-flight clarets from 1995 and a rare Rh\u00f4ne red \u2013 Jaboulet Gigondas \u2013 from the great 1978 vintage. But it deals in more than just classic French wine, finding a home for such leftfield gems as ex-classics professor Abe Schoner\u2019s hit-and-miss cult California range, of which this unusual, intensely herbal, spicy take on sauvignon blanc is a delicious standout.</p> <p><strong>Ch\u00e2teau du Coing Muscadet S\u00e8vre et Maine Sur Lie, Loire, France 2012 (\u00a310.50, </strong><a href=\"http://shop.thesampler.co.uk/store/\"><strong>The Sampler</strong></a><strong>) </strong>While Schoner\u2019s output is the definition of an acquired taste, and an expensive one at that, much of The Sampler\u2019s range sits in that independent merchant weekend-treat sweet spot from \u00a310 to \u00a320. Among the many summery highlights I enjoyed when The Sampler showed off their range to the press a couple of weeks ago, were a pretty, silky, feather-bed beaujolais (Domaine Grand Pr\u00e9 Fleurie 2014, \u00a316.50); a blisteringly fresh but balanced white and a crunchy, raspberry-scented red from the Basque Country (Doniene Gorrondona Txacoli 2014, \u00a312.50; Doniene Gorrondona Tinto 2013, \u00a315); and Ch\u00e2teau du Coing\u2019s superb, refined, savoury chablis-like muscadet dry white.</p> <p><em>Follow David on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daveydaibach\">@Daveydaibach</a></em></p>",

      "headline": "Dr Corbyn\u2019s elixir for electoral success will kill only the patient",
      "newspaperEditionDate": "2016-05-08T00:00:00Z",
      "body": "<p>During his brilliant campaign for the Labour leadership \u2013 and in large part explaining why he won it \u2013 Jeremy Corbyn offered a magic potion to his party. He beguiled its members with the idea that he had formulated a \u201cnew politics\u201d which would be played to entirely different and wonderfully better rules than the old politics. Labour would no longer treat electoral contests as a struggle won or lost by the party most effective at building a broad-based coalition of support. That disgraceful way of seeking power was for unprincipled sell-outs such as Clem Attlee, Harold Wilson and Tony Blair. Labour would no longer compete for the centre ground. It would instead tap a hidden reservoir of support from the many millions of people who had failed to support the party in the past because it had never offered them an authentically left-wing programme. Inspired by the pied piper of Islington, these folk would be roused to the polls and victory would follow. This was the Corbyn formula for electoral success.</p> <p>It was a seductive sell to a Labour party stunned by its general election defeat and the more attractive because it promised a cure both miraculous and painless. No more having to make compromises with the electorate. No more having to try to win the support of voters who might not always put a cross in the Labour box. No more having to talk to people who might even have backed the wicked Tories on occasion. Dr Corbyn\u2019s elixir promised Labour that it would not have to choose between purity and power. The party could have both.</p> <p>Some of us did spot a bit of a flaw with this thesis: the complete lack of evidence to support it. Unabashed, Mr Corbyn and his friends have pursued their experiment for the past eight months, quite a long time in politics. Their formula was given a very comprehensive test in the elections on Thursday. They were the fullest check on the mood of the electorate that you can get outside a general election. Every adult citizen of the UK had an opportunity to cast a ballot. While there is plenty of variation in the outcomes of the different elections, there is a big picture and it has one clear theme. Labour lost seats in Scotland, lost seats in Wales and lost seats in England. The very special case of London aside, these elections were awful for Labour.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/may/06/jeremy-corbyn-leadership-labour-mps-elections\">We nominated Jeremy Corbyn for the leadership. Now we regret it | Jo Cox and Neil Coyle</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Let\u2019s start in Scotland. If the Corbyn formula for electoral success is reliable, this is where Labour\u2019s recovery ought to have begun. Just last year, he declared that Scotland was his \u201ctop priority\u201d. You will also remember that it was his contention that moving to the left of the SNP was the way to mobilise new support and to woo back voters who had abandoned Labour for the nationalists. Kezia Dugdale, Labour\u2019s leader in Scotland, loyally put that thesis to the test by pledging higher rates of income tax, more spending on public services and opposing the renewal of the nuclear deterrent. She offered Dr Corbyn\u2019s magical potion to Scots and they spat it out. Labour has crashed to its worst result in Scotland since 1910. It has been supplanted by a resurgent Scottish Conservative party successfully bidding for the support of centrist, pro-union voters. The Tories, not Labour, will now be the principal party of opposition, a role given additional importance because the SNP just fell short of securing a majority. If there is a way back for Labour in Scotland, the evidence of these elections is that the route recommended by Mr Corbyn is not it.</p> <p>Labour\u2019s catastrophic collapse north of the border makes it even more imperative that the party recovers support in England and Wales if it is ever to look like a party capable of winning a general election. Shorn of Scotland, Labour has to be sure of Wales and 13 points ahead of the Tories in England to win the 2020 election. Labour lost a seat in the National Assembly for Wales and Ukip had a breakthrough. The loss of another seat in Cardiff might reasonably be put down to Labour being in power for a long time. But Ukip eating some of Labour\u2019s lunch in Wales? One of those doing the munching being Neil \u201ccash in brown envelopes\u201d Hamilton? That really shouldn\u2019t be happening if the Corbyn thesis is correct. If the magic potion was working as promised, Labour should not be also leeching support to Nigel Farage\u2019s gang in northern England.</p> <p>There was a variegated picture across England as a whole, which has been of some assistance to the Labour leader and his allies in trying to put some positive spin on the results. Even so, the best that Mr Corbyn could say of the English council results was \u201cwe hung on\u201d. The best John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, could do was to say \u201cshut up\u201d to any Labour colleague who wondered whether hanging on to Ed Miliband\u2019s share of the vote ought to be the summit of the party\u2019s ambitions. Some Corbynista apologists have chosen to conveniently forget that they previously promised that they had the elixir for success and now argue that roughly breaking even is good enough for Labour at this stage of the cycle. It is not. It really, really is not. We are in the sixth year of David Cameron\u2019s premiership. Tories are gouging out each other\u2019s eyes over Europe. The government has been stumbling from Budget blunder via doctors\u2019 strike and Cabinet resignation to academies U-turn. Yet the principal party of opposition has just lost council seats. That\u2019s the first time that has happened in a non-general election year in more than three decades. The last time was in 1985, and it was the harbinger of a landslide Labour defeat at the next general election. Another useful metric is to compare these results with how previous opposition leaders performed the first time they took their parties into May elections. I\u2019ve reviewed the history of these contests over the past 51 years. On every occasion, the opposition gained seats in the first council elections fought under a new leader. It did so whether the leader was a future general election winner like David Cameron or Tony Blair, or a future general election loser like Michael Foot and Michael Howard. Ed Miliband gained more than 800 seats in 2011. Jeremy Corbyn is the only leader of the opposition to lose council seats in his first electoral test in more than half a century.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>Only Diane Abbott thinks that Labour\u2019s victory in London\u2019s mayoral poll belongs to Jeremy Corbyn</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>The glittering exception to an otherwise dark picture for Labour, the beacon in the gloom, was Sadiq Khan\u2019s handsome victory in London with the largest direct personal mandate ever secured in a British election. It was a triumph made the sweeter because it was achieved in the face of a Tory campaign so poisonous that Tories are now falling over each other to condemn it. Only Diane Abbott, and probably not even her really, thinks that Labour\u2019s victory in London belongs to Mr Corbyn rather than the candidate.</p> <p>Mr Khan could not have been more obvious about distancing himself from the Labour leadership. He made sure that Mr Corbyn had almost nothing to do with his campaign. He was accurately designated as \u201chostile\u201d in the list of the leader\u2019s enemies drawn up within Mr Corbyn\u2019s circle. Mr Khan did not achieve his victory by waiting for a mythical army of left-wing voters to turn up. He fought a highly professional, inclusive campaign with a centrist pitch that competed for every vote. He devoted at least as much time to seeking support in the more Tory-inclined outer London boroughs as he did to campaigning in the inner boroughs, which are Labour\u2019s natural heartland. Writing for the <em>Observer</em>, he explicitly attacks the Corbyn approach and says, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/may/07/sadiq-khan-londoners-deserve-better-tory-campaign\">\u201cLabour has to be a big tent that appeals to everyone \u2013 not just its own activists.\u201d</a> As Labour\u2019s most powerful office-holder, a great responsibility, and with it a great opportunity, now falls on Mayor Khan to show how a moderate, reforming Labour party can be a success at governing.</p> <p>Labour MPs and councillors know that these elections were a dreadful warning to their party about the fate that could await it in 2020. Some have had the temerity to say so, at the risk of being menaced by twitter mobs of diehard Corbynistas bearing pitch-forks and crying \u201cheresy\u201d and \u201ctreachery\u201d. It is not disloyal to face the truth. The real disloyalists are those who refuse to face the facts and try to howl into silence people who are prepared to confront Labour with its plight.</p> <p>Will Mr Corbyn reassess whether he has the formula for success? That sounds unlikely. \u201cI\u2019m going nowhere,\u201d he declares. Will it be the precursor to a move by Labour MPs who think that nowhere is precisely where their party is headed under his leadership? I remain sceptical about a summer coup attempt. Labour MPs are as depressed as ever about their party\u2019s prospects under the current management, but they are unlikely to act in sufficient numbers for as long as it looks as though Mr Corbyn commands the support of the majority of the members. So the real question about Labour\u2019s future is for those who bought into the magic potion. Is it beginning to occur to at least some of them that Dr Corbyn\u2019s elixir is snake oil?</p> <p>\u2022 This article was amended on 13 May 2016. An earlier version referred to Labour\u2019s losing its majority in Wales rather than losing one more seat. Labour has never had an overall majority in the National Assembly for Wales although it is still the largest party.<br /></p>",

Their fanbase, normally unquestioningly loyal, reacted with unexpected irritation: refunds for upcoming shows were demanded (and given), and many \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2016/mar/10/ac-dc-brian-johnson-hearing-tour-dates-fans-acdc-call-quits\">me included</a> \u2013 questioned whether the band should continue at all.<br /></p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/may/06/axl-rose-brian-johnson-acdc-do-justice\">Axl Rose determined to 'do justice' to Brian Johnson with AC/DC shows</a> </p> </aside>  <p>When they announced that Johnson\u2019s short-term replacement would be Guns N\u2019 Roses singer Axl Rose \u2013 a man for whom reliability is not a byword \u2013 eyebrows were further raised. Given <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/acdc\">AC/DC</a>\u2019s legendary efficiency, and Rose\u2019s equally legendary tardiness in taking the stage, it seemed as if it could be a case of the irresistible force meeting the immovable object. And then Rose broke a metatarsal, meaning he would be chairbound on stage. AC/DC, a band who care what people think of them rather less than anyone except, perhaps, Donald Trump, evidently decided in the wake of all these disasters that they needed to win people back. And so, for this first show with Rose, writers \u2013 the Guardian included \u2013 have been flown in to Portugal as the band attempt to prove they are still a worthwhile concern, even with guitarist Angus Young and bassist Cliff Williams the only remaining core members.</p> <p>Rose\u2019s arrival makes this show the first AC/DC gig in years \u2013 certainly since Johnson replaced the late Bon Scott in 1980 \u2013 at which no one knows exactly what to expect. Its triumph is that it does exactly what one would expect, but rather better than one had dared hope for. Rose being confined to his throne on castors \u2013 he looks for all the world like a hard-rock Davros \u2013 is a rare downside to his performance.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"eaa49404bc3e678c57f3e76479b38db46aaa9258\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eaa49404bc3e678c57f3e76479b38db46aaa9258/0_0_3720_2468/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Axl Rose perfoms with Angus Young of AC/DC in Lisbon.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"663\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Axl Rose perfoms with Angus Young of AC/DC in Lisbon.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Roger Sargent/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The triumph lies in the renditions of the songs AC/DC wrote and recorded when Scott was still alive. Whereas the Johnson-era material tended towards boozy bonhomie, Scott was often a malevolently misanthropic writer and singer, concealing a slightly terrifying rage behind apparent good humour. Rose, who is familiar with both malevolence and misanthropy, delivers those songs perfectly, giving them fresh menace. Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap loses its cartoonish aspect, and becomes the bar-room chatter of a psychopath; he introduces Shot Down in Flames as \u201cthe story of my life\u201d and convinces you it\u2019s true. His voice, too, is brilliant: no matter how high, every note is hit, and sustained. And he keeps it up for two hours.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/music/2016/apr/19/acdc-brian-johnson-hearing-loss-diagnosis-statement\">AC/DC's Brian Johnson: hearing loss diagnosis was a dark day for my career</a> </p> </aside>  <p>He seems more relaxed on the Scott songs, perhaps because of the manner of his replacing Johnson. Johnson\u2019s songs are delivered just fine, but there\u2019s a slight sense he\u2019s being a little too reverent. He\u2019s spoken of wanting to do justice to Johnson\u2019s work, and maybe he\u2019s concerned with not imprinting his own personality over the songs. That\u2019s true, too, of his rapport with the crowd. Johnson was unfailingly good humoured \u2013 not much of an anecdote teller, but ready to rouse the rabble. Rose confines himself to a few softly spoken words between songs and a few all-but-inaudible thank yous afterwards. For this show, with this much at stake, you expect him to be the cheerleader for AC/DC, but he refuses to take the role.</p> <p>Nevertheless, he compensates for the sometimes erratic sound \u2013 a fierce wind blowing off the Tagus following a day of horrendous rain bashes the music hither and thither \u2013 and perhaps even inadvertently outshines Young, who sounds a tiny bit approximate in the fiddly intro to Thunderstruck. For AC/DC Kremlinologists, though, the telling moments come with the incorporation of two songs from the 1978 album Powerage that had been out of live circulation for a long while \u2013 Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Damnation and a thrillingly brutal Riff Raff. \u201cI never shot nobody / Don\u2019t even carry a gun,\u201d Rose snarls, with complete conviction. \u201cI ain\u2019t done nothing wrong / Just having fun.\u201d</p> <p>Carry on like this, and those wondering whether AC/DC are still worth going to see this summer should have no worries: they, too, will be having fun.</p> <ul> <li>On <a href=\"http://www.acdc.com/tour\">tour in Europe</a> until 12 June, including <a href=\"http://queenelizabetholympicpark.co.uk/whats-on/events/2015/12/acdc-at-the-stadium\">Olympic Park, London, 4 June</a>; Etihad Stadium, Manchester, 9 June.</li> </ul>",

      "body": "<p>As seas rise, as floods and droughts become more extreme, as crops fail and as storms intensify, the world will increasingly face a new challenge \u2013 climate refugees.</p> <p>In the US, witness the recent plan by the federal government to resettle a Native American tribe before their <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/15/louisiana-isle-de-jean-charles-island-sea-level-resettlement\" title=\"\">Isle de Jean Charles home in Louisiana vanishes underwater</a> \u2013 an example that hits close to home. I have deep family roots in south Louisiana: my mother, sister and brother-in-law, aunt and uncle were refugees from a weather disaster exacerbated by climate change, losing their homes in New Orleans during <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/hurricane-katrina\" title=\"\">Hurricane Katrina in 2005</a>. A year before, a heart condition killed my father in the aftermath of a stressful evacuation from Hurricane Ivan.</p> <p>Some scientists already argue that the hundreds of thousands of Syrians fleeing their war-torn country are as much refugees from climate change as from conflict, because of years of climate-related drought. Others predict the world will see hundreds of millions more climate refugees by mid-century, at a staggering human, financial and political cost.</p> <p>And sadly, this looming problem is not a surprise. Way back in 1988, I represented Louisiana on a global warming task force of the National Governors\u2019 Association. Even then, the sobering effects of increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide were clear. We didn\u2019t miss the irony that oil-producing coastal states like Louisiana and Alaska would be hit hard by climate change. Many years later, in 2004, while serving on a federal climate-change task force, I saw the simulated devastation wreaked by computer-generated storm \u201cPam\u201d along the Gulf coast. I was shaken, and prayed it would never actually come to pass. But it did in Katrina and, just three weeks later, the record-setting Hurricane Rita.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--supporting\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/may/01/climate-change-nicholas-stern-paris-summit-global-warming\">Extreme weather and rising seas are already global threats. This will only intensify</a> </p> </aside>  <p>And we can expect far more extreme weather. Over my decades of work on climate change, what has been a surprise is that these impacts are coming faster than we once thought, as the rate and extent of changes \u2013 such as climbing temperatures, increased heat waves and floods, and rising seas \u2013 outstrip projections. The massive ice sheets covering Greenland and west Antarctica are disintegrating far more quickly than scientists calculated even in the last <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/apr/13/averting-climate-change-catastrophe-is-affordable-says-ipcc-report-un\" title=\"\">IPCC report in 2014</a>. Earlier this year, on a trip to Antarctica, I saw enormous icebergs calving off the continent \u2013 a stark reminder of the immense changes under way on the planet we all call home.</p> <p>As a result, seas are now expected to rise by feet rather than inches this century, and other changes are accelerating. The first three months of 2016 have already shattered historical temperature records, with soaring heat in the Arctic speeding the rate of sea ice loss. With no ice to protect their coastal villages from storm-tossed waves, Native American communities in Alaska are also becoming climate refugees, with a price tag to move just <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/gallery/2015/jul/14/life-in-arctic-village-shishmaref-in-pictures\" title=\"\">one Inuit village, Shishmaref, estimated at $180m</a>.</p> <p>Like many other subsistence cultures living near the water, the people of Isle de Jean Charles or Shishmaref did little to contribute to climate change. Neither have many other coastal communities around the world that will suffer similar fates. It may be that the Louisiana climate refugees will be among the luckier ones\u2014in the sense that they are getting help to move away from their sinking island. Countless others will have to leave their homes with an uncertain future and no place to welcome them.</p> <p>I witnessed the heartbreak of losing home and community at first hand. After Katrina flooded 80% of New Orleans, my relatives, a friend and their five cats relocated to Arlington, Virginia and lived with me for several months. I saw the pain of being away from a home that you did not choose to leave. My sister said that losing her cherished New Orleans life and being thrown into mine in the Washington, DC area was like being in the witness protection programme. When it was unclear if the city would survive, she worried if the culture, food, music, neighbourhoods and people that made New Orleans unique and irreplaceable would be lost forever.</p> <p>My family was able to return to New Orleans, working to make it stronger. The Isle de Jean Charles tribe doesn\u2019t have that option. But thanks to support from the National Disaster Resilience Competition and the state, it does have a chance to rebuild elsewhere, though maintaining their cultural bonds in a new environment could be a challenge.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>It\u2019s not that we are leaving home, but that home is leaving us</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p>It\u2019s unlikely that millions of others will be given the same opportunity. From Bangladesh to Boston, from London to Vietnam, low-lying areas near coasts are endangered. Meanwhile, prolonged droughts will continue to fuel migration and conflicts in the Middle East, central and eastern Africa and other regions.</p> <p>Is there hope in his bleak picture? The <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/12/paris-climate-deal-key-points\" title=\"\">Paris Agreement to curb emissions</a> that cause climate change was a huge, historic step. Now, every nation must live up to its pledges in that agreement \u2013 and go beyond them \u2013 if we are to keep the planet\u2019s temperature from rising more than 2C, the level that scientists believe will prevent catastrophic consequences.</p> <p>However, we are already in a warming world and we must prepare for the changes happening today and in the future. We need to use the best available science to identify and reduce our vulnerabilities to rising seas, droughts, floods and other impacts. We need not only to invest more in resilient infrastructure \u2013 roads, railways, bridges, ports and subways; water, wastewater and electricity systems \u2013 but also to change how we invest and rebuild, taking future climate conditions into account instead of building for historic norms.</p> <p>We also need to update our laws and policies to make it easier to get permits for protective measures, including green solutions such as living shorelines, or for retreating from encroaching water. And at a time when one major political party in the US denies the very reality of climate change, we need to find the political will and the economic resources to do this and to help the most vulnerable. We need to support not just those displaced, but also those communities that accept climate refugees.</p> <p>Perhaps most difficult is the need to engage in wrenching but necessary conversations about what it means to leave the only home you\u2019ve known, and the home where your ancestors are buried, to try to create a more stable future. These must be conversations for all of us, not just those in Louisiana or Alaska. The economic, political and psychological toll of the coming droughts, famines, wars, storms and rising seas is difficult to fathom. Yet remarkably, even in this active political season, the need to adapt to climate change has hardly been mentioned.</p> <p>For Louisiana, my home state, the stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. We\u2019ve lost the equivalent of Delaware\u2019s entire landmass over the past century, and the familiar outline of the state is being eaten away. The wetlands that once provided bountiful resources while serving as a buffer against storms and floods are continuing to vanish at an alarming rate. Watching the Louisiana coast sink faster than any other shoreline on the planet while being buffeted by ever-rising seas and storms, one thing is clear. It\u2019s not that we are leaving home, but that home is leaving us.</p> <p><em>Vicki Arroyo is executive director of the </em><a href=\"http://www.georgetownclimate.org/\" title=\"\"><em>Georgetown Climate Center</em></a><em> and Professor from Practice at Georgetown Law.</em></p>",

      "body": "<p>Opinion polls are essential to modern election coverage. However, polls have a problem in that while they provide good fodder for headlines, they\u2019re not so good for looking at day-to-day variation in voter sentiment.</p> <p>Political scientist <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10361140500302472\">Simon Jackman</a> puts it best: \u201cMedia-commissioned polls employ sample sizes that are too small to reliably detect the relatively small day-to-day or week-to-week movements in voter sentiment we would expect to occur over an election campaign. Thus, as they currently stand, media-commissioned polls are essentially of \u2018news value\u2019 rather than social-scientific value.\u201d</p> <p>Sometimes journalists play up polls \u2013 reporting that their latest, expensive poll found no significant difference to the previous poll with any satisfactory scientific standard of statistics is boring reading. On the other hand there are those who scoff at polls as being unreliable with utter imprecision due to sampling error and the possibility of bias, due to the procedures and methods employed by a particular polling organisation.</p> <p>However, there are ways to counter both problems. There are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo\">advanced statistical techniques</a> appropriate for removing those in-house pollster bias uncertainties and polls can be combined with statistical techniques to improve precision and provide day-to-day estimates of voting intention. </p> <p>Here, we present a model of Australian voting intentions over a 20-year period and will continue to track public opinion as the 2 July election nears. The estimate is a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model\">precision weighted-average</a>, which <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10361140500302472\">pools publicly available polls</a>.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-interactive interactive\" data-interactive=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/iframe-wrapper/0.1/boot.js\" data-canonical-url=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2016/apr/polltracker/embed.html?embed=true\" data-alt=\"Poll of polls\"> <a href=\"https://interactive.guim.co.uk/embed/aus/2016/apr/polltracker/embed.html?embed=true\">Poll of polls</a> </figure>  <p>You can read more detail in the methods below but essentially this chart shows an estimate of the two-party preferred value for the Coalition over time. When the value is above 49.1% (see below for how this number is determined), the Coalition is more likely to win if an election is held. When the value is below, Labor are more likely to win.</p> <p>If election 2016 is anything like previous elections, as the campaign draws closer to the election day pollsters will begin to move from sampling 1,400 or 2,000 respondents per survey to 3,000 or 4,000 respondents per survey. This will allow for significantly more confidence in movements in public opinion in the final days before the election.</p> <h2>Methodology</h2> <p>The aggregation model used is known as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden_Markov_model\">Hidden Markov model</a>. In the model public opinion is allowed to transition from an observed point in time,<a href=\"http://www.aec.gov.au/elections/australian_electoral_history/house_of_representative_1949_present.htm\"> ie elections</a>, and then transition through over a modelled time period through <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State-space_representation\">mathematical space</a>. This sort of model can be referred to as a state space model which is from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo\">Markov Chain Monte Carlo</a> class from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_statistics\">Bayesian statistics</a> family. </p> <p>What the model is measuring is cannot be observed directly for most of the period of analysis. This is why it is referred to as a \u201chidden\u201d. The only time that the true national voting intention is revealed is at elections. These rare observations of the true national voting intention can then be used to anchor models. Election results provide prior information to the model that constrains its estimate of the polls.</p> <p>The two-party preferred national voting intention is a hidden latent variable that is modelled everyday in the period of analysis. Election results provide anchors, which allow for polls to predict national voting intentions while simultaneously taking into account of systematic in-house bias and sample size of polls. </p> <p>The model is informed by irregular and noisy data. The model disregards the noise and finds the underlying trend. Like beads on a string, the model is solved by finding the day-to-day path through which to transition. Given we know the election results, voting intention is allowed to transition from the election days where the true voting intention is known and using the known poll results transitions through the most likely path which links each of the days. </p> <p>Each day that voting intentions are modelled is known as a state. Public opinion transitions through mathematical space from the previous day\u2019s state to the next day\u2019s state. As each day\u2019s estimates are dependent upon the previous day, or are known election results, they link together much like beads on a string. This feature means that the model assumes that voting intention on one day is similar to the previous day and the next day will also be similar because of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain\">Markov process</a> which is employed.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/01/political-polls-matter-but-the-overall-trend-is-what-to-look-at\">Political polls matter, but the overall trend is what to look at | Ben Raue</a> </p> </aside>  <p>The model makes a provision for the long-run tendency of each pollster to systematically favour either the Coalition or Labor. This could be because of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_bias\">sampling</a> bias, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Response_bias\">response</a> bias, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_desirability_bias\">social desirability</a> bias or some other methodical bias in survey research. This small tendency to overestimate or underestimate voting intention for the Coalition of Labor is known as the \u201cin-house bias\u201d.</p> <p>Once the model determines the extent to which the average divergence of each pollster from the from real population voting intention, the model then corrects the estimate of voting intention doing away with the problem of in-house bias. </p> <p>This model does not make a provision for discontinuities where public opinion would be assumed to make a rapid change. For instance a leadership change where on a specific day is expected to shift suddenly and markedly rather than remain relatively stable. This can be an appropriate over a shorter period of analysis when a single significant leadership challenge or political event occurs (for <a href=\"http://marktheballot.blogspot.com.au/p/the.html?m=1\">example</a>). But many discontinuities complicate modelling over a particularly long time series and a discontinuity in the chain may be considered by some as arbitrary selected. As there is no discontinuities, a caveat when reading the estimate would be to acknowledge that, for example, when Malcolm Turnbull replaced Tony Abbott, voting intentions most likely shifted over one day but the estimate may show voting intentions transitioning over three or four days as the model presumes each day is similar to the previous one. Nevertheless the model performs quite well with steep transitions these sudden political events.</p> <p>As of 19 April 2016, the analysis was based on 2017 polls in the period from the 2 March 1996 federal election and includes the seven election results in the period.</p> <p>The algorithm used for the analysis, known as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter\">Kalman filter</a>, was applied by Jackman, the chief executive of the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney. The method was established in an article published in the <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10361140500302472\">Australian Journal of Political Science</a>.

      "wordcount": "1055",
      "body": "<p><strong>1: It\u2019s starting out close.</strong> The trends in the two-party preferred vote (Labor now level pegging or slightly ahead), satisfaction rating (Malcolm Turnbull plummeting but still ahead, Bill Shorten rising) and preferred prime minister (Turnbull still ahead but his lead has been halved) are all favouring the ALP. But Labor\u2019s primary vote is still at <a href=\"https://www.reachtel.com.au/blog/7-news-national-poll-5may2016\">35</a> or 36% according to the most recent Reachtel and Galaxy polls. Labor has never won with a primary vote that low. Even in 2010, when Julia Gillard negotiated her way into government in a hung parliament, the primary vote was 37.9%. <a href=\"http://www.essentialvision.com.au/most-likely-to-win-election\">A strong majority of voters expect the Coalition to win.</a> Taking into account the redistribution, Labor needs a uniform swing of four percentage points and a gain of 19 seats to take government. That would be an historic turnaround after a single term in opposition.</p> <p><strong>2: The swing will not be uniform.</strong> Nationwide polls hide big variations on the ground. Last year in the UK, a highly-targeted marginal seat campaign, run by the Australian Liberal party strategists Crosby Textor, helped take David Cameron to a decisive win. Liberals are confident, based on their tracking of marginal seats. But Labor says it is doing well in outer suburban and regional seats with lower household incomes. Labor\u2019s marginals campaign will bolstered by an ACTU grassroots campaign and marginal seats campaigning by groups like GetUp. Labor is targeting a raft of seats in the traditional battleground states of Queensland and New South Wales (Petrie, Capricornia, Brisbane, Flynn, Bonner, Forde and Dawson in Queensland and Banks, Reid, Eden Monaro, Page, Lindsay, Robertson, Dobell and Banks in New South Wales) but is also increasingly hopeful of gaining a seat or two in Western Australia, where its vote hit an historic low in 2013, possibly Cowan and the new seat of Burt, in Victoria (seats like La Trobe, Dunkley and Corangamite) and is still targeting a seat or two in South Australia, despite the government\u2019s attempts to shore up support in that state by bringing forward announcements about the contract to build submarines.</p>  <aside class=\"element element-pullquote element--supporting\"> <blockquote> <p>The loser may not get a second chance</p> </blockquote> </aside>  <p><strong>3: A lot could change during the campaign.</strong> Neither Turnbull nor Shorten has faced the voters as leader before. The unusually long eight-week campaign will magnify any stumbles. And both parties are yet to announce, or face intensive scrutiny, on important policies, some of which have not yet been made public and some which are still being unpicked from last week\u2019s budget and budget speech in reply.</p> <p><strong>4: The major parties will present clear policy choices, </strong>and <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/mar/18/a-shift-in-political-thinking-is-giving-labor-a-sense-of-purpose\">the opposition has been prepared to take some policy risks to get itself back into contention for the first time really since the Fightback! Election of 1993.</a> On the economy, Turnbull says his $48bn in company tax cuts will improve growth and generate jobs. Shorten says his policies on education will do the same, and that rising inequality is bad for society and the economy as well. Turnbull has more modest greenhouse gas targets and a policy few believe can achieve them. Labor has pledged tougher targets and new emissions trading schemes. The parties have constructed clear differences on the negative side as well. Labor is opposing the Coalition\u2019s company tax cuts and the retrospective parts of its superannuation concessions for the very wealthy. The Coalition says Labor\u2019s policy on negative gearing and capital gains tax will \u201csmash\u201d house prices.</p>       <figure class=\"element element-video\" data-canonical-url=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/may/08/malcolm-turnbull-calls-double-dissolution-election-for-2-july-video\"            data-short-url=\"http://gu.com/p/4jx4y\"                    data-show-ads=\"true\"            data-video-id=\"2500599\"            data-video-name=\"Malcolm Turnbull calls double-dissolution election for 2 July \u2013 video\"            data-video-provider=\"ABC News 24\"            > <video data-media-id=\"gu-video-572ec929e4b07f53f216acf8\" class=\"gu-video\" controls=\"controls\" poster=\"\"> <source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/mainwebsite/2016/05/08/160508malcolm_desk.mp4\"/><source src=\"https://multimedia.guardianapis.com/interactivevideos/video.php?octopusid=11477912&amp;format=video/webm\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/small/2016/05/08/160508malcolm_small.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/3gp/large/2016/05/08/160508malcolm_large.3gp\"/><source src=\"https://cdn.theguardian.tv/HLS/2016/05/08/160508malcolm.m3u8\"/> </video> <figcaption><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/video/2016/may/08/malcolm-turnbull-calls-double-dissolution-election-for-2-july-video\">Malcolm Turnbull calls double-dissolution election for 2 July</a></figcaption> </figure>   <p><strong>5: It could get nasty.</strong> The negative campaigning is likely to get very personal \u2013 in fact it already has. Labor is backing its \u201cputting people first\u201d slogan with an attack on Turnbull for being \u201cout of touch\u201d (i.e. wealthy) and for prioritising the interests of millionaires over battlers. The Coalition is attacking Shorten for being a weak and vacillating leader, beholden to the union movement and Labor\u2019s factional system. It has <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFNiLcl-5Ss\">already started running social media attack ads</a>. </p> <p><strong>6: We could get a hung parliament again.</strong><strong> Twice. </strong>It is impossible to predict at this stage, but the tight polls and strong re-election campaigns by several lower house crossbenchers, including the Greens Adam Bandt, Cathy McGowan in Indi, Andrew Wilkie in Denison and Bob Katter in Kennedy and a bid to return to the parliament by Tony Windsor in New England and the outside chance of another lower house seat for the Greens or even one for the Nick Xenophon team, means a hung lower house is within the realms of possibility. And despite all the furore over the Senate voting changes, the tightening of the polls means the Senate after 2 July may be no easier for a re-elected Turnbull government, which could be forced to govern with the support of three or four Nick Xenophon Team senators as well as some other independents like Jacqui Lambie in Tasmania or Glenn Lazarus in Queensland.</p> <p><strong>7: The Abbott legacy lives on. </strong>The former prime minister <a href=\"http://www.theaustralian.com.au/federal-election-2016/federal-election-tony-abbott-to-do-whatever-it-takes-for-lib-poll-win/news-story/9e053ee6a31f22577f6c8559103757a7#itm=taus%7Cnews%7Caus_authors_index%7C1%7Cauthors_storyBlock_headline%7CDennis_Shanahan%7Cindex%7Cauthor&amp;itmt=1462671466553\">has solemnly promised to do everything he can to help the Coalition\u2019s re-election</a>, but several of his least popular policies live on because the Turnbull government cannot afford to remove them from the budget bottom line but cannot get them through the Senate does not seem to want to advocate them in their current state. The Coalition is, for example, going to the polls with an \u201coptions paper\u201d instead of a higher education policy, retaining most of the Abbott era cuts but saying it has moved on from full deregulation. Cuts to family tax benefits and an extra one week waiting period for unemployment benefits are among the so-called zombie policies, delivering over $10bn to the budget bottom line despite not being legislated and the government not really wanting to talk about them. And his former chief of staff Peta Credlin has started as an election campaign commentator.</p> <p><strong>8: It could be do or die. </strong>The loser may not get a second chance. Having been re-installed as leader by a reluctant Liberal party on the basis of his popularity and its dismal polling performance, for Turnbull victory is vindication and loss means his leadership would quickly come under question. Shorten automatically faces another ballot of caucus and Labor members after the election, whatever the result. If he loses, but comes close to winning, he would have a strong case for re-election, but if not, the field would be open. </p>",

It cannot be \u201cabolished\u201d in any other way. </p> <p>Although Clinton has never made any statement in support of abolishing the second amendment or confiscating the personal firearms of citizens, she has stated that Heller v District of Columbia, a case where the supreme court overturned Washington DC\u2019s ban on handguns by a 5-4 vote, was wrongly decided. In that case, the court held that the second amendment provided for an individual right to bear arms and the late Justice Antonin Scalia proclaimed \u201chandguns are the most popular weapon chosen by Americans for self-defense in the home, and a complete prohibition of their use is invalid.\u201d Scalia though went on to endorse a laundry list of gun regulation including bans on automatic weapons and sawed-off shotguns as implicitly constitutional.</p> <p>Although Justice John Paul Stevens, a retired member of the supreme court who dissented in Heller, has called for a constitutional amendment to add the phrase \u201cwhen serving in the Militia\u201d to the constitution after \u201cthe right of the people to keep and bear arms\u201d, Clinton has not endorsed such an effort.</p> <p>The court\u2019s decision in Heller, which was uniquely narrow as it only provided for an individual right to bear arms to possession of handguns in the home for self-defense, could still be overturned in a future court case. That, however, would not be outright abolition of the second amendment. Instead, it would simply be a different interpretation of its centuries-old language. </p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/may/07/gun-control-march-new-york-julianne-moore\">'Did a bunch of little kids get shot today?' Stars join march for 'gun sense'</a> </p> </aside>  <p>On gun control, Clinton though has supported expanding background checks for gun purchases as well as restoring the assault weapons ban of 1994. This ban did not affect legally owned guns already in circulation, which could continue to be resold. It only forbade the manufacture of new assault weapons for civilian use. </p> <p> In contrast, although Trump has supported an assault weapons ban in the past, the presumptive GOP nominee is currently opposed to any limitations on gun ownership based on the variety of weaponry. In a campaign position paper, Trump said: \u201cLaw-abiding people should be allowed to own the firearm of their choice. The government has no business dictating what types of firearms good, honest people are allowed to own.\u201d</p> <p>The Clinton campaign did not respond to a request for comment while a Trump spokesperson dismissed a request for clarification as \u201csemantics\u201d.</p>",

      "body": "<h2><strong>How many seats do the parties start with?</strong></h2> <p>At the 2013 federal election, the Liberal/National Coalition won 90 seats, Labor won 55 seats, and independents and minor parties won five seats. These five crossbench MPs are Adam Bandt, Bob Katter, Cathy McGowan, Clive Palmer and Andrew Wilkie.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/07/malcolm-turnbull-expected-to-start-longest-election-campaign-since-1960s\">Malcolm Turnbull expected to start longest election campaign since 1960s</a> </p> </aside>  <p>There have been redistributions in New South Wales, Western Australia and the ACT since 2013. A Labor seat was abolished in New South Wales and a Liberal seat was created in Western Australia, while three other Liberal seats in New South Wales have become notionally Labor. This has the net effect of giving Labor two extra seats at the expense of the Liberal Party.</p> <p>In Queensland, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/04/clive-palmer-will-not-stand-again-for-lower-house-but-senate-remains-option\">Clive Palmer has announced he won\u2019t contest his seat of Fairfax</a>. The Liberal National party won 61.7% of the two-party- preferred vote against Labor in Fairfax, so in the absence of Palmer this seat should be treated as a Coalition seat.</p> <p>So with these adjustments, we can make an assumption that <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/07/malcolm-turnbull-expected-to-start-longest-election-campaign-since-1960s\">the parties enter the election with the following number of seats</a>:</p> <p>\u2022 89 \u2013 Coalition</p> <p>\u2022 57 \u2013 Labor</p> <p>\u2022 1 \u2013 Greens</p> <p>\u2022 1 \u2013 Katter\u2019s Australian Party</p> <p>\u2022 2 \u2013 Independent</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/06/truth-the-first-casualty-as-coalition-and-labor-give-in-to-tug-of-class-war\">Truth the first casualty as Coalition and Labor give in to tug of class war | Lenore Taylor</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>How many seats need to change hands for the government to lose power?</strong></h2> <p>Seventy-six seats are needed for a majority in the House of Representatives.</p> <p>If the Coalition loses fourteen seats, they will lose their majority. If Labor gains nineteen seats, they will gain their own majority.</p> <p>If the number of seats changing hands falls somewhere in the middle, we will have a hung parliament, and government will be decided by the crossbench MPs.</p> <h2><strong>What swing is needed for this to happen?</strong></h2> <p>You\u2019ll hear a lot about the \u201cuniform swing\u201d. This refers to what would happen if the swing were the same in every seat across the country.</p> <p>You can understand what a uniform swing would look like by reading the electoral pendulum, which orders electorates by margin of victory.</p> <p>A uniform swing of 3.4% would see the Coalition lose its majority. A uniform swing of 4% would see Labor win a majority.</p> <h2><strong>Is it really that simple?</strong></h2> <p>No, it\u2019s not. While seats often have similar swings, they don\u2019t all have the same swing \u2013 we may see seats change hands in different directions, or seats on much larger margins fall while seats on smaller margins stay still.</p> <p>Theoretically, variations in swings should cancel each other out. A uniform swing of 4% should see Labor gain roughly nineteen seats off the Coalition, but they may not be the same seats as the pendulum suggests.</p> <p>Unfortunately this theory doesn\u2019t always work. The Coalition could see smaller swings in many of its marginal seats, due to the presence of first-term MPs who benefit from a new personal vote. This effect is called the \u201csophomore surge\u201d, and it could mean Labor needs to gain a slightly larger swing to win a majority.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/06/one-year-richard-di-natale-first-verdict-greens-new-pragmatism\">One year in, Richard Di Natale faces first verdict on Greens' new pragmatism</a> </p> </aside>  <h2><strong>What about the crossbench?</strong></h2> <p><a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/may/06/one-year-richard-di-natale-first-verdict-greens-new-pragmatism\">The Greens are targeting a number of seats</a>, mostly held by Labor and mostly in inner city Melbourne and Sydney.</p> <p>The Nick Xenophon Team is targeting a number of seats in South Australia, all held by the Liberal Party.</p> <p>In addition to sitting independents Cathy McGowan and Andrew Wilkie, Tony Windsor is running a high profile campaign against the Nationals in New England.</p> <p>For every seat a major party loses to a minor party or independent, they are one seat further away from a majority. If the size of the crossbench grows, the chance of a hung parliament increases, since it is harder for either major party to win a majority.</p>",
